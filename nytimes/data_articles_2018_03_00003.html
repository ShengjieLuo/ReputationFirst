Substantial empirical evidence shows that America\u2019s favored retirement vehicle \u2014 the 401(k), recently renounced by its own inventors \u2014 is grossly inadequate and will leave tens of millions of Americans with insufficient retirement assets. And yet states and cities are busy converting traditional pensions into these failing 401(k)s or equivalents, to the great benefit of money managers and the finance class.\n\nAdvocates of pension \u201creform\u201d \u2014 which really means cutting or eliminating traditional pension funds \u2014 will tell you that such funds are a big drain on state and local budgets, since, as defined-benefit programs, they are obligated to pay workers a defined amount in their retirement. But that\u2019s largely a question of political priorities; underfunded pensions are the result of, well, decades of underfunding pensions. The real reason for the attack on pensions goes deeper, and exposes the great and growing rift between America\u2019s economic elite and everyone else.\n\nConsider how we 401(k) holders behave as investors. How many of us thought to sue Wells Fargo after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau revealed that the bank had created millions of fake credit card and bank accounts? Or to push our fund managers to do so for us? How many of us call up our fund managers after a quarter, a year or a decade in which we underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to renegotiate our fees? Or even to switch managers? How many of us even know how our funds performed relative to the S.&P. 500?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is a number very close to zero. We 401(k) holders are the world\u2019s ideal source of capital. We let ourselves be charged high fees that we do not understand, we accept poor returns quarter after quarter, we never sue to enforce our rights, we never vote as shareholders and we never tell our investment managers how we think they ought to vote.

That includes some of the nation\u2019s biggest industries: the automobile sector; aerospace; heavy equipment; and construction. In short, the chassis of a Ford, the body of a Caterpillar bulldozer, the wings of a Boeing aircraft, and the steel girders inside a New York skyscraper are all about to get more expensive.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s announcement, Wall Street quickly reflected this divide: Shares of U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum were each up about 7 percent shortly afterward, while shares of Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing were each down about 3 percent.\n\nThe industries that use steel and aluminum are considerably larger as a share of the United States economy than are steel and aluminum producers. By one estimate, from Lydia Cox of Harvard and Kadee Russ of the University of California, Davis, steel-using industries employ 80 times as many people as steel-producing industries.\n\nBut what does this mean for consumers?\n\nThe simple answer is that goods containing metals will become more expensive. But there\u2019s not much reason to expect enormous price increases for most goods.\n\nFirst, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel, and the tariff would not apply to domestic production (aluminum is more heavily dependent on imports, with only 10 percent made domestically).\n\nSo prices will go up by only a fraction of the tariff amount. But consumers don\u2019t generally buy raw steel and aluminum. People buy consumer goods in which those raw materials are but one input. A car includes not just steel and aluminum but also plastics and textiles and glass, not to mention the computer circuitry that controls it all, the design know-how and assemblage work, along with a profit margin for both the automaker and the dealer.\n\nFor any given product, it is hard to predict whether producers will eat the cost of more expensive metals, pass the cost on in the form of higher prices, or both. Put differently: If your favorite beer producers are looking at paying an extra fraction of a cent for each aluminum can, they might just take on the cost themselves, they might raise prices, or they might split the difference. It is hard to know in advance how much of each will take place.", "title": "The Real Risks of Trump\u2019s Steel and Aluminum Tariffs", "authors": []}

As a pesky 9-year-old, I once asked her why he\u2019d gone to jail, but she pretended not to hear. Her silence was understandable: That time was a tender nexus of old hurt; after his prison sentence, the Communist regime forced her to file for divorce, threatening to blacklist her children if she refused.\n\nThe little information I could gather about my great-grandfather came from my grandmother, who predictably whitewashed the particulars of his imprisonment. When I was a boy, she told me he\u2019d been sent to the camp simply because a \u201csnitch\u201d had overheard him disparaging \u201cCommunism\u201d in the restaurant he owned.\n\nThis set him up in my mind as a heroic insurgent. But when I turned 14, the story was drastically revised. He was imprisoned not for righteous opposition but for his allegiance to the Iron Guard. \u201cHe gave them money before the war,\u201d my grandmother told me then. \u201cThat was the extent of it.\u201d When I pressed for more details \u2014 including the depth of his anti-Semitism \u2014 she couldn\u2019t say: \u201cI was a child. What did I know?\u201d This is a familial refrain: No one knows, no one remembers.\n\nBut the crimes of the Iron Guard are well documented. Their place in Holocaust history is cemented by the Legionnaires\u2019 revolt in January 1941. Caught in a power struggle with the government, the group organized a militarized uprising in an effort to reclaim control, including a pogrom. Over three days of terror in Bucharest, the Iron Guard looted Jewish shops, set fire to synagogues and randomly seized Jews and dragged them to the snow-draped Jilava forest, where they were shot.\n\nThe most sadistic episode occurred in a slaughterhouse. Some 60 Jews were taken to the abattoir and, according to the American ambassador Franklin Mott Gunther \u2014 who toured the slaughterhouse shortly after the revolt was suppressed \u2014 hanged from meat hooks and skinned alive. The bodies were labeled \u201ckosher meat.\u201d One of the victims was a 5-year-old girl.\n\nRomania\u2019s involvement in the Holocaust extends far beyond this episode (the Iasi pogrom of 1941 claimed at least 13,000 lives, and under Marshal Ion Antonescu\u2019s watch countless Jewish families were sent to die in the labor camps of Transnistria). But the events in Bucharest stand out in the nation\u2019s long litany of Holocaust offenses.\n\nI cannot say where my ancestor fits into all of this. My great-grandfather\u2019s liability remains forever nebulous. Even if his input was strictly monetary, those nights of bloodletting embody the bitter fruits of his contribution. Such ghoulish affairs should never slip into forgetfulness, but in our family they do.

These included \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d (which won the accommodating Schumer an Emmy for best variety sketch show); \u201cTransparent\u201d (which won its creator, Jill Soloway, an Emmy for directing); and the Golden Globe comedy nominees \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d (created by Jenji Kohan), \u201cGirls\u201d (the signature work of Lena Dunham) and \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d (developed by Jennie Snyder Urman).

Dunham, for one, stumped indefatigably on Clinton\u2019s behalf. Rhimes and her producing partner, Betsy Beers, made the video that introduced Clinton at the 2016 Democratic convention. Diane English, who dreamed up the conversation-setting feminist sitcom \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d in the Reaganite 1980s, backed a pro-Clinton super PAC.\n\nWe know the Big Reveal. By the time the author, a former TV critic for The Village Voice, finished her book, Donald Trump had become the first fake-reality-TV character to occupy the Oval Office. \u201cWhat looked like the forward march of progress turned out to be one of history\u2019s grand zigzags,\u201d Press says in her realistically dismayed introduction. And so began the rising up of a new, very real, very raw female impatience with the same-old, same-old ways of gender inequality in politics; and in the workplace; and in the arts, media, industrial life, military life, factory life, corporate life and even in cartoon-superhero life, what with lady heroes condemned to run around in constricting bustiers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rising up continues. Nothing on the air seems quite so funny or delightful anymore, and the scripted shows meant to shock, provoke and amuse, whether about trans sexuality within the family (\u201cTransparent\u201d), murder as oh-hello (\u201cScandal\u201d) or weird sex stuff that women are jolly about (\u201cBroad City,\u201d made by Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer), don\u2019t cause nearly as much shock as the testimony of real women talking about what they experience during working hours.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe litany of imbalances sounds repetitious only because gender inequality repeats itself daily, while the latest headline-making abuses are discussed as if fantastic plot twists in an outrageous soap. And so, between the long-ago year of 2015 and now, the agitation continues, hashtags flying, with ramifications for pop culture and the business behind it that go considerably beyond the scope of Press\u2019s investigation.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn other words, \u201cStealing the Show\u201d at times feels a little bereft of urgency.\n\nThen again. Here is a collection of women who have managed to make television on their own terms, embodying proof that it can be done.

He relies on what the political scientist John Hart called the \u201cpresidential branch\u201d \u2014 which consists of almost 2,000 staff members, several hundred under the White House proper and the rest in a variety of management organizations (National Security Council, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Management and Budget) within the Executive Office of the President.\n\nThe advisers in the Executive Office and White House offer the president unbiased information and advice that serve his agenda. At least in theory. In practice, they pose a particular danger to a weak president. The political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has detailed how executive governance suffers in the absence of presidential leadership and can empower rogue policy entrepreneurship. As examples, he points to the policy debacles of Iraq under George W. Bush and the Iran-contra scandal under Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Executive Office advisers not only have discretion over the information the president receives but also have opportunities to derail presidential proposals before they can even see the light of day.\n\nEffectively managing the White House has been a challenge for all modern presidents. One prerequisite is an ability to articulate a policy vision and persuade senior advisers to develop and carry it out. Mr. Trump\u2019s visible lack of control over the White House is in part rooted in his lack of firm policy beliefs \u2014 about immigration, gun control or foreign policy. Chaos is rampant in the Trump White House largely because the president is weak and easily manipulated by those who have access.\n\nA mismanaged White House, a poor professional reputation and a weak presidency are not impossible to fix. Like Mr. Trump, other first-year presidents have had trouble adapting to the power dynamics of the White House and the Washington community. While some never recovered from disastrous starts (Jimmy Carter), others found their footing and became widely influential over the executive agencies (Bill Clinton).\n\nUnfortunately, the current state of the White House already reflects the most obvious fix Mr. Trump could make: bringing in a more empowered and competent chief of staff. By most accounts, John Kelly had succeeded in improving the information flow, removing some of the key factional actors and reducing the leaks. A more experienced White House hand could probably do better, but at this point it isn\u2019t clear Mr. Trump could attract that sort of A-list talent.\n\nIf the president is unwilling or incapable of getting control of the White House, he will continue to find his reputation lacking and his ability to influence the executive branch minimal. That may be enough for Mr. Trump, who often seems driven by anything but the desire to influence policy.\n\nBut a weak president is not something to cheer. Set aside the dangers of a weak leader engaging in risky foreign policy to try to improve his public standing.

You can raise islands or destroy them.\n\nSome of the technical leaps that allow investigation of the oceans are high tech, like the submersibles, spheres with large acrylic windows in which you can dive thousands of feet deep. Advances in sonar and lasers allow scientists to better map the ocean floor, the details of which are largely unknown and unexplored.\n\nParts of the ocean are so remote it is hard to imagine them. The Pacific\u2019s Mariana Trench, the deepest part of any ocean, is in the hadal zone (for Hades, the underworld). The deepest part of the trench, seven miles down, is called the Challenger Deep. Only three humans have visited it, fewer than have been to the Moon.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ocean that is glimpsed in this show is largely still to be explored, but, as the exhibit notes at the end, it is threatened in many ways by climate change and other environmental insults. The ocean is becoming more acidic, which threatens some plankton. Warmer seas and acidity are implicated in killing the algae that live with corals, creating bleached, dead reefs. Overfishing threatens many species. All the more reason to learn as much as possible about the oceans now.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough I am usually partial to biological wonders, my favorite part of this exhibit was the technology under development, such as the soft fingerlike grippers that researchers are developing so scientists in a submersible or remotely operating one can take hold of objects and living things without damaging them. This particular project is a joint effort of Harvard and the City University of New York. The group that does this work is called the Squishy Finger/Soft Robotics for Delicate Deep-sea Marine Biological Interactions team. The title itself is an unseen wonder.\n\nMy favorite story of technological innovation in the exhibition involves attaching tags to sea creatures to track their movements. Attaching such tags always presents challenges, like how to get them to stick and not interfere with water flow as a whale swims.\n\nBut what about tagging a jellyfish? Researchers tried quite a few different ways to stick a tag on amorphous, fragile jelly. The solution was an inexpensive glue that veterinarians use to help small cuts on animals heal. According to the show, the battery for such a tag is \u201cnow the size of a piece of Trident gum.\u201d\n\nOf course, I have to say that I really liked sitting in the model submersible and playing the submersible video game too. It\u2019s a good thing my children are older now. It would be bad enough to have my kids be the ones to tell me to put my shoes on.

The diet seemed to act like a time machine, and Dr. McCay\u2019s hungry rats maintained their dapper, glossy coats of fur and frisked about their cages; their well-fed counterparts doddered about in shabby coats and then died. \u201cIn the laboratory today are two male white rats that are the equivalent in age to men more than 130 years old,\u201d Dr. McCay announced, promoting the benefits of calorie restriction.\n\nA gentleman farmer, Dr. McCay applied his theories to himself, nibbling on morsels from his own fields. But he didn\u2019t make it close to 130. Though trim and athletic, he had two strokes and died at 69.\n\nOver the decades that followed, research teams would repeat his experiments and confirm that calorie restriction almost always prolonged the lives of lab animals. One of the most prominent of those scientists, Roy Walford, showed that a strict diet could double the life span of mice. Dr. Walford himself stuck to a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet.

The government must do whatever it takes to ensure the physical and psychological integrity of women who report sexual assault.\n\nA first step would be to reduce the impunity. But the state must also help to orient and protect those who report these crimes by offering them temporary economic assistance, some form of job security, and support for ensuring custody of their children.

For every cleaned street in the old city there are 10 just outside it with lampposts snapped in two, and fallen trees barely pushed off the sidewalks. It says much about the intense beauty of this island that the devastation barely detracts from vistas and skies that seem designed to produce audible gasps at every turn.\n\nIn the colorful hipster arts district of Santurce, where one can find street art on every wall, in every direction, I saw a bus stop that was completely caved in and an open-air flea market that, a vendor told me, had brick walls until last September.

No one was driving. It was like, \u2018Come on, just let us have a beer!\u2019\u201d\n\nOn a Sunday, I went with Adnelly Marichal, a Nuyorican documentary filmmaker, to an organic farmers market in Placita Roosevelt in the Hato Rey neighborhood of San Juan. All of the vendors we met, from cocoa purveys to herbalists, came from the interior of the island and not one of them had luz. One farmer, Rafael de Leon, told us it had taken him five months to recover enough to get back to the market, but he\u2019d also had to stop making cheeses and anything that couldn\u2019t be served immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t have refrigeration,\u201d he said in Spanish, \u201cso we have to do everything the day of because there\u2019s no way to keep it.\u201d\n\nSomehow, we wound up with an invitation to La Fiesta de la Amistad (Party of Friendship) on La Finca de Carlos Cuevas, a large farm about an hour outside the city in the region of Cidra.

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "The district court ruled that American Express\u2019s \u201canti-steering\u201d provisions stifled price competition and violated the antitrust laws (Mastercard and Visa settled with the government before trial). But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.\n\nThe case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.\n\nThe fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.\n\nThis danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a \u201ctwo-sided\u201d market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.\n\nIndeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d thereby securing less stringent review.", "title": "Opinion | The Supreme Court Case That Could Give Tech Giants More Power", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Confusion abounded in the American and South Vietnamese command structures; Tet had struck like a thunderbolt, and it took time to sort out what was going on across the Vietnamese countryside. At first reinforcements trickled into Hue, but, as the situation became clearer, ARVN units were called to the command post in the north, while American Marines linked up with the MACV outpost in the south. With the imminent threat of losing the entire city having passed, thoughts now turned to routing the North Vietnamese. Dug into the walls and towers of the Hue Citadel and transforming the buildings of the city into a complex defensive network, the N.V.A. made ready to fight to the last man.\n\nIt took nearly a month of intense fighting in an urban hellscape to retake Hue \u2014 a victory symbolized by the recapture of the Imperial Palace by Tran Ngoc Hue and the Hac Bao on Feb. 24, 1968. Tran and his men had been among the very few engaged in the struggle from its opening moments to its bloody conclusion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nChronicled in books and movies, the battle for Hue has rightly gone down in the lore of the United States Marines, who single-handedly liberated the southern part of the city and fought an epic battle in the northern Citadel, with 147 of them killed in action.\n\nThe South Vietnamese role in the fighting, though, is all too often missing from the story. In actuality, ARVN did the bulk of the fighting in Hue, losing 357 in battle and killing 2,642 N.V.A. and Vietcong fighters. It was their city, their capital, their battle. The struggle for Hue during Tet 1968 was arguably ARVN\u2019s greatest victory of the war \u2014 a victory too often denied its proper place in history.\n\nThe fighting in Hue, and the wider Tet offensive, is best understood in a Vietnamese context. The attacks were not, strictly speaking, aimed at American forces; they were aimed militarily at ARVN, and psychologically at the South Vietnamese national will. The American military fought gallantly as part of Tet, from Saigon in the south to Khe Sanh in the north. But, as in Hue, the bulk of the Tet fighting fell to ARVN, with South Vietnamese forces suffering two-thirds of the estimated 12,000 allied casualties in the overall campaign.\n\nWithin this broader context, Tet was even more of a spectacular failure for the North Vietnamese on all levels. The Communists had long contended that ARVN was a puppet force that would collapse when faced with real military pressure. But ARVN fought hard and well during Tet, besting the Communists at every turn. Making matters much worse for Hanoi, the South Vietnamese had not risen up in support of the North even though the vicious fighting left 600,000 of them refugees. With their Tet plan in tatters, the Communists were left to rethink their war effort, and their vision of what South Vietnam really was.\n\nWithin the broader context of the Vietnam War, more than anything else Tet indicated South Vietnam\u2019s resilience and military competency after nearly 14 years of conflict. While ARVN usually receives little notice in the West, and is usually dismissed as doomed to failure, the Tet experience hints at something deeper and different \u2014 a difference reflected in some perhaps startling numbers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Army of the Republic of Vietnam was huge, numbering over a million men toward the end of the conflict in a nation of just 18 million souls. During the war ARVN had over 200,000 dead, and perhaps four times that many wounded. About one of every five soldiers, or almost one of every 20 adult males in the country, was killed or wounded in service with ARVN. Such percentages would have resulted in the Americans having a military of over 11 million men and suffering two million dead in Vietnam.\n\nNumbers and comparisons in such cases are always tricky and laden with complex meaning. But suffice to say that these very basic statistics indicate that, while not always fighting well, ARVN fought long and hard in the service of its country. And the number of men who served indicates that, while the South Vietnamese often chafed under the ham-handed rule of their government, there was a deep reservoir of military support for a non-Communist nationalism.\n\nFor South Vietnamese soldiers like Tran Ngoc Hue, the Tet offensive was neither beginning nor end. Tran had entered the Vietnamese National Military Academy in 1961, graduating and taking his first combatant command in 1963. Unlike most American servicemen, whose tours of duty in Vietnam lasted a calendar year, Tran Ngoc Hue endured a brutally long war. He led his men into battle year after year until he was severely wounded and captured by Communist forces during the invasion of Laos in 1970. Tran spent the next 13 years first in North Vietnamese prisoner of war camps and then undergoing re-education. After his release, Tran spent the next eight years living under close surveillance, a type of house arrest. He finally emigrated to the United States in 1991.\n\nLike any military, ARVN suffered from cases of poor leadership and was sometimes bested on the battlefield. But, as perhaps best demonstrated by the fighting in Hue, ARVN also included stalwart leaders like Tran Ngoc Hue and, more often that not, defeated North Vietnamese and Vietcong forces in battle. It was not foreordained to defeat. Instead, ARVN was a complex institution serving a young and imperfect state.

Maram, who asked that her last name not be published because of safety concerns, said she had not thought to bring the cars at first: With 150 people sharing the windowless space, she assumed there would be no time or space for toys. But her children were growing restless.\n\nAhmad and his eight-month-old brother, Omar, were stuck inside for days on end as warplanes passed.\n\nMoreover, Omar\u2019s teething pain made him fussy. His mother noticed his first tooth had broken through his gums while they were sheltering.\n\nAfter more than a week underground, the airstrikes paused and Maram made it a priority to retrieve the toys.\n\nA blast had shattered her home windows and damaged the doors.

He emphasized that \u201cgrowth and stability\u201d were the aim of Mr. Trump\u2019s policy goal of ensuring that trade with the United States is fair and reciprocal.\n\nInvestors\u2019 fears of a trade war seemed to subside some on Monday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index climbed 2.7 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite jumped 3.3 percent.\n\nWhether an agreement that forestalls a protracted economic conflict can be reached remains unclear. The two nations, whose markets are highly integrated, have engaged in discussions for years with little to show as a result. Talks between the United States and China stalled last summer, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue between two countries has produced little progress.\n\nThe Trump administration has largely shunned the highly structured discussions of past administrations, which were used to try to reach agreement on economic and security issues. The White House now views those channels as producing largely hollow promises by the Chinese and has shifted toward engaging directly with senior-level Chinese counterparts.\n\nOn Saturday, just two days after the administration announced tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, called Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, to congratulate him on his new role of vice premier. The two discussed the trade tensions, including reducing tariffs on American cars and opening up China\u2019s financial services sector to American firms.\n\n\u201cThey also discussed the trade deficit between our two countries and committed to continuing the dialogue to find a mutually agreeable way to reduce it,\u201d a Treasury spokeswoman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, characterized the call between Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Liu as confrontational, with Mr. Liu warning Mr. Mnuchin that America\u2019s trade actions against China were straining economic ties between the countries.\n\nChinese leaders contend that their country\u2019s economy is still developing. They openly reject Mr. Trump\u2019s call for reciprocity in trade relations. They have instead offered concessions like raising caps on foreign investors\u2019 stakes in Chinese financial institutions, and proposed eliminating import tariffs in narrow categories like drugs to treat cancer.\n\nBeijing says that opening up some services sectors would improve the efficiency of the Chinese economy as well as make money for foreign companies. Improving health care, particularly for the aging, has also become a national priority.\n\nBut Chinese officials argue that their country is still dangerously reliant on smokestack industries of the past, like steel, aluminum and cheap manufacturing. The average Chinese household lives on a quarter of the income that American and Western European households do, and standards of living remain very low in rural parts of the country, and across central and western China.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He noted that the United States and the European Union had higher tariffs than China on some imports of shirts and dairy products. He argued that China meets its W.T.O. obligations; the W.T.O. has long allowed developing countries to have higher tariffs to protect certain industries from international competition.\n\nMr. Lamy, a longtime critic of protectionism and government intervention, dismissed those arguments. China \u2014 which has the world\u2019s second-largest economy, after the United States, and is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer by far, of everything from steel and cement to laptop computers \u2014 had made too much progress to be lumped in with poor countries, he said.\n\n\u201cPretending it is like India, or like Senegal, or like Botswana is pushing the envelope too far,\u201d Mr. Lamy said. He added that China still had to do more to \u201censure a level playing field between Chinese producers and foreign producers, whether they produce inside China or outside of China.\u201d\n\nOn crucial issues, China and the United States appear to be talking past each other, not even agreeing on what is being debated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTake semiconductors, for example: China is a major customer for microchips, which are used to power computers, smartphones and an ever-widening array of other electronics. Chips from the United States account for just 4 percent of China\u2019s $260 billion in annual chip imports. While Chinese trade officials have been willing to discuss buying more chips from factories in the United States, that could take market share from Japan and South Korea. Washington has resisted that solution.\n\nAmerican officials say the problem is that China\u2019s national, provincial and municipal governments are working with state-owned banks to rush the construction of factories, particularly to make memory chips.\n\nThe new factories often rely on technology that foreign companies have had to transfer as a condition of competing in the Chinese market, according to the United States. Global trade rules ban mandatory technology transfers.\n\nNumerous factories are nearing completion, which will unleash an avalanche of additional output. China contends that it has assisted the sector partly to upgrade its economy and partly because the factories will mainly be supplying its domestic market.\n\nBut since factories in China are the world\u2019s main assemblers of electronics, the country\u2019s drive for self-sufficiency in microchips could pose a threat to chip producers in the rest of the world.\n\nFor now, China seems to be pinning its hopes on heavy lobbying in Washington by Wall Street, traditionally Beijing\u2019s most reliable ally in bilateral disputes. China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund owns stakes in a variety of American financial institutions. Estimates of Chinese outbound investment over the next decade run as high as $2.5 trillion, a rich source of advisory fees in the United States.\n\nMr. Wang said on Sunday that China might go beyond its earlier offer to raise caps on foreign ownership in Chinese financial institutions. \u201cIt is even possible we will remove those caps altogether\u201d in some categories, he said.\n\nBut he also made clear that China would not be intimidated if its offers are not enough to satisfy the Trump administration, which has focused on reviving American manufacturing.\n\n\u201cIf China\u2019s interests are impaired,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will have to take measures.\u201d", "title": "The Trade Issue That Most Divides U.S. and China Isn\u2019t Tariffs", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher", "Alan Rappeport"]}
{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "Humphrey\u2019s support for the war condemned him in history as a supporting player in the tragedy of Vietnam. The war alienated Humphrey from liberals, civil rights activists and young Americans \u2014 the same people who, for decades, had loved Humphrey for his support of racial justice, full employment and the labor movement \u2014 and ultimately cost him the presidency in 1968. Voters thought Humphrey meant continued war, while Richard Nixon promised \u201can honorable end to the war in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nBut given what we now know the history of the Vietnam War after 1968, Hubert Humphrey \u2014 both his life and political career \u2014 deserves re-examination. Humphrey forces us to consider the history that might have been: the possibility of ending the Vietnam War before 1973, an expansion of the Great Society in the 1970s, a different America. Without Vietnam (and his being Johnson\u2019s vice president), Humphrey might have won in 1968. The country \u2014 and the world \u2014 would be drastically different.\n\nHubert Humphrey arrived in the Senate in 1949 as a liberal in an illiberal institution. Southerners held the reins of power in Congress, and they hated Humphrey for his opposition to Jim Crow segregation and \u201cthat speech\u201d at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nWhile he was determined in his quest for social justice, his legislation often stalled in committee. He gravitated toward the one man who could help him: Lyndon Johnson. By 1954, Johnson needed Humphrey too \u2014 Johnson had become Senate majority leader and wanted liberals to fall behind his leadership; Johnson concluded Humphrey was the brightest and most pragmatic of them. It was a devil\u2019s bargain: Johnson helped Humphrey with his relationships with Southerners, and Humphrey vowed to keep the liberals in line.\n\nThe partnership between Johnson and Humphrey was as close as that of two antagonists could be. When Johnson became president in November 1963, Humphrey ensured that the Civil Rights Act overcame the Senate filibuster the following summer. Johnson recognized Humphrey\u2019s talents as a legislator and orator (\u201cThere are so many ways I envy you,\u201d Johnson said in 1951), and chose Humphrey as his vice president in 1964 \u2014 but not before asking Humphrey for his backing (\u201cunswerving loyalty,\u201d as Humphrey recalled) on all his decisions. When Mississippi civil rights activists tried to force the Democratic Party to recognize them over the state\u2019s official, segregationist delegation at the 1964 national convention, it was Humphrey who, on Johnson\u2019s orders, made them back down.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Humphrey had been suspicious of American involvement in Vietnam since the mid-1950s, but became more incredulous of the war\u2019s success after meeting with the veteran intelligence officer Edward Lansdale in 1964, who argued that a political solution to the war was possible. Humphrey sent several memos to Johnson in 1964 implying Johnson should pull back on the conflict, and that he meet with Lansdale. Johnson dismissed each one.\n\nThen, on Feb. 7, 1965, American forces were attacked at Pleiku and nine Americans were killed. Bundy, the national security adviser, sent panicked cables to Johnson demanding the United States retaliate. When Johnson asked Humphrey his thoughts on bombing North Vietnam, Humphrey responded, \u201cMr. President, I don\u2019t think we should.\u201d Johnson ordered the bombing anyway. Then Humphrey wrote his Feb. 17 memo, and his fate was sealed for 1965.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Johnson gave Humphrey one last chance to prove his loyalty, sending him to South Vietnam in February 1966 (almost one year to the date of his memo). On that trip, after meeting with Gen. William Westmoreland, American and Vietnamese soldiers, and South Vietnamese civilians, Humphrey convinced himself of the truth he wanted to believe: Vietnam was winnable; it was a war for democracy; it represented a global mission for peace and prosperity.\n\nHumphrey\u2019s adviser Thomas Hughes recalled that Humphrey returned from Vietnam \u201csaying things that were crazy\u201d about the virtues of the war. In a meeting of the National Security Council in June 1966, Humphrey said, \u201cI have come around reluctantly to accepting the wider bombing program.\u201d\n\nFor two years, Humphrey seemed to genuinely believe that Vietnam was a necessary war, that it represented a fight against global poverty and Communist tyranny. Humphrey convinced Johnson he believed this, that he had changed, and was welcomed back into Johnson\u2019s good graces. (After Humphrey encouraged Johnson\u2019s staff members to send the president his speeches supporting the war, Humphrey was admitted to the president\u2019s luncheons on Vietnam.)\n\nBut as he promoted the war to the American people (his main task after 1966), Humphrey was increasingly taunted by the antiwar movement. When Humphrey emerged as the Democratic candidate in 1968 \u2014 after the assassination of Robert Kennedy and the upheaval at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 \u201cDump the Hump\u201d became a common motto. Signs with slogans such as \u201cKiller of Babies\u201d and \u201cHumphrey\u2019s Johnson\u2019s War Salesman\u201d regularly greeted him on the campaign trail.\n\nThe protests agonized Humphrey. \u201cAll I had ever been as a liberal spokesman seemed lost, all that I had accomplished in significant programs was ignored. I felt robbed of my personal history,\u201d he recalled.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1968, Humphrey had enough of Johnson and his war, and in a speech in Salt Lake City he demanded a halt to the bombing. Humphrey called Johnson to warn him of the speech hours before. Johnson reacted coldly: \u201cI take it you are not asking for my advice. You\u2019re going to give the speech anyway.\u201d Johnson then shunned Humphrey for the remainder of 1968 \u2014 indeed, the question remains whether Johnson favored Richard Nixon over Humphrey in the election, and whether Johnson\u2019s hatred of Humphrey led to his loss.\n\nBut what if Humphrey had not been Johnson\u2019s vice president \u2014 what if Humphrey remained in the Senate? What if Eugene McCarthy received the vice-presidential nomination in 1964 as he wanted? McCarthy would have become Humphrey: forced to defend America\u2019s policy in Vietnam, and painted as a patsy for Johnson\u2019s War. Humphrey would be the skeptic on Vietnam, and eventual vociferous critic \u2014 but also more palatable to the party establishment than McCarthy ever was. Divisions within the party would be united under a Humphrey candidacy in 1968, the wounds Vietnam opened among \u201cNew Democrats\u201d healed by a Cold War liberal.\n\nHumphrey could have won in 1968 under these circumstances. Would Humphrey have faced the same pressure as Nixon to end the war with \u201cpeace through honor?\u201d Most likely, and certainly during his first term. But Humphrey would have immediately searched for a political solution to the war \u2014 for the conflict to end peacefully, and without further military commitment. Needless to say, he also would have continued to expand the Great Society, and not begin its long demolition, as Nixon did.\n\nFor these reasons, Humphrey represents the possibilities for a different history for the United States after 1968, particularly for Democrats looking today to rebuild their party and understand the mistakes of the past. Vietnam turned America\u2019s leading liberal into a personification of liberalism\u2019s failures. This is the tragedy of Hubert Humphrey and his Vietnam War \u2014 one that shapes Americans today.", "title": "The Tragedy of Hubert Humphrey", "authors": ["Michael Brenes"]}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Ross\u2019s decision was based on the disingenuous argument that the Department of Justice needs to know the citizenship status of residents in each census tract so it can better protect the rights of minority voters under the Voting Rights Act. Even putting aside the laughable notion that this administration cares about minority voting rights, this argument is bunkum \u2014 the Justice Department has been enforcing that law without access to such data for decades. The last census that asked people to report their citizenship status was conducted in 1950, 15 years before the Voting Rights Act became law. What\u2019s more, the Justice Department already has access to citizenship data through the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year.\n\nThe timing of this change is highly suspect. It comes too late to be included in a field test of the 2020 census the government is conducting right now with 275,000 households in Providence County, R.I. In his memo, Mr. Ross sought to play down concerns that the citizenship question would reduce response rates by claiming there was no \u201cempirical evidence\u201d to back up that argument. Yet, by seeking to insert the question so late in the process, he has prevented officials from empirically testing how people will react to it.\n\nThe evidence that does exist shows that concerns that the citizenship question would curb participation are legitimate. The Census Bureau reported in a September memo that its surveyors were encountering significant resistance from immigrants about providing personal information because they feared it would not be kept confidential. \u201cThe immigrant is not going to trust the census employee when they are continuously hearing a contradicting message from the media every day threatening to deport immigrants,\u201d one Arabic-speaking respondent told the bureau.\n\nEven Mr. Ross acknowledged in an October House hearing that adding questions to the census reduced response rates because \u201cthe more things you ask in those forms, the less likely you are to get them in.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the Trump administration has sought to compromise the integrity of the census. Last year, the bureau limited its field test to Rhode Island because, it said, it didn\u2019t have the money for tests in Washington State and West Virginia. In his budget request to Congress, the president asked for a modest increase in census funds, far less than what most experts say is needed. (Last week, lawmakers increased the bureau\u2019s budget by $1.34 billion, about twice what he had sought.) The administration has also undermined the bureau by failing to nominate a leader since the agency\u2019s last permanent director left in June. And, until recently, the administration was considering as deputy director a political-science professor who has argued for partisan gerrymandering and against competitive elections.\n\nBy now, many people have come to expect that Mr. Trump will inject politics into every decision. But even by this administration\u2019s low standards, trifling with the census, which is required by the Constitution and is a foundation of American democracy, represents a serious breach of trust.", "title": "Opinion | The Trump Administration Sabotages the Census", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "Women\u2019s progress in America has been inextricably tied to the availability of birth control. Landmark Supreme Court decisions in 1965 and 1972 recognizing a constitutional right to contraception made it more likely that women went to college, entered the work force and found economic stability. That\u2019s all because they were better able to choose when, or whether, to have children.\n\nA 2012 study from the University of Michigan found that by the 1990s, women who had early access to the birth control pill had wage gains of up to 30 percent, compared with older women.\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling that anyone would want to thwart that progress, especially since women still have so far to go in attaining full equality in the United States. But the Trump administration has signaled it may do just that, in a recent announcement about funding for a major family planning program, Title X.\n\nSince 1970, the federal government has awarded Title X grants to providers of family planning services \u2014 including contraception, cervical cancer screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 to help low-income women afford them.

Consider his comments on climate change. Scientists generally think global warming is real and human generated. Who would dare to take on all those scientists? Mr. Trump would, because their conclusions just don\u2019t sound right to him, even if he can\u2019t explain why. And the Trump narrative presents him as an unrivaled success: a billionaire, a bon vivant and now president.\n\nIn the same book, Mr. Trump said his approach implied stress: \u201cI want to tell you about the negatives of business as well as the positives. I want to talk about the fact that most people are not cut out to deal with the high stress level of being a great success.\u201d But he advocates stressful risk-taking, not quiet contemplation, for readers who can handle it.\n\nMr. Trump has personified these ideas and attracted millions of people to them, shifting mass psychology in ways that the confidence indexes will have a hard time capturing. The indexes routinely miss the major changes in spirit that cause long-term economic phenomena like the reckless prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, a decade of high adventuresome spirit in business. Too high, actually.\n\nThis confidence crashed, shifting into the gloom of the Great Depression of the 1930s, a period characterized by waves of recriminations and disappointment. As the decade wore on, the term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d became prominent. That depression was \u201cgreat\u201d partly because it lasted more than 10 years.

After leaks indicating that Mr. Trump planned to withdraw the United States from Nafta, there was an onslaught of phone calls to the White House from C.E.O.\u2019s and international leaders. And pro-trade advisers worked to get the president\u2019s ear.\n\nHe backed off, saying the next day that he would give Nafta renegotiation a try.\n\nWhen the administration has acted on trade \u2014 with tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, most notably \u2014 the moves have been relatively narrow, fitting comfortably with precedent and unlikely to spark global blowback.\n\nLately, there has even been talk that the administration might reverse course and move to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the United States pulled out of at the start of the Trump administration.\n\nMore broadly, financial markets spent the first year of the Trump presidency gaining comfort that investors could count on the administration to deliver business-friendly economic policy, regardless of presidential bombast.

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "According to the United States International Trade Commission, other serious consequences of the tariffs included difficulties obtaining steel in the quality and quantity desired, a shift to sourcing finished parts from overseas, and relocating domestic steel-consuming facilities abroad.\n\nDoes that sound like what\u2019s best for American workers and consumers? Instead of bringing jobs back to America and fighting off imports, the tariffs led to more jobs shipped abroad and more imports of final, rather than raw, goods. In other words, if your company uses steel to make pipes or refrigerators, you may decide to simply produce your own products abroad rather than paying artificially inflated prices on steel in order to make them in the U.S.A.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, recently reminded the president of the negative impact of the 2002 import taxes. Mr. Trump dismissed it as a byproduct of the Bush administration\u2019s incompetence. But this president doesn\u2019t have the power to change the laws of economics.\n\nLike President Bush, Mr. Trump will raise the cost of doing business in steel- and aluminum-consuming companies.

Many will lose their jobs \u2014 possibly more than the 170,000 workers currently employed in the steel and aluminum producing industries.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the president is comfortable with the knowledge that his import tax will make our cars, infrastructure, soda cans and aircraft more expensive. And he\u2019s flat-out wrong when he claims, \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll cost a little bit more, but we\u2019ll have jobs.\u201d As the Department of Commerce\u2019s own report shows, the decline of jobs in the steel and aluminum industries predates the competition with China by decades. Industry experts know that this is mostly because of innovation and industry consolidation. The era of labor-intensive metal production is over.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump may think a tariff-induced trade war would reduce our trade deficits, as he gleefully tweeted the day after the announcement, but don\u2019t count on it. In the unlikely event that the import tax would incentivize foreign companies to set up shop in the United States, these investments would very likely increase the United States trade deficit. It would prompt foreigners to buy fewer American exports in order to accumulate the dollars needed to fund these investments.\n\nNo one doubts that Beijing doles out special privileges to Chinese exporters, but the way to answer Chinese cronyism isn\u2019t to expand American cronyism. Chinese cronyism comes at the expense of other Chinese producers and consumers. We shouldn\u2019t imitate their behavior by hurting our own consumers.\n\nA better path forward is to allow the World Trade Organization to settle the dispute or go back to the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2019s negotiating table.

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Navalny initially dismissed speculation that Deripaska had served as a back channel between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. \u201cAmong all the conspiracy theories of American mass media, this part was the most unconvincing,\u201d he said in the video. \u201cMany oligarchs are close to Putin,\u201d and there was no evidence that Deripaska was transmitting secret intelligence to him.\n\nBut then Navalny and his team looked closely at the Instagram account of Deripaska\u2019s nubile consort. Vashukevich had posted video from an August 2016 trip to Norway on Deripaska\u2019s yacht with several other escorts. And on that yacht was a Russian deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko. In the video, you can even hear Deripaska and Prikhodko talking about Russia\u2019s bad relations with the United States, for which Deripaska blamed Victoria Nuland, Barack Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs. Seeing it, said Navalny, \u201cthe pieces of this puzzle fell into place.\u201d\n\nWithin 24 hours of Navalny posting his investigation, a Russian court issued a ruling trying to block access to it. Deripaska filed a claim against Vashukevich and Aleksandr Kirillov, a self-styled \u201csex guru\u201d she\u2019s close to, for invasion of privacy. And at some point Vashukevich and Kirillov took off for Thailand.\n\nThey were arrested there last Sunday, while teaching a \u201csex training\u201d seminar for Russian tourists in the resort city of Pattaya. (The charges were working without a permit.) From what was apparently the back of an open-air police vehicle, Vashukevich made an Instagram video begging Americans for help. \u201cI\u2019m ready to give you all the missing puzzle pieces, support them with videos and audios, regarding the connections of our respected lawmakers with Trump, Manafort and the rest,\u201d she said, according to CNN\u2019s translation.\n\nWhen the news about Vashukevich\u2019s arrest broke, my first thought was that it was some sort of dirty trick, a sideshow designed to make the investigation into Trump\u2019s Russian connections look ridiculous. After all, one thing we\u2019ve learned from this whole affair is that Deripaska maintains relationships with sex workers who participate in gonzo political theater. (That itself is useful knowledge in evaluating the more salacious claims in the infamous dossier compiled by the British former spy Christopher Steele.)\n\nBut Vashukevich and Kirillov really are being detained, and, speaking from a police van, Kirillov told The Associated Press that he believes Russia is behind their arrests. He has reportedly sent a handwritten letter to the American Embassy in Thailand pleading for asylum in exchange for information.\n\nNavalny told The A.P. he didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cShows like \u2018Homeland\u2019 begin to look entirely realistic when you look at what is happening in Russia now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe thought the scriptwriters made the most impossible things up, but in Russia the most absurd things are possible.\u201d\n\nThey are in America, too. Could a social-media-obsessed escort help explain the degrading nightmare of the Trump presidency? It seems like the preposterously lazy plot of a sub-B movie.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "The result was that privates first class and specialists fourth class \u2014 untested, lower-ranking enlistees \u2014 were suddenly thrust into leadership roles. Captain Medina later testified that these transfers cost the company 70 percent of its strength.\n\nStatistically, Charlie Company was slightly above average among the infantry companies serving in Southeast Asia during the war. Eighty-seven percent of the remaining noncommissioned officers had graduated from high school, a rate 20 percent higher than the average for line infantry companies. Seventy percent of the men in lower enlisted ranks had graduated from high school, also slightly above the average for soldiers serving in Vietnam.\n\nThe unit was mixed demographically, with half of its troops being African-American, and the men came from geographically diverse hometowns. Other than the inexperienced men in key leadership roles, and the company\u2019s experiences in the months before My Lai, there is little to explain why this particular group of soldiers committed the most horrific set of war crimes by American troops during the entire conflict.\n\nSoon after its deployment in Vietnam, Charlie Company began to take heavy casualties from booby traps and snipers. Lieutenant Calley grew to hate and fear the local Vietnamese after losing his radio telephone operator, William Weber, to a sniper\u2019s bullet while carelessly leading his men along the top of a dike between rice paddies to keep them out of the water. After that, all Vietnamese became synonymous with Vietcong guerrillas for Lieutenant Calley, and soon the rest of the company adopted his harsh attitudes.\n\nCaptain Medina and his officers tolerated Charlie Company\u2019s abuse of Vietnamese civilians in the weeks before the massacre. After Pfc. Herbert Carter knocked an unarmed farmer into a well, Lieutenant Calley shot the defenseless man. Captain Medina allowed his troops to use prisoners as human mine detectors and personally beat captives during interrogations.\n\nRape became such an endemic problem in Charlie Company that one member of its Second Platoon, Michael Bernhardt, assumed that every woman Lieutenant Calley\u2019s platoon came across would be raped within moments. After a booby trap killed Sgt. George Cox, surviving soldiers stole a radio from a local woman and kicked her to death when she protested.\n\nSergeant Cox\u2019s death set the stage for the My Lai massacre. On March 15, the company held a memorial service at which Captain Medina reminded the company of their casualties. The company had lost half of its strength in just two months. Lieutenant Calley\u2019s First Platoon was down to 27 of its original 45 men.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCaptain Medina argued that Charlie Company could not afford more casualties, so they needed to pull together and be aggressive in their pursuit of the enemy. Soon after the funeral Captain Medina briefed the company about its next mission: an assault into My Lai to destroy the remnants of one of the Vietcong\u2019s most lethal units,the 48th Local Force Battalion.\n\nThe briefing for the assault on My Lai led many of Captain Medina\u2019s subordinates to believe that their mission was to kill everyone in the hamlet, to shoot the livestock, to destroy the wells and to level the buildings, because everyone living in My Lai was either a member of the Vietcong or a Vietcong sympathizer.\n\nCaptain Medina told his troops that this was their chance to avenge their fallen comrades. One private, Dennis Bunning, later claimed that Captain Medina ordered them to kill everyone; their intelligence briefing claimed that all My Lai\u2019s women and children would be at the market that morning. Another, James Bergthold, summed up the general response to the briefing: \u201cAlthough Captain Medina didn\u2019t say to kill everyone in the village, I heard guys talking and they were of the opinion that everyone in the village was to be killed.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The 105-millimeter shells were supposed to land 400 meters away from My Lai, but some of the rounds fell near houses. The artillery was intended to harass Vietcong; but there were no Vietcong in My Lai, not any more at least, so it merely damaged houses and dikes and forced residents to hide in bunkers.\n\nLieutenant Calley\u2019s platoon, and part of second platoon, led by Second Lt. Stephen Brooks, landed at My Lai with the first wave of helicopters and secured the landing zone. While they did not receive any enemy fire, the constant stream of machine gun and rocket fire that helicopter gunships sprayed at the nearest huts gave them the impression that they were under attack. Lieutenant Calley and Lieutenant Brooks led their men into the village after a second wave of helicopters brought the rest of the company.\n\nMoving into My Lai the platoons broke up into smaller groups of soldiers that their officers could not observe. Two privates, Dennis Conti and Paul Meadlo, kept the people they encountered under guard until an officer could evaluate them. When Lieutenant Calley found them, he ordered Private Conti and Private Meadlo to \u201ctake care of them\u201d and left.\n\nUnder pressure from Captain Medina to quickly move his men through My Lai, Lieutenant Calley returned a few minutes later, and asked why they had not taken care of the villagers. Private Meadlo responded that they were following his orders, and Lieutenant Calley responded that he wanted the villagers killed. Pushing the soldiers into a firing line, Lieutenant Calley ordered them to shoot the villagers.\n\nPrivate Meadlo obeyed Lieutenant Calley while Private Conti watched the tree line for danger. After firing three magazines of ammunition, Private Meadlo broke down in tears, telling Private Conti: \u201cIf they are going to be killed, I\u2019m not doing it. Let him do it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nContinuing into My Lai, Lieutenant Calley, along with Private Conti, Private Meadlo and Specialist Ronald Grzesik, arrived at a drainage ditch where other members of the company guarded 50 more villagers, including women, small children and a Buddhist monk. When the monk could not tell Lieutenant Calley where the Vietcong had gone, he pushed him into the ditch and shot him. After additional soldiers brought more Vietnamese to the ditch, Lieutenant Calley ordered his men to shoot them.\n\nThe massacre finally ended when a flight crew led by Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson intervened. Angered by the murders he observed from his scout helicopter, he landed when he saw soldiers moving toward a group of villagers hiding in a bunker. As he left the helicopter, Mr. Thompson told the door gunner, Lawrence Colburn, to cover him, and to fire on Charlie Company if they begin killing the Vietnamese at the bunker.\n\nAfter confronting Lieutenant Calley, who told him that it was none of his business, Mr. Thompson persuaded the pilots of other helicopters overhead to land and evacuate the civilians. His radio calls eventually caught the attention of Lt. Col. Frank Barker, who ordered Captain Medina to stop the killing.\n\nLeadership failures continued after the shooting stopped. When Hugh Thompson reported the large number of civilian deaths that occurred at My Lai, his commander, Maj. Fred Watke, discounted the report in the belief the pilot did not have the experience to tell how the Vietnamese had died. When he took the allegations to the assistant division commander, Brig. Gen. George Young, Major Watke said that only 25 noncombatants had died and focused on the encounter between Mr. Thompson and Lieutenant Calley. This report allowed Colonel Barker to later claim that there was no evidence to support Mr. Thompson\u2019s reports, and that the civilians had died in a crossfire.\n\nCaptain Medina began the cover-up by falsely claiming that the village had indeed been full of Vietcong when the assault began, but that they had all fled, so that all that remained were women and children. When questioned about the disparity between the high body count and low number of captured weapons \u2014 Charlie Company found only three old M1 Garand rifles \u2014 Captain Medina lied to the division\u2019s commander, General Koster, that artillery killed 20 to 28 civilians.\n\nHis false report to General Koster began the core of the cover-up that Lieutenant Colonel Barker and the brigade commander, Lt. Col. Oran Henderson, initiated to hide the massacre.\n\nThe ambitions of the senior officers in the 23rd Infantry Division helped create the environment in which the massacre unfolded and was hidden from scrutiny. General Koster viewed his command as a temporary stop on his way to higher rank \u2014 commanding a division in combat was another box to check. The division public affairs officer, Lt. Col. Charles Anistranski, remembered General Koster being furious over the results of My Lai because the official body count of 128 Vietcong killed, but only three weapons recovered, reflected poorly on his leadership.\n\nWhile General Koster rarely interacted with his subordinates, he regularly reminded them to follow the rules of engagement, and that he equated the number of weapons recovered with the number of enemy killed. Although he told men that they could not simply shoot up a village to increase body counts, General Koster did not insist on an accurate account of the deaths at My Lai.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the assistant division commander, George Young, informed General Koster of Hugh Thompson\u2019s allegations that Captain Medina\u2019s men had murdered civilians at My Lai, both focused on the pilot\u2019s confrontation with Lieutenant Calley. Focusing on the argument between Mr. Thompson and Lieutenant Calley, General Young and General Koster skirted directives from the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam that accusations of war crimes be forwarded to the staff judge advocate in Saigon.\n\nCareer aspirations also motivated Lieutenant Colonel Barker, who had never had a combat command. Understanding that a battalion command was necessary for promotion to full colonel, he saw the current operation, of which the assault on My Lai was just one part, as the next best thing. Wanting to score successes against the Vietcong, he urged Charlie Company to be very aggressive during the assault on My Lai, later acknowledging that his exhortations likely contributed to the misconception that Captain Medina\u2019s men should kill everyone in the village.\n\nWhile emphasizing aggressiveness and the liveliness of heavy combat during the assault, both Lieutenant Colonel Barker and Captain Medina failed to provide instructions for how to handle noncombatants. When assigned to investigate the actions of his own men, Lieutenant Colonel Barker wrote a superficial report that cleared Charlie Company of wrongdoing.\n\nThe events at My Lai became public a year later. Several officers were brought to trial in 1971, but only Lieutenant Calley was convicted. He was released from prison in 1974.", "title": "The Truth Behind My Lai", "authors": ["Christopher J.

While it had been nearly 50 years since the last American planes riddled the countryside near Danang in central Vietnam, craters still pockmark the land. Some of the deep depressions remain dry while others, a testament to the ingenuity of the villagers, serve as watering holes for the oxen that farmers harness to till their fields.\n\nIt was my first week in Vietnam, where I would spend the summer of 2016 conducting research. I was studying the efficacy of international law, namely whether legal remedies exist for civilian victims of unexploded ordnance and chemical weapons from the Vietnam War. I had arrived well versed in the numbers: America dropped three times more ordnance over Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia than all sides did during World War II. Estimates are that at least 350,000 tons of live bombs and mines remain in Vietnam, and that it will take 300 years to clear them from the Vietnamese landscape at the current rate.\n\nPhoto\n\nBombs and other ordnance were dropped on thousands of villages and hamlets. The most common were cluster bombs, each of which contained hundreds of baseball-size bomblets; the bombs are designed to explode near ground level, releasing metal fragments to maim and kill. But many of the cluster bombs failed to release their contents or, in other cases, their bomblets failed to detonate.\n\nFor the Vietnamese, the war continues. Loss of arms, legs and eyesight are for the more fortunate ones. Others have lost their family breadwinners, or their children. Children find baseball-size metal objects and unwittingly toss the \u201ctoys\u201d to one another in games of catch until they explode. Nearly 40,000 Vietnamese have been killed since the end of the war in 1975, and 67,000 maimed, by land mines, cluster bombs and other ordnance.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat\u2019s not the only, or even the worst, legacy of the war that Vietnamese families still face. Seeking to defoliate entire forests to expose enemy forces to spotter planes, the Americans dropped 18 million gallons of chemical herbicide over South Vietnam from 1962 to 1972. There were several defoliants used, but the best known was Agent Orange. In 20,000 spraying missions, planes drenched the countryside and an estimated 3,181 villages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile entire forests dried up and died typically within weeks of spraying, it would be years before scientists established that one of the active ingredients in the defoliants, a group of compounds called dioxin, is one of the deadliest substances known to humankind. Just 85 grams of dioxin, if evenly distributed, could wipe out a city of eight million people. But illnesses and deaths from Agent Orange exposure were only the initial outcomes. Dioxin affects not only people exposed to it, but also their children, altering DNA. Large numbers of Vietnamese babies continue to be born with grotesque deformities: misshapen heads, bulging tumors, underdeveloped brains and nonfunctioning limbs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Indeed, by making the drugs ever more valuable, they have only amplified the motivational feedback loop of the very people lawmakers are trying to stop.\n\nAn overreliance on intensive policing over the decades has also produced a rapid Darwinian evolution of the drug trade. The people we have typically captured tend to be the ones who are dumb enough to get caught. They may have violated operational security, bragged too much, lived conspicuous lifestyles or engaged in turf wars. The ones we usually miss tend to be the most innovative, adaptable and cunning. We have picked off their clumsy competition for them and opened up that lucrative economic trafficking space to the most efficient organizations. It is as though we have had a decades-long policy of selectively breeding supertraffickers and ensuring the \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d\n\nTo support his case for executions, Mr. Trump cites draconian penalties in other countries. Iran has used the death penalty extensively in drug cases, but more than 2.8 million Iranians still consume illicit drugs. Earlier this year, the Iranian government even repealed the use of executions in most drug cases which could spare up to 5,000 people on death row.\n\nMr. Trump often praises President Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s brutal drug war in the Philippines, which has claimed 12,000 to 20,000 lives in mostly extrajudicial killings. But there is little indication that drug use has actually decreased. In fact, as the killings have increased, so too have the government\u2019s drug use estimates. What began as 1.8 million users at the beginning of 2016 grew to three million and later four million. Last September, the Philippine Foreign Secretary, Alan Peter Cayetano, even raised that estimate to seven million. The higher numbers are likely inflated, but more killings do not appear to reduce the number of users.\n\nSingapore notoriously refuses to publish reliable drug-use statistics, so there is no way to show whether executions have any measurable effect on drug consumption. As Harm Reduction International pointed out, however, Singapore\u2019s seizures for cannabis and methamphetamine increased 20 percent in 2016 while heroin seizures remained stable. Moreover, 80 percent of Singapore\u2019s prisoners are incarcerated for drug-related offenses. All of this suggests, Singapore\u2019s famous panacea to solve the drug problem is not as miraculous as it seems.", "title": "Opinion | The War on Drugs Breeds Crafty Traffickers", "authors": []}

These defeats obscure many victories as we help those with severe mental illness reclaim their lives.\n\nWe have the medications and psychological interventions if offered in knowledgeable, humanistic systems. But access is limited and a challenge to locate, benefits are often inadequate or nonexistent, and treatments are too often applied sporadically. Thus there are also wrenching failures.\n\nThe amazing outcomes we now can achieve with cancer and cardiac disease occur because these individuals are not burdened with stigma.

If it does, they\u2019ll want to see what Wall Street\u2019s response says about the prospects for other so-called unicorns, the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by the private investors that have so far financed their growth. Although privately valued at $10 billion, Dropbox recently set an initial price range for its shares at $16 to $18, for a value of $7 billion to $7.9 billion. One question is whether Dropbox, and others that may follow it to market, can avoid the fate of Snap, the company behind the Snapchat app, which has struggled to stay above its $17-a-share offering price since going public a year ago, and the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June and is now trading well below that.\n\nEconomy\n\nJerome Powell\u2019s first meeting as Fed chairman.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss interest rates, the first such session with Jerome H. Powell as the central bank\u2019s new chairman. With the job market tight and inflation picking up only gradually, the Fed is widely expected to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point in what is likely to be the first of three rate increases this year. After the meeting, Mr. Powell will hold his first news conference in his new role, where observers will be listening closely for any suggestion that the Fed might depart from its anticipated path, and, if so, why.\n\nTrade\n\nDeadline looms for duties on imported metals.\n\nThe steep tariffs ordered by President Trump on imported aluminum and steel are to take effect on Friday.

She told HuffPost that she works as a cashier at Hardee\u2019s on weekends, for $8.75 an hour, to help support her family.

West Virginia has more than 700 unfilled teaching positions, as teachers head to jobs in neighboring Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania that pay far more. Instead of raising pay to attract qualified applicants, West Virginia officials want to reduce certification standards.\n\nOklahoma is facing its own severe teacher shortage, and dozens of schools in the state have shortened the school week to four days to cut costs.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "Last May, Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, delivered one of the most stirring and important speeches of the Trump era without once deigning to mention the president\u2019s name. He spoke after New Orleans pulled down four Confederate monuments, the culmination of a ferocious two-year political fight that included threats, armed right-wing protesters and a car being firebombed.\n\nAll around the country, there was a bitter debate about what to do with monuments to slavery and treason, most erected by white supremacists decades after the Civil War. Much of this debate, like our politics in general since November 2016, focused on the feelings of white voters who feared their history was being taken from them. So it was moving to hear a white Southern politician \u2014 a bluff, broad-shouldered guy who looks like a football coach in an inspirational Hollywood movie \u2014 try to see the statues from the perspective of his city\u2019s African-American majority.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, Landrieu said, \u201casking African-Americans \u2014 or anyone else for that matter \u2014 to drive by property that they own occupied by reverential statues of men who fought to destroy the country and deny that person\u2019s humanity seems perverse. It seems absurd.\u201d He argued that a city is entitled to choose whom it venerates. \u201cUnlike when these Confederate monuments were erected as symbols of white supremacy, we now have a chance to create not only new symbols, but to do it together, as one people,\u201d he said.\n\nIt may be a sign of how starved we are for eloquent leadership that this speech led to talk of Landrieu as a potential presidential contender. That chatter has only picked up with the publication of Landrieu\u2019s new book, \u201cIn the Shadow of Statues: A White Southerner Confronts History.\u201d In Politico, Donna Brazile and James Carville were recently quoted cheering him on; Carville described him as a talent on the scale of Bill Clinton or Barack Obama.", "title": "Opinion | The White Southern Anti-Trump", "authors": []}

And the imprint of Minoso lives on.\n\nA nine-time All-Star, Minoso played 12 seasons for the White Sox, his first in 1951 and his last a cameo in 1980. The Cuban pitchers Jose Contreras and Orlando Hernandez helped lead the White Sox to their World Series title in 2005, and on multiple occasions in 2014, the team used four Cuban players in the same lineup \u2014 Abreu, Alexei Ramirez, Dayan Viciedo and Adrian Nieto. No other team had done that in 45 years.\n\nMinoso, who lived in Chicago year-round before his death in 2015, spoke before one of those games about his pride in that lineup. He shared his advice for his successors with the White Sox.\n\n\u201cBe in love with the game,\u201d Minoso said. \u201cDo everything beautiful for the game and the people and the country you represent. That\u2019s what I want everyone to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2013, Abreu defected by boat to Haiti from Cuba, where he had starred for Cienfuegos of Serie Nacional and made about $20 a month. On his flight to the United States, where a six-year, $68 million contract with the White Sox awaited, he swallowed a page of his passport because it contained a false name. He did not want to risk jeopardizing the deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat revelation, which Abreu made last year at the smuggling and conspiracy trial of an agent and trainer, underscored the desperation of Cubans to leave a country that prevents them from seeking their market value. Abreu has made good on the White Sox\u2019 investment; he is the only player in the majors to hit at least .290 with 25 homers and 100 runs batted in in each of the last four seasons. Listening to Minoso, he said, helped his transition.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came here, he was a person who gave me the trick to have success in this country, and in the major leagues: work hard, respect and punctuality,\u201d Abreu said. \u201cThose are the three keys I\u2019ve been trying to pass to Yoan and Robert, and all the people around me, too, because I know it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve applied them, and I\u2019ve enjoyed the success I\u2019ve enjoyed because of it.\u201d\n\nThe White Sox have changed over nearly their entire roster since Abreu arrived.

From December 2016 through last July, he traded Sale, outfielder Adam Eaton, starter Jose Quintana and relievers Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson for an avalanche of prospects who have lifted the White Sox from 23rd in Baseball America\u2019s 2016 farm system rankings to fourth (behind Atlanta, the Yankees and San Diego) this spring.\n\nNow, they wait.\n\n\u201cThe final stage, where you start adding to this young core at the big-league level with premium free-agent talent, that\u2019s exciting, because you\u2019re getting close,\u201d Hahn said. \u201cIt\u2019s this in-between stage \u2014 when you have to show patience and let player development take its course \u2014 that\u2019s perhaps the most challenging of the whole thing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother challenge could be re-signing their team leader, although Abreu, who can be a free agent after the 2019 season, has no plans to leave. He changed his diet this winter and shed 10 pounds.\n\n\u201cMy parents taught me to always be grateful, and I\u2019m very grateful to this organization,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to play for this team for a very, very long time and to be here when this organization wins a championship.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Over the next half-year, the patient continued to have episodes of chest pain on her right side. Each time she had a twinge or stab, fearing another pneumothorax, she would call her doctor, and he would send her to the E.R. for an X-ray. It happened almost 20 times. The X-rays, though not exactly normal, did not show evidence of new leaks \u2014 until one day in May, when a chest X-ray showed yet another, albeit small, pneumothorax.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhy was this happening? The patient asked Patton whether the lung problems could be related to the hormone therapy she\u2019d had for in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.). It was really the only new thing in her life before all this started. It had taken nine fertilizations and nearly three years, but she finally became pregnant four years earlier and now had twin girls. Patton didn\u2019t know of any link between pneumothorax and I.V.F., but there was a link, albeit rare, between pneumothorax and endometriosis \u2014 a disorder in which tiny dots of the inner lining of the uterus tissue, known as endometrium, move into other parts of the body. Women who have endometriosis can have episodes of pneumothorax if those cells make their way past the diaphragm into the chest.\n\nThis endometrial tissue, like that in the uterus, changes with the monthly cycle of estrogen and progesterone, causing pain and sometimes bleeding. In the chest cavity, it could cause what was called a catamenial (derived from the Greek for monthly) pneumothorax. But did her episodes of pneumothorax come with her period? She wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nTargeting Hormones\n\nPatton had suggested starting birth-control pills to suppress the hormonal changes. She began taking them three weeks before the horrible night at her weekend home, which left her with difficulty breathing. First thing the next morning, her husband carried their sleepy children to the car. She carried the oxygen tank she got earlier that spring \u2014 just in case \u2014 and they set off for the drive to Lenox Hill Hospital. They stopped to pick up her mother on the way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The pleurodesis hadn\u2019t worked. The patient had been reading about catamenial pneumothorax, and even though hormone suppression hadn\u2019t been effective, she still thought this was what she had. Her mother found a gynecologic surgeon at Lenox Hill, Dr. Tamer Seckin, who specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis. Mother and patient urged the two subspecialists to work together in the operating room, and they agreed.\n\nIn the Operating Room\n\nThe operation, which involved both doctors, took five hours. Seckin went first. He looked in the abdomen and pelvis and found many endometrial implants. He saw small patches of wayward cells on the bladder and the intestines and scattered across the abdominal and pelvic walls. But he did not see any on the bottom side of the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest. Although there was evidence that she had extensive endometriosis, it wasn\u2019t clear if it was the cause of her lung collapse.\n\nThen it was Patton\u2019s turn. He would examine the chest and lungs. The patient was placed on her left side, and the camera and surgical instruments were inserted between her ribs into the right side of her chest. Patton carefully examined the smooth, curved upper surface of the diaphragm. Directly below the lung there was a patch of purple tissue, a little smaller than a dime. Were those the endometrial cells? Patton cut out the abnormal-looking tissue then sewed up the hole. He scanned the lung, from top to bottom, and found another small patch of abnormal-appearing tissue, which he cut out as well. The samples were sent to the pathology lab. He then fastened her lung to the pleural surface of her chest again. Before the operation was finished, the results were back from the lab. The tissue on the diaphragm was endometriosis. She had catamenial pneumothorax disease.\n\nRecovery was slow after the operation, but the patient felt less anxious because she knew the cause of her lung problems. In a second operation, Seckin was able to remove all the visible endometrial implants. Still, there was no way to guarantee that she wouldn\u2019t develop more unless the source of the implants, her uterus, was removed, along with her ovaries. It was a tough decision. But since she wasn\u2019t planning to have more children, she felt it made sense.\n\nThat final operation was six months ago. And the patient says her life is slowly coming back. She jokes that after all these chest and abdominal operations, she looks as if she were in some kind of knife fight. And though her chest still feels tight, it\u2019s good to be able to breathe.", "title": "The Woman Was Fit and Healthy. Why Did Her Lung Mysteriously Collapse?", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}
{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nON A FALL afternoon at De Maria, a year-old restaurant in New York\u2019s NoLIta neighborhood, the flat city light pours in from a wall of windows onto square tables covered in worn pistachio-green and navy leather. Diners can sit on squat wooden chairs, a tan-leather banquette or felt-topped stools at the bar, which is lit by orblike pendants and backed by a Bauhaus-via-Brazil geometric tile mural. They might order a chai latte, which arrives in a stoneware mug made by Brooklyn\u2019s Workaday Handmade, or a cured-salmon and coconut grain bowl, off seasonal menus that are available from early in the morning until late at night.\n\nBeyond the virtuous food, the space itself is somehow salubrious, as if solely by being here you are improving your life. Along with places like Kismet in Los Angeles, June\u2019s All Day in Austin and Res Ipsa in Philadelphia, De Maria is part of a new class of American restaurants \u2014 or rather, \u201call-day cafes\u201d \u2014 that combine highly specific, instantly recognizable d\u00e9cor with visually pleasing riffs on health-store classics like flaxseed banana bread and acai. These new cafes, all of which owe a debt to New York\u2019s abstemious Dimes, which opened in Chinatown in 2013, present amiable aesthetic experiences that feel ready-made for Instagram: Many of these rooms share the same natural light, blond wood chairs and copper details that have come to evoke a kind of Scandinavian-inflected, aspirational millennial apartment, which the cafes themselves tend to resemble.\n\nDe Maria\u2019s interior, in particular, is the work of the MP Shift, a Chinatown-based design and branding studio that, since its founding three years ago, has created variations on this look for several New York City restaurants and is now expanding throughout the country \u2014 as well as to Paris, London and Sydney. The studio was established by Amy Morris and Anna Polonsky (the M and P of the name, plus shift as in \u201clate\u201d), who met a decade ago through mutual friends, when Morris was a marketing consultant and Polonsky was a managing partner at a culinary events company. The young chefs and restaurateurs they encountered in those jobs were often interested in developing independent projects but lacked the proper guidance, so the two women decided to build an agency that consolidated graphics, interiors and brand-direction.\n\nIf it\u2019s well established that we eat with our eyes, then the MP Shift is selling a related truth: In our digital age, a restaurant\u2019s interior must be as satiating as its food. Officially, Morris and Polonsky have little to do with what\u2019s on a client\u2019s menu (aside from its logo, typefaces and layout), but they have tended to partner with chefs who prefer serving things like cerulean spirulina smoothies and magenta-hued radicchio salads that feel intended for future snapshots. The plating, too, reflects an understanding of what appeals to these restaurants\u2019 intended psychographic: It\u2019s heavy on swooshes of creamy sauces and bright, clashing layers of tropical fruits or local vegetables in flattened, de Kooning-esque compositions, often rendered atop wide, shallow clay plates and bowls. The MP Shift doesn\u2019t tell the kitchen staff how to assemble their ingredients, but they don\u2019t need to; chefs these days must think as much like designers as they do cooks \u2014 indeed, their success depends upon it.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat the MP Shift does do is help ensure that this all-day fare remains visually appealing no matter the hour, while also providing a growing community of urban freelancers a sort of idealized living-room-as-office, allowing a public space to masquerade as a private one. \u201cIn the morning, everyone is on their laptop here; people are spending more time in restaurants as their third space,\u201d Morris says of De Maria, referencing a concept by the urban sociologist Ray Oldenburg, who argued in 1989\u2019s \u201cThe Great Good Place\u201d that communities thrive in social spaces beyond homes and offices. These days, she says, \u201cYou\u2019re asking for a restaurant to be more than just food.\u201d\n\nRESTAURANTS, OF COURSE, have always been about more than just the food, whether it was New York\u2019s Four Seasons, designed in the International Style by Philip Johnson and William Pahlmann in 1958, or the organic austerity of the French Laundry, opened in Napa County in 1978, which for decades has defined a particular indoor-outdoor Northern Californian reverie. Meals worth traveling for are usually complemented by service and d\u00e9cor that\u2019s meant to soothe, excite or even dazzle in person. But now that every diner has a camera in her handbag, restaurateurs have been forced to acknowledge that what they\u2019re creating is not just a place where people consume meals but an aspirational space that, for many who experience it, exists only online. So even casual cafes \u2014 the sort that the MP Shift often designs \u2014 have to be stunning and distinctive enough to woo potential diners.\n\nMorris and Polonsky\u2019s projects often reflect the idea that these places become most enticing when filled with the same global, minimalist details (imported tiles, Alvar Aalto stools, oak tables) that appeal when encountered on social media, whether in pictures of other restaurants, or even of homes or hotels. \u201cThey asked me to open a Pinterest account,\u201d says Gonzalo Go\u00fbt, the co-owner of Verde, an erstwhile salad counter in New York\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, who hired the MP Shift in 2016. All of Verde\u2019s ingredients came from the farmer\u2019s market, so Go\u00fbt used his virtual mood board to create a look that \u201cconveyed that sense of the natural,\u201d he says. Following this exercise, Morris and Polonsky built a dramatic counter of triangular slices of green and pink marble, which also adorned the facade as terrazzo. The final touch was the logo, with the restaurant\u2019s name rendered in a fat, cheery pink-and-green sans serif.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Morris and Polonsky\u2019s portfolio grows, new clients increasingly reach out because they want to replicate a detail that they\u2019ve seen only in photographs. In Houston, Kelly Barnhart will soon open Vibrant, an all-day cafe serving \u201cadaptogenic potions\u201d and grain salads out of a former laundromat. She was impressed with De Maria after seeing the space in a magazine, and brought the MP Shift on as consultants last spring. Working with Lake Flato, a local architecture firm, Barnhart plans to install long, leather-clad L-shaped banquettes, vintage Tobias Scarpa lamps and drawings by the New York artist Karin Haas, whose work abstracts patterns she finds in nature.\n\nThe room\u2019s look will probably feel familiar: comforting, even. But having become known for an identifiable style over the past few years, Morris and Polonsky are now at pains to escape its tyranny. Back at De Maria, Polonsky points out a geometrically patterned wall inspired by kintsugi (the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with thin threads of lacquer mixed with precious metals) that they created by filling cracks within the restaurant\u2019s vintage subway tiles. Potential clients constantly request this motif, but Morris and Polonsky aren\u2019t interested in replicating it. Likewise, they avoid Prouv\u00e9 chairs and parti-colored Max Lamb marble. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy for our clients to say, \u2018We should do a pink place with midcentury chairs,\u2019 \u201d Morris says. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want them to fall into that trend. We don\u2019t want them to say, \u2018Let\u2019s put avocado toast on the menu.\u2019 \u201d\n\nInstead, one of the MP Shift\u2019s new European clients is adopting a primary-colored palette that seems inspired, in part, by another recent internet phenomenon: the resurgence of the designer Ettore Sottsass and his Memphis Group. At the forthcoming Parisian cafe Echo, the menus and logo will feature Crayola red, blue and yellow that suggest mid-80s Los Angeles. Morris and Polonsky predict Europe\u2019s next trend-driven restaurant interiors might include angular Serge Mouille sconces and chrome seating, Formica counters and linoleum floors; in this context, these mundane American surfaces would likely feel modern. Though soon enough they, too, will be retired, making way for a new aesthetic to serve a new generation of diners who need to rest their phone on a lambent tabletop, order a hemp-milk cortado and, perhaps, post a photo or two.", "title": "The Women Responsible for the Look of Your Next All-Day Cafe", "authors": ["Kyle Chayka"]}

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "On the surface, of course, there\u2019s an obvious tension between the largely secular, liberal traditions of German culture and those forms of Islam that, for example, place religious law over secular law. But that\u2019s also a moot point: Muslims have been living here in large numbers since the 1960s, and now Germany\u2019s six million Muslims make up roughly 6 percent of the population. The problem is that the way Germany has dealt with them is a history of mistakes.\n\nThe first mistake, the one conservatives made, was to believe that the early \u201cguest workers\u201d brought from Turkey in the 1960s, to make up for a labor shortage, would eventually go home again. The second mistake, the one the left made, was to embrace all foreigners, whatever their values. After Sept. 11, more or less all sides have made a third mistake, the failure to ask painful questions about how to reconcile Islam with an pluralist, secular democracy.\n\nApathy, illusions and false tolerance have left important issues unaddressed for half a century. That has now turned to hostility: Many Germans just don\u2019t believe that Islam is compatible with Western values.\n\nAnd yet the fact that there are many liberal observant Muslims living in Germany suggests the opposite. These are the people who speak out against false dogma, the overly literal reading of the Quran, and anti-Western teachings. The problem is their small number and the hostility they encounter from fellow Muslims here in Germany.\n\nIn a representative survey conducted by the University of M\u00fcnster in 2016, 47 percent of Turkish immigrants and their descendants said that it was more important for them \u201cto abide by religious commands than by the laws of the country I live in.\u201d Some 32 percent said that Muslims should try to re-erect a social order like the one during the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad. And 50 percent said there was \u201conly one true religion.\u201d\n\nThese are troubling figures. While giving divine laws priority over worldly laws does not necessarily mean rejecting democracy (many Christians and Jews would subscribe to the same statement), the apparent longing of so many Muslims for an authoritarian rather than an open society is shocking. Their intolerance for those of other beliefs matches a political attitude that surprised this country one year ago: Of the roughly 700,000 Turkish Muslims in Germany who participated in the constitutional referendum in Turkey last April, 63 percent voted in favor of granting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unilateral powers.\n\nThis contempt for liberalism is a real problem, but rhetoric like Mr. Seehofer\u2019s will only make things worse.

In an interview with The New York Times this year, Mr. Zuckerberg cited his children as one of the reasons he was so focused on fixing Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me that when Max and August grow up that they feel like what their father built was good for the world,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\n\nChamath Palihapitiya, 41, an early Facebook executive who now leads the venture capital firm Social Capital, told me that becoming a father had transformed his outlook on technology. He avoids screen time for his children, and is more wary of the tools he helped build.\n\n\u201cBefore fatherhood, I believed that enabling my children to grow and explore through technology would be an obvious edge and something I\u2019d support,\u201d Mr. Palihapitiya said. \u201cIncreasingly, what I see is a detached generation of kids living behind screens.\u201d\n\nAs their executives pursue personal growth, some of Silicon Valley\u2019s large companies are also professionalizing their workplaces by cutting back on frivolous perks and enforcing stricter rules on sexual harassment and other forms of employee misconduct.

The story may have been set in turn-of-the century Indian Territory on the verge of statehood, but its subtext was the determination it had taken to tame the frontier \u2014 and by implication the courage it would take to defeat fascism in Germany and Japan. When the characters sang the joyous title song, with its proud anticipation of a \u201cbrand-new state!\u201d audiences heard the promise of a brand-new world, one in which the citizens of the newly created United Nations might actually behave and \u201cact like brothers,\u201d in the words of \u201cThe Farmer and the Cowman.\u201d\n\nThere had been no such promise in \u201cGreen Grow the Lilacs,\u201d the Theatre Guild play on which \u201cOklahoma!\u201d was based, and which had a Broadway run of just 64 performances, in 1931.

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "When a lot of the mainstream media talks about the working class, there is a tendency to romanticize, to idealize them as the most authentic Americans. They are \u201creal\u201d and their problems are \u201creal\u201d problems, as if everyone else is dealing with artificial obstacles. We see this in some of the breathless media coverage of Trump voters and in a lot of the online chatter about the \u201cRoseanne\u201d reboot. What often goes unsaid is that when the working class is defined in our cultural imagination, we are talking about white people, even though the real American working class is made up of people from many races and ethnicities.\n\nDuring a Television Critics Association panel promoting the show, Ms. Barr said, \u201cit was working-class people who elected Trump.\u201d\n\nThis myth persists, but it is only a myth. Forty-one percent of voters earning less than $50,000 voted for Mr. Trump while 53 percent voted for Hillary Clinton. Forty-nine percent of voters earning between $50,000 and $100,000 voted for Mr. Trump while 47 percent voted for Mrs. Clinton. The median income of these voters was $72,000, while the median income of Hillary Clinton voters was $61,000. A significant number of middle-class and wealthy white people contributed to Trump\u2019s election.\n\nIn the show, during an exchange about their political disagreement, Roseanne tells Jackie one of the reasons she voted for Mr. Trump is because he \u201ctalked about jobs.\u201d And that was all the political ideology we got. If we are to believe the circumstances of this character\u2019s life, a few vague words about \u201cjobs\u201d was more than enough to compel Roseanne, with inadequate health care, with vulnerable grandchildren, and struggling to make ends meet, to vote for Mr. Trump.\n\nHow do you reach people who make dangerous political choices grounded in self-interest? When Roseanne and Jackie finally reconcile, Roseanne never apologizes or concedes. She merely tells Jackie, \u201cI forgive you,\u201d and Jackie acknowledges how hard that was for Roseanne. Clearly, we cannot reach people who make dangerous, myopic political choices. We concede, as Jackie does, or we resist, as hopefully the rest of us will.\n\nIn my book \u201cBad Feminist,\u201d published in 2014, I wrote about giving myself permission to be flawed but feminist. I wrote about how sometimes I consume problematic pop culture, knowing I shouldn\u2019t, knowing how harmful that pop culture can be. I still believe there is room for that, for having principles and enjoying things that challenge those principles. But in the ensuing years, I\u2019ve also been thinking about accountability and the repercussions of our choices. I\u2019ve been thinking about how nothing will change if we keep consuming problematic pop culture without demanding anything better.\n\nAs I watched the first two episodes of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d reboot, I thought again about accountability. I laughed, yes, and enjoyed seeing the Conner family back on my screen. My first reaction was that the show was excellent. But I could not set aside what I know of Roseanne Barr and how toxic and dangerous her current public persona is. I could not overlook how the Conner family came together to support Mark as he was bullied at school for his gender presentation, after voting for a president who actively works against the transgender community. They voted for a president who doesn\u2019t think the black life of their granddaughter matters. They act as if love can protect the most vulnerable members of their family from the repercussions of their political choices. It cannot.\n\nThis fictional family, and the show\u2019s very real creator, are further normalizing Trump and his warped, harmful political ideologies. There are times when we can consume problematic pop culture, but this is not one of those times. I saw the first two episodes of the \u201cRoseanne\u201d reboot, but that\u2019s all I am going to watch.

And the story was so apposite to now, to the crazy wealthy element of our society, that I felt I should do it right away.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFX agreed. \u201cIt was really their larger ambitions that drew us in,\u201d Gina Balian, executive vice president of series development at FX Networks and FX Productions, said in an email. \u201cIt felt like their approach to exploring how money influences family bonds would be original and not another story that idealizes the wealthy and powerful of this world.\u201d After seeing early scripts, Ms. Balian said that it was \u201can easy decision\u201d to greenlight the show.\n\nMr. Boyle had begun casting \u2014 signing up Hilary Swank as Gail Getty, Paul\u2019s mother, and Brendan Fraser as the former C.I.A. operative James Fletcher Chace, who was Getty Sr.\u2019s security specialist \u2014 when it emerged that Mr. Scott was making a movie on the same subject. Although FX ultimately pushed back the series release date from January, to put some distance between \u201cTrust\u201d and the December opening of \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d there was no erosion of confidence from network executives, Mr. Boyle said, adding that they felt that a 10-part series was quite a different beast from a two-hour film.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a lot more experimental. Episode 8 is spoken entirely in the Calabrian dialect of Paul\u2019s kidnappers. In several episodes, Chace speaks directly to the audience (shades of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d), offering an epoch-spanning perspective on the events depicted during the rest of the show.\n\n\u201cI mentioned that it\u2019s like Chace has a prescience, like he is a time traveler,\u201d Mr. Fraser recounted in a telephone interview. \u201cThat developed into a touch of magical realism.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the first three episodes, which Mr. Boyle directed, the plethora of characters, split screens and montages of often-puzzling, nonlinear events eventually begin to resolve into a coherent story line: Paul, badly in debt to drug dealers, has planned his own kidnapping to raise money from his famously tightfisted family, then becomes a helpless victim as events spiral out of control. (This offers a different perspective to \u201cAll the Money,\u201d which paints Paul as a victim from the outset.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe more research I did, the more I realized he arranged his own kidnapping,\u201d Mr. Beaufoy said. \u201cIt was a huge attention-seeking device; they\u2019ll pay because they love me. It became an extraordinary metaphor for the third generation saying, pay some attention to me, show me some love.\u201d\n\nBut only Gail, Paul\u2019s mother, seems to have any love to give, and is the only one who desperately fights for her son\u2019s release. \u201cThere is probably nothing as scary as something happening to your child when you don\u2019t know what the outcome will be,\u201d Ms. Swank said during a day filming Gail\u2019s meeting with Walter Annenberg, the American ambassador in London at the time.\n\n\u201cI felt that what was important was that Gail is the story\u2019s emotional anchor, for all those others who treat the kidnapping like a business transaction,\u201d Ms. Swank said in a subsequent telephone interview. \u201cFrom being someone who was dependent on others, she has to take charge because no one else is going to. What does she have to do to get her son out alive?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the things she has to do is persuade Getty Sr. to agree to provide the ransom, which was reduced to about $3 million. When it was suggested to Mr. Sutherland that Getty Sr. was perhaps not the nicest of men, he fiercely defended his character\u2019s choices.\n\n\u201cI have huge respect and admiration for him,\u201d Mr. Sutherland said. \u201cHe did what he did himself, he worked on oil rigs, and he was desperately anxious to have his children carry on what he had worked so relentlessly \u2014 not ruthlessly \u2014 to achieve. He offered the children everything, and instead they didn\u2019t work and took drugs, and he gave up on them.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Mr. Boyle said, the story is about willpower. \u201cIt\u2019s the willpower of each of the individual characters, the willpower exercised between old Paul and his grandson, first as one tries to get money from the other, then extending into different arenas, some tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cThe joy of working in this format is that you can show how complicated any narrative can be.\u201d\n\nOr as Mr. Sutherland put it: \u201cTo try to capture the truth of a human being, la condition humaine, it\u2019s the most extraordinary business in the world.\u201d", "title": "The \u2018Trust\u2019 Equation: Wealth and Power Equals Misery", "authors": ["Roslyn Sulcas"]}

Mr. Serebrennikov is also a welcome guest at Komische Oper Berlin. His most recent work there was a modern-day, social media-heavy staging of Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbi\u00e8re di Siviglia\u201d in 2016, which is currently being revived. He was also set to direct Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rake\u2019s Progress\u201d in the 2019-20 season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that we think about Kirill,\u201d Barrie Kosky, the Komische Oper\u2019s artistic director, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re all waiting. That\u2019s the most frustrating and saddest thing about it.\u201d\n\nMr. Kosky said that he hoped Mr. Serebrennikov would soon be able to work again at the Komische Oper and elsewhere, but that he was anxious about what the Russian director might face first. \u201cI\u2019m fearing that it will be a bit of Russian grotesque with shades of Bulgakov,\u201d he said, referring to the Russian author of the satirical novel \u201cThe Master and Margarita.\u201d\n\nThe investigation against Mr. Serebrennikov began in May 2017. Prosecutors have so far presented little to support their claims, and they have dismissed striking evidence against them \u2014 multiple newspaper reviews, for instance, of a show they say was never staged. Mr. Serebrennikov has repeatedly protested innocence, most recently on Feb. 21.\n\nAt home and abroad, the outpouring of support for the director has been enormous. A Change.org petition initiated by Thomas Ostermeier, artistic director of the Schaub\u00fchne (another Berlin theater where the Gogol Center has performed in the past) has garnered more than 50,000 signatures. Among the most prominent artists lending their support are the actress Cate Blanchett, the filmmaker Lars von Trier and the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Elfriede Jelinek.\n\nAt a news conference at the Deutsches Theater on Monday, Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s assistant, Anna Shalashova, urged the assembled journalists to read a campaigning website tracking the case. \u201cYou will see how Kafkaesque this whole trial is,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile expressing gratitude to the Deutsches Theater, whose collaboration also included a guest performance in Moscow this February, Ms. Shalashova said she doubted that the Gogol Center\u2019s visit to Germany would have much effect on Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s legal position. \u201cWe just hope to present good productions, to show them to a German audience and to enter into dialogue with them,\u201d she said, speaking in Russian with a German translator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince Mr. Serebrennikov\u2019s arrest, many have suggested that the director is being made an example of to discourage other Russian artists from voicing dissent in their work. Ms. Shalashova seemed to subscribe to this view. \u201cKirill is the emblematic figure of Russia\u2019s theatrical landscape,\u201d she said. \u201cBy now, he\u2019s Russia\u2019s most important director.

But with each fallen comrade, activists are left to ponder their own mortality and whether the many pressures of the movement contributed to the shortened lives of their colleagues.\n\nAlong with the long hours, constant confrontation and frequent heartbreak they experience, activists work for little or no pay and sometimes struggle for basic needs like food and shelter even as they push for societal change.\n\nAn essential part of activism these days, those on the front lines say, is ensuring that they and their comrades work through all the stress, whether it\u2019s with meditation, therapy or just taking breaks from the struggle.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more front and center than it ever was when I was coming up as a young organizer 20 years ago,\u201d Cat Brooks, an Oakland-based activist, said of self care.\n\nIn many ways, Ms. Garner\u2019s story represents the perils activism can inflict on a life.\n\nShe grew up poor in New York. Her father died a very public death in 2014, one she would witness through bystanders\u2019 videos of a police officer on Staten Island confronting her father on the street, putting him in a chokehold and tackling him to the ground. Mr. Garner lost consciousness and died after crying out in distress, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nMs. Garner\u2019s activism, like that of many new to a cause, was initially driven more by passion than polished ideas. She held weekly protests on Staten Island, demanding that the officers involved be punished. Yet she doubted that race played a role in her father\u2019s killing, she said in a CNN interview.\n\nIn late 2014, she connected with Reggie Harris, a political operative and activist, who helped her as she entered the world of activism. Ms. Garner read titles like \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d \u201cSlavery By Another Name\u201d and \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X.\u201d She developed an understanding of structural racism and how race was a factor in her father\u2019s death, Mr. Harris said.\n\nHe recalled a community meeting about three years ago in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where Ms. Garner spoke. She called out Staten Island Democrats, saying they were too scared to stand up for her father during an election, and she emphasized the importance of black voters banding together.\n\n\u201cFor me, that was a turning point,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cShe was picking out a very reasonable, attainable set of goals, instead of just saying, \u2018No justice, no peace.\u2019 \u201d", "title": "They Push.

But it wants to be uncomfortable as well.\u201d\n\nBilled as \u201can experiential entertainment,\u201d \u201cPrurience\u201d may be more discomfiting than Mr. Green initially bargained for. It arrives in the midst of a boom in immersive theater, when creators seem to be continually upping the ante on extreme premises, but also six months into the #MeToo moment, when questions of sex and power are dominating the conversation (and reports that Harvey Weinstein responded to sexual assault allegations by checking into a spalike rehab facility in the Arizona desert have drawn snorts of derision).\n\nPhoto\n\nThe script doesn\u2019t name-check #MeToo, or take a stand on the hotly debated matter of whether pornography addiction is real. (The program includes testimonials from experts on both sides.) But it does leave open the question of whether we are in a time of sexual enlightenment or moral panic.\n\n\u201cThe show is about this prurient attitude we have, this fear of sexuality,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about male power, and what it means to stand up to it.\u201d\n\nMr. Green, a rangy 49-year-old with flowing pale red hair and an intimacy-inspiring manner (used to creepy effect in the show), said he quit drinking a decade ago with help from Alcoholics Anonymous, and more recently attended another self-help group he declined to identify. But \u201cPrurience\u201d grew less out of personal questions than artistic ones.\n\nHe wanted to stage \u201cthe least theatrical thing ever,\u201d he said, with no set, no lighting, no formal seating. He thought about tackling modern dating and the possibilities opened up by apps like Tinder and Grindr, but after attending sex addiction groups for research, the idea of focusing on the meetings themselves clicked into place.\n\nMr. Green started researching porn and sex addiction on the internet, where he encountered a lot of what he described as alarmist commentary. Then he did extensive interviews with experts, with financial support from the Wellcome Trust, a charitable foundation that supports medical research as well as health-related work in the arts and humanities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

While both directors had their heads deep in research about addiction, sparks flew over their differences relating to both theater (more traditional and text-based for her; looser and more experiential for him) and porn.\n\nMs. Roughan, who is 28 and straight, described herself as taking \u201ca more hard-line, feminist\u201d view. \u201cI see most mainstream porn as essentially sexist and racist in its tropes,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cI also don\u2019t think you can watch something and not have it have an impact on reality.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Green, who is gay, is \u201cmuch more open-minded and sex-positive,\u201d she said. \u201cHe thinks you can watch pornography and not have it bleed into real life, or at least takes a more ambiguous, questioning point of view.\u201d\n\nSatirizing recovery programs, even shamelessly commercialized ones (Mr. Green\u2019s character keeps directing attention to a branded merchandise table), can be dicey territory. David Hare\u2019s 2000 play \u201cMy Zinc Bed,\u201d which suggested that self-help culture might be substituting one kind of addiction for another, was criticized by one critic (and A.A. veteran) as \u201cmisguided and malign.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cPrurience\u201d raises the same question, Mr. Green insists it\u2019s not about mocking self-help groups but about collectively exploring the transformative potential they and theater share.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very interested in theater as therapy,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a group, it should be a space where things shift and change.\u201d\n\nThe show also floats along on the fascination of guessing just who is, or isn\u2019t, in on the game. The night Caroline Cronson, the producer of Works & Process, saw it in London, an older woman stood up to give a riveting account of her first experiences with porn in rural Ireland in the 1950s, via a traveling library.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe she wasn\u2019t an actor,\u201d Ms. Cronson said.\n\nOccasionally, things have gotten out of control. Mr. Green had to shut down one woman, a repeat visitor, who started telling an extreme (and, he thinks, fictional) story about sexual abuse by her father. \u201cIt was getting really unsafe,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all the questions the show raises about consumption and addiction, Ms. Roughan and Mr. Green agree that it\u2019s just as much about the compulsion to tell stories, and the uncontrolled places they can lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSome nights you just feel like we\u2019ve made this extraordinary comedy,\u201d Ms. Roughan said. \u201cOther nights, it feels like we\u2019ve made this very intricate drama.\u201d", "title": "They Talk About Porn in This Show.

When they find out they owe taxes on their cryptocurrency trades, she said, \u201ca lot of people are kind of shocked.\u201d\n\nPart of what makes paying cryptocurrency taxes so difficult is that current I.R.S. rules treat cryptocurrency as property rather than currency. That means that every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else \u2014 whether you\u2019re cashing out Ether for dollars, trading Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency or using Ripple to buy a cup of coffee \u2014 you\u2019re creating a taxable event that must be separately recorded and accounted for.\n\nComplicating matters even more, the timing of last year\u2019s cryptocurrency boom made for some extra tax headaches. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1,500 percent last year, with most of the gains coming during the last two months of the year. High prices caused many traders to sell Bitcoin in 2017, in order to lock in their profits. But instead of cashing out into dollars, many traders put their 2017 profits into new cryptocurrency investments, most of which have lost money in this year\u2019s market slump. That decline has left some investors short of the funds they need to pay the taxes they owe on last year\u2019s gains.\n\nMs. Walter said she had seen clients with cryptocurrency gains as large as $400,000 who did not withhold taxes during the year and subsequently lost money trading. \u201cNow they\u2019re stuck with these huge tax bills, and they don\u2019t have the capital to pay it.\u201d\n\nFaced with such problems, some cryptocurrency traders have decided to avoid the issue entirely, by not declaring any cryptocurrency on their taxes and hoping for the best.

Replacing them with other options or scrapping them altogether can save money as well as the environment, since you\u2019re not spending on extraneous items or putting them into the ground.\n\nThe extent of how \u201cgreen\u201d a burial can be is up to the individual; the service can be as simple as wrapping the deceased in a cotton shroud before lowering them into the ground. The services can also become more complicated, involving a memorial ceremony and burial in a conservation park like Washington\u2019s Greenacres, where families can choose to plant a variety of plants, flowers and shrubs on the grave.\n\nThese aren\u2019t entirely new ideas \u2014 the funeral traditions of many religions, for example, are in line with these steps.\n\nWhy would I want one?\n\nDeath planning is a deeply personal and often unpleasant topic, so reasons for choosing one type of burial over another are as varied as you can imagine. But for many people who opt for a green burial, it can come down to cost, environmental impact and legacy.\n\nSince burial costs vary not just state to state but cemetery to cemetery, hybrid cemeteries \u2014 or those offering both conventional and green burials \u2014 offer a balanced look at the financial aspect of death. According to the Green Burial Council, a nonprofit that encourages environmentally sustainable death care, most hybrid cemeteries report that graves intended for green burial cost \u201cthe same or somewhat less\u201d than their conventional counterparts; after the costs of vaults, coffins and embalming are factored in, the savings a green burial offers are \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nThe reason others choose green burial is right in the name: It\u2019s environmentally friendly. Green burials do away with both the embalming chemicals and the extraneous cement, steel or other non-biodegradable materials conventional burials put into the earth, and lack the carbon footprint of cremation, which has been calculated to be the equivalent of a 500-mile car journey.\n\nPerhaps the most personal reason of all is one where the idea of green burial simply speaks to a person. They might find comfort in their body \u201creturning to nature,\u201d or want to take part in a conservation burial, where burial fees are also used to cover land protection, restoration and management. \u201cNot only does conservation burial help protect land, but the burial area becomes hallowed ground, restored to its natural condition and protected forever with a conservation easement,\u201d explains the Prairie Creek Conservation Cemetery. \u201cCitizens who support conservation are offered a more meaningful burial option with the certainty that protected land is the ultimate legacy to leave for future generations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut isn\u2019t embalming necessary?\n\nGenerally speaking, no. Embalming \u2014 the preservation of human remains for public display through the use of a chemical mixture that delays decomposition and makes the body \u201clook natural\u201d \u2014 is more of a cosmetic procedure than a public health safeguard.\n\n\u201cThe easy elimination in traditional funerals is embalming,\u201d said Amber Carvaly, a service director at California\u2019s Undertaking LA, referring to how to lessen a funeral\u2019s environmental impact.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost exhausting at this point to argue with people in the industry on whether it is good or bad,\u201d she said. \u201cYou took a body that would have decomposed naturally, you put chemicals in it and a huge part that is left out is that most of the chemicals don\u2019t stay in the body: They are flushed down the drain when they are let back out of the body\u2019s arterial system.\u201d\n\nStill, popular culture tends to reinforce the idea that embalming is a necessary step: Just about 48 percent of people are aware that embalming isn\u2019t needed for a cremation service, according to the N.F.D.A.\u2019s consumer survey.\n\nJeff Jorgenson, who owns Elemental Cremation and Burial in Washington, said forgoing embalming is a crucial part of green burials.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

You can also keep (or bring) the body home and cool it with fans, cooling blankets or open windows.\n\n\u201cTraditional funeral directors will frequently talk about how mom or dad won\u2019t look very good\u201d if the bodies aren\u2019t embalmed, Mr. Jorgenson said. Instead, he has found that families are thankful that his company doesn\u2019t perform embalming \u201cbecause it feels like there is more room for closure.\u201d\n\nCremation or burial?\n\nHere is what Americans put in the ground each year through traditional burials: 20 million feet of wood, 4.3 million gallons of embalming fluids, 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete, 17,000 tons of copper and bronze, and 64,500 tons of steel, according to the Green Burial Council.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGreen burials eliminate much of this waste by leaving out almost all of those materials; most bodies are simply wrapped in shrouds made from a biodegradable material like cotton and placed in the ground. And although cremations often have the reputation as being an eco-friendly option, they tend to have an outsize carbon footprint.\n\n(A third option, called alkaline hydrolysis or aquamation, in which water pressure accelerates the decomposition of soft tissues, uses less energy than cremation but is only legal in 14 states.)\n\nEach option has its pros and cons, and it\u2019s important to consider your situation. If you\u2019re attentive to your carbon footprint, cremation in your hometown might still be a better choice than using a green cemetery hours away, and certain funeral homes have ways to offset the environmental hit, like working with organizations on strategic reforestation processes, Mr. Jorgenson said.\n\nShould you go with cremation, there is one final factor to consider: What to do with the remains.\n\n\u201cEven scattering small amounts can be hazardous in a delicate environment such as an alpine environment or vernal pool,\u201d said Michelle Acciavatti of Ending Well, a service that guides families all over the country through their end-of-life options.\n\nInstead of scattering, try Let Your Love Grow, a product that turns ashes into plantable soil for a memorial flower or tree. Another option is Eternal Reefs, which hold cremated remains in an underwater cement ball and create new marine habitats for fish and other sea life.\n\nA \u2018green\u2019 burial by any other name\n\nWhile cremation is a straightforward option, a green burial encapsulates a wider range of decisions, from how to where. If there aren\u2019t green cemeteries where you live, there are still plenty of ways to minimize the burial process\u2019s environmental impact.\n\nSubstitute concrete vaults and toxic burial containers for coffins made with sustainably harvested wood and organic liners, and check if products or components were transported over long distances, which can increase the carbon footprint.\n\nYou also shouldn\u2019t feel limited by what a funeral home is selling you \u2014 by federal law, they\u2019re required to accept a coffin provided by the customer at no extra charge. Or skip the coffin altogether. A shroud made from organic, biodegradable cotton can be purchased through your funeral home or online, or even at the local fabric store.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA growing movement\n\nWhen it comes to green burials, funeral professionals say the biggest challenge is a lack of awareness and resources.\n\n\u201cThinking about the impact of disposition on the environment is a new idea,\u201d Ms. Acciavatti said. \u201cAnd, I would say the other big issue is access: Even though there are over 150 green cemeteries in the U.S. and Canada, there still aren\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nMs. Acciavatti and many others in the industry believe that educating the public as well as continuing to invest in green practices helps not just the environment, but humans, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always really rewarding when someone says, \u2018I\u2019d really like to return to the earth.\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I get to say, \u2018I can help you do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nInterested?

My relationship with my mechanical watches grounds me and pulls me out of this fast-paced and hectic world. Those few minutes of winding my watch in the morning are quite emotional and enjoyable and makes me feel like I\u2019m rewinding my own energy and giving myself a morning boost much in the same way as a double shot of espresso.\n\nSHAWN MEHTA, 22, member of the Belgian Watch Club, in Antwerp, Belgium\n\nThere isn\u2019t one concise reason why any one man or woman should begin a watch collection. This isn\u2019t like starting a 401(k) or taking your daily vitamins. Only begin one if you want to begin one \u2014 you really enjoy watches, want to learn more about watches or just enjoy the hunt. They can be really rewarding, honestly, from an emotional and social point of view, and occasionally, though not often, financially.\n\nBENJAMIN CLYMER, founder and chief executive, the watch website Hodinkee, in New York\n\nWhen you have a real passion for watchmaking, for the beauty and complexity of mechanical objects, you will get to a point where you will have this strong feeling to own the timepieces you always desired. One purchase leads automatically to the next one. Then I think you have to make the difference between accumulating objects and collecting. Collecting implies that there is common point between all your timepieces. It\u2019s like a quest to perfection. All your timepieces must be connected by age, material, complication, brand or any other specificity.\n\nALEXANDER FRIEDMAN, 40, co-founder of the online magazine Watchonista and co-founder of the Watches Network, a communications agency dedicated to watch brands, in Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nThe classiest element marking a milestone in each man\u2019s life is a watch. A simple graduation gift can escalate to becoming an acute passion. As a young boy, I was fascinated by the watches worn by my father and the unique mechanisms always had a positive impact on me. This infatuation has only amplified with time. This is the same impression watches leave most men with. Besides fixation and admiration, watches are a significant part of a great investment plan.\n\nOMAR AL HAJ, 35, founder of the online site Homebazar, in Dubai\n\n[MORE: Members of the RedBar watch clubs in New York and London offer their best tips for new collectors]\n\nHow do I begin?\n\nDepending on your age, your taste, your personal history, your profession and your budget, you will probably begin to feel drawn to one brand or type of watch.

Follow your heart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVANESSA CHICHA, 43, owner of the consulting company Iconeek, in Geneva\n\nI would suggest you \ufb01nd your comfort zone at \ufb01rst (in terms of complication), whether it be a tourbillon, chronograph or a simple three-hand watch. Thereafter, I would research endlessly until I found something that ticks all the boxes. The categories that are most important to me are movement/\ufb01nishing, wearability, aesthetics and the vision of the brand.\n\nMR. MEHTA of the Belgian Watch Club\n\nI love nothing more than the research and hunting period \u2014 where I try to find every piece of information on any given reference or example known to man. I do it through my own records that I\u2019ve accumulated after 10 years of world travel for watches with Hodinkee, my network of friends, auction houses, and old books and magazines. There are any number of websites out there writing about watches, even more Instagram pages, and the first thing to know is not all \u201cexperts\u201d are created equal.\n\nMR. CLYMER of Hodinkee\n\nVintage watches can be a little perplexing at first. People throw around reference numbers that sound like they\u2019re reciting a Fibonacci sequence and they debate minuscule details which sometimes aren\u2019t even visible to the naked eye. Vintage watches are a challenging category in collectibles, and that\u2019s precisely what attracts so many collectors. Start by gathering as much information about the watch you\u2019re personally interested in. Learn about the manufacturer\u2019s history, find out how many watches they produced, in which metals, with which dials. In other words, do your homework.\n\nARTHUR TOUCHOT, 29, head of digital and watch specialist, Phillips auction house, based in Geneva\n\nHow do I build a collection?\n\nIt is good to follow your passion but we also have to consider the ongoing market. For example, why should we buy a pocket watch today, if these items totally lost value over the time?\n\nMS. MONDANI of Mondani Web\n\nLook for themes that interest you, whether it be a particular brand, complication or feature. Learn as much as you can about that initially, then look at brands that might have that as a focus. Personally, I have a soft spot for titanium watches, I like that they\u2019re quite light (compared with steel) which makes them very comfortable on the wrist.\n\nSEAN LI, 48, editorial and business development director, Blackbird Watch Manual website\n\nThere\u2019s really no road map to this. What\u2019s important is that you pursue what interests you. Not trends and what 20 other people around you are buying.

I think your quest will have different stages over time. With patience you will find the exact watch you wish to add to your collection.\n\nMR. FRIEDMAN of Watchonista\n\nHow do I store my watches?\n\nA safe at home for your daily pieces and one at the bank for the rest of your collection. You can also loan pieces to museums; it will be a good way to transmit your passion to other people. For me, it\u2019s important to share \u2014 to share your passion, share your knowledge, share your love for watchmaking. From my point of view, if you leave all your pieces in the back of your safe, it\u2019s a pity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. GARDINETTI of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie\n\nYou can choose one or several solutions, such as having a personal safe, home security measures, a bank vault or free ports. Whatever your choice, make sure your watches are protected from water, humidity, dust and direct exposure to light. My advice: The best protection is discretion.\n\nMS. CHICHA of Iconeek\n\nOther important aspects?\n\nToo often we hear stories of a watch being stolen from having been left out in the open. Even worse is when the watch is not insured. Adding watches to a homeowner\u2019s policy is simple and in most cases not too costly; most insurers require just a certified appraisal from the dealer who sold the watch to you.\n\nLIAM WEE TAY, 58, chairman of the online sale site WatchBox, in Hong Kong\n\nYou should insure your collection. Ask for documents with insurance values or contact an independent watch expert to create a portfolio of your collection with detailed pictures, descriptions and estimates. Then proceed with your insurance company.\n\nMS. CHICHA of Iconeek\n\nUltimately, what I enjoy most about watch collecting is the emotional and intellectual rush I get from learning things that are not widely known and then the great reveal to my other collector friends. One of the great joys of collecting is really the people you will meet, and though there is always some mild competition among friends, the support from this group of people is really something very special and one that is not found in many other areas. Watch collecting is also a fun way to hone your critical mind and provides a nice vehicle to support international travel \u2013 above all else, it is a lot of fun. The minute it stops being fun, you should stop.\n\nMR. CLYMER of Hodinkee\n\nI used to keep and keep and keep. But maybe at this time of my life I would fancy some changes. Let\u2019s upgrade!\n\nMR. FRIEDMAN of Watchionista\n\nMost collectors will buy a watch because A) they don\u2019t have it B) they have one but in poorer condition or C) it\u2019s part of a family or set that they are trying to complete. And then there are those who buy watches just because they can. They collect to keep. They aren\u2019t so concerned with upgrading because they often start with the very best. Ultimately though, everyone is collecting to upgrade, because tastes change over time and new pieces become available. Every watch has its price, and sometimes that means starting over. One of the consignors from the Heuer Parade auction held last year sold most of his collection because he felt he had \u201cdone it.\u201d He had spent almost a decade finding Heuer chronographs from a specific era, and once he had them, he needed a new challenge. He is still collecting watches today, but from other manufacturers.\n\nMR. TOUCHOT of Phillips\n\nChances are the first 10 to 20 watches you end up buying will also be the first instances of watches that you flip. Collecting is a journey of learning after all. The more knowledge you amass, the more you discover about the world of watches and what you like about your watches. In turn, your collection evolves.\n\nMR. NAG of Revolution Media\n\nPersonally, I feel what one does with each watch depends on its history and mechanism. A vintage watch with different complications hard to find is definitely meant to be kept. On the other hand, the latest watches in the market are eligible to be changed if you feel there are better ones in the market. The simple strategy of selling a watch to fund a better one is acceptable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMR. AL HAJ of Homebazar\n\nWhat\u2019s the next big thing?\n\nWe are starting to see a resurgence in popularity of \u201ccontemporary vintage\u201d pieces. By this, I mean watches from the 1980s-1990s. Pieces from this era that stand out to us are IWC Pilots watches, Jaeger-LeCoultre Calendars, previous generation Lange models. Furthermore, ultraexclusive brands like F.P. Journe will be very desirable moving forward. They have seriously low production numbers and have already begun captivating collectors around the world.\n\nMR. TAY of WatchBox\n\nSteel sport watches from Rolex continue to be a smart option for parking your money, with the added benefit of being able to wear them out on the weekends (take the newest Daytona, for example, the MSRP of this watch is $12,400!).\n\nBLAKE BUETTNER, 34, director of watches, the e-commerce company StockX, in Detroit\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to say which model will be the next big thing, and it\u2019s very difficult to look past early Rolex Daytonas these days. However, it\u2019s a hard and fast rule that vintage watches that are original and well preserved today will have enduring value. We will almost certainly see the value of the most sought-after watches continue to appreciate as new collectors enter this field of collectibles.\n\nMR. TOUCHOT of Phillips\n\nI am not sure if there is anything left to be collected; it seems to me that every possible item is already being collected by someone.\n\nSABINE KEGEL, 56, international senior specialist and head of Christie\u2019s Geneva Watch Department", "title": "Thinking About a Watch Collection?

But for unknown reasons, in early 2017, mosquitoes with the virus began turning up in unexpected spots, including coastal areas.\n\nOfficials are now worried that the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which can also carry Zika, dengue and chikungunya, will pick up the virus. Aedes aegypti live close to the ground in cities and like feasting on humans, so if they become infected, it puts the population of major cities at high risk, Dr. Ryan said.\n\nThere\u2019s no specific treatment for yellow fever, just supportive care, Dr. Ryan said.\n\nEarly symptoms include fever, chills, headache, backache and muscle aches, according to the C.D.C.\n\nIn about 15 percent of victims, the virus reaches a fulminant form, which causes liver damage that turns the whites of the eyes yellow, hence its name, Dr. Ryan said. The liver is where clotting factors are made, so liver damage can causes blood-thinning which can trigger bleeding.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cI CAN\u2019T QUITE deal with it,\u201d says Marc Camille Chaimowicz, in considerable understatement, on moving from the London apartment he has spent the past 38 years living and making his art in. The flat is on the top floor of Hayes Court, a 19th-century red brick building in Camberwell, South London, an area long known for having successive waves of artists such as Frank Auerbach and Griselda Pollock. We are sitting in the kitchen, which is filled with appliances from when he first moved in: the 1970s. That was also the era in which Chaimowicz, who is about to have his first solo museum exhibition in the U.S., at the Jewish Museum in New York, began creating his distinct body of cross-disciplinary work, which explores ideas of domestic life through fully realized life-size room installations that he fills with furniture, ceramics, collages, wallpaper, textiles and sculptures, many of which are his own design.\n\nThe influence of Chaimowicz\u2019s work is hard to pinpoint, but everyone familiar with his art agrees that it is substantial. Is it his imagined rooms, so evocatively furnished as to suggest a story? Or his classic drawings, suggestive of abstracted body parts or fractured parentheses that appear on everything from wallpaper to murals to fabric? His persistently joyous sense of color? Most likely, it\u2019s Chaimowicz\u2019s anarchic lack of distinction between public art and private life that makes him a pioneer and also an enigma. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s being directly copied by other artists,\u201d says the British contemporary-art writer Louisa Buck. \u201cBut more that Chaimowicz has made a broad swath of practice permissible.\u201d In the post-Pop world of his early career, the idea of calling a lampshade a work of art was sacrilegious; colors such as pastel pink or eau de nil \u2014 signature Chaimowicz hues \u2014 were anathema. Now, the hierarchies between art and ornament have dissolved, and Chaimowicz has emerged, in Buck\u2019s estimation, \u201cas a presiding force over a growing group of artists who are unashamedly playing with d\u00e9cor and environments,\u201d Karen Kilimnik and Lucy McKenzie among them. His 2016 show at the Serpentine Gallery in London encapsulated both the singularity of the artist\u2019s aesthetic and the diversity of his vision: three rooms, each appointed with his colorful retro-futuristic furniture, dreamlike illustrated wallpapers and abstract sculptures made from repurposed items such as vases or jugs or chairs. \u201cChaimowicz has suddenly become an urgent artist in the age of the internet, as boundaries become more porous,\u201d says the Serpentine\u2019s artistic director Hans Ulrich Obrist. Kelly Taxter, curator of the Jewish Museum show, suggests he\u2019s particularly interesting now \u201cbecause the work is in one sense very esoteric and abstract, but it\u2019s also totally approachable. Everyone recognizes a chair and understands wallpaper. So there\u2019s an immediate understanding of his art, coupled with the layers of poetry behind it.\u201d\n\nAll of these layers \u2014 the everyday and the intellectual, the romantic and the rigorous, the domestic and the dramatic \u2014 are present in both the home he is leaving behind and his new one, located just over a mile away in Vauxhall, in a 12-sided free-standing brick-and-concrete building commissioned by Cabinet, the London gallery that represents Chaimowicz as well as Ed Atkins and Lucie Stahl. Designed by the British firm Trevor Horne Architects in collaboration with Cabinet\u2019s artists, the structure\u2019s three lowermost floors serve as the gallery\u2019s showspace; above are two floors of residential apartments, including Chaimowicz\u2019s. He\u2019s contributed to the building\u2019s facade, designing its large, jaggedly geometric windows, set in natural oak frames, an indication of Chaimowicz\u2019s innate inclination to live among his art pieces. Unsurprisingly, the interiors of both the Hayes Court and Cabinet flats keenly resemble his work. Each is constructed almost entirely from his imagination, from the lamps to the drapes to the wallpaper. As more than one curator who has worked with Chaimowicz has pointed out, his installations are Gesamtkunstwerk, or \u201ctotal work of art,\u201d and in Taxter\u2019s view they align the interior of the home with \u201cthe psychological and interior life of the artist.\u201d", "title": "This Artist\u2019s House Is Not a Home", "authors": []}

Despite extensive deforestation, the Atlantic Forest is one of Earth\u2019s great cradles of biological diversity.

The variety of hummingbirds makes it difficult to isolate specific noises without sophisticated listening or recording devices.\n\nIn 2015, Dr. Mello returned to the forest with microphones used to record high-frequency bat noises. The recordings he made confirmed that the calls were coming from black jacobin hummingbirds. The species is found in other parts of South America, too, and researchers are unsure whether the sound is emitted by males, females or both, although they have confirmed that juvenile black jacobins do not make them.\n\nWhen Dr. Mello and his team analyzed the noise \u2014 a triplet of syllables produced in rapid succession \u2014 they discovered it was well above the normal hearing range of birds.

On a computer monitor was a document opened to draft No. 78 of \u201cCleo.\u201d He was preparing for the play\u2019s September debut. Then Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in late August and damaged the Alley, prompting the delay.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn those seven months, Mr. Wright wrote nine more drafts, all while serving as an executive producer for the new Hulu series based on \u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d and completing a new book on Texas politics. \u201cCleo\u201d is now a drastically different play than it was when Mr. Wright conceived it, yet the theme remains the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in some ways a disquisition on love, and how dangerous it is, and yet how essential,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cWe\u2019re condemned to have this riotous, unsettling element in our natures and we don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInitially, Mr. Wright had focused on the affair between Joseph Mankiewicz, the movie\u2019s director and co-writer, and Rosemary Matthews, the script supervisor. He was intrigued with the intertwined destructive relationships at play on the set: from Antony and Cleopatra, whose relationship shook empires; to Burton and Taylor, whose relationship ripped apart their marriages and ignited the gossip pages; to that more prosaic boss-subordinate romance.\n\nChange came when Mr. Balaban got involved about seven years ago. He had met Taylor a few times through the actress Maureen Stapleton, and persuaded Mr. Wright to redirect the emphasis to her and Burton, the obvious stars of the show.\n\nThe script still does feature Mankiewicz, an Oscar-winning filmmaker who became overwhelmed with the enormity of the movie, a budget-buster that threatened to bankrupt Fox. Also in supporting roles: Eddie Fisher, the singer and actor who was Taylor\u2019s husband \u2014 her fourth \u2014 at the time, and Rex Harrison, the actor playing Caesar, whose ego took a toll as his role diminished in the growing shadow of Burton\u2019s Mark Antony.\n\nThe actors Lisa Birnbaum and Richard Short portray Taylor and Burton. They were cast, Mr. Balaban said, for their ability to embody both tragedy and comedy, and because they resembled their characters without ever appearing to do impressions of them.\n\nThe play starts with Burton arriving drunk to the set, in Rome, to replace the actor Stephen Boyd, who was no longer available after production delays. The idea of using Burton came from Fisher, who unwittingly invited a snake into his own den, according to Mr. Wright.\n\nBurton and Taylor couldn\u2019t keep their cravings secret and the nascent paparazzi captured every blatant minute of their sunbathing and petting.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere was outrage,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cNobody had ever seen this kind of thing happening in public before. The tabloids were full of \u2018homewrecker.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe pope condemned the couple, and a congresswoman from Georgia proposed prohibiting Taylor, a naturalized U.S. citizen, from returning after filming. Fidelity was a tightly held American value, yet the pair persisted in flagrant defiance and, in Mr. Wright\u2019s estimation, helped to spark the sexual revolution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Richard Burton Diaries,\u201d published in 2012, was crucial to understanding not only the dynamic between Burton and Taylor but also Burton\u2019s light and dark sides.

Mr. Wright is not, however, new to theater.

In 2013, he began working for Judah Smith, who became well known after taking over the leadership of Churchome in 2009, a megachurch started by Mr. Smith\u2019s father, Wendell.

Mr. Veach was there when Mr. Bieber performed at the Stade De Suisse Wankdorf in Bern, Switzerland. After the show, they drove a couple of hours to Mr. Bieber\u2019s hotel. He posted a video of them singing in his room, while Mr. Smith howled in pain in the background. He was getting a tattoo.\n\nThis was not a frivolous gesture.

A church should also have a catchy logo or catchphrase that can be stamped onto merchandise and branded \u2014 socks, knit hats, shoes and sweatshirts. (An online pop-up shop on Memorial Day sold $10,000 in merchandise its first hour, Mr. Veach said.)

And \u201cLean on Pete,\u201d opening Friday, April 6, in New York and Los Angeles, starts out as just that: the tale of two misfits.

But when Charley learns that Pete is headed for slaughter, he and his newfound companion make a run for it through the American frontier on a quest for a place to call home.

To the left is a wild storm-soaked tangle of old trees and dense vegetation; to the right, far below, a flat terrain of treeless, square-cut fields running back to distant hills scarred by clear-cutting. The wilderness looks unkept and threatening, but seethes with life. The flat land, though cultivated and presumably fertile, feels as bare and bland as a tract-house town. And in the foreground of the picture is a tiny self-portrait of Cole at his easel. He turns away from his canvas and looks right at us, as if to say: Here are the alternatives; you choose.\n\nCole chose wilderness, and in doing so disappeared himself for more than a century. When he died suddenly, at 47, in 1848, he was widely mourned; pictorial tributes from fellow artists piled up, the most famous being Asher Brown Durand\u2019s 1849 \u201cKindred Spirits,\u201d which shows Cole and the nature-poet William Cullen Bryant sharing thoughts in a paradisal Catskill Mountain glen. (The picture is back in town for the first time since it was sold by the New York Public Library to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas in 2005.)\n\nYet within a few years, Cole was all but forgotten. And the colonizing of Nature he so hated \u2014 hyped as Manifest Destiny \u2014 was being cheered on by artists who claimed to revere him, Durand among them.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolitically, Cole\u2019s art is conservative, but it\u2019s also work that challenges and complicates that term.

It details the lifestyles and health of tens of thousands of American men and women.\n\nSince 2002, some of the participants in N.H.A.N.E.S. have worn accelerometers to precisely track how much and when they move throughout the day.\n\nFor the new study, which was published this month in the Journal of the American Heart Association, the scientists chose data about 4,840 men and women past the age of 40 who had worn activity trackers.\n\nUsing the accelerometer readouts, the scientists determined how many minutes per day, in total, each person had spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. They defined moderate activity as, in essence, brisk walking, and vigorous activity, which was rare, as workouts similar to jogging.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers also looked at how long each session of physical activity had continued. If a single session went on for more than five minutes, it was considered to be a \u201cbout\u201d of exercise. If it were shorter than five minutes, it was considered to be sporadic physical activity, such as walking down the hallway or up a brief flight of stairs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The men and women who were the least physically active, exercising moderately for fewer than 20 minutes a day, were at the highest risk of premature death.\n\nThose who moved more often, especially if they managed about an hour in total of physical activity over the course of the day, cut their mortality risk in half, the researchers found.\n\nAnd it did not matter how they accumulated those minutes. If people walked continuously for five minutes or longer, meaning in exercise bouts, they lowered their risk of dying young.\n\nBut they gained the same benefit if they walked sporadically in short but repeated spurts, as long as they moved often.\n\n\u201cThe message is that all physical activity counts,\u201d says Dr. William Kraus, a professor at Duke University who conducted the study with researchers from the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\u201cThe little things that people do every day,\u201d like walking from their cars to the office or climbing a flight of stairs, \u201ccan and do add up and affect the risk for disease and death,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, this was an epidemiological study, meaning that it can show only that more physical activity is associated with a longer life, not that it directly causes people to live longer.\n\nThe study was also short, in terms of how long it followed people.\n\nBut the results, which will be considered as scientists and experts plan changes later this year to the formal exercise guidelines, are encouraging, Dr. Kraus says.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t go for a long walk,\u201d he says, \u201ca few short walks are likely to be just as good for you.\u201d", "title": "Those 2-Minute Walk Breaks?

The district is in the state\u2019s steel and coal belt, including suburbs of Pittsburgh. By threatening the tariffs, Mr. Trump is hoping to swing enough votes to keep the district in his party\u2019s hands and avoid another humiliating off-cycle loss. Why aluminum? Alcoa is based in Pittsburgh.\n\nKey is that Mr. Trump is merely threatening the tariffs but hasn\u2019t enacted them. Late next week, after the votes are counted, he is highly likely to allow himself to be persuaded by his political allies to defer the tariffs indefinitely.\n\nTo rational people, it might make no sense to roil the stock market and upset our trading partners just to sway a few votes in southwestern Pennsylvania, but it\u2019s exactly the sort of narrow, petty con that has typified Mr. Trump\u2019s career and at which he excels.\n\nEDWARD GOODMAN\n\nWATERTOWN, CONN.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs an economist, I have no idea what it would look like for the United States to \u201cwin\u201d a trade war, and I\u2019ll bet a fair sum that President Trump doesn\u2019t either.

Unless it took steps to protect the watershed surrounding its reservoirs, the city would need to build a water treatment plant. Rather than spend upward of $10 billion on the plant, it spent less than $4 billion protecting and restoring the watershed.\n\nThese and other stories \u2014 of cities conserving and reusing water, farmers engaging in \u201cconservation agriculture,\u201d and a dam-removal movement that is restoring thousands of miles of free-flowing rivers \u2014 give substance to the idea of replenishing.\n\nTHE SOURCE\n\nHow Rivers Made America and America Remade Its Rivers\n\nBy Martin Doyle\n\n349 pp. Norton. $26.95.\n\nPhoto\n\nDoyle\u2019s book tells the story of how rivers have shaped the United States from its founding, when cities were located astride rivers that served as transportation arteries for goods to move up- and downstream. As the new nation added lands, the federal government began to play an essential role in regulating rivers that crossed state boundaries, building dams for flood control and water supply, and overseeing the hydroelectric power they provided.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, environmental concerns prompted all levels of government to change course. Most notably, the Army Corps of Engineers, which has done more to straighten and confine rivers than any agency in the history of the world, remade itself into a force for restoring meanders in rivers, guarding endangered species and protecting wetlands.\n\nDoyle grafts his original ideas and research onto a big argument that doesn\u2019t quite hold up. To be sure, rivers shaped American society. But the federal government\u2019s authority, under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution and the 16th Amendment\u2019s power to generate revenue for federal projects, affected far more than rivers. It\u2019s a stretch to claim that the \u201cwhole economic history of the United States\u201d is the story of determining which level of government would provide water. Other economic historians place substantially more emphasis on railroads and the Interstate Highway System, for instance.\n\nStill, Doyle\u2019s historical perspective offers a poignant account of how financing the country\u2019s water and wastewater systems began at the local level, moved to the federal level, then, following the Reagan Revolution and the pulling back of federal funds, brought us to our current situation.

But perhaps its most fertile relationship in recent years has been with the Dutch husband-and-wife team of Stefan Scholten and Carole Baijings, both in their mid-40s, whose eponymous Amsterdam studio has designed fabrics for Maharam that speak to their love of soft yet bright colors, such as azure blue and cotton-candy pink, as well as grid-based patterns.\n\nImage Clockwise from top left: an antique darning sampler that inspired their designs for Maharam\u2019s upcoming fabric range; a mug from Maharam\u2019s first foray into housewares; dishware from the collection. Credit Courtesy of Scholten & Baijings\n\nNow, the couple and Maharam are uniting to introduce a line of housewares and accessories created in collaboration with several Japanese craftsmen. There is a stackable wooden stool manufactured by Karimoku New Standard, its seat upholstered in a variety of Maharam fabrics (three of them by Scholten & Baijings) and a five-piece collection of colorful, geometric porcelain dishware produced by the Japanese ceramics company 1616 / Arita Japan. \u201cConnecting Maharam with the level of work you find in Japan was incredibly satisfying,\u201d Scholten says.\n\nYet even as Maharam makes its first foray into housewares, the brand isn\u2019t neglecting its roots. Mary Murphy, the company\u2019s top design executive, recently introduced Scholten & Baijings to a bygone craft from Holland that was unfamiliar to them: composition paper-size patchwork darning samplers made by young girls in the 18th and 19th centuries, each featuring a dozen or so colorful, complicated stitch patterns originally intended to mend clothes. Scholten & Baijings, always ready to embrace a new idea (however old), reinterpreted these embroidered motifs for Maharam\u2019s latest textile range, to be released in July, elevating the homespun look with Mondrian-like flair.", "title": "Three Venerated Design Companies Look Back to Move Forward", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Taken together, these three books tell an alarming story about how difficult it is for women to access quality care; particularly those women suffering from poorly understood autoimmune disorders.\n\nThis is hardly breaking news. One member of the feminist collective that produced the 1971 women\u2019s health manual \u201cOur Bodies, Ourselves\u201d said that \u201ceveryone had a \u2018doctor story\u2019\u2014that is, a tale about male physicians who were sexist, paternalistic, judgmental or simply unable to provide the information women needed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThese new \u201cdoctor stories\u201d cut deep, especially in a moment when \u201cbelieve women\u201d has become a rallying cry. They feel linked to other instances of women\u2019s voices being suppressed and belittled \u2014 in the accounts of assault and harassment emerging in the #MeToo moment, for example, or in the recent studies showing how frequently men interrupt women in meetings and how rarely women are quoted as experts. This is a crisis of authority, Dusenbery argues. Women are regarded as unreliable narrators who can\u2019t even be trusted to speak for themselves or to testify to their own pain.\n\nIn \u201cDoing Harm,\u201d this cultural distrust of women \u2014 ancient and ingrained \u2014 is shown to govern quality of care at every stage of treatment. Women with abdominal pain wait in emergency rooms for 65 minutes compared with 49 minutes for men , and young women are seven times more likely to be sent home from a hospital while in the middle of a heart attack. Doctors rarely communicate (or understand) how drugs from aspirin to antidepressants affect women and men differently. Autoimmune disorders have been understudied because, as Hirsch points out, three-fourths of the patients are women and it is considered a woman\u2019s ailment, never mind that 37 million people are afflicted, as estimated by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association. (In comparison, 15 million Americans have cancer.)\n\nWomen are consistently undertreated for pain, as one influential paper showed: Male patients are given pain relief while women, who are more likely to have their pain rated as \u201cemotional,\u201d are given sedatives. This also extends to children; a study of postoperative pain management found that boys were more likely to receive codeine and girls the gentler acetaminophen.\n\nFor women of color, especially black women, the situation is even more parlous. Black patients are 22 times less likely to get any kind of pain relief in emergency rooms. And Dusenbery reports on a disturbing 2016 study of more than 200 medical students who were presented absurd, made-up statements on race and medicine. Half gave credence to statements like: Black people have less sensitive nerve endings than white people.\n\nPhoto\n\nAddressing such entrenched inequities requires more than bringing more women doctors into the fold. As Norman learns the hard way in \u201cAsk Me About My Uterus,\u201d women doctors are not immune from implicit bias. Nor will a greater number of women doctors make up for the fact that, to this day, men are the default objects of study for research. A 2005 study found that almost 80 percent of animal pain studies used only males. A 1986 study on the influence of obesity on breast and uterine cancer infamously failed to enroll any women in the study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to Virginia Woolf, writing about the sick body (\u201cthis monster,\u201d \u201cthis miracle\u201d) requires the courage of a lion tamer and the spirit of a philosopher.\n\nNot all these books meet that exalted standard. But all three, despite their grim stories and projections, leave the reader galvanized, not despairing. Each of them ends on a similar note \u2014 calling for women to keep sharing their \u201cdoctor stories,\u201d keep putting pressure on medical professionals to study women\u2019s health and, in the meantime, for women themselves to learn how to advocate for their own care. Even as they recognize the burden that sick women must carry (Dusenbery: \u201cWomen should not be required to be more knowledgeable about women\u2019s health than their doctors are\u201d), they are each, in their own flawed, complicated way, the very intervention they seek.", "title": "Three Views of the Crisis in Women\u2019s Health", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal", "Books Of The Times"]}

Panama City was then awash with international investors and a booming economy, earning it the nickname \u201cDubai of Latin America.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlan Garten, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief legal officer, said President Trump had no role in the current dispute. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with the president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is purely a commercial dispute,\u201d adding that \u201cIt is simply getting more attention, obviously.\u201d\n\nAll indications point to business, not politics, as the source of the tensions, and at any other moment, the Trump Organization and its army of lawyers might have relished this sort of pitched battle.\n\n\n\nBut the Panamanian misadventure has become the family business\u2019s biggest headache at a time when its founder is in the White House and every move and woe is magnified across the planet. The business is also showing other signs of receding: The Trump Organization last year agreed to buyout deals that removed the Trump name from once-prized properties in New York and Toronto.\n\nWith those stresses and strains, the company is reluctant to walk away from the Panama property and possibly invite other partners to challenge their agreements, according to people close to the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Trumps also believe that the law is on their side, according to their lawyers, who argue that their management agreement prevents Mr. Fintiklis from terminating the contract without an arbitrator\u2019s order. The contract to manage the hotel extends through 2031, and the Trumps say they want to stand behind their employees, several of whom Mr. Fintiklis has sought to fire, for the duration of the deal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dispute comes as the Trumps\u2019 property \u2014 like many Panamanian hotels \u2014 is struggling.\n\nThe hotel lost over $1 million last year, according to the hotel\u2019s confidential financial documents reviewed by The Times, after turning a gross operating profit of more than $800,000 in 2016. (The results are unaudited and may improve somewhat once they are finalized.)\n\nMr. Fintiklis, 39, declined to comment, but he has made several notable \u2014 and provocative \u2014 appearances at the hotel in recent days. On one evening, following a verbal confrontation with Trump employees, he and his entourage of about a dozen people retired to the lobby and had pizza delivered from a restaurant on the property. Then Mr. Fintiklis played music from \u201cZorba the Greek\u201d on the lobby\u2019s baby grand piano while his friends sang along.\n\nBorn in Cyprus, Mr. Fintiklis served as an officer in the country\u2019s military before studying law at Oxford University. He now lives in South Florida and runs his own investment firm, Ithaca Capital Partners.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very smart individual, and he worked with us for 10 years so he\u2019s very well trained,\u201d said Pierre Charalambides, a co-founder of Dolphin Capital Partners, a real estate private equity firm where Mr. Fintiklis previously worked. \u201cThis battle with Trump, it fits him perfectly.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Fintiklis agreed to buy 202 of the hotel\u2019s 369 units for about $25 million, making him the controlling owner of the hotel. The 70-story tower also includes a casino and a separate condominium development, which are not part of the dispute between the Trumps and Mr. Fintiklis.\n\nThe Trumps say they blessed the transaction, on the condition that Mr. Fintiklis not interfere with their management of the hotel.\n\nWhen the purchase was finalized in August, the Trump-Fintiklis partnership initially seemed promising. Mr. Fintiklis hailed the hotel as \u201can iconic property\u201d and said he looked forward to working with the Trumps.\n\nBut soon after closing on the purchase, he tried to remove them.\n\nHis campaign began in earnest in October. He arranged for the hotel\u2019s unit owners to meet \u2014 the Trumps say he falsely portrayed the session as a \u201cmeet and greet\u201d \u2014 and they voted to declare the Trumps in default of their management agreement. The dispute soon spilled into the legal system, with Mr. Fintiklis seeking arbitration to remove the Trumps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trumps say that the rapid-fire nature of Mr. Fintiklis\u2019s legal efforts show that he never intended to cooperate, and that he had been planning an attack from the get-go.\n\n\u201cWe just want to run the hotel peacefully, and without interference,\u201d said Mr. Garten, the Trump Organization lawyer. \u201cBut I look forward to litigating this, and have no doubt we will prevail.\u201d\n\nThe president continues to own the company through a trust but has turned over day-to-day management to his eldest sons, Donald Jr. and Eric.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore than a decade ago \u2014 long before Mr. Fintiklis came into the picture \u2014 the Trumps began their foray into Panama when they teamed up with the developer Roger Khafif and his firm, Newland International Properties, as well as another partner.\n\nNewland signed an agreement with the Trump Organization, which would brand and manage the property. In a 2007 bond offering, Newland said the Trump name would be a boon to the project: \u201cWe benefit from the international prestige and name recognition associated with the Trump brand name.\u201d\n\nThe project united the Trumps with influential political figures, including Ricardo Martinelli, the president of Panama at the time. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend. Great honor,\u201d Mr. Trump said to the president at the grand opening in July 2011.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He is currently in the Federal Detention Center in Miami, fighting extradition.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the project encountered financial difficulties during the development phase. Newland defaulted on its debt soon after the building opened and later filed for bankruptcy.\n\nWhen Mr. Fintiklis became majority owner last year, the hotel was struggling, a fact he soon blamed on the Trumps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithering in his criticism, he said in one court filing that \u201cabysmal management\u201d of the hotel, along with \u201cmaterial breaches\u201d of its management contract and fiduciary duties, had \u201cdramatically\u201d driven down profits and the condition of the building. \u201cThe hotel has been virtually empty,\u201d the filing said, a claim the Trumps dispute.\n\nThe Trump Organization declined to reveal the hotel\u2019s occupancy rates, but in a letter to hotel unit owners, the company argued that the hotel \u201ccontinues to outperform the market by a wide margin,\u201d despite a weakening hotel market in Panama. The Trumps say that Mr. Fintiklis was aware of the hotel\u2019s performance, and the broader hotel market woes, when he signed the deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nA hotel building boom over the past decade has tripled the number of hotel rooms in the country, according to Armando Rodr\u00edguez, president of the Panamanian Hotel Association. During the same period, however, occupancy rates have steadily fallen \u2014 to about 47 percent last year from about double that rate in 2008, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nAlgerd Monstavicius, who bought one of the hotel\u2019s penthouses as an investment in 2007, four years before the building opened, said he had seen revenues from his unit plummet in the past year. He attributes the falloff in part to President Trump\u2019s hard-line stance on immigration and antipathy toward him across much of Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe perception is: Trump is anti-Latino,\u201d said Mr. Monstavicius, 78, a retired pathologist living in Incline Village, Nev. \u201cAnd that\u2019s reflected in the occupancy.\u201d\n\nLawyers and executives from both sides of the dispute said the Panamanian government, at least so far, appeared to be showing no favoritism in either direction. At various times during the past week, delegations of government investigators and ministry officials, often accompanied by armed security forces, have spilled from the elevators into the hotel\u2019s elegant sky lobby, as perplexed hotel guests looked on.\n\nAs if the standoff were not bizarre enough, a number of apparent coincidences embellish the tale even further.\n\nFor one, Dolphin Capital Partners, where Mr. Fintiklis worked for 10 years, was founded in 2004 by a pair of investors who once worked at George Soros\u2019s real estate investment arm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr. Soros, a huge Democratic donor and critic of President Trump, played any role in the turmoil here, or that partisan American politics are a factor in the effort to remove the Trumps. Mr. Charalambides, the Dolphin co-founder, said his firm had no current business connection to Mr. Soros.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Fintiklis\u2019s New York lawyers operate out of 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the financially troubled office tower owned by the family of Jared Kushner, President Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser.\n\nAnd Mr. Fintiklis filed the registration papers for his company, Ithaca Capital Partners, in Delaware on Nov. 9, 2016 \u2014 the day after President Trump won the election.", "title": "Thugs, Leeches, Shouting and Shoving at Trump Hotel in Panama", "authors": ["Kirk Semple", "Ben Protess", "Steve Eder"]}

It hardly mattered that Mr. Woods had not appeared in a tournament in 13 months.\n\nPhoto\n\nAngel Ilagan, Bridgestone Golf\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview that the company had sent 12 dozen balls to Mr. Woods, hoping he would attach his name and endorsement to the product, which he eventually did, signing a multi-year contract in December of that year\n\n\u201cWe know Tiger\u2019s brand strength,\u201d Mr. Ilagan said. \u201cWhether he does play or not doesn\u2019t really matter. That\u2019s just icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nWith Mr. Woods apparently close to his previous form \u2014 he is the betting favorite to win his fifth green jacket at the Masters \u2014 that icing is already tasting sweet. Already in 2018, Bridgestone\u2019s sales of golf balls have increased 115 percent over the same period a year ago. Mr. Ilagan attributed that to Mr. Woods; Bridgestone has already begun to market a Woods edition golf ball, which it introduced on Wednesday.\n\nTaylorMade, which signed Mr. Woods to use its clubs in January last year, said it saw no need to build a marketing campaign around the star, because the mere fact that he plays with the clubs or talks about their performance in interviews does the selling job.\n\n\u201cWhen Tiger says something, the world takes notice,\u201d David Abeles, the company\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s true. We\u2019re excited just when he talks in his own words.\u201d\n\nMr. Ilagan suggested that Mr. Woods\u2019s rebound from the dramatic turn his career took in 2009 had made him more relatable and perhaps likable for fans. \u201cHis absence showed what was missing when he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Mr. Ilagan said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMartin Buckley, global vice president and general manager of Nike Golf, which sells a full line of Woods-branded clothing, including shoes, shirts and sweaters, said that fans would be seeing a lot more of him in Nike advertisements this summer.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a unique, integral part of the Nike family,\u201d Mr. Buckley wrote in an email, \u201cand we don\u2019t see that changing any time soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while performance brands remain aligned with Mr. Woods, more mainstream companies have not yet jumped back on the bandwagon. Peter Land, a partner at Finsbury, the strategic communications firm, suspects a reason could be that Mr. Woods likely alienated women when news about his extramarital affairs surfaced.\n\n\u201cBrands with a strong female stakeholder base will continue to be a struggle for Tiger,\u201d said Mr. Land, who was with PepsiCo when Gatorade, which PepsiCo owns, decided to drop Mr. Woods. \u201cThere are so many other successful and charismatic global athletes to partner with \u2014 and they come with a lower risk profile.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The golfer with 14 major championships has proved repeatedly throughout his career that it is never safe to count him out.\n\n\u201cI think people in this country are very quick to forgive and forget,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cThey want to give people the benefit of the doubt and a second chance.

After his first-hole introduction, Spieth, who wore a winter beanie to ward off the 48-degree morning chill, tipped an imaginary bill to the throng of fans surrounding the tee box.\n\nAfter two solid shots, Spieth missed his six-foot birdie putt, capsulizing his recent putting woes. He said his struggles \u201cwere all about my own game.\u201d\n\nStill, it was hard to ignore the frenzy surrounding Woods, which at times made Stenson and Spieth seem invisible in plain sight. Woods said he was unaware that he ever had the lead to himself, because he never saw a leader board until he walked off his last green after his bogey. His focus was so fine-tuned that he didn\u2019t hear the running commentary of all the amateur analysts and play-by-play announcers in the gallery.\n\nThe crowd following the threesome had the size and timbre of a major championship Sunday. The volunteers at many holes became so caught up in watching Woods that they neglected to marshal the fans, who spilled inside the ropes and staked out spots behind tee boxes or within a few feet of the players so they could take sharper photographs with their smartphones.\n\n\u201cHe just has an extra following so the roars are a little louder,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly an energy about the gallery that you don\u2019t have anywhere else.\u201d\n\nSpieth, 24, is part of the generation that was inspired to take up golf by Woods\u2019s dominance. To this point, he and his peers have known Woods mostly as a mentor. At last year\u2019s Presidents Cup, Spieth was one of the players Woods oversaw as an assistant captain for the United States team.\n\nSnedeker, 37, who is old enough to have squared off against Woods when he was winning regularly, said of the younger Americans, \u201cI think it will be harder for them because they only know Tiger as a friend, and they don\u2019t know Tiger as the \u2018cut your head off on 18 and make that putt to win the tournament\u2019 kind of guy.\u201d\n\nCasey, 40, remembers that Woods well and was thrilled to be tied with him with 36 holes left.\n\n\u201cI want him to play brilliant golf, want him to win again because I want these kids to see what we dealt with for a long, long time,\u201d Casey said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this in a nasty way.

But Mr. Kushner\u2019s continued efforts to serve as the administration\u2019s intermediary in crucial foreign relations have undercut Mr. Tillerson\u2019s authority.\n\nMr. Tillerson is out of Washington just as South Korean officials fly in to brief their American counterparts about their talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un.

A 2014 study of college tennis players determined that grunting could indeed increase the power of players\u2019 groundstrokes and serves. And a study from 2010 found that such sounds can be distracting for others. In that study, participants watched videos of a tennis player striking the ball while a loud, grunt-like yell played or did not. The viewers pressed keys to indicate their snap judgments about which side of the court, right or left, the ball was heading toward. When the stroke coincided with the noise, the viewers were noticeably slower and more inaccurate in their picks.\n\nBut those studies could not determine whether the usefulness of grunting was confined only to tennis or how the ballistic squawks were affecting onlookers and opponents. Were the screams masking the sound of the racket striking the ball, making it difficult for people to judge the right trajectories? Or were the sounds more directly distracting people, drawing their attention away from the onrushing ball and befuddling their reactions?\n\nTo learn more, some of the same scientists decided, for the new experiment, which was published last month in PLOS One, to look closely at mixed martial arts and grunting.\n\nThey chose that sport for several reasons, the first being that, like tennis, it demands sudden, explosive movements, meaning punches and kicks, to which grunting conceivably could add power.\n\nPerhaps even more important, martial arts moves do not involve inherent noise, unlike the ping of a tennis racket meeting a ball. So if an onlooker proved to be worse at judging a fast-approaching kick when someone grunted, it would be because the yell had directly confused the watcher, not because it had masked some other noise.", "title": "To Boost Sports Performance (and Annoy Your Opponents), Grunt", "authors": []}

Started in 1986, the quartet flew a flag of conviction in an insouciant era: First-generation indie rock was on the up, with bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth proposing abstention as rebellion. But Fugazi went for something direct and throttling; it played around with Jamaican dub, the loose-limbed punk coming from California, and drops of minimalism, arriving at a dark, stony, hard-bitten sound. Unlike past iterations of punk, the currency was its heft, not its speed.\n\nThe same could be said of \u201cThe Messthetics,\u201d though Mr. Pirog\u2019s playing here introduces something else. It can feel both misty and assertive, partly because of the way his effects pedals create something hot and threatening, as if he\u2019s immolating his own notes as soon as they arrive. The new album begins with \u201cMythomania,\u201d centered on a classic, low-boil bass line from Mr. Lally, cutting and quaking between two notes. Mr. Pirog plays snarled, overlapping guitar lines that seem to be shining through warped glass. Sometimes, he uses a pedal to play back his lines in reverse.\n\nThe track never rises into guitar heroics; there\u2019s a lot of heady downtime, the groove getting thicker, pulling you toward a foreboding stupor. Mr. Pirog offers a short guitar solo at the end, some unlikely mixture of John McLaughlin\u2019s Carnatic jazz fusion and Dick Dale\u2019s surf music, heightening the suspense but forgoing any big payoff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater on the album, after a couple of fast, mathy burners, Mr. Pirog drops things down for \u201cYour Own World\u201d and \u201cThe Inner Ocean.\u201d Both are slow and open-ended, their irresolution suggesting a cinematic expanse.\n\nWhether speeding and distorted or slow and ethereal, the Messthetics have a remarkable cohesion. And they see this as more than an intergenerational experiment; the band is already writing tunes for a second album.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to me because I know I can play with a certain intensity every night, and not second guess it or worry whether people will come with me,\u201d Mr. Pirog said.

There is nothing amateur about his brackets, which also appear online at NBC Sports. This year, Ommen chose all but one team in the field correctly, with almost the full bracket (64 teams) seeded within one spot of the actual results. Yet this was still only good enough to tie for ninth on Bracket Matrix in 2018.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan. He\u2019s covered Kobe.

Sixty prognosticators have joined the Bracket Matrix since 2015, a fact that has stunned Phan, who said he did not expect his website to maintain enough interest to last past its first season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFew groups embody the young fan\u2019s interest in the hobby more than Delphi Bracketology, a club at Delphi Community High School, in Delphi, Ind., whose membership includes 10 students and three faculty members who meet between 7:15 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Thursday mornings throughout the fall and winter.\n\nOver breakfast, they break down the bracket for months before it is released.\n\n\u201cYou have to think outside the box, you have to analyze data, you have to make comparisons, and you have to have some debate skills,\u201d said Brian Tonsoni, the social studies teacher and basketball coach who founded the club in 2016. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know they\u2019re learning all that. They just think they\u2019re talking about Gonzaga and Wichita State and Kansas.\u201d\n\nThe one thing Miller has learned since he tried to take on Lunardi\u2019s projections is that \u201cit\u2019s not as easy as it looks.\u201d\n\nAndy Bottoms, an Indiana University graduate whose bracket, Inside the Hall, is ninth in the five-year rankings, said the fun is trying to get into the minds of the N.C.A.A. tournament selection committee, which ultimately decides which programs are in and which ones get left out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be really easy if I was just trying to come up with the field as I thought it should be,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the element of trying to predict what other people are going to do that makes it difficult.\u201d\n\nFor all his success, Ommen, who started Bracketville in 2008, said he had no secret algorithm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purely: Who did teams play, who did they beat, where did they play, the statistical data that\u2019s available, whether that\u2019s R.P.I. or other metrics,\u201d Ommen said. \u201cVersus an understanding and a historical perspective of how the committee has handled selections in the past, trying to weigh all that.\u201d\n\nMiller said that he goes as far as rewatching interviews with the selection committee\u2019s leadership from past seasons, trying to glean insight from previous bracket reveals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a psychology exercise more than being a basketball effort,\u201d he said.\n\nThis season\u2019s field, bracketologists said, was one of the hardest to handicap. The number of teams that could have filled the middle seeds made it hard to feel confident going into Sunday.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "In contrast to this fragility, parents who don\u2019t flinch from the power of emotions like anger have a greater capacity to absorb challenging interactions with their children, said Dr. Siegel, who is executive director of the Mindsight Institute. And don\u2019t worry if this kind of resilience doesn\u2019t come naturally, he said \u2014 with practice, it gets easier.\n\nHere are some tips for making those difficult interactions easier to absorb:\n\nTake a Breath\n\nTo respond thoughtfully to our child\u2019s outbursts, we have to first silence the alarm bells going off inside our head. Dr. Markham coaches parents to \u201chit the pause button\u201d before taking any action, even in the face of a screaming child. In her research, Ms. Lewis learned that parents and children often synchronize their heart rates, breathing and other physiological functions, so calming ourselves down can have a measurable, physical effect on our child \u2014 not to mention on our own ability to face a situation calmly.\n\nLet Emotions Happen\n\nResilience depends on an understanding that emotions \u2014 even those considered \u201cnegative,\u201d like sadness, grief or anger \u2014 aren\u2019t a problem to be fixed, but a natural consequence of being human. \u201cThe thing about emotions is that they don\u2019t last forever; there\u2019s a beginning, middle and end to all of them,\u201d said Carla Naumburg, a clinical social worker and author of \u201cReady, Set, Breathe: Practicing Mindfulness With Your Children for Fewer Meltdowns and a More Peaceful Family.\u201d More than that, allowing ourselves \u2014 and our children \u2014 to experience and express a full range of emotions is vital to our well-being. Dr. Markham noted that it is actually when we don\u2019t express our emotions that we lose control of them \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nGet Curious\n\nSo often as parents, we ask \u201cwhy\u201d questions about unwanted behavior (\u201cWhy can\u2019t he remember to put his socks in the hamper?\u201d). But Dr. Naumburg said that asking ourselves \u201cWhy am I responding this way?\u201d may be a more useful question, especially when our buttons are getting pushed. \u201cNotice what\u2019s happening with you, and start to take responsibility for it,\u201d Dr. Markham suggested.\n\nSet Boundaries With Compassion\n\nEstablishing and holding the line on boundaries can lead to some of the most unpleasant moments in the parent-child relationship \u2014 but approaching those moments with compassion and kindness goes a long way toward keeping your blood pressure down. Dr. Markham and Dr. Naumburg suggested verbally acknowledging your child\u2019s feelings and comforting him or her doesn\u2019t have to mean giving in to their demands. \u201cThere are times when I will sit with my daughter in my lap, as she\u2019s crying, and snuggle her as I\u2019m saying \u2018no\u2019 to her,\u201d Dr. Naumburg said. \u201cShe\u2019s still crying, but we\u2019re still connected.\u201d\n\nExamine Your Yeses and Nos\n\nSusan Newman, a social psychologist and author of \u201cThe Book of No: 365 Ways To Say It and Mean It,\u201d said parents should be especially mindful of the times you\u2019re most likely to give in to your child\u2019s outburst. \u201cIf you can recognize what triggers you to an automatic \u2018yes,\u2019 it\u2019s time to step back and say, \u2018Hold it a minute, why am I doing this?\u2019\u201d Dr. Newman suggested. \u201cWe\u2019re living in this culture of \u2018yes\u2019 parenting,\u201d Dr. Newman said, \u201cand it\u2019s easier to say yes than to deal with a child\u2019s meltdown.\u201d But parents can consider, \u201cHow will a \u2018no\u2019 help?\u201d as a way to explore the reason for a particular boundary so that you and your child can better understand it.\n\nGet Some Distance\n\nWhen we identify closely with our children, or rely on them as a barometer of our own self-worth, we set ourselves up for disappointment (or worse) when things don\u2019t go exactly as we planned. \u201cOur egos are very tied up in our parenting,\u201d said Julie Lythcott-Haims, author of \u201cHow to Raise an Adult.\u201d Dr. Naumburg noted that this is partially informed by a cultural narrative that suggests that \u201cIf the kids are not O.K., then it\u2019s because we parents have done something wrong.\u201d As Ms. Lythcott-Haims put it, \u201cIf we can get a life, maybe our kids can have one too.\u201d", "title": "To Raise Resilient Kids, Be a Resilient Parent", "authors": []}

And he\u2019s famous for his notes \u2014 detailed instructions scribbled on yellow notepads \u2014 and his emails. \u201cThey\u2019re legendary, the barrage of notes,\u201d said James McArdle, the Scottish actor playing Louis, the most Kushner-like character, in the new production. \u201cI once asked him the meaning of a three-word sentence and got back a 10-page email.\u201d\n\nMr. Kushner is also famous for quarreling with practically every director he\u2019s ever worked with. He even fired Mr. Eustis, one of his best friends. He screamed at George C. Wolfe, the director of \u201cAngels\u201d on Broadway, and he reduced Declan Donnellan, who directed the 1993 London production, to sobbing. Mr. Donnellan was so frustrated by a nightly onslaught of Kushner faxes that he agreed to direct \u201cPerestroika,\u201d the second half of the play, on two conditions: Mr. Kushner could not even be in the United Kingdom during rehearsals, and he could attend the second preview, but not the first, only if he sat in the audience without his pen and yellow pad.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner says that he isn\u2019t nearly as bad as he used to be, and that Marianne Elliott, the director of this \u201cAngels\u201d revival, doesn\u2019t know how lucky she is. \u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said to her after a rehearsal one afternoon last month. \u201cYou think I\u2019ve given tons and tons of notes.\u201d She nodded and gave a shy smile suggesting that, well, yes \u2014 there had been quite a few.\n\n\u201cI think Tony has slightly begun to trust the world and to trust the play more,\u201d Mr. Eustis said recently. \u201cA lot of his controlling impulses have come, first, from his not trusting that people would understand his vision. And, second, from his not trusting enough that the play is doing that work for him. That makes it very hard for him to sit back and say, \u2018Oh, maybe there\u2019s another way to think about that.\u2019\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat makes \u201cAngels in America\u201d so complicated to stage is not just Mr. Kushner\u2019s need to supervise everything, but that \u201cPerestroika,\u201d the second part, is to a certain extent a work in progress and may always be. The first part, \u201cMillennium Approaches,\u201d was already up and running in the spring of 1991, when, with a deadline looming, Mr. Kushner retreated to a cabin in Northern California and wrote most of \u201cPerestroika\u201d in a feverish eight-day stint, hardly sleeping and living on junk food.\n\nHe has been tinkering with it ever since. \u201cIt\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything wrong with it,\u201d he said recently. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a play that will always be available to a certain degree of moving things around. \u2018Millennium\u2019 hasn\u2019t changed since 1990. There are some plays that are like that.\u201d Even during rehearsal last month he was still cutting, rewriting, restructuring. At one point he consulted with what he called a \u201cKaddish coach,\u201d a Westchester rabbi, for help in a scene where two characters recite the Jewish Prayer for the Dead.\n\nTo all this fussing, Ms. Elliott has been a more than willing accomplice, and why they have got along so well may have less to do with his softening than with her being equally fanatic. She had never seen \u201cAngels,\u201d except in the 2003 HBO version, directed by Mike Nichols, but fell in love with the text, and cashing in on the clout she had earned with her acclaimed productions of \u201cWar Horse\u201d and \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\u201d talked the National into letting her revive it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She showed up once at a breakfast restaurant in Bayswater with some notebooks that Mr. Kushner said reminded him of the Talmud. \u201cThere was text in the middle,\u201d he explained, \u201cand all around were these diagrams, with blocking and notes, little pictures pasted in. I took one look and I thought, \u2018God, she\u2019s as crazy as I am.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Elliott laughed, hearing that. \u201cWas he a pain in the ass?\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re both obsessive, and I would say we both obsessed in our own little worlds. But you can talk to him. We worked out a way that I could say, \u2018Well, this is what I think, and it\u2019s up to you if you want to do something about it.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had mellowed, Mr. Kushner said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m trying. I watched my husband make this documentary based on his book \u2018Five Came Back.\u2019 It was a two-year process and somewhat complicated, and I watched him never get angry at anyone, never write 5,000-word emails lambasting the stupidity and imbecility of everyone. He behaved completely like a gentleman and got done what he needed to get done, and the results are spectacular. I\u2019m not him, but I keep thinking I could do something like that.\u201d\n\nStill, you get the sense that with Mr. Kushner nothing is ever really finished and nothing is ever going to be easy. Mr. Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, told New York magazine in November that he was reviving \u201cA Bright Room Called Day\u201d next season, but Mr. Kushner recently described the play (set in Weimar Germany) as a learning experience with \u201cmaybe a few good things at the end.\u201d Then again, he may be coming around. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said of a new production. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nA recent casting call signaled that the \u201cWest Side Story\u201d screenplay is done enough for filming to begin. Mr. Kushner said he\u2019s recontextualized the songs in certain places but is \u201cnot changing a word of the lyrics.\u201d Even so, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll be working till the last day of shooting.\u201d\n\nAs for that Trump play \u2014 or play about the Trump era, at least \u2014 it\u2019s in such an early stage he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. It\u2019s meant to be about this moment, he said, but to describe what a moment feels like sometimes needs a couple of years\u2019 distance.\n\nThe thing to remember about theater, Mr. Kushner concluded, is that it\u2019s hard \u2014 not just for playwrights but even for the audience. \u201cYou have to show up \u2014 you can\u2019t watch it from your living room. It\u2019s not a commodity form. It will be different the night you\u2019re watching it from every other night.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always aware of that,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that you\u2019re watching a bunch of people trying to remember their stuff \u2014 and part of your sympathy involves anxiety.\u201d", "title": "Tony Kushner, at Peace?

It was 12th year in a row of losses outpacing gains.\n\nPretty depressing, right?\n\nWell, so it goes in the world today.\n\nAnd yet, our public discussion (which followed a chat, a day earlier, with Clive Hamilton about China\u2019s influence in Australia) ranged widely from the causes to possible solutions to signs of both despair and hope.\n\nA few of the highlights and themes worthy of further examination:\n\n\u2022 The Talent Deficit:\n\nBoth Professor Grayling and Mr. Megalogenis lamented the way that politics now struggles to draw in the best and brightest minds. For those who are ambitious and want to change the world, I also noted, there\u2019s more interest in tech start-ups than in government.\n\nWhat can or should our leaders do to make representative democracy feel more dynamic and relevant?\n\nProfessor Grayling suggested that strict term limits would be one way to help, by making politics a temporary service rather than a career. Another idea that came up: recruiting a more diverse pool of candidates, tapping into the optimism of immigrant communities and their children, who tend not to be underrepresented in Australian politics.\n\n\u2022 Tech, Foe and Friend:\n\nSocial media and big data: Good or bad? How about both.\n\nThey allow for niche targeting of voters, which usually means the undecided, but in the case of Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union, Professor Grayling noted, it also meant encouraging complacency with social media posts telling anti-Brexit voters that there was no way they\u2019d lose, making them less likely to turn out to vote.\n\nAt the same time, social media is also now being used by young people to demand change \u2014 whether it\u2019s around the issue of guns in the United States, or in Britain with those who are calling for a second Brexit vote through a group called Our Future, Our Voice.\n\n\u2022 Transparency vs. Secrecy:\n\nAn Australia Letter reader in Canberra, Brett Kennedy, emailed last week with a smart question for our discussion: \u201cHow can democracy be sustained and furthered in a world where Western governments are taking every opportunity to increase secrecy around their functions and reduce transparency of their actions and decisions?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019m zealot for transparency, as some of you know, so I paraphrased the inquiry.\n\nMr. Megalogenis agreed that it was a problem, noting that Australian politicians were continually trying to to avoid transparency and questions \u2014 except from friendly journalists.\n\nWhat he and Professor Grayling concluded was that most of today\u2019s leaders have simply not come to grips with the current moment of existential challenge for democracies: Politicians are still waltzing in a world where the stakes are small and intimately tied to their own party loyalty, their donors and re-election.\n\nWhat might it take for them to wake up, mature and reinvigorate government?\n\nWhat needs to happen for the public to be better informed and to demand more from their elected representatives?\n\nThese questions came up, too, from me and from the audience. And besides the answer I felt compelled to toss out there (subscribe to The Times!) a consensus emerged around the simplest possible idea: People just have to do it.\n\nI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s as satisfying as one would hope. We seem to be in a moment where much of the world is just trying to keep up with the volatility of shifting politics \u2014 very little feels settled, and our discussion did little to banish that uncertainty.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Morning Briefing What you need to know to start your day in Australia, delivered to your inbox.

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "In 1985, Mr. Madison killed a police officer, Julius Schulte, who had been trying to keep the peace between Mr. Madison and his ex-girlfriend, Cheryl Greene, as she sought to eject him from what had been their shared home. Mr. Madison shot Ms. Greene, too, wounding her.\n\nMr. Madison remembers none of this. He has suffered at least two severe strokes, and he is blind and incontinent. His speech is slurred, and what he says does not always make sense.\n\nHe has asked that his mother be told of his strokes, but his mother is dead. He soils himself, saying \u201cno one will let me out to use the bathroom,\u201d though there is a toilet in his cell. He says he plans to move to Florida. He can recite the alphabet, but only to the letter G.\n\nMr. Madison also insists that he \u201cnever went around killing folks.\u201d\n\nA court-appointed psychologist found that Mr. Madison had \u201csignificant body and cognitive decline as a result of strokes.\u201d But the psychologist testified that Mr. Madison understood what he was accused of and how the state planned to punish him. According to Steve Marshall, Alabama\u2019s attorney general, that is enough.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s precedents bar the execution of people who lack a \u201crational understanding\u201d of the reason they are to be put to death.\n\nMr. Marshall told the justices that Mr. Madison satisfied that standard. \u201cThe ability to form a rational understanding of an event,\u201d he wrote in January in a brief urging the justices to stay out of the case, \u201chas very limited relation to whether a person remembers that event.\u201d\n\nMr. Madison\u2019s case, which has been bouncing around the court system for more than 30 years, has taken some unusual turns.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His second conviction was thrown out after prosecutors committed misconduct by using expert testimony to tell the jury about evidence never properly introduced.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Mr. Madison\u2019s third trial, the jury voted to sentence him to life in prison. But Judge Ferrill D. McRae, of Mobile County Circuit Court, overrode that verdict and sentenced Mr. Madison to death.\n\nI interviewed Judge McRae in 2011, not long before he died. I had sought him out because he had achieved a rare distinction. He had overridden six jury verdicts calling for life sentences, a state record, while never rejecting a jury\u2019s recommendation of death.\n\nAlabama juries are not notably squeamish about the death penalty, but Judge McRae said they needed to be corrected when they were seized by an impulse toward mercy. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have something like that,\u201d he said of judicial overrides, \u201ca jury with no experience in other cases would be making the ultimate decision, based on nothing.\u201d\n\nAlabama abolished judicial overrides last year.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Madison came very close to being put to death. A deadlocked eight-member Supreme Court refused to vacate a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court, with the court\u2019s four conservative members saying they would have let the execution proceed. Justice Antonin Scalia had died a few months before, leaving the Supreme Court short-handed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly be dead by now.\n\nThe case took some additional procedural twists, and Mr. Madison returned to the Supreme Court in January after a state court again ruled against him. The Supreme Court stayed his execution, though the court\u2019s three most conservative members \u2014 Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 said they would have let it go forward.\n\nThe case, Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505, will be argued in the fall, and it will give the court a chance to consider some profound questions.\n\n\u201cMr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion when the court considered an earlier appeal. \u201cGiven this trend, we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age.\u201d", "title": "Too Old to Be Executed?

Because the speakers aren\u2019t in your ear, the sound has never been loud enough for me to drown out noisy passengers on an airplane the way sound through earbuds can. (This could also be a problem for those who want to use SleepPhones to tune out a vigorously snoring partner.) And charging the wireless Bluetooth version through its USB port is inelegant: You have to open the fabric headband to get at the wiring.\n\nBut that said, this little device causes no ear pain and is as light and as small as a sock, so there\u2019s barely any added weight or space in your luggage. Also, while SleepPhones come with an app that includes soothing sounds, you don\u2019t need it for the headphones to work. That\u2019s a relief: A number of sleep-related products have apps that are awkward to use and instruction booklets that put you to sleep faster than the devices themselves.\n\nYet while sleeping away from home can be challenging, when it comes to managing jet lag, things get even tricker.\n\nA handful of new apps purport to help by adjusting your circadian rhythms. Chronoshift says it uses the travel details you input to create the ideal sleep-wake schedule for the days before your particular trip (free). Uplift aims to fight jet lag through a personalized regimen that involves activating certain acupressure points ($9.99 a year).\n\nThe Illumy Sleep and Wake Mask by Glo to Sleep ($149) uses an app and colored, pulsing light panels to help encourage sleep (a slow, red pulse to simulate a setting sun) or wakefulness (faster, blue pulsing for a gradually brightening morning sky). The mask is controlled through a smartphone app (for instance, you can adjust the duration of the simulated sunset and the time you want to be awakened). And it\u2019s thick enough to block out light, though this also makes it a bit heavy and stiff \u2014 indeed, this side sleeper couldn\u2019t wear it.\n\nI did, however, find the slightly weighty mask with its pulsing red light somewhat comforting to begin to doze off in on my back at the end of the day. But then, I was tired at the end of the day \u2014 so perhaps it simply felt good to lie down? The company says its regimen of sunset and blue sky exposure is like the system used to help astronauts in space keep their body clocks in sync.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic recently offered some sound advice on its website, explaining that in addition to modifying your schedule before you depart, you should stick to your destination\u2019s schedule as soon as you leave home and once you arrive, stay well hydrated by drinking liquids on the flight (note: go easy on the alcohol and caffeine), and, if you\u2019re traveling fewer than eight time zones away from home, use bright light to get your body on the new schedule, like morning light if you have traveled east, and evening light if you have traveled west.", "title": "Tools for Sleeping Well While Traveling", "authors": []}

Ms. Unwin, who thinks the episode was designed to discredit protesters, said she had been told by her lawyer that there would be no further action against her or her husband.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Darren Butt, account director for Amey, the company doing the maintenance work, said the incident was a sign of an increasingly lawless protest.\n\n\u201cTeagate is genuine, I can guarantee it\u2019s genuine,\u201d he said, adding that he was not accusing any individual, but that the three victims had been ill enough with stomach problems to stay off work for more than a day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the opposition to the project \u2014 and even the intervention of Britain\u2019s secretary of state for the environment, Michael Gove, who described the felling program as \u201cbonkers,\u201d \u2014 around 5,700 of the targeted trees have been cut down. The remaining 300 are those that protesters have worked hardest to protect.\n\nMatters were complicated by the fact that Amey is a private company. That fueled campaigners\u2019 suspicions that the trees were being cut to simplify maintenance work and make it as economical as possible. Some also wondered if the contract limited Amey\u2019s discretion to negotiate alternative solutions to felling, because the company might be sued if it failed to complete agreed work.\n\nThe accusations are denied by Amey and by Sheffield City Council, but the contract has been published only in redacted form, on grounds of commercial confidentiality. In total, it allows for up to 17,500 trees to be felled over the full 25-year period, though the council argues that this is not a target and that the figure is merely intended to cover the most extreme scenario.\n\nSCOTLAND North Sea N. IRELAND ENGLAND IRELAND Sheffield BRITAIN WALES London Celtic Sea English Channel FRANCE 100 miles\n\nOfficials say the trees scheduled to be felled are dead, dying, diseased, decaying or causing problems like buckled sidewalks. They emphasized that the lost trees would be replaced with saplings and that most residents supported the work.\n\nNone of that has placated the tree lovers. Across the city, yellow ribbons flutter from trunks, and one elm is festooned with flags, decorations and even a Valentine\u2019s Day poem (\u201cWill you be my Valentine/ As I await my Council killers/ In patient Trepidation,\u201d it starts.)\n\nThought to be about 120 years old, that elm has won a stay of execution, but only because it is home to a rare species of butterfly, the white-letter hairstreak.\n\nWhen workers arrive to chop down a tree, protesters use a variety of techniques to stop them, including \u201cbunnying,\u201d hopping over barriers erected around targeted trees, and \u201cgeckoing,\u201d standing next to garden walls and refusing to move. It\u2019s not exactly tree-hugging, but the basic tactic is to get too close to allow the tree to be felled in safety.\n\nMr. Rust of the tree action group talks of a secret army, including \u201cgrannies on buses,\u201d that keeps watch, enabling protesters to arrive only minutes after Amey\u2019s workers.\n\nPhoto\n\nActivists complain of being grappled, and the former deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, who represented part of Sheffield until last year, once compared their treatment to that received by protesters in Russia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Butt of Amey said that one of his security team had suffered a broken wrist, and that staff had been required to go on \u201cconflict training\u201d to learn how to defuse confrontations.\n\nNow that his car is recognized, Mr. Butt\u2019s movements are monitored and he often receives emails within minutes of arriving in a road asking why he is there. Mr. Lodge, of the city council, said that he had received pieces of shredded trees through the mail slot in his door and that he had been asked how safe he felt.\n\nThe tree fellers say they remain convinced that they are doing residents a favor.\n\n\u201cWhat you can see is a large number of trees causing damage, so why wouldn\u2019t you take them out now, and replace them with new perfect trees for the location, and future generations will also see a beautiful majestic avenue of trees?\u201d Mr. Butt said.\n\nBut campaigners say that most of the trees are free of problems. They promised to continue the resistance.\n\nPhoto\n\nGordon Ashall, an 87-year-old retired bus driver, pointed to one lime tree he saved by refusing to move from a fence near the house he has lived in since 1955.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let them move me from the railings, and they decided that I am an old man and it might be dangerous to remove me forcefully,\u201d said Mr. Ashall, who added that he would risk jail to save the trees.\n\nSo would his wife, Maureen, 83, a retired bus conductor.\n\n\u201cWe stand out in the freezing weather, we\u2019ve been covered in hail stones, wet, cold, we\u2019ve been up at night,\u201d she said, adding,\u201cI think they believed we would get tired and sit in our kitchen, but the opposite happened.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFurther down the street, however, Ian Hutchinson, 63, who is currently unemployed, asked what the protesters would do \u201cwhen the roots of the trees fracture a water main or electric, gas or telephone \u2014 they\u2019ll be complaining to the council.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake them down,\u201d he said, referring to the trees. He added that, although it was \u201ca shame\u201d to fell living trees, one was causing subsidence and cracking the walls of his house.\n\nBoth sides are tensed for a showdown. Last summer, the City Council won an injunction to prevent protesters bunnying or geckoing, and in November, Amey brought in an 18-strong security team to guard \u201csafety zones\u201d constructed around trees being felled.\n\nMs. Unwin, the architect, said she was more determined than ever to protect the trees, no matter what countermeasures Amey or anyone else might take.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing special about this street, it\u2019s a conglomeration of architectural styles, and the trees just tie it all together,\u201d she said.", "title": "Toxic Tea and Other Tales From an English Tree War", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"]}

When I was growing up, my father had a series of books whose titles began \u201cThe Works of \u2026.\u201d Without making a lot of fuss about them, or worrying over the literal sense of them, I read sonnets by Shakespeare and poems by Poe, and loved the feeling that those works created in me.

As I got older, poems began to offer me new and life-changing ways of looking at the familiar world.\n\nWas there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write?\n\nSeamus Heaney\u2019s first book, \u201cDeath of a Naturalist,\u201d made me want to be a poet. More than that, it made me want to be Seamus Heaney, and I imitated him for a long time. I was his student as an undergraduate, and that whole time I was, at least in my heart, imitating him.

The more I read them, the more their poems seem to accomplish. I\u2019m co-translating the contemporary Chinese poet Yi Lei, and her vision of freedom and love, her concerns for humanity and for the planet speak very actively to my own. I\u2019m learning a great deal from living with her voice and her imagination.\n\nAre there poets for whom you\u2019ve gained greater appreciation over time?\n\nWhen I first became brave enough to tell people that I wrote poems, so many people would rave to me about Edna St. Vincent Millay\u2019s work. I was embarrassed not to have read her and I think that put me off from reading her for a long time. So many of her poems are just impeccable. I love the subtlety and the tiny, yet significant, gestures driving poems like \u201cEbb\u201d and \u201cThe Fitting.\u201d\n\nAs poet laureate of the United States, you\u2019ve been traveling across the country to meet with people in underserved communities. What books do you recommend to them? And have they in turn pointed you to any neglected or unfamiliar writers?\n\nI find myself sharing poems by other poets on these trips, which is something I didn\u2019t used to do at readings. Some of the voices I\u2019ve been excited to celebrate so far are Natalie Diaz, Aracelis Girmay, John Yau, Patrick Rosal, Laura Kasischke and Chen Chen. I like that these are poets living and writing in America today, each with different thematic concerns, different approaches to language and different ideas about what it means to belong to this place made up of many places. And I feel very lucky that I get to meet other poets in my travels. In New Mexico, I met dg okpik, an Inupiaq-Inuit poet whose work draws Inuit creation stories into conversation with a personal exploration of self, family and the natural world. And I read recently with Kealoha, the poet laureate of Hawaii, whose performance piece \u201cThe Story of Everything\u201d traces the origin of the universe from the Big Bang until now.\n\nIf you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?\n\n\u201cLittle Women\u201d made me into a reader. About a decade later, I wrote one of my college admissions essays on Thoreau\u2019s \u201cWalden.\u201d I have no memory of what I might have said then about the book, though I do remember loving its various paradoxes and the beautiful spacious sense of self, nature and possibility that the prose fostered. I was longing for the kind of largeness of spirit and rhetorical authority of a writer like Thoreau. I didn\u2019t encounter Emerson until college, but I think I was an aspiring Transcendentalist from a young age.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat genres do you especially enjoy reading?

At one time, I thought I\u2019d raise my kids on the classic books from my childhood: \u201cLittle House in the Big Woods,\u201d Beverly Cleary\u2019s wonderful Ramona books, \u201cBlack Beauty.\u201d It\u2019s been great to revisit some of those titles as a parent, but my children have guided me to the joys of contemporary children\u2019s literature. Jacqueline Woodson\u2019s books are such a gift to parents and children for their poignant subtlety and lyricism, and their willingness to let a reader dwell in the pangs of realization that we sometimes try to protect our children from. I\u2019m thinking of \u201cEach Kindness\u201d and \u201cThe Other Side.\u201d My daughter is 8 and loves the way that private and public history intersect in \u201cFeathers.\u201d Many picture books have fostered inroads for talking with our kids about history: Margaret H. Mason\u2019s \u201cThese Hands\u201d tells the story of racial discrimination at the Wonder Bread factory in the 1950s and \u201960s. Selina Alko\u2019s \u201cThe Case for Loving\u201d tells the story behind the Supreme Court\u2019s Loving v. Virginia decision. And then there are books that have given us a wonderfully useful vocabulary for feelings of anger or longing, like Barbara O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cWish.\u201d\n\nI have to say that I just haven\u2019t found a way to get excited about \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d though my daughter and husband loved the series. I loved C. S. Lewis as a kid, so I thought I\u2019d have a toehold in that world, but invariably I\u2019d get about two paragraphs in and fall asleep. Maybe I\u2019ll be ready to face those books in a few more years when they come around for our boys.\n\nWhat books might we be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nPerhaps because I\u2019ve lost both my parents, I really appreciate Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross\u2019s books on death and dying.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\nEmily Wilson\u2019s translation of \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d", "title": "Tracy K.

With the 2018 midterm elections fast approaching and many Republicans in vulnerable positions, Mr. Trump is trying to win agreements that will appeal to his base and help keep Republican control of Congress.\n\nIf Mr. Trump\u2019s push works, it could hasten the biggest rewrite of trade rules around the world since 118 nations agreed in Geneva in 1993 to create the World Trade Organization.\n\nBut the rush carries significant risks. Hasty deals could do little to solve major, long-running problems for the United States, like China\u2019s financial support for its homegrown companies. New tariffs could also prompt the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners to push back and ignite a trade war or a serious geopolitical confrontation. And it could simply prompt some nations to pull back from the United States, rather than accede to demands that may be unpalatable back home.\n\n\u201cYou get this thing rolling and it gets hard to stop,\u201d said Nelson G. Dong, an international investment and technology lawyer in the Seattle office of Dorsey & Whitney, a law firm. \u201cEach side gets its manhood challenged.\u201d\n\nThere are legal risks as well. Trade pacts are usually inspected minutely by lawyers on both sides before they are signed. The United States is trying to conclude a rapid-fire series of them at a moment when the office of the United States trade representative is short-staffed for budgetary reasons. Many governments plan to challenge Mr. Trump\u2019s trade actions at the World Trade Organization including Canada, which has already filed a sweeping trade case.\n\nFor now, Mr. Trump\u2019s highly ambitious agenda lacks even a clear schedule for trade ministers to meet and sort out the details. The approach has irritated trade ministers in Canada, China, the European Union and Mexico, who have made clear that they would prefer the United States address its chronic trade deficits in a quieter and more collegial manner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the case of South Korea, the high-pressure tactic returned results \u2014 though it is not yet clear how much Seoul\u2019s concessions will help American workers.\n\nPhoto\n\nUnder the deal announced on Wednesday, South Korea will reduce its steel exports to the United States by nearly one-third to avoid getting hit with new American steel tariffs. South Korea also agreed to double, to 50,000, the number of American cars that it will allow to be imported each year into the country without meeting South Korea\u2019s unique safety standards, which have been criticized for decades by American and European officials as a trade barrier.\n\nSouth Korean demand for American cars appears to be growing, but the new rules may not provide an immediate increase for Detroit. According to the Korea Automobile Importers and Distributors Association, the number of cars imported from the United States remains below the 25,000 cap, reaching 20,019 last year.\n\nStill, the South Korea examples offers a look at what Mr. Trump may be seeking by pressuring trading partners for quick deals. Mr. Trump strongly hinted last week that his goal in confronting trading partners was a negotiated settlement, as opposed collecting billions of dollars from new tariffs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

China\u2019s retort is that the West agreed to the tariffs in the 1990s, and that a deal is a deal, not to be changed unless the West offers further concessions.\n\nPascal Lamy, the former director general of the W.T.O., said that what the United States accomplishes could depend to a considerable extent on whether it seeks a broad opening up of international trade, including a requirement that China remove many trade barriers, or whether the United States ends up protecting its own market.\n\n\u201cIf the United States carpet bombing on trade is about opening a negotiation, which is one of the interpretations, then I think there is ample room to improve the rules of the W.T.O.,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he added that if American officials \u201care after blowing up the multilateral system, then it is a very serious issue.\u201d", "title": "Trade Deals Take Years.

That\u2019s why I, like many other economists, wanted us to take a tougher stance on Chinese currency policy back in 2010, when we had around 9 percent unemployment. But the case for worrying about trade deficits, like the case for running budget deficits, has largely evaporated now that unemployment is back to 4 percent.\n\nSo we can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d a trade war. What we can do is start a cycle of tit-for-tat, and when it comes to trade, America \u2014 which accounts for 9 percent of world exports and 14 percent of world imports \u2014 is by no means a dominant superpower.\n\nA cycle of retaliation would shrink overall world trade, making the world as a whole, America very much included, poorer. Perhaps even more important in the near term, it would be highly disruptive. We live in an era of global supply chains: just about everything produced in America (and everywhere else) uses inputs produced in other countries. Your new car may well have a chassis assembled in the U.S., an engine and wiring system made in Mexico, electronics from Korea and China, and, of course, steel and aluminum from Canada.\n\nCould we produce cars without all those imported components? Yes, given time. But getting from here to there would be a huge mess: hundreds if not thousands of factories would have to close or convert over to other uses. Never mind the net loss of jobs from a full-scale trade war, which would in the end probably be a relatively small number. The point instead is that the gross job losses would be huge, as millions of workers would be forced to change jobs, move to new places, and more. And many of them would suffer losses on the way that they would never get back.\n\nOh, and companies on the losing end would lose trillions in stock value.\n\nSo the idea that a trade war would be \u201cgood\u201d and \u201ceasy to win\u201d is surpassingly stupid. And the way Trump seems to be starting his war is also remarkably stupid: start by protecting goods that are inputs to industries that employ far more people than those being protected?

But Mr. Trump\u2019s move will have a limited effect on China because much of the steel and aluminum the United States imports actually comes from allies like Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. Further, the move could hurt American businesses that use these metals, including auto and construction companies, which will now pay more for a critical raw material.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were truly interested in getting China to reduce its excess production, he would have worked with the European Union, Canada, Japan, South Korea and other countries to put pressure on Beijing. Those nations tend to be closely aligned with the United States and have also been hurt by China\u2019s mercantilist economic policies.\n\nBut rather than make common cause with them, Mr. Trump has angered American allies with this move. Top officials in Canada and the European Union are already threatening to retaliate forcefully against the new Trump tariffs. They could do so by bringing cases against the United States at the World Trade Organization, or by doing what Mr. Trump did and unilaterally imposing new tariffs on American exports like soybeans and Boeing planes. As it happens, Canada imports more American Steel than it exports to the United States, giving it the ability to hurt the very industry Mr. Trump claims to want to help. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, says Canada buys about half of American steel exports.\n\nIt\u2019s also not clear that these tariffs will help Mr. Trump achieve his goal of increasing manufacturing employment in the United States. For example, businesses located in this country already produce about 70 percent of the steel used here. Experts say for every new job at a steel mill or aluminum smelter that is created by this trade decision, the country could lose as many or more jobs at businesses that use those metals, which will now cost more. This is one of the reasons that trade wars are, in fact, not easy to win.\n\nMr. Trump clearly sees trade as a zero-sum game. He and some of his most protectionist advisers, including Peter Navarro, think that if China and Mexico sell the United States more things than they import from America, they are winning. The president wants to turn the table on them with tariffs and other trade restrictions. But trade is much more complicated than that. Tariffs are blunt instruments that can hurt countries that use them, just as much as they can help.", "title": "Opinion | Trade Wars Are Destructive. Of Course Trump Wants One.", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "That is, of course, a possibility. But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.\n\nThe closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries.\n\nImports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others \u2014 in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals \u2014 surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.\n\nUndeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average.\n\nGary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion \u2014 or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that.\n\nThe lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs \u2014 paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans \u2014 the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled.\n\nThe critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThink of the multifiber agreement, which until its demise at the end of 2004 allowed the United States to impose individual quotas on thousands of pieces of apparel \u2014 cotton diapers from China, trousers from Guatemala. The rationale was to protect one of the lowest-wage industries in the country from lower wages in the developing world. A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, \u201cFree Trade Under Fire,\u201d concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A 63 percent tariff on advanced flat-panel screens for laptop computers in 1991 helped drive a stake through the heart of the American laptop industry itself. Japan\u2019s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision \u201can eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.\n\nClever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.\n\nThen the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.\n\n\u201cIn the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,\u201d the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports.\n\nSugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.\n\nSugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana.\n\nMr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints on cars \u2014 raising car prices for American consumers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent.\n\nBut there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford\u2019s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit\u2019s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world.\n\nIf gasoline prices were to rise \u2014 say, in an effort to combat climate change \u2014 a gas-guzzling domestic auto industry could prove a weak link in the nation\u2019s security.", "title": "Trade Wars Can Be a Game of Chicken.

It made me self-reliant and independent, and you need to be like that to be an inventor.\u201d\n\nThe family was not well off when he was young, so he did odd jobs to help out, including, at age 9, working a milk route with a horse and cart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI remember that the horse, Gip, knew exactly where to drop off the milk,\u201d he told The Telegraph in 2015. \u201cShe was marvelous.\u201d\n\nHe left school, but while working in a soil mechanics laboratory in Southall as a teenager he began studying engineering part time at a local technical college. After serving in the Army, Mr. Baylis, an excellent swimmer, sold swimming pools, sometimes diving from 10 feet into shallow water as part of the sales pitch. He also worked in the Berlin Circus as an underwater escape artist.\n\nThe human-powered radio was far from his first invention. Earlier in his eclectic career he had a particular concern for the needs of people with disabilities, which inspired him to invent dozens of devices, like a bottle opener designed to be used with one hand.\n\nMr. Baylis said it took him only about a half-hour of fiddling in his workshop to come up with a working version of a hand-powered radio, but turning the idea into a product took a lot longer. None of the electronics manufacturers he wrote to were interested.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until he told his story and spoke of his frustrations on the BBC series \u201cTomorrow\u2019s World\u201d in 1994 that an entrepreneur, Chris Staines, became involved, setting up a factory in South Africa under the name BayGen that was staffed by people with disabilities. A 1995 television program chronicled Mr. Baylis\u2019s introduction to that facility.\n\n\u201cTrevor burst into tears when he walked through the door,\u201d a reviewer for The Independent wrote, \u201cso that much of what he said subsequently was subject to sniffly interference, as if his own mainspring was winding down. You gathered that he was happy and proud \u2014 and justifiably so.\u201d\n\nLater that year Reuters reported that 60,000 of the radios had already been ordered by aid organizations operating in Rwanda, and BayGen said the radios would also soon be in use in Bosnia, which was then in the midst of a war. Today, renamed Freeplay Energy, the company has products aimed at the developing world, emergency preparedness providers and the outdoor leisure market.\n\nMr. Baylis, who leaves no immediate survivors, became a sought-after speaker. In his later years he put much of his effort into advising other inventors through Trevor Baylis Brands. His autobiography, \u201cClock This: My Life as an Inventor,\u201d was published in 1999.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2000, Mr. Baylis walked 100 miles across the Namib Desert \u2014 partly for a charitable cause, but also to demonstrate a new invention, electric shoes. A pouch on the side of the shoe held electronic gear that generated electricity from the walking motion.\n\nThe next year, though, a terrorist tried to blow up an American Airlines plane with a shoe bomb, and Mr. Baylis acknowledged that the incident had created a marketing problem for his electric shoe.\n\n\u201cThe only trouble is that having a pouch full of electronics on the side of the shoe invites you to have four bullets in the brain,\u201d he told TechWeekEurope, \u201cbecause they think you might be a shoe bomber.

Under the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation, a tip pool could have included those groups.\n\n\u201cThis protects workers from employers and managers skimming their tips and sets up conditions for better wage justice in restaurants and bars across the country,\u201d said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.\n\nAngelo I. Amador, a senior official at the National Restaurant Association, an industry trade group, said in a statement that he was pleased that the new legislation would make it possible for cooks, dishwashers and other workers to share tips. But he expressed concern that \u201cthe enforcement and penalty language for unintentional violations goes too far.\u201d\n\nThe provision would give the secretary of labor broader authority to impose civil penalties on employers who steal tips. For example, workers currently must show that the theft was repeated or willful. Now, civil penalties could be applied to any instance of tip theft.\n\nIn addition to restaurant workers, the rules would apply to tipped employees in other fields, like hairstylists and manicurists.\n\nThe proposed regulation came under particular fire after a report in February that the Labor Department had scaled down its projection for the amount that might be transferred from workers to their bosses, and then abandoned the projection altogether under pressure from Mr. Acosta and the Labor Department.\n\nIt is standard practice for proposed regulations with more than $100 million in economic impact to include an economic analysis, and the Office of Management and Budget typically insists on abiding by that protocol.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter reports emerged that the analysis had been spiked, Democrats in Congress demanded an investigation into the matter and the Labor Department\u2019s inspector general opened an inquiry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During testimony by Mr. Acosta before a congressional committee on March 6, Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned him about the absence of an economic analysis in the proposed regulation and pressed him on why anyone other than workers should be allowed a share of their tips.\n\nMr. Acosta said he did not personally favor allowing managers and owners to siphon tips. But he said the law governing the question, the Fair Labor Standards Act, did not give him the authority to prevent employers from taking tips if the workers were paid the standard minimum wage.\n\nAround the same time, Ms. Murray, the senator from Washington, began negotiations with Mr. Acosta, leading to the provision that was inserted into the spending bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased that Secretary Acosta listened, reversed course and worked with me on legislation to make sure that big businesses can\u2019t steal their workers\u2019 tips,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement renders portions of the Labor Department\u2019s proposed regulation invalid, but it is unclear whether the department will officially withdraw it. The department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is possible that some high-earning tipped workers would do worse under the compromise. Restaurants would be permitted to set up pools that redistribute their tips to colleagues who often don\u2019t earn tips now.\n\nBut according to Saru Jayaraman, president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a worker advocacy group, the vast majority of workers would benefit from the compromise provision, because such tip-pooling is linked to workers receiving the regular minimum wage, as opposed to the tipped minimum wage, which can be several dollars per hour lower.\n\nFor example, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, while the federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour. Employers who pay tipped workers below $7.25 per hour must make up any difference between that amount and what their workers receive in base wages and tips. (Many cities and states have a far higher minimum wage.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe compromise\u2019s minimum wage requirement changes the math in the employees\u2019 favor. Any restaurant setting up a tip pool that involves non-tipped workers would have to be paying its tipped workers the regular minimum wage, not the reduced wage.\n\nWorkers who previously made $3.25 per hour from their employer and $4 in tips would instead receive their share of the tip pool on top of a $7.25 minimum wage. Even if such workers received slightly less than their usual $4 per hour in tips because some portion of that money was being redistributed, they would almost certainly fare better than if they kept all their tips but had a lower base wage.\n\nMs. Jayaraman pointed to an analysis by her group showing that tipped workers, including the most highly paid tipped workers, typically earn more in the seven states that have done away with the tipped-worker minimum wage than in the states that haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo one tips based on how much you\u2019re earning,\u201d said Ms. Jayaraman, whose group strongly supported the legislative compromise. \u201cThey tip the same amount, and your wages go up.\u201d", "title": "Trump Administration Retreats on Tip-Sharing Plan in Compromise", "authors": ["Noam Scheiber"]}

Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as \u201cinsignificant\u201d in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.\n\nThe White House\u2019s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.\n\nEconomists say the tariffs, if applied without exceptions, would harm allies like Canada, South Korea and the European Union, which export more steel to the United States than China does. Shortly after the tariffs were announced, the European Union responded by saying that it was already preparing to levy retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, bluejeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting China off the hook,\u201d Mr. Graham said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cChina wins when we fight with Europe.\u201d\n\nJoshua B.

Tillerson, whose last official day on the job is Saturday, had come to the conclusion before Mr. Trump fired him this month that a year of attempting to cooperate had not yielded much success, according to people familiar with his thinking. As a result, they said, Mr. Tillerson had begun mapping out a tougher policy toward Russia and found agreement in the White House.\n\nThe administration began taking a more robust approach, publicly blaming Russia for a devastating attack on computers in Ukraine and elsewhere, accusing Moscow of trying to break into the United States\u2019 power grid and imposing sanctions in retaliation for Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election in the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s feelings were hardened further by a conversation with Boris Johnson, the British foreign secretary who described to him the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter living in Britain. Even in the hours before his dismissal by Mr. Trump, Mr. Tillerson spoke out in stronger terms than the president in condemning the poisoning.\n\nWhile Mr. Tillerson is on the way out, his designated successor, Mike Pompeo, and the incoming national security adviser, John R.

Russia responded Thursday by ordering out 60 Americans and closing the consulate in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe scope of Russia\u2019s retaliation grew clearer on Friday as the Kremlin summoned 23 ambassadors from other countries to evict some of their diplomats. On Saturday, the Tass news agency reported that Moscow had informed Britain it must send home a total of \u201cmore than 50\u201d diplomats. Russia had already announced the expulsion of 23 Britons.\n\nMr. Trump has remained publicly silent amid the dramatic rounds of diplomatic retaliation, leaving it to others to condemn Moscow.

Mueller III, into whether his campaign cooperated with Russia in 2016, a scenario he dismissed as a \u201choax,\u201d Mr. Trump recently called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on his victory in a re-election widely dismissed as a sham.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After firing Mr. Comey, the president said privately that the dismissal had relieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him.

The president has not been questioned by Mr. Mueller; Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are negotiating terms of a possible interview. Learning even basic details about what other witnesses told investigators could help the president shape his own answers.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Mr. McGahn unfolded in the days after the Jan. 25 Times article, which said that Mr. McGahn threatened to quit last June after the president asked him to fire the special counsel. After the article was published, the White House staff secretary, Rob Porter, told Mr. McGahn that the president wanted him to release a statement saying that the story was not true, the people said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Porter, who resigned last month amid a domestic abuse scandal, told Mr. McGahn the president had suggested he might \u201cget rid of\u201d Mr. McGahn if he chose not to challenge the article, the people briefed on the conversation said.\n\nMr. McGahn did not publicly deny the article, and the president later confronted him in the Oval Office in front of the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, according to the people.\n\nThe president said he had never ordered Mr. McGahn to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn replied that the president was wrong and that he had in fact asked Mr. McGahn in June to call the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to tell him that the special counsel had a series of conflicts that disqualified him for overseeing the investigation and that he had to be dismissed. The president told Mr. McGahn that he did not remember the discussion that way.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump moved on, pointing out that Mr. McGahn had never told him that he was going to resign over the order to fire the special counsel. Mr. McGahn acknowledged that that was true but said that he had told senior White House officials at the time that he was going to quit.\n\nIt is not clear how the confrontation was resolved. Mr. McGahn has stayed on as White House counsel, one of the few senior administration officials who has been with the president since the campaign.\n\nMr. Priebus met with the president in the West Wing in December, according to the people with knowledge of their encounter. Allies of Mr. Priebus, who left the White House in July 2017, have cautioned him to keep his distance. But Mr. Priebus, who is seeking to build a law practice as a Washington power broker who can open doors for clients, has maintained contact and occasionally visited the White House to see Mr. Trump and his own replacement, Mr. Kelly.\n\nMr. Trump brought up Mr. Priebus\u2019s October interview with the special counsel\u2019s office, the people said, and Mr. Priebus replied that the investigators were courteous and professional. He shared no specifics and did not say what he had told investigators, and the conversation moved on after a few minutes, those briefed on it said. Mr. Kelly was present for that conversation as well, and it was not clear whether he tried to stop the discussion.\n\nIt is not illegal for the subject of an investigation to learn what witnesses have told investigators. But that is usually done through lawyers for the people involved because their communications are often shielded from prosecutors because of attorney-client privilege. In organized crime and complex white-collar investigations, prosecutors often ask witnesses whether they have spoken to the person under investigation to determine whether they are coordinating their stories.\n\nMr. Priebus has had a long and complicated relationship with the president. He was one of the few who publicly defended Mr. Trump after the Times article about his attempt to fire Mr. Mueller, which cited the president\u2019s view that Mr. Mueller had too many conflicts to be the special counsel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe expresses concerns with the conflicts, but I never heard the idea or the concept that this person needed to be fired,\u201d Mr. Priebus said last month in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI never felt it was relayed to me that way, either.

His counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had no comment, as did a number of other top Senate Republicans.\n\nLate in the day, the White House tried to douse the furor. \u201cIn response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller,\u201d Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, said in a statement.\n\nThe president\u2019s tweet followed a statement by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, John Dowd, on Saturday calling on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Trump followed up that evening with a tweet arguing that \u201cthe Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.\u201d\n\nThe two weekend tweets were the first time Mr. Trump has used Mr. Mueller\u2019s name on Twitter, not counting a message he once retweeted, and reflected what advisers called a growing impatience fueled by anger that the investigation was now looking at his business activities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe New York Times reported last week that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers met with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization.\n\nFor months, Mr. Trump had been reassured by his lawyers that the investigation would wrap up soon \u2014 by Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Year\u2019s. But with the expansion into Mr. Trump\u2019s business, it seems increasingly clear that Mr. Mueller is not ready to conclude his inquiry.\n\nA top adviser to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that the White House had grown weary of the inquiry. \u201cWe have cooperated in every single way, every single paper they\u2019ve asked for, every single interview,\u201d Marc Short, the president\u2019s legislative director, said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing frustration that after a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this, there remains no evidence of collusion with Russia.\u201d\n\nA president cannot directly fire a special counsel but can order his attorney general to do so. Even then, a cause has to be cited, like conflict of interest.

The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, knowing this issue could reach her, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush.\n\nMr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia.\n\nThe White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful to the special counsel. His focus on Democrats working for Mr. Mueller could be aimed at demonstrating conflict of interest that would merit dismissal.\n\nWhen Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with trusted former colleagues and experts on specific crimes like money laundering. As the team filled out, Republican allies of Mr. Trump noted that some members had previously contributed to Democratic candidates.\n\nIn particular, Republicans pointed to Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obama\u2019s election effort.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Andrew G. McCabe, his former deputy, both of whom, like Mr. Mueller, are longtime Republicans. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision.\n\nMr. Sessions, under intense public pressure from Mr. Trump, fired Mr. McCabe on Friday after an inspector general found that he had not been forthcoming about authorizing F.B.I. officials to provide information about the Clinton inquiry in 2016 to a reporter.\n\n\u201cWow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked \u2018have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cHe said strongly \u2018never, no.\u2019 He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director, just as Mr. Comey did. Mr. McCabe left those memos with the F.B.I., which means Mr. Mueller\u2019s team has access to them.\n\n\u201cSpent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?\u201d\n\nMichael R. Bromwich, Mr. McCabe\u2019s lawyer, fired back by accusing the president of corrupting the law enforcement system. \u201cWe will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe whole truth will come out in due course. But the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to Mr. McCabe\u2019s termination and has rendered it illegitimate.\u201d\n\nIn suggesting that Mr. Comey lied under oath to Congress, Mr. Trump appeared to refer to a comment by Mr. McCabe that the former director had authorized the news media interaction at the heart of the complaint against him. The president\u2019s Republican allies picked up the point on Sunday and pressed for appointment of a prosecutor to look at the origin of the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cSo we know that McCabe has lied\u201d because the inspector general concluded he had not been fully candid, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said on Fox News. \u201cNow he\u2019s saying about Comey \u2014 Comey may have lied as well. So I don\u2019t think this is the end of it. But that\u2019s why we need a second special counsel.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans, however, suggested that the Trump administration was going too far. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida criticized the decision to fire Mr. McCabe on a Friday night shortly before his retirement took effect, jeopardizing his pension.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the way it happened,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on NBC. \u201cHe should\u2019ve been allowed to finish through the weekend.\u201d Speaking of the president, he added: \u201cObviously he doesn\u2019t like McCabe and he\u2019s made that pretty clear now for over a year.

We have no actions at this time.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.\n\nHis comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.\n\nThe tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.\n\n\u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.\n\nDrew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.\n\nSeveral current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.\n\nBrad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d\n\nThe Post declined to comment.\n\nOne person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.\n\nThe president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThere was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.\n\nHow the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.\n\n\u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nBut the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.\n\nAT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.\n\nMr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.\n\nAmazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.\n\nThe size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.\n\nIn 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.\n\nBut when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "title": "Trump Attacks Amazon, Saying It Does Not Pay Enough Taxes", "authors": ["Michael D.

Business groups have warned that the effect could be felt across the global supply network as consumers face higher prices for automobiles, appliances and other goods. But Mr. Trump\u2019s aides dismissed such predictions as \u201cfake news\u201d and said most Americans would hardly notice any impact.\n\nThe United States issued the tariffs under a little-used provision of trade law, which allows the president to take broad action to defend American national security. The Commerce Department previously determined that imports of metals posed a threat to national security.\n\nThe United States is the largest steel importer in the world and the order could hit South Korea, China, Japan, Germany, Turkey and Brazil the hardest. Mr. Trump said his tariff orders were tailored to give him the authority to raise or lower levies on a country-by-country basis and add or take countries off the list as he deemed appropriate.\n\n\u201cThis has certainly put the fear of God in America\u2019s trading partners,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University. The tariffs disprove the notion that Congress and broader business interests would prevent the Trump administration from turning its saber-rattling into real sanctions, Mr. Prasad said. \u201cThe day has actually come when real trade sanctions are on the board.\u201d\n\nThe White House sought to soften the blow by temporarily exempting two key trading partners, Canada and Mexico, and opening the door to carve-outs for other countries. Mr. Trump said the order would temporarily exempt Canada and Mexico, pending discussions with both about the terms of trade, including already tense talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nOfficials from Canada and Mexico have said they will not be bullied into accepting a Nafta deal that could disadvantage their countries.\n\nChrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, called the initial exemption a \u201cstep forward\u201d but said it would not change Canada\u2019s negotiating approach to Nafta. In a statement, Mexico said those talks would not be subject to conditions outside the negotiating process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn language authorizing the tariffs, the White House said any nation with a security relationship with the United States was welcome to discuss \u201calternative ways to address the threatened impairment of the national security caused by imports from that country.\u201d Those talks could result in the tariff being lifted, the order said.\n\nMr. Trump said that Robert Lighthizer, the top United States trade negotiator, would be in charge of negotiating with countries asking for exemptions in the next 15 days.\n\nThe potential for exemptions is likely to incite a tsunami of lobbying and cajoling as foreign governments pressure the White House for a carve-out that could save them from steep tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to educating the Trump administration on the vital role the Japanese steel industry plays in the American marketplace,\u201d said Tadaaki Yamaguchi, a steel executive and the chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center. \u201cThe Japanese industry is not part of the import problem but a solution.\u201d\n\nWilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, will lead a parallel process that could result in the exemption of certain products made of steel and aluminum that American companies need, but that are not manufactured domestically. Products as varied as construction cranes and railroad ties are made with specialized steel that is not available widely, if at all, from United States manufacturers.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting earlier in the day, Mr. Trump singled out Australia as an example of another country that could be excluded, citing the trade surplus that the United States maintains with Australia, which imports more from America than it exports to the country.\n\nThe announced trade barriers came just hours after a group of countries signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping trade deal that no longer includes the United States. Mr. Trump, a fervent opponent of the deal, officially withdrew the United States from it on his fourth day in office.\n\nThe juxtaposition further highlighted the protectionist approach to trade policy that Mr. Trump has embraced, bucking years of America\u2019s embrace of free and open trade. Trade experts said the approach would ultimately compromise the United States\u2019 ability to temper China\u2019s unfair trading practices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe tariff action coupled with the mishandled renegotiations of existing trade deals have alienated the very countries we need as allies to help confront the challenges posed by China,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former Bush White House adviser.\n\nThe tariff announcement was poised to set off a wave of retaliation and suits against the United States at the World Trade Organization, as countries argue that they posed no security threat to the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If the United States ignores or withdraws from the group, it could precipitate a breakdown in global trading rules and a new era of global protectionism.\n\n\u201cIt opens up this horrible Pandora\u2019s box, and we don\u2019t know where that leaves other countries or where that leaves the W.T.O.,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nMario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Thursday that a plan to impose broad tariffs that hit allies was \u201cdangerous\u201d and could undermine national security.\n\n\u201cIf you put tariffs against your allies,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Frankfurt, \u201cone wonders who the enemies are.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday imploring him to drop plans for sweeping tariffs. A day earlier, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, announced his resignation after his failure to forestall the president from pursuing tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile many economists have said it is natural for a high-technology, highly developed economy like the United States to evolve away from raw industries, Mr. Trump presented the steel and aluminum sectors in romantic terms, signs of a muscular superpower that had been allowed to atrophy under his predecessors.\n\n\u201cSteel is steel,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country.\u201d\n\nHe invited a few of the steelworkers to make comments and they told stories of plants that have cut back or idled altogether. \u201cThese tariffs going into place, this gives us the ability to come back to 100 percent capacity,\u201d said Dustin Stevens, a worker at Century Aluminum\u2019s plant in Hawesville, Ky.\n\nCentury Aluminum has said that it will restart shuttered capacity at its Hawesville plant, adding nearly 300 workers this year. And on Wednesday, United States Steel said it would restart a blast furnace in Granite City, Ill., bringing back 500 workers to help meet additional orders that it expected as a result of the tariffs.\n\nBut economists warned of potential job losses from price increases, and other industries that send their products abroad denounced the risk of retaliation.\n\nJohn Heisdorffer, the president of the American Soybean Association, called the tariffs \u201ca disastrous course of action from the White House\u201d that could put farmers at risk at a time when the agriculture industry is already struggling. \u201cWe have heard directly from the Chinese that U.S. soybeans are prime targets for retaliation,\u201d he said. Soybeans are the United States\u2019 biggest agricultural export.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, said the United States was \u201con the verge of a painful and stupid trade war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just bad for farmers and ranchers in Nebraska who need to buy a new tractor, it\u2019s also bad for the moms and dads who will lose their manufacturing jobs because fewer people can buy a more expensive product,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he and his colleagues \u201care concerned about the scope of the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum and their impact on American citizens and businesses, including many I represent in Kentucky.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs of up to 30 percent. But facing an adverse ruling by the World Trade Organization and retaliation by trading partners, he lifted them 15 months before the end of the planned three-year duration. Studies found that more jobs were lost than saved and Republican leaders vowed not to repeat the experiment.\n\nThe Trade Partnership, a research firm cited by pro-trade advocates, has concluded the same would happen with Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs. It estimated that the tariffs would create 33,464 jobs in the metals sectors but cost 179,334 jobs in other sectors for a net loss of nearly 146,000.\n\nThe issue has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s own team. Mr. Ross, Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, the president\u2019s trade and manufacturing adviser, overcame objections from Mr. Cohn and national security officials like Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, who cautioned Mr. Trump that the plan would roil relations with important security allies.\n\nThe consequences of the split were on display at the cabinet meeting earlier in the day when Mr. Trump thanked Mr. Cohn for his service, but needled him about his decision to leave. \u201cHe may be a globalist, but I still like him,\u201d the president said as Mr. Cohn sat in a chair along the wall and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s seriously a globalist. There\u2019s no question. You know what? In his own way he\u2019s a nationalist, because he loves his country.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump then suggested that Mr. Cohn might eventually return to the administration. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019ll be back,\u201d the president said. In a teasing voice, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can put him in the same position though.

That was when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, a government panel that typically works behind closed doors and reviews deals only after they are announced, said it would stall Broadcom\u2019s bid because of national security concerns while it examined the deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom said it was reviewing Mr. Trump\u2019s order, and disputed the notion that the bid posed a security threat.\n\n\u201cBroadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,\u201d a company spokesman said in a statement.\n\nWhile Broadcom is based in Singapore, China was the main concern that drove Mr. Trump\u2019s decision over the Qualcomm deal, because allowing an American technology company to be acquired would cede its primacy in the semiconductor and wireless industry.\n\nSteven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, said in a statement that the decision was part of the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to take all actions necessary to protect the national security of the United States.\u201d\n\nHe said the order was based \u201con the facts and national security sensitivities related to this particular transaction only and is not intended to make any other statement about Broadcom or its employees, including its thousands of hard working and highly skilled U.S. employees.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the order will undoubtedly raise questions about the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to intervene in private-sector decisions. While Qualcomm opposed Broadcom\u2019s bid and had reached out to the foreign investment committee for a review, the proposal was nonetheless headed to the company\u2019s shareholders for a vote. The foreign investment committee intervened before that could happen, refusing to let the shareholder meeting take place until after it had a chance to investigate.\n\nJohn P.

The panel had said that the leadership of Qualcomm, which makes wireless chips and also licenses key wireless patents, was too important to let go of. The committee argued that economic leadership in next-generation high-speed mobile networks known as 5G, in which Qualcomm is a key player, was also a national security interest.\n\n\u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover,\u201d a United States Treasury official wrote in a letter to the companies last week.\n\nAs part of the presidential order, the United States also barred the 15 individuals who Broadcom had proposed for Qualcomm\u2019s board from running, saying they were \u201cdisqualified from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm.\u201d\n\nQualcomm acknowledged receiving the presidential order and said it had been told to reconvene its shareholder meeting at the earliest possible date, March 23.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA presidential action against foreign investment in an American company is rare and has only taken place four times in the past 30 years, according to the law firm Ropes & Gray. Scrutiny of foreign companies buying United States assets ramped up under President Barack Obama, including a presidential order barring a Chinese company from purchasing Aixtron, a German company with American assets, on national security grounds in 2016.\n\nUnder Mr. Trump, several deals involving foreign buyers have been squelched after a review by the foreign investment committee, including Moneygram\u2019s sale to an affiliate of the Alibaba Group and Lattice Semiconductor\u2019s sale to an investment firm with reported ties to the Chinese government. But the action against Broadcom was unusual because mergers are rarely killed before a publicly traded company\u2019s shareholders are given the chance to decide on the offer for themselves.\n\nThe decision was a blow to Broadcom, which under its chief executive, Hock Tan, has built itself up through several acquisitions. Mr. Tan had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration, including appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.\n\nBroadcom had at one point in its negotiations with Qualcomm also offered to raise its offer to acquire the company.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "To understand why, one needs to understand exactly what sanctuary laws do. They draw their name from the sanctuary movement of the 1980s. During that period, Central American refugees were routinely denied asylum because the United States government supported the regimes from which they had fled. In the face of this injustice, some religious leaders took steps to actively prevent federal immigration officers from arresting and deporting these vulnerable immigrants. It was, at times, a form of civil disobedience.\n\nToday\u2019s sanctuary laws, while bearing the same name, are markedly different. California and the hundreds of other places across the country with such laws and policies have done nothing whatsoever to actively interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Rather, the defining characteristic of these laws is their passivity. They do not direct state officers to take any steps to interfere with federal enforcement efforts. Instead, they dictate that the local police and state officers simply do not assist in the federal government\u2019s deportation agenda \u2014 that they do nothing.\n\nThis may sound like an overly formal distinction, since both efforts have made it harder for the federal government to deport people. To be sure, the decision of local and state officials not to lend their resources to immigration enforcement efforts means that either there will be fewer deportations or the deportations will be more expensive for the federal government. This is one reason these laws have so rankled Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuit emphasizes that immigration is a federal matter, that we must have a uniform scheme to oversee it and that this scheme is being undermined by sanctuary laws. In most states, federal immigration authorities are able to leverage state and local criminal justice systems. The Justice Department is arguing that California\u2019s refusal to participate requires it to adapt and employ different enforcement strategies.\n\nIt is fair to ask whether states should have the power to abstain from federal law enforcement programs that they view as immoral or adverse to their local interests. It is not, however, a new question.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Can\u2019t Stop the Sanctuary Movement", "authors": []}

That plant, in the city of Zouping 90 miles away, takes raw aluminum and turns it into car parts. Most of those won\u2019t be affected by the tariffs.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cEvery day here, the factory is working as usual,\u201d said Geng Peiguo, a 67-year-old in a reflective yellow safety vest who cleans the street in front of the parts factory. A loud clanging emerged from the factory, which was the size of several football fields.\n\nEven before the tariffs, China\u2019s vast steel exports to the rest of the world were falling, stemmed by Beijing\u2019s efforts to shrink the industry as well as by improved demand at home. China\u2019s aluminum exports are rising, but at only a fraction of their earlier pace.\n\nChina will not give up its old ways overnight, as some local officials look to bolster local employment and short-term economic growth. Even as the Chengkouzhen factory lies dormant, more raw aluminum operations are set to open. Morgan Stanley, the American bank, estimates that Chinese aluminum companies are set to expand capacity by 11 percent, though it noted that the government might discourage some of those projects.\n\n\n\nLast year, Beijing propped up the publicly traded subsidiary of debt-laden Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, converting about $2 billion in loans into equity to be held by China\u2019s state-controlled firms. The move was part of a broader effort to keep debt from hobbling the economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, China contends that it is addressing its wasteful factory problem and that American tariffs are unnecessary. Last week, the government-controlled association that oversees aluminum production called for retaliation against a wide variety of American products.\n\nChina accounts for only a small fraction of American aluminum and steel imports. As with the steel industry, aluminum manufacturers in the United States say China sends its cheap aluminum to other markets. That drives down global prices, and prompts producers elsewhere, notably Canada, to ship more to the United States instead.\n\nOther Shores China produces more than half of the world's steel and aluminum but exports only small amounts to the United States, thanks to strong demand at home, existing American tariffs and other reasons.

Qixing ran out of money after it overextended itself into real estate and other businesses. Last year it looked as if it might close.\n\nThe two factories then met different fates.\n\nIn Zouping, after some workers demonstrated, local officials stepped in. They helped provide two-thirds pay for the workers and get the company partly back in operation, according to two people familiar with the payments who asked not to be identified because the local authorities consider the matter sensitive.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile it is not clear how many people Qixing employs in Zouping, the aluminum industry is a major presence. Factories owned by Qixing and others get power from a chain of huge coal-fired plants sporting 13 hourglass-shaped, 300-foot-tall cooling towers, about six times as many as a traditional coal plant. An overhead cobweb of ultra-high-voltage power lines connects the power stations to the city\u2019s voracious aluminum smelters.\n\nThe Zouping factory\u2019s workers are still nervous. They worry that the American tariffs will end up hitting the business, or that the government may decide to let the factory close after all. While the factory remains open, two of the four kilns at Qixing\u2019s smelter in Zouping have been shut down.\n\n\u201cIf Qixing goes bankrupt and my husband is laid off, how could we make a living?\u201d said Liu Guifang, a full-time mother whose husband and sister work for Qixing. \u201cI have a 13-year-old daughter and a 1-year-old son.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At a signing ceremony for one of those bills in June, Mr. Trump said his secretary did not have to worry about hearing the president\u2019s old reality-show catchphrase, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never have to use those words on our David,\u201d Mr. Trump said, pointing his finger at the secretary like a pistol. \u201cWe will never use those words on you, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The report found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d related to the trip and concluded that the secretary spent much of it sightseeing and improperly accepted a gift of Wimbledon tickets.\n\nThe report in hand, Dr. Shulkin\u2019s critics in the White House and the department \u2014 including his two top communications deputies \u2014 worked behind the scenes to try to hasten his ouster. Dr. Shulkin, who disputed the report\u2019s findings, went public with fears that appointees were \u201ctrying to undermine the department from within.\u201d He iced out those he viewed as a threat and essentially became his own one-person press office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs recently as last week, after a series of meetings with John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Dr. Shulkin publicly declared victory, hinting that he had the White House\u2019s support to remove officials battling him.\n\nThe secretary appeared to be regaining his footing. He sat at Mr. Trump\u2019s side during a cabinet meeting, and the two men together called Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, the chairman of the Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee, to pledge their support for his more moderate health care legislation, according to a congressional aide briefed on the call. The secretary maintains the support of top Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut top White House officials have only become more irked with the secretary\u2019s penchant for publicly discussing internal politics, and Mr. Trump has begun searching for a replacement.\n\nMr. Perry is seen as a more pliant figure for the veterans affairs position. Unlike Dr. Shulkin, who had run the department\u2019s health care system under President Barack Obama and spent a career in hospital administration, Mr. Perry has no background in health care delivery, but as Texas\u2019 governor, he showed a willingness to experiment.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to make the move, possible replacements for Mr. Perry could include Ray Washburne, a Dallas entrepreneur and prominent Republican fund-raiser; J. Larry Nichols, the former chairman of Devon Energy; and T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, according to people who work closely with senior officials at the department and the White House.", "title": "Trump Eyes Replacing His Veterans Affairs Secretary With His Energy Chief", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Nicholas Fandos"]}

Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices.\n\nThe \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students.\n\nIn recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums.\n\nAt a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out.\n\nSince the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline.\n\nBut proponents argued that racial bias was well documented.\n\nWhen the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American.\n\n\u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions.\n\n\u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nIn recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d\n\nIn a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year.\n\nWhile Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded.\n\nThe Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d", "title": "Trump Finds Unlikely Culprit in School Shootings: Obama Discipline Policies", "authors": ["Erica L.

Mr. Tillerson said he planned to immediately step aside from his post, turning over all responsibilities by the end of the day to John J. Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state.\n\nDuring a short statement in a briefing room packed with reporters, Mr. Tillerson said he would end his service at midnight on March 31, but was encouraging his policy planning team and under secretaries and assistant secretaries \u201cto remain in their posts and continue in our mission at the State Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll now return to private life, as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I had to serve my country,\u201d Mr. Tillerson said. He took no questions and left the briefing room.\n\nThe firing of Mr. Tillerson caught even the White House staff by surprise. Just the day before, a White House spokesman berated a reporter for suggesting there was any kind of split between Mr. Tillerson and the White House because of disparate comments on Russian responsibility for a poison attack in Britain.\n\nBut a senior administration official said that Mr. Trump decided to replace Mr. Tillerson now to have a new team in place before upcoming talks with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader he plans to meet by May. The president also wanted a new chief diplomat for various ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nThe White House\u2019s purge extended to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s inner circle. The under secretary of state for public affairs, Steve Goldstein, was fired, and the status was unclear of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, and his deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson was at the State Department on Tuesday and spoke to reporters, saying that he would surrender his authority at midnight and resign officially at the end of the month.\n\nAt the C.I.A., Mr. Pompeo will be replaced by the current deputy director, Gina Haspel, who will be the first woman to head the spy agency. Both she and Mr. Pompeo would need confirmation by the Senate to take the positions.\n\nMr. Tillerson has been out of favor with Mr. Trump for months but had resisted being pushed out. His distance from Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle was clear last week when the president accepted an invitation to meet with Mr. Kim, to Mr. Tillerson\u2019s surprise.\n\nMr. Trump said Mr. Pompeo \u201chas earned the praise of members in both parties by strengthening our intelligence gathering, modernizing our defensive and offensive capabilities, and building close ties with our friends and allies in the international intelligence community.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have gotten to know Mike very well over the past 14 months, and I am confident he is the right person for the job at this critical juncture,\u201d the president continued, in a written statement distributed by the White House. \u201cHe will continue our program of restoring America\u2019s standing in the world, strengthening our alliances, confronting our adversaries, and seeking the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\u201d\n\nIn a Twitter post, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, warned that the turnover at the top of the State Department had diminished the United States with foreign leaders.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a former congressman, has become a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s, impressing the president with his engaging approach during morning intelligence briefings. But he also, at times, has been at odds with the president \u2014 including agreeing with a C.I.A. assessment about Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nIn picking Ms. Haspel to succeed Mr. Pompeo at the C.I.A., Mr. Trump opted for continuity rather than bringing in an outsider. At one point last fall, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of the president\u2019s closest Republican allies on Capitol Hill, had been tentatively tapped as the front-runner to run the agency if Mr. Pompeo moved up, but the idea later faded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of the oil giant Exxon Mobil, had once been viewed as an intriguing, if unorthodox, cabinet choice. He had deep experience with Middle Eastern potentates, and knew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia through Exxon\u2019s extensive efforts to explore for oil in Russia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut the early enthusiasm for bringing a business sensibility to the State Department faded fast, as Mr. Tillerson seemed overwhelmed by the diplomatic challenges before him and isolated by career foreign service officers whom he often froze out of the most important debates.\n\nHis profound disagreements with the president on policy appeared to be his undoing: Mr. Tillerson wanted to remain part of the Paris climate accord; Mr. Trump decided to leave it. Mr. Tillerson supported the continuation of the Iran nuclear deal; Mr. Trump loathed the deal as \u201can embarrassment to the United States.\u201d And Mr. Tillerson believed in dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, but Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened military options.\n\nVeteran diplomats said they could not remember a time when a president so regularly undermined his secretary of state so brazenly in the midst of a tense situation. Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served many Republican presidents, last fall urged Mr. Tillerson to quit.\n\n\u201cRex Tillerson has been dealt a bad hand by the Potus & has played it badly,\u201d Mr. Haass wrote in a post on Twitter, using the acronym for president of the United States. \u201cFor both reasons he cannot be effective SecState & should resign.\u201d\n\nCareer diplomats, who had seen in the gravelly voiced Mr. Tillerson a man of stature, experience and great wealth whom they hoped the president would respect and heed, eventually turned against him as he expressed more interest in shrinking the department than expanding American influence.\n\nWhile other cabinet officers made their goals plain, Mr. Tillerson never set clear diplomatic priorities other than to pursue Mr. Trump\u2019s slogan of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d a term he never really defined. In an odd admission more than eight months into the job, Mr. Tillerson told employees in September that his top priority was to make the State Department more efficient. Yet he never fully addressed what diplomats should be doing with that greater efficiency.\n\nCongress rebelled, declining to endorse his suggested 30 percent cuts in the State Department\u2019s budget. But the message of his tenure seemed clear: At a moment when money was being poured into the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, diplomacy seemed less valued than at any time in recent American history.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe turning point for Mr. Tillerson came when NBC News reported that he had called the president a \u201cmoron,\u201d leading him to take the extraordinary step of holding a news conference to affirm his support for Mr. Trump and insist that he had never considered resigning.\n\nDuring a trip to Beijing in September, Mr. Tillerson told reporters that he already had \u201ca couple, three\u201d lines into North Korea to get communication started with the United States. Mr. Trump erupted the next morning, and denigrated the effort on Twitter by saying Mr. Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave your energy Rex,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019ll do what has to be done!\u201d Mr. Trump later said he wished his secretary of state were tougher. The Chinese were left to wonder why Mr. Trump sent an emissary whose message the president did not believe in.\n\nPart of the reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s eruption then was that Mr. Tillerson\u2019s suggestion of secret talks with North Korea surprised President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who called the White House to complain, according to people with knowledge of the exchange. That Mr. Tillerson failed to take into account Seoul\u2019s possible reaction was one of several embarrassing stumbles, arising from his own inexperience and decision to insulate himself from the department\u2019s diplomatic corps.\n\nWith his ousting, Mr. Tillerson joins a long list of Trump administration appointees who have left or been fired, including the president\u2019s first national security adviser, chief of staff, chief strategist, press secretary, two White House communications directors and secretary of health and human services.\n\nMr. Tillerson had some successes, including the growing international isolation of North Korea and improved ties between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. But he is likely to go down as among the least successful secretaries of state in history, and one big reason was his poor management of his relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nAlthough Mr. Tillerson spent his first months on the job getting to know Mr. Trump at lunches, dinners and White House get-togethers, the two never established a comfortable rapport.\n\nOnce the head of the Boy Scouts of America, Mr. Tillerson was outraged when the president spoke to the Boy Scouts in July and turned it into a political event. When Mr. Trump declined to denounce white nationalists who paraded in Charlottesville in August, Mr. Tillerson made it clear that Mr. Trump \u201cspeaks for himself\u201d \u2014 not his secretary of state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe growing distance between the men was on clear display during Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Asia in November, when Mr. Tillerson visited the prison that once housed Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is a frequent critic of the president.\n\nBut perhaps the most puzzling part of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure was his poor oversight of the State Department. As a former top business executive, his managerial skills were thought to be his chief asset.\n\nBut he failed to quickly pick a trusted team of leaders, left many critical departments without direction and all but paralyzed crucial decision making in the department.\n\nHe approved one global conclave in Washington just eight days before the event was to start, ensuring that few leaders from around the world were able to attend. He rarely sat for comprehensive briefings with many of his top diplomats and often failed to consult the State Department\u2019s experts on countries before visiting.\n\nForeign diplomats \u2014 starting with the British and the French \u2014 said Mr. Tillerson neither returned phone calls nor, with much advance warning, set up meetings with his counterparts. Strategic dialogues with many nations, including nuclear weapons powers like Pakistan, were ended without explanation.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s policymaking process devolved into conversations between Mr. Tillerson and a lone top aide, neither of whom had much experience or knowledge about many of the countries they discussed.\n\nMr. Tillerson became so isolated that even top administration officials like Mr. Pompeo and allies like Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state whose recommendation was crucial to his selection, had trouble penetrating a phalanx of staff to speak to him directly.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between top management and the bulk of the State Department was toxic,\u201d said Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, a former senior diplomat and fellow at the Washington Institute who once worked with Mr. Tillerson. \u201cAnd that was a total mystery because the people at the State Department would work for the devil if he is advancing American interests, which Mr. Tillerson was.\u201d", "title": "Trump Fires Rex Tillerson and Will Replace Him With C.I.A.

She entered her password as the alert requested. It turned out to be a phishing attack, according to the lawsuit, and the information she provided was used to get access to her account, Mr. Broidy\u2019s and that of his company, Broidy Capital Management.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the emails began appeared in the news media, Mr. Broidy retained a team of cyberforensic experts, including at least one former American intelligence official. According to the lawsuit, their initial analysis indicated that the attacks appeared to originate from computer servers in Britain and the Netherlands, but the researchers later concluded that the addresses of those servers had been used to mask another point of origin.\n\n\u201cA more thorough review of the server data\u201d showed that for a brief time on one day \u2014 Feb. 14, 2018 \u2014 \u201cproblems with the attackers obfuscation techniques\u201d had \u201crevealed that the attack originated in Qatar.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that a Republican lobbyist, Nicolas D.

Stonington Strategies is registered as a foreign agent of Qatar, and the lawsuit says that Qatar pays him $300,000 a month.

Among the biggest concerns have been access to its markets for American exports of automobiles and agricultural products.\n\nThe reduction of trade deficits have been a priority for the United States; in 2016, it had a $17 billion trade deficit with South Korea.\n\nIn a statement published on Monday, the South Korean Trade Ministry said it had agreed to adhere to a quota of 2.68 million tons of steel exports to the United States a year, which it said was roughly equivalent to 70 percent of its annual average sent to the United States from 2015 to 2017. It also agreed to lower trade barriers to vehicles imported from the United States. Trump administration officials cited what they considered unfair barriers against American-made cars when they began last year to pressure South Korea to amend the trade pact.\n\nIn return, the Trade Ministry said, South Korea would be exempt from the steel tariffs.\n\nUnder the deal, the number of vehicles the United States can export to South Korea without meeting local safety requirements would double to 50,000.\n\nCars are a major reason for Seoul\u2019s trade surplus with Washington. Brands like Hyundai and Kia have found ready markets in the United States, but the big American automakers have complained that restrictions keep them from trying to make the same headway in South Korean. The agreement is also expected to allow the United States to extend the tariffs that it imposes on Korean pickup trucks to 2041. The tariffs are currently scheduled to be phased out in 2021.\n\nKim Hyun-chong, South Korea\u2019s trade minister, told journalists on Monday, however, that there would be no further opening of his country\u2019s agricultural markets, and no changes to tariffs that had already been lifted.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Several said the increased auto import numbers did not guarantee that automakers would be able to crack the Korean market, which is notoriously hostile to foreign cars.\n\nOthers expressed cautious optimism.\n\n\u201cAs with all trade agreements, the details are important, so I want to see the specific concessions we secured from Korea \u2014 especially on steel,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. He added that it was \u201cgood news\u201d that Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, \u201cappears to have taken steps to make the Korea agreement better for U.S. workers and auto companies while also getting the Koreans to limit their steel exports to the U.S.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs \u2014 set in motion by a Commerce Department declaration that steel and aluminum imports posed a national security threat because they degraded the American industrial base \u2014 prompted American allies and trading partners including Australia, the European Union and Japan, as well as South Korea, to jostle for exemptions. But the impact of the tariffs may not be as great as expected, since most of the biggest suppliers of foreign metals have been granted at least temporary exemptions.\n\nSouth Korea was the third-biggest exporter of steel to the United States in 2016, after Canada and the European Union. Mr. Lighthizer said last week that those three trading partners, along with Argentina, Australia and Brazil, would initially receive a reprieve from the tariffs.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact last year and said that he would focus on negotiating new bilateral deals with countries around the world. The steel tariffs are speeding up that process, and Mr. Mnuchin signaled on Sunday that more deals were on the way.\n\n\u201cWhere we\u2019ve put a pause on tariffs, we\u2019re negotiating,\u201d he said.", "title": "Trump Gets First Major Trade Deal as South Korea Looks to Avoid Tariffs", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Jim Tankersley"]}

Not from Russian bots or targeted social media ad buys, but from a prime-time show that sold itself as real, and sold him as a business genius. Forget unhappy blue collar heartlanders; forget white nationalists and birthers: The core Trump demographic might just have been Republicans who watched \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d who bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them.\n\nThat was step one in the Trump hack of television media. Step two was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign. Yes, his fame also boosted him on social media, but there you can partially blame algorithms and the unwisdom of crowds; with television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump\u2019s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.\n\nNothing that Cambridge Analytica did to help the Trump campaign target swing voters (and there\u2019s reason to think it didn\u2019t do as much as it claimed) had anything remotely like the impact of this #alwaysTrump tsunami, which probably added up to more than $2 billion in effective advertising for his campaign during the primary season, a flood that drowned all of his rivals\u2019 pathetic tens of millions. And as cynical as I believe the lords of Silicon Valley to be, the more important cynicism in 2016 belonged to those television execs who were fine with enabling the wild Trumpian takeover of the G.O.P., because after all Republicans deserved it and Hillary was sure to beat him in the end.\n\nExcept that she didn\u2019t beat him, in part because he also exploited the polarization that cable news, in particular, is designed to feed. In 2016 this polarization didn\u2019t just mean that Fox became steadily more pro-Trump as he dispatched his G.O.P. rivals; it also meant that a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn\u2019t pro-Trump enough.\n\nThe depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office. But especially once he won the nomination this skepticism was often filtered out of cable coverage, because the important thing was to maintain the partisan shouting-match model. This in turn encouraged a sense that this was just a typical right-versus-left election, in which you should vote for Trump if you usually voted for Republicans \u2026 and in the end that\u2019s what most G.O.P. voters did.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Hacked the Media Right Before Our Eyes", "authors": []}

Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a co-author of a 2017 book of policy recommendations on how to reduce trade imbalances.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cThe trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.\n\nA year ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative to conduct a 90-day review on the causes of America\u2019s persistent trade deficits. That review has not yet been released. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that the trade deficit grew to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, up from 2.7 percent the year before.\n\nThe deficit in goods alone with China grew to $375 billion last year, an 8 percent increase from 2016.\n\nThe deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.\n\nThe tangible source of America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China\u2019s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.\n\nWhen it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. \u201cChina did not keep up its end of the bargain,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. \u201cIt did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis \u2014 2000 until the end of that decade \u2014 they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.\n\n\u201cA bilateral balance doesn\u2019t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,\u201d said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, \u201cjust like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn\u2019t tell you anything about whether I\u2019m in debt.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s own Council of Economic Advisers, in a report last month, seemed to play down alarms over bilateral trade deficits. \u201cThe United States has a bilateral goods deficit and a services surplus with many of its major trading partners,\u201d council members wrote. \u201cOverall, the United States has a goods deficit and a services surplus with the world. The services surplus is consistent with the structure of the private sector, which has evolved during the last few decades toward more services output as a share of G.D.P.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries\u2019 currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.\n\nMr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America\u2019s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.\n\n\u201cThere are things we could do,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I hate to recommend them when we\u2019re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, he noted, recently signed sweeping tax cuts that will add an estimated $1 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years, even after accounting for the faster growth it could bring.", "title": "Trump Hates the Trade Deficit.

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "After a week marked by persistent scandals and high-profile staff departures, policy was not at the forefront of the president\u2019s mind. Mr. Trump seemed intently focused on delivering his own progress report to supporters on a range of red-meat issues, including his zeal for improving border security, his promise to construct a border wall with Mexico, his administration\u2019s efforts to roll back what he called \u201cjob killing\u201d regulations and his thwarting of Democrats.\n\n\u201cReally, I have gotten done much more than I promised,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe did a lot of things I didn\u2019t even promise.\u201d\n\nIn the driving rain, Mr. Trump made his way to the training center, where he had been scheduled to sell an ambitious plan that would try to leverage $200 billion in federal spending to generate $1.5 trillion in total spending on projects such as tunnels, bridges and highways. White House officials had framed the event as a ramp-up, but this conflicted with the president\u2019s decision to say he would push the plan to next year, declaring that he did not expect it to pass at least until after the November midterm elections.\n\nAlso curiously, Mr. Trump spent little time on the trade deal struck with South Korea this week, which had been a win for his administration. That continued a relatively muted celebration: The announcement of that agreement\u2019s details came not from Mr. Trump or his White House, but from South Korean officials; Trump administration officials unveiled the plan days later in a conference call with reporters.\n\nInstead, Mr. Trump disparaged a previous version of a South Korea trade agreement as a \u201chorror show\u201d and a \u201cHillary Clinton special.\u201d He mused to the crowd that he might hold up finalizing the deal while he pursues planned talks with North Korea.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the rhetoric has calmed down just a little bit, would you say?\u201d Mr. Trump asked the crowd. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it all turns out.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seemed to veer off script in other areas as well. At one point, he suggested that he planned to pull American troops out of Syria, where they have aided a military campaign that has recaptured the vast majority of the territory once controlled by the Islamic State, or ISIS. \u201cWe\u2019re knocking the hell out of ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon.

As recently as Tuesday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that while American forces were no longer in \u201can offensive effort on the ground\u201d and had \u201cdrawn off slightly\u201d to avoid accidental conflict with Russian troops, they continued to play a role. \u201cWe continue the operations in Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSome foreign policy specialists said a complete withdrawal of American troops from Syria would leave a dangerous void. \u201cIf we\u2019re pulling those troops out, we\u2019re ceding the remnants of Syria to the Russians and the Iranians and the other actors, which actually I would argue would be a big victory for Russia,\u201d said Jamie M. Fly, a Republican scholar at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\nMr. Trump eventually focused on infrastructure on Thursday, zeroing in on his plan to speed up permitting. But the subject and timing of the president\u2019s focus on his plan, announced in February, are curious. Congressional Republicans have not shown much appetite for taking up the infrastructure package, and neither have Democrats, who prefer proposals with much more federal spending.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged some of that reality in his remarks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get Democrat support very much,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to wait until after the election.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have not mounted any sort of effort, in public or private, that matches the scale of the pressure campaign they employed before the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s signature tax cut package last year. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of the infrastructure proposal, Gary D. Cohn, recently left his post as director of the National Economic Council. His successor, Larry Kudlow, is less enthusiastic about increases in federal infrastructure spending.\n\nThe administration envisions states, local governments and the private sector contributing the bulk of the funds, a recipe that experts doubt would result in anywhere close to the targeted level of investment.\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has lobbied for a large infrastructure bill, said he was skeptical that the president\u2019s visit would spur any action.\n\n\u201cHe and Congress didn\u2019t blink whenever they shelled out a trillion and a half dollars in tax giveaways for the rich,\u201d Mr. Trumka said, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t seen a nickel yet for infrastructure. He can talk about it forever, but he\u2019s got to do something.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, echoed that sentiment on Thursday. \u201cDemocrats are eager to work with the administration on infrastructure,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s been a lack of seriousness on this issue from the White House.\u201d", "title": "Trump Heralds South Korea Trade Deal, Then Says He Might Delay It", "authors": ["Katie Rogers", "Jim Tankersley"]}

The president has steadily winnowed free-trade advocates from the ranks of his cabinet, and these measures are unlikely to draw the wall of opposition from Republicans that the metal tariffs did.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement brought some clarity to a process that the White House has largely conducted in secret, since the president announced an investigation of China\u2019s trade practices last summer.

Those include electric vehicles, high-tech shipping and aerospace technology. He called them \u201cthe ones I care about.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Lighthizer and his colleague, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, faced a barrage of questions and criticism from lawmakers, several of whom worried about Chinese retaliation.\n\n\u201cA state like Iowa stands to lose,\u201d particularly if China targets soybean exports, said Senator Charles E.

Such a move could set off alarms among Republicans in Congress, who have largely stood by as the president repeatedly assailed the Justice Department and the F.B.I.\n\nMr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking on behalf of the president but later backed off that assertion. He did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation, saying only: \u201cJust end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the president were skeptical that Mr. Dowd was acting on his own.

Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to end an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The special counsel is investigating both matters.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey\u2019s account.\n\nMr. McCabe\u2019s lawyers had no comment on Saturday, and Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly defended the special counsel, including in an interview this month with USA Today, in which he said he had seen no need to fire Mr. Mueller.\n\nMr. Comey, who has a book scheduled to be published next month, weighed in himself.\n\n\u201cMr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cAnd they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s supporters have tried to undercut the investigation as part of a broader attempt to clear him of wrongdoing.

His legal team has worked to keep him from firing Mr. Mueller in the past. To keep the president at bay, the lawyers \u2014 led by the White House lawyer Ty Cobb \u2014 told him that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation would be over by last December and that they would ask Mr. Mueller to put out a statement saying the president was not a target of the investigation.\n\nBut instead, Mr. Trump was livid anew this week over the Times report that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records, including those related to Russia, according to one person close to the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s lawyers appear to be feeling increasingly uneasy about where they stand. This month, Mr. Trump met with a veteran Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, to discuss coming on board to take over the president\u2019s dealings with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office and possibly replacing Donald F. McGahn II as White House counsel. The president\u2019s personal lawyers, Mr. Dowd and Jay Sekulow, did not know about the meeting, prompting concerns that they could be pushed aside, and potentially making them less resistant to Mr. Trump\u2019s whims about handling the inquiry.\n\nLast June, Mr. Trump backed down from his demand that Mr. Mueller be fired after Mr. McGahn threatened to quit. A month later, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. After the Trump Organization subpoena was revealed on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers privately tried to play it down, in part to keep the president and his family calm.\n\nMr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing episodes in recent months. In December, he said he had written a tweet posted by the president that implied Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Flynn had lied to the F.B.I. when Mr. Trump fired him.\n\nMonths earlier, Mr. Dowd was overheard by a Times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president\u2019s legal team over lunch at a Washington steakhouse.\n\nDemocrats seized on Mr. Dowd\u2019s statement on Saturday.

But he also has to protect the U.S. And he feels that many countries\u201d have engaged in unfair trade practices. Mr. Kudlow cited China as a prominent example, expressing a view that is widely held within the administration. The White House has taken a series of steps to curb China and is expected to announce tariffs on certain Chinese products in the coming weeks.\n\nMr. Kudlow has long espoused a traditional conservative embrace of free trade, but it remains to be seen how vocally he will push back on the growing ascendance of West Wing advisers who are trade skeptics and have urged Mr. Trump to adopt protectionist measures to protect American industry.\n\nStock markets, which have been rattled by the White House tariffs, did not react positively to news of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s appointment on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 200 points for most of the afternoon, once news media outlets began reporting Mr. Kudlow was the pick.\n\nMr. Kudlow is a radio and television commentator and an economics consultant. He was a zealous convert to the supply-side economic policies that swept the Republican Party in the late 1970s. He is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the supply-side economist Arthur Laffer, with whom Mr. Kudlow worked on Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 presidential campaign.

In the early 1990s, Mr. Kudlow took a leave from the firm to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; his colleagues said he abused cocaine.\n\nMr. Kudlow has spoken frequently about his addiction and ensuing sobriety in the ensuing years.\n\nHe said Thursday that staying clean and sober for nearly 23 years \u201cis the center of my life\u201d and \u201cmy No. 1 job.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he thought the substance abuse could prove problematic for him as a White House staff nominee, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see how that plays out.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The men agreed on their desire for growth-goosing tax cuts but disagreed on trade, on which Mr. Trump ran as a populist and Mr. Kudlow preached free-market principles.\n\nMr. Kudlow criticized the president after the emergence of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in October 2016. He later re-endorsed him, but Mr. Trump, who nurses grudges, was angry for some time, according to people close to him.\n\n\n\nThe trade critique carried into Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure in the White House. Like Mr. Cohn, Mr. Kudlow had been publicly critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s push for stiff and sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He jointly wrote a critical column urging the president to reconsider his plan to impose tariffs. \u201cTrump should also examine the historical record on tariffs,\u201d he and his co-authors wrote, \u201cbecause they have almost never worked as intended and almost always deliver an unhappy ending.\u201d\n\nMr. Kudlow said Wednesday that although he had little stomach for blanket tariffs, he was \u201cabsolutely delighted\u201d that Mr. Trump had softened his stance since first announcing global tariffs on steel and aluminum. \u201cWe talked a lot about that,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said, adding that Mr. Trump \u201cregards tariffs as a negotiating tool. And I think that\u2019s fair.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump indicated on Tuesday that he saw little disagreement with Mr. Kudlow on the issue of tariffs.\n\n\u201cI want to have a divergent opinion,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cWe agree on most. He now has come around to believing in tariffs as also a negotiating point. I\u2019m renegotiating trade deals and without tariffs we wouldn\u2019t do nearly as well. But Larry has been a friend of mine for a long time. He backed me very early in the campaign; I think the earliest; I think he was one of my original backers. He\u2019s a very, very talented man, a good man.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Mr. Kudlow can navigate the chaos that has surrounded the White House and often clouded its message or if he can convince Mr. Trump to follow his advice. Mr. Kudlow said he plans to try.\n\n\u201cI expect to have a very disciplined process,\u201d he said, one that \u201cprovides the best policy advice possible to the president.\u201d\n\nStephen Moore, a longtime friend of Mr. Kudlow\u2019s and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said Mr. Kudlow would help with a pressing challenge: How to convince voters to credit the president, and his policies, for an improving economy. Surveys of businesses and voters show economic confidence is strong, but Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings are still hovering around 40 percent.\n\n\u201cThe communication of all these triumphs has not been fully communicated,\u201d said Mr. Moore, whom many expect to ultimately go to work with Mr. Kudlow at the N.E.C.\n\nAfter Republicans pushed a $1.5 trillion cut through Congress late last year, Mr. Kudlow praised it effusively, predicting it would usher in long-term annual growth of 3 percent to 4 percent \u2014 a more optimistic assessment than most independent economists have offered \u2014 and would help Republicans in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nGene Sperling, a former N.E.C. director under President Bill Clinton and again under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Kudlow would have a difficult job \u2014 and that communicating happy economic news was the least of his tasks.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental job of the N.E.C. director is to ensure that the president is getting, in a fair way, the diverse advice of his economic cabinet, and to be the top economic person in the West Wing in advising the president on day by day and long term matters,\u201d Mr. Sperling said. \u201cHowever good Larry may be on TV, it would be very, very sad if the president looked at this job as fundamentally promoting with the media whatever the president\u2019s political interests are.\u201d", "title": "Trump Picks CNBC\u2019s Larry Kudlow as Top Economic Adviser", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Kate Kelly", "Jim Tankersley"]}
{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "The effect of the China tariffs would be larger and more concentrated than the steel and aluminum measures and would have a bigger impact on United States consumers, who are heavy purchasers of electronics, clothing and other Chinese imports. The steel and aluminum tariffs would affect imports of roughly $33 billion, excluding Canada and Mexico, which are expected to be exempt from the measures, said Joseph Parilla of the Brookings Institution. The China moves would affect at least $50 billion a year in imports, officials said.\n\nChinese companies have also been placing big bets on American companies. New Chinese acquisition deals in the United States once totaled tens of billions of dollars annually, according to Rhodium Group, which tracks Chinese investments abroad, though last year they fell sharply to $8.7 billion as China cracked down on money leaving its borders.\n\nChinese companies have purchased many nonstrategic assets like movie theaters and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. But they also sought out deals in cutting-edge areas like semiconductors and start-ups related to autonomous driving as China looked to upgrade its technological capabilities. China sees the American stranglehold on fundamental technologies as a long-term economic and security threat to its rise as a superpower.\n\nUnlike the metal tariffs, which caused bitter divisions within the Trump administration and were opposed by many Republican lawmakers and businesspeople, the technology moves against China are likely to be politically popular on Capitol Hill and throughout some industries.\n\n\u201cTheir theft costs us over $350 billion per year, so the bigger the better,\u201d said Daniel DiMicco, a steel executive and trade adviser to the Trump campaign, referring to the forced transfer of intellectual property and other unfair practices alleged by the administration.\n\nThe business community, which long defended trade with China despite accusations of theft of intellectual property, has grown more dissatisfied with adverse treatment in the Chinese economy. With the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises playing an ever-larger role in the market, the environment for American companies has steadily deteriorated.\n\nStill, American business groups expressed concern over the possibility that the United States tariffs would spur others around the world to raise their own trade barriers.", "title": "Trump Plans Stiff Trade Tariffs and Other Penalties on China", "authors": []}

Mr. Cohn, who argued that tariffs would create a global trade war, found himself overshadowed by a group of more protectionist-minded advisers who have urged the president to follow through with the get-tough pledges he made during his campaign.\n\nThose advisers have been in ascendence, including Mr. Navarro, a trade skeptic who had been sidelined by Mr. Cohn. Mr. Navarro was recently promised a promotion and made the rounds on Sunday talk shows to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policy. Mr. Ross succeeded in moving up last week\u2019s announcement, over the objections of Mr. Cohn. Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative who has pushed trading partners to accede to the country\u2019s demands, has become a trusted adviser to the president.\n\nThat group has a much more binary view of trade, seeing it as a zero-sum game in which the United States is losing. The advisers have pushed the president to withdraw from trade deals like Nafta and to carry out the type of stiff tariffs that Mr. Trump seems poised to impose on steel and aluminum imports. They see the United States\u2019 ballooning trade deficit, which hit a nine-year high on Wednesday, as evidence that more needs to be done to put the country on the winning end of global trade.\n\nThe rise of the populist faction is already fanning fears on Wall Street and among foreign officials that Mr. Trump could start and escalate a global trade war or take a more combative stance toward trading partners and international groups like the World Trade Organization. Foreign officials viewed Mr. Cohn as a reliable ally on global economic issues and as someone who could express their views to the president.\n\nThe prospect of approaching tariffs has set off furious lobbying from governments around the world, who have tried to sway the administration with offers of friendship and threats of retaliation. On Wednesday, the European Union released a list of American-made goods it would penalize if the tariffs went through.\n\nChina cautioned that it was prepared to \u201cmake an appropriate and necessary response\u201d should the United States impose the tariffs.\n\n\u201cChoosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,\u201d China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said during a news conference on Thursday in Beijing. \u201cIn the end, you will only hurt others and yourself.\u201d", "title": "Trump Prepares to Formalize Tariffs but Floats Exemptions", "authors": []}

Solomon for the job, Goldman seems to be signaling that, even if trading revenue revives after some difficult quarters, it intends to press on with its efforts to bolster its nontrading businesses, like lending to corporations and consumers. Mr. Solomon, after a successful run as the head of Goldman\u2019s powerful deal-making business, embodies in many ways the bank\u2019s hopes to be far more than a high-octane trading shop.\n\nOf course, if the Trump administration guts Wall Street regulations, particularly the Volcker Rule, Goldman may be tempted to pile back into trading. But the bank\u2019s recent track record in trading suggests that would not be a good idea.\n\nNot only does Goldman\u2019s business that trades bonds, derivatives, currencies and commodities bounce around too much for shareholders\u2019 tastes, it is opaque. Bank executives are often loath to talk in detail when it underperforms.\n\nGoldman also made strategic mistakes in this business in recent years. It focused too heavily on hedge fund clients, something it is trying to fix by reaching out to different types of customers. Its commodities business, which it clung to in the face of political pressure, has been a drawn out disappointment.\n\nAnd Wall Street traders ought not to get too excited about the prospects of deregulation. As some rules get loosened, others may get toughened up, like those that would liquidate a troubled Wall Street firm rather than bail it out. While the government may not be winding down any large banks anytime soon, the diminished likelihood of bailouts can force up the cost of borrowing for firms like Goldman. This, in turn, may steer them away from riskier businesses like trading.\n\nInvestors still seem to doubt Goldman\u2019s desire to adapt to a much more ordinary future. This is revealed in a comparison of Goldman and its rival, Morgan Stanley.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoldman\u2019s return on shareholder equity, a closely watched metric that quantifies the profits generated on shareholders\u2019 money, has been higher than that of Morgan Stanley in recent years. But investors seem just as enthusiastic about the future of Morgan Stanley. Its stock trades at the same multiple to shareholders equity as Goldman\u2019s. Why? Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading to businesses, like wealth management, that are more stable.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nAnd then there was one.\n\nDavid M.

Blankfein, the investment bank\u2019s longtime chief executive.\n\nContext\n\nMr. Solomon and Harvey M. Schwartz were seen as the favorites to eventually replace Mr. Blankfein when they were named co-chief operating officers and presidents in December 2016.\n\nBut, Mr. Schwartz, who previously served as the bank\u2019s chief financial officer and global co-head of the securities division, has decided to retire in April, Goldman said on Monday.\n\n\u201cHarvey has been a mentor to many, and his influence has made an indelible impact on generations of professionals at Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mr. Blankfein said in a news release. \u201cI want to thank Harvey for all he\u2019s done for the firm.\u201d\n\nMr. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and previously served as co-head of its investment banking division.\n\n\u2014 Chad Bray\n\nCritic\u2019s corner\n\nAnthony Currie of Breakingviews writes: \u201cIf Solomon does take the reins, it would end some 12 years of traders holding top positions at the Wall Street firm \u2013 and serve as another sign of Goldman\u2019s troubles in that business.\u201d\n\nCase in point:\n\n\u2022 Trading accounted for 53 percent of Goldman\u2019s revenue in 2012.\n\n\u2022 It made just over a third of the firm\u2019s revenue last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, takings from merger advisory and stock-and-bond underwriting \u2013 Solomon\u2019s world \u2013 increased by half over the past six years.

Mr. Liddell\u2019s previous experience as a chief financial officer for Microsoft had been seen as a selling point. But after The New York Times reported that Mr. Liddell was under consideration, Mr. Trump received pushback from people both inside and outside the White House, according to the people close to the president. On Monday, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board wrote a piece critical of Mr. Liddell\u2019s views on free trade. On Sunday, Mr. Trump again began discussing Mr. Kudlow as an option, the people close to the president said.\n\nPhoto\n\nDropbox looks to raise up to $648 million in its I.P.O.\n\nIn a revised prospectus filed this morning, the online storage company said that it planned to sell 36 million shares at $16 to $18 a share.

Companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index trade at 2.3 times sales. Dropbox would also have a higher valuation than Box, another file storage company, whose market value is 5.6 times the revenue it generated in its last fiscal year, which ended in January.\n\nInvestors may, however, decide that Dropbox\u2019s higher valuation is not justified. True, its sales grew at an impressive 31 percent last year, but that is not materially faster than the 27 percent Box achieved in its latest fiscal year. (Revenue grew 6.3 percent at companies in the S.&P. 500, according to FactSet.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeither company made a profit in their most recent fiscal year.

China introduced a comprehensive initiative in 2015 to upgrade Chinese industry over the next decade and dominate sectors of the future, including advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace equipment.\n\nUnlike the steel and aluminum measure, which divided the president\u2019s advisers and his own party, the idea of targeting China has broad support among a number of officials who believe China is cheating in global trade.\n\nGary D. Cohn, a top economic adviser who resigned over the steel and aluminum tariffs, had approved of action against China, the people familiar with the discussions said. Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Republicans who criticized those tariffs, have also endorsed a tough approach toward China.\n\nCongress is also weighing legislation that would strengthen national security checks on Chinese investment. In a House hearing on Thursday, Heath P. Tarbert, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said the current system for assessing investment is riddled with loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to evade such checks.\n\nConcern over China\u2019s practices picked up speed at the end of the Obama administration and has only increased since. Last year, a technology-focused unit in the Defense Department issued a report arguing that rising Chinese investment in Silicon Valley was giving China unprecedented access to the military technologies of the future, and increasing Chinese ownership of supply chains that service the United States military.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Business leaders and politicians of both parties now widely say that Washington\u2019s past strategy of offering Beijing economic incentives to liberalize its market has failed. On Sunday, China officially ended term limits on the presidency, clearing the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power indefinitely.\n\nAdministration officials say that past failure to rein in China warrants a much tougher approach. Mr. Trump took one step toward this in his national security strategy, which identified China as an economic aggressor. When a top Chinese economic envoy visited in late February, the administration asked China to shave $100 billion off its $375.2 billion trade surplus with the United States, two people close to the talks said. And while the steel and aluminum tariffs will hit many countries, they are primarily aimed at combating overcapacity in Chinese metals, including those that are routed through other nations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe next step, advisers say, is to more aggressively focus on trade with China.\n\nThe United States is expected to impose tariffs on Chinese imports of high-technology goods specified in the Made in China 2025 plan, including semiconductors and new energy vehicles. But they could go beyond that to target more mundane products, including consumer electronics, apparel and even shoes. The breadth of the tariffs remains a contentious topic in the business sector and the White House, with some industries fretting about retaliation and increased costs to American companies and consumers.\n\nThomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that while the administration was right to focus on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, his group strongly disagreed with sweeping tariffs.\n\n\u201cSimply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cTariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform.\u201d\n\nHun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that tariffs on apparel, shoes and electronics would hit American families most. \u201cIs the best response to make American consumers pay for China\u2019s violations? We don\u2019t think so,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough there is wide support for taking action against unfair trade practices by China, business groups and economists still say the measure could be risky. The United States and China maintain the world\u2019s largest trading relationship, and the tariffs could easily provoke a backlash.\n\n\u201cThey know our system inside out,\u201d said Jim McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide. He added, referring to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader: \u201cThey know what companies are important to Paul Ryan. They know what companies are important to Mitch McConnell. They know which trade associations and political groups have a big voice in Washington.\u201d\n\nScott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while China deserved a tough response, he feared the consequences of the administration\u2019s actions had not been well considered. \u201cYou really have to be smart,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Chinese aren\u2019t just going to fold over on this.\u201d\n\nMr. Kennedy compared China to a bully that had stolen America\u2019s lunch money. \"You want to teach them a lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not as simple as going up in the playground and punching them on the nose.\u201d", "title": "Trump Readies Sweeping Tariffs and Investment Restrictions on China", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

Cohn, who argue that the measure could disrupt international alliances and global supply chains.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have criticized tariffs as undercutting the $1.5 trillion tax cut that they worked in lock step to pass last year, saying tariffs are essentially a tax increase that would slow economic growth. On Monday, they floated the idea of congressional action to try to block tariffs, should the president impose them.\n\nRepresentative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, circulated a letter Monday expressing concern over the tariffs. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he spent the weekend speaking with members of Congress and \u201csenior administration officials\u201d about his opposition to the president\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cAs you know the administration is split itself,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said from the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, noting that details of the tariffs remain sparse.\n\nMr. Trump has heard all sides\u2019 arguments, but his view has remained steadfast, one White House official said.\n\nStill, the official said, the president is mindful enough of the arguments against potentially tanking the stock market that he has been somewhat open to a move to narrow the scope and effects of the tariffs while avoiding the perception that he was relenting. That would echo the approach the administration took to winding down the president\u2019s promises on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which has protected young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.\n\nThe unsettled nature of a final policy was magnified by a conversation on Sunday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.", "title": "Trump Reaffirms Commitment to Tariffs but Opens Door to Compromise", "authors": []}

But for Mr. Angelle, 56, it is associated with an enduring alliance he forged with the offshore oil and gas industry nearly eight years ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn July 2010, just three months after the Deepwater Horizon accident, Mr. Angelle, then lieutenant governor, stood in the arena before more than 10,000 locals, offshore workers and industry executives. He promised to pressure the Obama administration to end the moratorium on new offshore drilling, which had deeply angered communities that depended on it. The ban was lifted that October.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d he said with a thick Cajun accent in a rousing speech laced with rhymes and applause lines. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time to quit punishing innocent American workers to achieve some unrealistic political agenda.\u201d\n\nOne of nine children whose father owned a local Ford dealership before going into Louisiana politics himself, Mr. Angelle turned the arena on fire by ticking off the names of local families.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He eventually went on to lead the state agency charged with regulating the oil and gas industry, and made a series of appeals to Interior Department officials \u2014 some at the safety agency he now runs \u2014 to press the federal government to soften its response to the Deepwater Horizon accident.\n\nHis ties to the industry are also financial. Mr. Angelle was paid $1 million to serve for four years on the board of directors at Sunoco Logistics, a pipeline company. And when he ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2015, he benefited from large contributions from the industry. One of these was a $1.25 million donation to Louisiana Rising, a political action committee that backed him, from a top executive at an oil and gas company that then had hundreds of Gulf platforms. Mr. Angelle promised voters that he was \u201cfighting for Louisiana\u2019s energy industry\u201d in one advertisement.\n\nAfter being appointed to his current post, Mr. Angelle made a return visit to the Cajundome last September as part of his outreach to oil and gas executives. Mr. Angelle, agency officials note, has sold off any industry stock assets to comply with federal conflict-of-interest rules.\n\nHis job was new, but his message was familiar: How can I help your companies thrive? In addition to safety enforcement, he made it clear that he viewed his role as helping the industry grow.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we want to do is help unlock the next wave of investment into the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThat is what we want to do.\u201d\n\nThe next day, at a meeting with executives in Houston, Mr. Angelle acknowledged that efforts to assist the industry could be hampered if safety problems persisted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the end, we are only as strong as the weakest link,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if we have someone who is a bad actor, you owe it to yourselves, you owe it to your families, you owe it to the industry, you owe it to America, to call them out.\u201d\n\nEven before this gathering, the Trump administration had signed off on the first rollback of industry regulations, including the one pertaining to the removal of unproductive offshore platforms. The lobbying effort on that rule was funded in part by companies, like Renaissance and Energy XXI, that were plagued by safety violations. It involved both Mr. Lott and his partner, John Breaux, a Democrat and former senator from Louisiana, according to a disclosure report.\n\nThe rule had taken effect late in the Obama administration after government auditors estimated that it would cost nearly $40 billion to remove the old wells, but determined that oil companies had issued just $2.9 billion worth of bonds to cover the expense.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s remedy was to require companies to buy more bonds, or provide other financial guarantees, to prove they had the capacity to pay for the removal of the wells. The industry\u2019s reaction was swift.\n\n\u201cThe Louisiana economy needs a kick start, not a kick in the teeth,\u201d Gifford Briggs, the top lobbyist and vice president at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, wrote in 2016.\n\nThe problems associated with the old platforms can be severe, as seen in an oil leak 12 miles off the Louisiana coast that has been spreading a sheen across the Gulf for more than a decade. The leak, from a collapsed platform once operated by the now defunct Taylor Energy Company, could continue for 100 years unless it is properly sealed, the safety agency has estimated.\n\nNext, the oil and gas companies pushed to unravel a major safety requirement known as the well-control rule, which regulates methods used to drill new oil and gas wells \u2014 and prevent explosions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt took six years after the Deepwater Horizon accident to enact the rule, a process that involved thousands of hours of consultations with industry experts and public safety officials, according to Mr. Bromwich, the former federal prosecutor who helped start the process.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new rule, which took effect in July 2016, required additional inspections of devices called blowout preventers, the equipment that failed during the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. \u201cWe believe the deal\u2019s steel provision will be as effective as a tariff in achieving the goals of strengthening our domestic industry and ensuring it can supply America\u2019s security needs.\u201d\n\nThrough the agreement, South Korea \u2014 the third-biggest exporter of steel to the United States in 2016 \u2014 is permanently exempt from the White House\u2019s global tariffs of 25 percent on steel. In return, South Korea agreed to adhere to a quota of 2.68 million tons of steel exports to the United States a year, which it said was roughly equivalent to 70 percent of its annual average sent to the United States from 2015 to 2017.\n\nThe deal also doubles the number of vehicles the United States can export to South Korea without meeting local safety requirements to 50,000 per manufacturer. However, trade experts said that American companies had not come close to meeting their existing quota last year, and that American carmakers had not done enough to tailor their products for South Korean consumers, who prefer smaller vehicles. The revised agreement does ease environmental regulations that American carmakers face when selling vehicles in South Korea and makes American standards for auto parts compliant with South Korean regulations.\n\nImportantly for the Trump administration, the agreement extends tariffs on imported South Korean trucks by 20 years to 2041. Those tariffs were set to phase out in 2021, which officials said would have harmed American truck makers.\n\nThe deal will also establish a side agreement between the United States and South Korea that is intended to deter \u201ccompetitive devaluation\u201d of both countries\u2019 currencies \u2014 which can artificially lower the cost of imports bought by consumers \u2014 and to create more transparency on issues of monetary policy. Administration officials suggested that this new type of arrangement was likely to be replicated in other trade deals, though they acknowledged that it was not enforceable.\n\nSenior White House officials trumpeted the addition of the currency provision to the negotiations, which would seek to prevent South Korea from reducing the value of its currency to make its goods cheaper abroad and export more to the United States. In a report published in October, the Treasury Department declined to label South Korea a currency manipulator, but placed it on a \u201cmonitoring list\u201d for its currency practices and large trade surplus with the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, the effect of the currency agreement may be mostly symbolic, since it was signed in a side deal to the pact to avoid a lengthy legislative approval process. Unlike other provisions of the official agreement, the currency provision is not enforceable through panels that typically settle disputes, or through officially sanctioned retaliation, the usual method for policing trade deals.\n\nThe Obama administration had fought for a similar currency provision to be included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nOn automobiles, the biggest source of trade tensions between the countries, the negotiation delivered modest victories that were likely to be welcomed by American carmakers who have long sought to sell more cars in South Korea.

Yet it was only the latest instance of Mr. Trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which a president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government.

The program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation.\n\nBut the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous wall across the nation\u2019s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigration.

Within hours, Mr. Mattis was in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump telling him the level of military spending was \u201chistoric,\u201d according to a senior White House official. Vice President Mike Pence, who had postponed a trip to deal with the crisis, also chimed in to make a case for signing the bill.\n\nThe president relented.

But he sought to claim some measure of victory, saying that $1.6 billion \u201cdoes start the wall\u201d and promising to \u201cmake that $1.6 billion go very, very far.\u201d\n\nThe political whiplash that he had put Washington through was reflected in Mr. Trump\u2019s own comments. At times, he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on Republican lawmakers. But later, he praised them for doing their best in a tough situation.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank members of Congress for working so hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s threat came as a surprise but hardly a shock to Republican leaders, who spent much of a snowy Wednesday privately imploring an agitated Mr. Trump to put aside his objections and back the measure, claiming it as a win.\n\nSensing a political advantage, Democrats were unperturbed by Mr. Trump\u2019s veto threat fire drill. Top Democratic aides said on Friday morning that they would not make concessions to Mr. Trump if he chose to reject the legislation, but lawmakers stayed silent until the president signed the bill.

But he has made clear that he misses the staff structure that Mr. Porter had helped build and implement, a White House official said, speaking on background because advisers were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Officials there dealt with four MS-13-related police incidents involving murder last year \u2014 for a total of five homicides \u2014 compared with zero in 2013.\n\n\u201cThey are a local public safety threat, but they are not a national security threat,\u201d Chief Manger said.\n\nFormed in central Los Angeles by Salvadoran refugees fleeing a civil war in the 1980s, the gang is believed to have 10,000 members in 40 states, according to the F.B.I. \u2014 but predominantly in just three metropolitan areas: Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington. Most of its 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico, according to the authorities.\n\nIn his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump said MS-13 members exploited immigration laws to move to Long Island and, ultimately, kill Kayla Cuevas, 16, and Nisa Mickens, 15. The girls were beaten with bats and sliced by machetes in a cul-de-sac near an elementary school parking lot in September 2016.\n\nMr. Trump brought their parents to the speech and asked them to stand, as if to exhibit the reason for his immigration crackdown.\n\nMS-13 operates in loose local cliques, sowing fear and violence. It is not a sophisticated global drug cartel, and many gang members are destitute.\n\nPhoto\n\nInterviews with dozens of law enforcement and intelligence officials, and a review of documents, indicate that the gang dabbles in small-time drug dealing, gun sales, prostitution and extortion, with some members receiving just enough money to get by.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one case, the suspected leader of one the largest MS-13 cliques in Maryland recently canceled a drug deal because he did not have enough money to pay for gas to drive to the drop-off point, according to a law enforcement official in the state.\n\nThe Trump administration is not the first to target MS-13.\n\nPresident George W. Bush set up an F.B.I. task force to focus on MS-13 in 2004 and created the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2005. MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so in 2012.\n\nMr. Sessions has compared MS-13 to Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia. The gang is now a top target of the Justice Department\u2019s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, which has historically focused on major drug traffickers and money launderers with its annual $500 million budget. The department\u2019s budget proposal for next year also requests $400,000 for a \u201csensitive investigative unit\u201d to address transnational threats from El Salvador.\n\nThe United States and foreign allies have issued charges against 4,000 members of MS-13, Mr. Sessions said earlier this month. In December, he announced 40 new assistant United States attorney positions across the country to fight MS-13 and other gangs, including two on Long Island and three in Maryland.\n\nOne official at a United States attorney\u2019s office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was troubled by new pressure on MS-13 cases, given skyrocketing opioid crimes and a growing national human trafficking problem.\n\nEven so, the number of federal prosecutions against MS-13 in the United States is limited. Only 11 cases were brought between October 2016 and September 2017, according to data provided by the Justice Department. Since then, prosecutors have opened another 13 cases.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

We want to hammer them,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators arrested 796 suspected members of MS-13 last year, up from 429 in 2016. The agency said it also deported about 5,300 suspected members of all gangs over that same period of time, up from 2,000. Over a three-month span last fall, an I.C.E. operation dubbed \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d swept up 214 MS-13 members nationwide and arrested an additional 53 in El Salvador.\n\nIn New York, F.B.I. agents have grumbled about having to focus on MS-13, according to a senior bureau official; there have been worries that agents have arrested members of Trinitario, a Dominican gang, but characterized them as MS-13 members to inflate their arrest totals to meet expectations, a senior state law enforcement official said. Neither official was authorized to speak publicly and both spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cAny claim that we are mischaracterizing gang members to inflate our arrest totals is false,\u201d an F.B.I. spokeswoman, Nora Scheland, said in a statement. The F.B.I. cracks down on all gang activity as part of its work to combat violent crime, she said.\n\nA $500,000 Justice Department grant promised in October to fight gang violence and gun crime in Suffolk County, N.Y., targeted not only MS-13 but also the Bloods and Crips in its crime analysis. The Long Island county, which applied for the grant, was one of 14 awarded for a total of $3.375 million. Officials say they have not yet received the grant.\n\nTimothy D. Sini, the Suffolk County district attorney and former police commissioner, said MS-13 \u201cconstitutes a significant public safety threat\u201d and was responsible for 17 murders in 15 months in that area of Long Island.\n\n\u201cWith that said,\u201d Mr. Sini said, \u201cthe No.1 public health and safety issue facing Suffolk County, as in other communities, is the drug epidemic. And this drug epidemic is a moving target.\u201d He said opioid overdoses killed more than 300 people in Suffolk County last year, compared with six deaths linked to MS-13.\n\nPhoto\n\nA two-year uptick in violent activity converged with the arrival of more than 4,700 school-age minors in Suffolk County since 2013. Many of the children were fleeing gang violence in their native El Salvador or Honduras, and, after entering the country, most often applied for asylum, or the protection known as Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.\n\nLast March, federal authorities charged 13 young adults \u2014 including four accused of involvement in the killings of Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens \u2014 linked to MS-13 with racketeering and other crimes in Suffolk County. Of the 13, 10 were unauthorized immigrants, federal prosecutors said. Seven had come to the country as unaccompanied minors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly sought to show that immigration programs it is trying to eliminate have allowed MS-13 and other gangs to flourish. It has singled out the nation\u2019s diversity lottery system, immigration programs to allow unaccompanied minors to cross the border and deportation protections for people who were brought illegally to the United States as children.\n\nYet the latest numbers do not bear that out. According to Border Patrol apprehension statistics published in December, the number of MS-13 members caught at the border actually declined to 228 in 2017, from 437 in 2014.\n\nSome law enforcement officials privately fear that the Trump administration\u2019s push to eradicate crime by deporting illegal immigrants could backfire.\n\nImmigrants in communities where MS-13 is the strongest may be reluctant to come forward with information to help investigations, fearing deportation themselves. Some fear the government will use MS-13 cases to identify the gang members\u2019 relatives and deport them. And MS-13\u2019s victims are overwhelmingly immigrants themselves.\n\n\u201cThe administration is using MS-13 in Willy Horton-esque campaign ads and as cover to make a boogeyman out of immigration,\u201d said Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a California state senator. \u201cIt is using MS-13 as a pretext to go after hardworking immigrants.\u201d", "title": "Trump Targets MS-13, a Violent Menace, if Not the One He Portrays", "authors": ["Ron Nixon", "Liz Robbins", "Katie Benner"]}

At least 10 states allow staff members to possess or have access to a firearm on school grounds, according to an analysis by the Education Commission of the States. And local districts have varied their approach to arming educators \u2014 in Ohio, guns are kept in safes; in Texas, they can be worn in holsters or kept in safes within immediate reach.\n\nA Florida state legislative committee approved a $67 million \u201cschool marshal\u201d program this week to train and arm teachers \u2014 over the vocal opposition of Parkland residents.\n\nIn Texas, some public school systems have been quietly arming teachers and administrators for more than a decade. Teachers and other school personnel who volunteer to undergo specialized training receive approval to either carry a concealed firearm in school or have one within reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nLawmakers, educators and advocates for gun rights said Texas\u2019 school marshal and school guardian programs have eased fears of armed intruders and have not led to any firearm accidents or mishaps. The state\u2019s programs could serve as a model for schools around the country, advocates say.\n\nOne rural district, Harrold Independent School District, has been allowing armed personnel to carry concealed firearms on school grounds as part of its guardian program since 2007, one year after a shooting at an Amish school in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThis clearly is the solution to the problem that we\u2019re seeing around the country, and I think the president has recognized that,\u201d said State Representative Jason Villalba, a Dallas Republican who wrote the law that established the school-marshal program.\n\nAt a meeting at the White House with other governors on Monday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican, told Mr. Trump that in more than 100 school districts in Texas, teachers and other personnel carry a weapon and are trained to respond to an attack.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCandidly, some school districts, they promote it,\u201d the governor told the president. \u201cBecause they will have signs out front \u2014 a warning sign: \u2018Be aware, there are armed personnel on campus\u2019 \u2014 warning anybody coming on there that they \u2014 if they attempt to cause any harm, they\u2019re going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Ohio, which allows local school boards to decide who can possess or have access to firearms on school grounds, Gov.

Uniformed, armed officers cost $200,000 a year, and an insurance policy of $100,000 a year includes coverage for its staff with access to firearms. Those are negligible costs for a school district with a $36 million budget, the superintendent said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re buying time, and it\u2019s of the essence,\u201d Mr. Scheu said.\n\nWindows and doors are numbered in the district\u2019s schools, and visitors have to be buzzed in.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "The departures of Rex Tillerson and H. R. McMaster, in particular, do not indicate a sudden swerve in policy: Mr. Tillerson a was a gamble from the beginning, a secretary of state with as little political experience as the president and no very tight ties to him. Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure at the State Department has been considered a success by no one. His exit was a matter of time.\n\nGeneral McMaster likewise has never developed a rapport with the president, who chose him as national security adviser only after Michael Flynn was forced to resign and Mr. Trump\u2019s second choice, Robert Harward, a retired vice admiral, declined the role. General McMaster was given a fair chance and allowed to remove from the National Security Council political holdovers from General Flynn\u2019s brief tenure. But his support for the Iran deal has been at odds with the president\u2019s commitment to ending or drastically renegotiating it. The president is determined on his course, and he understandably wants a national security adviser who shares his priorities.\n\nWere he not being replaced by the president, General McMaster would soon have found himself facing the same choice that Gary Cohn had to confront once Mr. Trump followed through on his promises of economic nationalism: to resign or implement a policy with which he firmly disagreed. Advisers are there to offer the president a menu of options, including those he might not find to his taste. Once the president has made up his mind, however, the responsibility of his aides is to see that his orders are carried out effectively. Policy differences have a proper place in an administration, but only before a decision is made.\n\nThere always has to be some trial and error involved in building an effective cabinet and White House team, and in Mr. Trump\u2019s case, coming from as far outside the policy world as he did, there was sure to be more turnover than in most administrations, as the president got a feel for personalities and policies. Has a year\u2019s experience now shown Mr. Trump who his real allies and most suitable colleagues are?\n\nThat\u2019s one theory for Mr. Pompeo\u2019s proposed elevation to secretary of state. And while Mr. Bolton and Mr. Kudlow have not served in the administration before, they have built strong relationships with the president. Then again, so did Steve Bannon, who proved not to be as close or indispensable to Mr. Trump as an avalanche of media coverage had made him seem. The man purported to be the power behind the throne didn\u2019t last a full eight months in this White House.\n\nThe next wave of national-security and economic advisers is not assured of lasting any longer. This is another reason fears of Mr. Trump\u2019s latest staff replacements are misplaced. An old joke attributed to Groucho Marx has a politician declaring: \u201cThese are my principles. If you don\u2019t like them, I have others.\u201d The same can be said about President Trump\u2019s personnel \u2014 if you don\u2019t like them, he has others.\n\nThe new personnel will not make the administration a monolith. Like those who came before them, they will find that the real key to policy lies not with them but with a single unchanging executive branch employee: Donald J. Trump. His great virtue is that he cannot be molded by his advisers; he resists all tutelage. He was elected because the people who do the molding in our politics have for too long led our country down a path of destruction, under Republicans and Democrats alike. The advice they give, sound in theory, is terrible in practice. One service President Trump has performed that even many of his detractors should applaud is to demolish the mystique of the policy elite.

Other countries might now feel emboldened to block as a security threat inbound foreign investment that they consider significant, justifiably or not. France and other countries have a history of protecting companies they consider \u201cnational champions,\u201d but the United States has been reluctant to do so. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is made up of representatives from across the executive branch, looks at acquisitions that could represent a national security problem, but its reviews typically end up scuttling only a few deals annually, though the number has increased in recent years.\n\nBecause the committee does most of its work in secret, it is hard to know if it is making the right calls. But in this case, the ultimate outcome was correct because the potential takeover raised serious antitrust concerns.\n\nThere are good reasons to worry about the growing concentration of power \u2014 and lack of competition \u2014 in the semiconductor business, which supplies chips used in everything from phones and computers to cars and fighter jets. If the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger had gone through, just three companies \u2014 Samsung, Intel and Broadcom \u2014 would have controlled more than 36 percent of the global market for chips, according to Gartner. And the concentration would have been far greater in certain fields, like telecommunications.\n\nAs the number of players in the industry shrinks, innovation tends to decline because companies have less reason to worry about losing business to competitors. And they have a bigger incentive to milk profits by raising prices on existing products, which are often protected by patents that in the United States typically give inventors a 20-year monopoly over their creations. Such arguments would typically arise during antitrust reviews by the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission, but they are also important to national security. That\u2019s because the government is heavily dependent on private companies like Qualcomm, which got its start in the 1980s by developing communications systems for the military.\n\nBroadcom being based in Singapore provided the Trump administration an easy way to block this deal.

The Trump administration has also become home to what we might call neo-goldbugs: people who think that a nation\u2019s strength can be measured by the strength of its currency, and refuse to see any downside in a strong dollar, never see any reason a weaker dollar might be needed.\n\nLike neo-mercantilism, or for that matter supply-side economics, this view has been debunked many times \u2014 I wrote about it in 1987! \u2014 yet keeps shambling along, because it appeals to the prejudices of wealthy and powerful people.\n\nUntil now, the most visible neo-goldbug in the administration has been David Malpass, the under secretary of Treasury for international affairs \u2014 normally a position of great policy influence, although under Trump, who knows? Malpass is the former chief economist of Bear Stearns, and a man with a Kudlow-like record of being wrong about everything. In particular, however, back in 2011 Malpass published an op-ed article declaring that what America needed to fix its economic ills was a stronger dollar (and higher interest rates).\n\nIt was a bizarre claim. After all, at the time the unemployment rate was still 9 percent \u2014 and a stronger dollar would have made things even worse. Why? Because it would have made U.S. products less competitive, increasing the trade deficit \u2014 and a situation of persistently high unemployment is the one situation in which trade deficits really are an unambiguously bad thing, reducing the demand for domestic goods and services.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Kudlow appears to share Malpass\u2019s worldview. In fact, his first newsworthy statement after Trump announced his selection was a call for a higher dollar \u2014 something that would worsen the very trade deficit Trump sees as a sign of American weakness.\n\nWhy has Trump hired people with such conflicting notions about international economic policy? The answer, presumably, is that he doesn\u2019t understand the issues well enough to realize that the conflict exists. And what both sides in this dispute share is a general propensity for invincible ignorance, which makes them Trump\u2019s kind of people.\n\nAnyway, on international economics the Trump administration is now on track for a battle of the zombies \u2014 a fight between two sets of bad ideas that refuse to die.

For months, as Mr. Shulkin delivered a series of bipartisan legislative victories to a White House badly in need of them, Mr. Trump showered him in praise. At one such bill-signing ceremony in June, Mr. Trump teased that the secretary need never worry about hearing his \u201cApprentice\u201d-era catchphrase, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nBut that support began to erode in February, after the department\u2019s inspector general released a blistering report that found \u201cserious derelictions\u201d related to a business trip taken by the secretary to Britain and Denmark last year. It concluded that the secretary had spent much of the trip sightseeing and improperly accepted Wimbledon tickets as a gift.\n\nThe report provided ammunition for Mr. Shulkin\u2019s critics within the department, who had increasingly broken with the secretary over how to approach one of the White House\u2019s top policy priorities: the expansion of government-subsidized private health care for veterans.

An aide to Mr. Shulkin disputed that characterization.\n\nMr. Shulkin has played down speculation about his departure as he has testified about the department\u2019s budget request for the coming fiscal year and met privately with lawmakers to discuss pending legislation to remake the department\u2019s approach to private care. He was scheduled to host a regular meeting on Thursday with leaders of the nation\u2019s largest veterans groups.\n\nBut he has proceeded with a curtailed public profile. The secretary was not on hand for a veterans event at the White House on Friday, for instance, and he is now hurried in and out of events by a security detail without taking questions from the press. Those who have spoken with the secretary said he had made it clear that he wanted to continue in the department\u2019s top job, but was increasingly isolated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAshleigh F. Barry, a spokeswoman for the secretary, said on Tuesday only that Mr. Shulkin was focused on the work of the department.\n\nThe speculation and mixed messages coming out of the White House have flummoxed key lawmakers in both parties, who continue to support the secretary, as well as many of the major veterans groups, which are congressionally chartered and largely apolitical. Organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion hold considerable sway over veterans policy in Washington, and they solidly back Mr. Shulkin.\n\nThough the groups were generally displeased with the findings turned up by the inspector general, they see the secretary as a pragmatic and effective leader who understands the challenges facing the department\u2019s sprawling health care system and has taken concrete steps to address them.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed about all this speculation that is happening because we feel that the secretary has done a good job of leading the V.A. in a positive direction,\u201d said Garry Augustine, the executive director of Disabled American Veterans.\n\nThe groups and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are closely watching for candidates to replace Mr. Shulkin, many of them fearful that the White House might try to use the nomination to advance a long-held conservative goal of shifting more of the department\u2019s health care to private doctors. A nominee seen as too aggressive on privatization would likely face a difficult path to confirmation in the Senate, where Republicans have only the narrowest of majorities and several key Republicans have indicated an uneasiness with several of the names floated by people close to the White House.\n\nThose candidates include Jeff Miller, a former Florida congressman who led the House Veterans Affairs Committee and is now a lobbyist in Washington; Keith Kellogg, a retired three-star Army general who serves as the chief of staff of the National Security Council; and Leo Mackay Jr., a former deputy secretary at the department who is now an executive at Lockheed Martin. Mr. Trump has also discussed the job with Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\n\nAnother potential nominee, Pete Hegseth, is said to be uninterested in the nomination. Mr. Hegseth is a weekend co-host of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d who formerly ran Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative veterans advocacy group backed by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. The group has led the push to let veterans use their government benefits at private doctors.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Shulkin may not be the only department official on his way out. Several high-ranking officials opposed to the secretary have indicated that they, too, intend to leave. Darin Selnick, an influential conservative voice on veterans issues within the administration, departed a position on the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council on Friday and has decided to leave the administration entirely.

Trump spends all his time watching Fox News, basing his opinions and tweets on it, and now he\u2019s simply becoming one with it. He is even willing to overlook his distaste for the yeti mustache of the warmongering John Bolton and consider the Fox News analyst as a replacement for McMaster.\n\nRoger Ailes would be so proud, if he were still alive and harassing women.\n\nTrump thinks he\u2019s a fabulously devious manager creating \u201cgreat energy,\u201d with great ratings coming from his talent for theatrical twists and turns. But he\u2019s really inhumane, playing people against one another and widely discussing successors for officials who haven\u2019t even been officially informed that they\u2019re walking the plank. And, far from the A-team he promised, he\u2019s hired a bunch of pathetic, disgusting swamp schnorrers who can\u2019t stop using taxpayer money to fund their office furniture or office redesign or luxury plane trips with their wives.\n\n\u201cI like conflict,\u201d Trump said this month at a press conference with the Swedish prime minister, smacking his fists together and adding, \u201cI like watching it, I like seeing it, and I think it\u2019s the best way to go.\u201d\n\nNever mind that a lot of the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 craves stability.\n\nWhile the president may appear unconstrained, intoxicated with escaping the net of those who displease him by telling him \u201cNo,\u201d he is getting ever more enmeshed in another net \u2014 Robert Mueller\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think Trump is royally pissed about the Mueller subpoena of the Trump Organization records,\u201d Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio says about the special counsel crossing the president\u2019s red line. \u201cHe fears the nakedness of his true business activities being revealed far more than the shame of \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 or Stormy Daniels.

The administration\u2019s only tough comment on Russian involvement until Tuesday came from Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, but he has since been fired.\n\nMr. Trump and Ms. May then talked by phone on Tuesday night, and the White House issued a statement expressing his solidarity with her.

Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, said at an emergency Security Council session, calling the poisoning \u201can atrocious crime.\u201d\n\nThat did not satisfy those who said the president should show personal leadership. \u201cJudgment day for Donald Trump,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and an under secretary of state under President George W. Bush, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWill he support Britain unequivocally on the nerve agent attack? Back #NATO sanctions? Finally criticize Putin? Act like a leader of the West?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has at times grudgingly accepted that Russia meddled in the 2016 election but usually sounds more determined to rebut any suspicions that his campaign colluded with Moscow or that whatever meddling took place helped him win. He has opted against imposing sanctions beyond those already imposed by Mr. Obama despite a new law passed overwhelmingly authorizing further penalties.\n\nAsked about the meddling last week, after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, indicted 13 Russians for spreading disinformation and propaganda in a concerted effort to influence the election, Mr. Trump focused on whether it changed the result, and avoided strong words about Moscow.\n\n\u201cWell, the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever,\u201d he said during a news conference with Sweden\u2019s prime minister. \u201cBut certainly there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals.

And we won\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201d\n\nRaj Shah, a White House spokesman, said on Wednesday that the president took the election meddling seriously and had ordered his administration to take steps to prevent it from happening again.\n\nWhen asked if the president would eventually opt for retaliation in addition to prevention, Mr. Shah implied that Mr. Trump already had, but in secret. \u201cThere are steps that I\u2019m talking about that we can talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there are steps that we can\u2019t talk about publicly but that our adversaries know that we are engaged in.\u201d", "title": "Trump, Pressured to Criticize Russia for Poisoning, Leaves Comment to Aides", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Trump seems so enamored with autocrats and strongmen that he wants the United States to imitate governments like China and the Philippines by executing drug dealers, claiming such countries \u201cdon\u2019t have a drug problem\u201d because of their brutality. This is patently absurd. While it is hard to analyze the experience of many of these countries because they do not collect and publish reliable data about substance use, experts say it is clear that they have not eliminated drug abuse or the crime that often accompanies it. More broadly speaking, many scholars have concluded that there is no good evidence that capital punishment deters crime.\n\nBut we do have convincing evidence that ratcheting up the war on drugs, as Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, want to do, would not work. Since the early 1980s, the federal government and states have imposed increasingly harsh criminal penalties on drug dealers and users. Not only did they fail to stem drug use or the availability of illicit substances, but they may have contributed to their spread by taking resources away from treatment and prevention efforts. It is no wonder, then, that the per-gram retail price of heroin fell by about 85 percent between 1981 and 2012, according to a report published in 2016 by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\nFurther, legal experts say it is unlikely that a law authorizing capital punishment for drug dealers would be considered constitutional, because the Supreme Court has previously struck down laws that allowed the use of the death penalty for crimes other than murder.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s other get-tough policies are also unlikely to help. The wall will not stop drugs \u2014 most imported illicit substances like heroin and methamphetamines already come in through legal border crossings. And his plans to penalize sanctuary cities, which choose not to participate in federal deportation crackdowns, would be counterproductive. That\u2019s because law-abiding immigrants are less likely to identify and testify against drug dealers and gang members if they fear that helping law enforcement agencies could put them or their relatives at risk of being detained or deported.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s New Hampshire speech did contain a few good ideas \u2014 but only a few. He said that the administration would seek to reduce opioid prescriptions and expand access to medication-assisted treatment for those suffering from addiction.

The White House has not even completed a legal review of the measures.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s off-the-cuff opening of a trade war rattled the stock market, enraged Republicans and left Mr. Cohn\u2019s future in doubt. Mr. Cohn, who almost left last year after Mr. Trump\u2019s response to a white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., indicated he was waiting to see whether Mr. Trump goes through with the tariffs, people familiar with his thinking said.\n\nThe chaotic rollout also reflected the departure of another White House official, Rob Porter, who as the staff secretary had a key role in keeping the paper flowing in the West Wing and who had backed Mr. Cohn in his free-trade views. Mr. Porter was forced out last month after facing accusations of spousal abuse.\n\nIt was the second day in a row that Mr. Trump blindsided Republicans and his own aides. On Wednesday, in another televised session at the White House, he embraced the stricter gun control measures backed by Democrats and urged lawmakers to revive gun-safety regulations that are opposed by the National Rifle Association and most of his party.

Mr. Trump has few fixed views on any issue, but he has been consistent on his antipathy for free trade since the 1980s, when he took out newspaper ads warning about American deficits with Japan \u2014 a concern that has shifted to China in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe W.T.O. has been a disaster for this country,\u201d Mr. Trump said Thursday, asserting that China\u2019s economic rise coincided with its entry into the World Trade Organization. \u201cIt has been great for China and terrible for the United States, and great for other countries.\u201d\n\nBut a president who has long tried to impose his version of reality on the world is finding the limits of that strategy. Without Mr. Porter playing a stopgap role on trade, the debate has been marked by a lack of focus on policy and planning, according to several aides.\n\nMorale in the West Wing has sunk to a new low, these people said. In private conversations, Mr. Trump lashes out regularly at Attorney General Jeff Sessions with a vitriol that stuns members of his staff. Some longtime advisers said that Mr. Trump regards Mr. Sessions\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation as the \u201coriginal sin,\u201d which the president thinks has left him exposed.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s children, meanwhile, have grown exasperated with Mr. Kelly, seeing him as a hurdle to their father\u2019s success and as antagonistic to their continued presence, according to several people familiar with their thinking. Anthony Scaramucci, an ally of some in the Trump family, whom Mr. Kelly fired as communications director after only 11 days, intensified his criticism of the chief of staff in a series of news interviews on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nYet Mr. Trump is also frustrated with Mr. Kushner, whom he now views as a liability because of his legal entanglements, the investigations of the Kushner family\u2019s real estate company and the publicity over having his security clearance downgraded, according to two people familiar with his views. In private conversations, the president vacillates between sounding regretful that Mr. Kushner is taking arrows and annoyed that he is another problem to deal with.\n\nPrivately, some aides have expressed frustration that Mr. Kushner and his wife, the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, have remained at the White House, despite Mr. Trump at times saying they never should have come to the White House and should leave. Yet aides also noted that Mr. Trump has told the couple that they should keep serving in their roles, even as he has privately asked Mr. Kelly for his help in moving them out.\n\nTo some staff members, the chaos feels reminiscent of the earliest days of the Trump administration.

But he does not seem to know how to fix that pressing problem.\n\nMr. Trump on Thursday announced a three-pronged attack on China. He said he would bring a case against the country at the World Trade Organization, slap about $60 billion of tariffs on unspecified imports from China and impose restrictions on what investments Chinese businesses can make in the United States. His administration argues that these decisions are meant to force President Xi Jinping of China to begin to play by the rules other major economies follow \u2014 a goal that eluded President Barack Obama and his predecessors. But it is hard to see how Mr. Trump will do much better. That\u2019s because this president has shown little interest in putting together the kind of effective strategy that would be needed to get China to change its ways.\n\nThe first element of the administration\u2019s approach \u2014 going to the trade organization to challenge China\u2019s use of technology-licensing policies to transfer know-how from foreign businesses to Chinese companies \u2014 is a good start. It also bucks the president\u2019s oft-stated disdain for the trade organization and multilateral institutions in general. But Mr. Trump could have gone much further. He ought to have enlisted Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and other countries to jointly put pressure on China. Technology businesses in these countries have many of the same complaints about China that American businesses do. By assembling a coalition to confront China, Mr. Trump would have left it little room to maneuver. But by acting alone, he has given Mr. Xi the ability to make common cause with other countries that see Mr. Trump as a bully intent on penalizing rivals and allies alike.\n\nThe second part of his plan \u2014 a 25 percent tariff on certain Chinese products, which the administration says it will specify in the coming days \u2014 could cause collateral damage to domestic industry and farmers. The Chinese government is already threatening to retaliate by imposing restrictions on American soybeans, sorghum and other farm commodities in a targeted assault on states that voted for Mr. Trump. The country might also seek to switch from American products to European, Canadian or Japanese equivalents. Tariffs are blunt tools that are far less effective than Mr. Trump realizes.

Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement last summer was an attempt to reverse that Obama-era policy \u2014 and a clear effort to pander to Vice President Mike Pence, other right-wing zealots and regressive generals. The United States \u201cwill not accept or allow\u201d transgender people in the military \u201cin any capacity,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted at the time. The president, who avoided fighting in the Vietnam War by getting five deferments, also suggested that transgender enlistees are unfit to serve, tweeting that the military \u201cmust be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory.\u201d\n\nIn October, after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., temporarily blocked the move and said the ban was probably unconstitutional, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to find a way to carry out a version of the ban, and in February, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis provided a recommendation. Mr. Mattis, a former Marine general, said that there were \u201csubstantial risks\u201d related to transgender people who serve in the military and that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption from certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, potentially undermining troops\u2019 readiness and disrupting unit cohesion.\n\nAlthough Mr. Mattis is considered Mr. Trump\u2019s most responsible foreign policy adviser, his handling of this matter has been disappointing. His report to Mr. Trump dismissed a RAND Corporation study that found that allowing transgender people to serve would have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on Pentagon readiness and health care costs.\n\nIt also seemed at odds with the comments of Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr. of the Marines, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who told the Senate Armed Services Committee last fall that transgender troops have served with honor \u2014 not to mention research predicting there would be little to no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness if transgender people were allowed to serve. Two senior Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona, who is a former P.O.W., and Orrin Hatch of Utah, as well as a group of 56 retired generals and admirals, have voiced similar views.\n\nThe number of affected troops is small; an estimated 2,000 to 11,000 identify as transgender, out of a total military force of 1.3 million active-duty members. But Mr. Trump\u2019s discriminatory and inhumane order adds immeasurably to the suffering of this minority population yearning to come out of the shadows, be treated as human beings, feel respected and be permitted to serve their country.\n\nAs is often the case in America, the rights of vulnerable people now rest with a federal court, this one in the Western District of Washington State, near Seattle. During a hearing there on Tuesday, a judge gave lawyers seven days to file additional documents before deciding on a request by two advocacy groups, Lambda Legal and OutServe-SLDN, to permanently end Mr. Trump\u2019s transgender ban.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Heartless Transgender Military Ban Gets a Second Shot", "authors": []}

The two celebrated Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv in defiance of much of the rest of the world.\n\nMr. Netanyahu extolled Mr. Trump for the decision, comparing him to three of the most important figures in the history of the Jewish people: King Cyrus of Persia, who 2,500 years ago freed the Jews from exile in Babylon and permitted them to return to Jerusalem; Lord Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose declaration in 1917 first paved the way for a Jewish homeland in Palestine; and President Harry S. Truman, who recognized Israel\u2019s existence 11 minutes after it declared independence in 1948.\n\nJust as Israelis remember those historical figures, Mr. Netanyahu said, \u201cwe remember how a few weeks ago President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. President,\u201d he continued, \u201cthis will be remembered by our people through the ages. As you just said, others talked about it. You did it.\u201d\n\nUnlike Mr. Trump, however, Mr. Netanyahu mentioned the goal of peace with the Palestinians only in passing and focused instead on the topic he always makes his top priority when he visits Washington, namely Iran.\n\nHe hoped to use the visit to encourage Mr. Trump to tear up President Barack Obama\u2019s agreement with Tehran limiting its nuclear program or renegotiate it to toughen its provisions, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. He also sought consensus on how to counter Iran\u2019s presence in Syria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIran must be stopped,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cThat is our common challenge.\u201d\n\nHe voiced deep skepticism about the prospect of a Palestinian state, recalling how Gaza fell under the control of Hamas after Israel withdrew. \u201cYou can bring models, theoretical models, say it will be good if we give them a state,\u201d he told the reporters. \u201cEmpirically, it doesn\u2019t work with what we see.

In response to the president\u2019s Jerusalem move, they declared that they no longer saw the United States as a neutral broker with the Israelis. Mr. Trump then withheld $65 million in aid for Palestinian refugees.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner went to the United Nations recently to hear Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, speak in an effort to show respect shortly after the president publicly pressed Israel on settlement construction in the West Bank.\n\nThe Monday meeting came at a time when both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu are under increasing domestic pressure from investigations bearing down on them and their families. Shortly before their get-together, Mr. Trump was lashing out at the investigation into whether his team cooperated with Russia during the 2016 election, while reports from Israel indicated that a former confidant of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s had made a deal with the police in a corruption investigation of the prime minister.\n\n\u201cThey have an awful lot in common and they both may be desperately in need of a friend and someone who understands what they\u2019re going through,\u201d said Mara Rudman, a former deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under Mr. Obama. \u201cAnd they happen to be showing it for the world to see.\u201d\n\nMr. Netanyahu later said their mutual woes \u2014 they both use the phrase \u201cwitch hunt\u201d to describe the inquiries into their activities \u2014 never came up during their meeting. Instead, they relished the chance to showcase their partnership during the part of their session when cameras were on.\n\n\u201cThe relationship has never been better,\u201d Mr. Trump declared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been stronger,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu agreed.\n\nMr. Trump has made his decision to move the embassy a selling point among his supporters, lauding it during a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference as one of his major achievements. His administration announced that it would formally open the Jerusalem embassy in May to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel\u2019s independence by redesignating an existing consular facility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president said on Monday that he may attend. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at coming,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIf I can, I will.\u201d\n\nAs he has before, Mr. Trump argued that his decision to recognize Jerusalem resolved a tough issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken it off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this gives us a real opportunity for peace.\u201d\n\nHardly any veterans of Middle East peacemaking, including some who support moving the embassy, share this view. Mr. Trump\u2019s unilateral declaration does not mean that the Palestinians have given up on Jerusalem; instead, they have dug in. Many former negotiators have envisioned a peace deal in which both sides operate their capitals out of Jerusalem, the Israelis in the west and the Palestinians in the east.\n\nAs he often does, Mr. Trump boasted that he had already cut the cost of building a new embassy, but he seemed to be conflating two different expenses. \u201cThey put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars,\u201d he said. \u201cI said a billion? What\u2019s that for? They said, \u2018We\u2019re going to build an embassy.\u2019 I said we\u2019re not going to spend a billion dollars. We\u2019re actually doing it for about $250,000.\u201d\n\nThe State Department has estimated that construction of a new embassy will cost about $500 million. Mr. Trump\u2019s reference to $250,000 presumably is the cost of making minor adjustments to the existing consular facility so that it can house an office for the American ambassador and be formally redesignated an embassy while a new facility is constructed.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Hopes of Being the \u2018Neutral Guy\u2019 in the Mideast Seem Long Gone", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "David M.

Triolo, the head of global technology for the risk-consulting firm Eurasia Group.\n\nThe move followed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after the Commerce Department declared that the imports were a threat to national security because they degraded the American industrial base. Mr. Trump singled out China in announcing the tariffs, saying the nation was flooding the United States with cheap metal, often by routing it through other countries. The legal provision that allowed Mr. Trump to impose the tariffs had been used only twice in history, to limit oil imports from Libya and Iran.\n\nConcern about Chinese investments in technology has been building for years. In 2015, China rolled out a sweeping plan called \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d to upgrade its industry. The focus on China\u2019s industrial policy intensified at the end of the Obama administration, when Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker called out Chinese state-led interference as a threat to the global chip-making industry.\n\nBut the Trump administration has called for an even harder line on China, as more evidence emerges that the country is engaged in a pattern of global acquisitions that would give it an edge in advanced technology and box out the United States government from similar partnerships.\n\nPhoto\n\nThese concerns are what ensnared Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm. Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is poised to be an industry leader in the next-generation high-speed mobile network technology known as 5G, which will be critical for the development of future industries, including driverless cars and artificial intelligence. Estimates by Qualcomm and the research firm IHS Markit have suggested that 5G would generate $12.3 trillion in economic activity and create 22 million jobs by 2035.\n\nDaniel H.

United States regulators have blocked multiple attempts by Huawei to acquire American businesses or sell products in America in the past.\n\nStill, the administration\u2019s speedy response to Broadcom\u2019s takeover bid was unprecedented, some Cfius experts say, in part because the government intervened before shareholders of a publicly traded company were allowed to vote.\n\nDerek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said the move was unusual but also warranted, given that the United States lacks another firm like Qualcomm. Mr. Scissors said the move also ratcheted up the administration\u2019s efforts to link the soundness of the economy with national security.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s clearly the direction of U.S. policy at the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the Trump administration was predisposed to reject a takeover so closely related to national security, behind-the-scenes machinations by Qualcomm hastened the result.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Jan. 29, Qualcomm submitted a voluntary filing asking Cfius to review whether Broadcom\u2019s proposed takeover of its board posed national security concerns. On March 5, a Treasury official issued an interim order and sent it to Qualcomm\u2019s counsel and Broadcom\u2019s counsel, saying Cfius had identified national security concerns and would expand its review to look at whether the entire transaction posed a national security risk. The move stunned Qualcomm, according to two people familiar with the matter, since Cfius was exceeding its request and essentially investigating a deal that had yet to be agreed to.\n\nThe next day, Broadcom asked the government of Singapore for an emergency hearing there to move its headquarters to the United States, which it expected to reduce the scrutiny of the merger. That move irked Cfius, which said in a letter on Sunday that Broadcom had violated its interim order. On Monday, Mr. Trump killed the takeover attempt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnne W. Salladin, a former senior counsel at the Treasury Department who provided legal advice on Cfius matters, noted that Cfius reviewed nearly 240 transactions last year and was on a pace for about 215 this year. The more aggressive approach being taken by the Trump administration could have a chilling effect on global technology mergers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that some deals in certain areas will not get through, particularly when they are in sensitive areas,\u201d Ms. Salladin said. \u201cThe government is prepared to be very tough when strategic areas are at risk.\u201d\n\nWhile the move to scuttle the Broadcom deal was a provocative one by Mr. Trump, it was one of the rare presidential decisions that appeared to unite Republicans and Democrats. Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican who has proposed legislation to strengthen reviews of such deals, had been calling on Mr. Trump to intervene. And on Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, praised the decision.\n\n\u201cLet me say unequivocally: President Trump and his administration made the right decision on blocking Broadcom from taking over Qualcomm,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cWe all know that China has been rapacious about trade, and very smart.\u201d\n\nThe changes have reverberated across the globe. On Tuesday, Li Dongsheng, the chief executive of TCL, a Chinese consumer electronics maker, accused the Trump administration of bias against Chinese firms.\n\n\u201cI understand that local governments need to protect their local industries, but the way the U.S. government treated Chinese companies was unfair and absurd,\u201d Mr. Li told reporters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress, where he is a member, according to Reuters.\n\nIn June, TCL abandoned its bid for San Diego-based Inseego, a maker of networking routers and other hardware, after Cfius expressed national security concerns. Inseego\u2019s networking gear is used by financial institutions, and the company is developing networking gear that will be used in high-speed 5G mobile networks.\n\n\u201cThere was great concern by the U.S. government that the development process would be taken over and migrate to China and that all the intellectual property here would be taken over,\u201d said Dan Mondor, chief executive of Inseego.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Killing of Chip Deal Pushes Protectionism as It Invokes Security", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Cecilia Kang", "Alan Rappeport"]}

He was left to choose among a more willing but less attractive crop of lawyers, many of whom who were either considered past their prime or had gained prominence through news media appearances rather than legal work.\n\nHe hired Mr. Dowd, Mr. Sekulow and Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer for the investigation, who all advised the president to be more cooperative with the special counsel, convincing him that it would hasten the end of the investigation. They also promised him at several points that the inquiry would be over by last December.\n\nThe president was said to be pleased with the resignation of Mr. Dowd, whose prickly personality had begun to grate on him and other members of the legal team, according to a person who spoke with the president. Mr. Trump had lost confidence in his lead lawyer in recent weeks and had spoken to the outside lawyers without directly consulting Mr. Dowd about hiring them, the person said.\n\nTensions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Dowd began to emerge publicly in January when the president told reporters that he was eager to be interviewed by the special counsel. Mr. Dowd, who had taken the lead in dealing with investigators about an interview, had been trying to persuade Mr. Mueller to allow the president to answer questions in writing or through recorded video. Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration angered Mr. Dowd, who viewed it as undercutting whatever leverage he had over Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cI will make the decision on whether the president talks to the special counsel,\u201d Mr. Dowd told reporters at the time. \u201cI have not made any decision yet.\u201d\n\nMr. Dowd, along with other lawyers on the team, recognized the risks of putting a client prone to hyperbole and inaccuracies in the same room with prosecutors. Mr. Mueller has already prosecuted several people for making false statements in the case.\n\nMr. Dowd, a former Marine Corps captain and seasoned Washington defense lawyer, was best known as leading the Major League Baseball inquiry into gambling accusations involving Pete Rose, baseball\u2019s hits leader and the former Cincinnati Reds manager.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Dowd also represented Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, when he was accused of improperly meeting with federal bank regulators as a favor for a political donor. Mr. McCain was ultimately exonerated.\n\nBut shortly after taking over, Mr. Dowd committed a series of unforced errors that raised questions about his judgment. In August, he forwarded an email to journalists, government officials and friends that echoed secessionist Civil War propaganda and equated the South\u2019s rebellion to that of the American Revolution against England.\n\nA month later, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb were overheard by a New York Times reporter openly discussing intimate details about the president\u2019s legal strategy over lunch at a bistro near the White House.\n\nIn December, Mr. Dowd was forced to apologize for composing a tweet posted by the president suggesting Mr. Trump knew his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had lied to the F.B.I. Mr. Flynn had pleaded guilty a day earlier to the charge and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel.\n\nFinally, last weekend, amid the fallout from the firing of a top F.B.I. official, Mr. Dowd called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd, who had forged relationships with the special counsel\u2019s office, said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked.\n\nThe president was angered with Mr. Dowd\u2019s handling of the episode, telling people that it was ham-handed and that Mr. Dowd should not have backed off his initial statement. Mr. Dowd has told people that the president had recently implored him to stay, but he was said to be considering quitting earlier this week.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Lawyer Resigns as President Adopts Aggressive Approach in Russia Inquiry", "authors": ["Michael S.

And it\u2019s our national security that is at stake.\u201d\n\nWhile the president\u2019s economic pressure may have prompted him to come to the table, Mr. Kim made few known concessions to win a meeting with Mr. Trump. The North Korean leader agreed to suspend nuclear and missile tests for the moment, although after a year of accelerated tests, they may not be as necessary for the program\u2019s development at this point. And he assented to routine joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea that usually draw his ire.\n\nWhat Drives Kim Jong-un?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine any other president doing this on the basis of these general comments passed on from Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Christopher R.

He cited Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a move Democratic and Republican presidents were too wary to make. While it drew loud protests from Palestinians, Mr. Carafano said, the world did not come to an end.\n\nBut Mr. Carafano cautioned against expecting a breakthrough if the meeting with Mr. Kim takes place. \u201cThe odds of him actually negotiating something are incredibly small,\u201d he said. But the president\u2019s agreement to talk dispels the warnings by critics that Mr. Trump was inevitably headed to war with North Korea through his bellicose messaging. \u201cOur policy is not on this inevitable path to World War III.\u201d\n\nStill, the critics remain dubious. While they have urged Mr. Trump to try diplomacy, many said they did not mean that he should do it personally, and they warned that the president did not seem to have a thought-through plan for what he could reasonably achieve and how he would do it. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated criticism of Mr. Obama\u2019s Iran deal \u2014 and a looming deadline for deciding whether to scrap it \u2014 the president would be hard pressed to agree to any accord with North Korea that fell short of its terms.\n\n\u201cTrump sees himself as a master negotiator, and yet is not particularly good at it,\u201d said Colin Kahl, a former national security official under Mr. Obama. \u201cHe isn\u2019t thoughtful or steeped in the types of details required for this type of diplomacy. He is prone to manipulation and flattery. He often makes threats he doesn\u2019t follow through on and promises he can\u2019t or won\u2019t keep. And he often throws allies under the bus. This does not add up to a recipe for success, and the stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nBut the president\u2019s aides said he was full of surprises and should not be discounted. While noting that this would be a meeting, not a negotiation, a senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Trump was elected in part because he was willing to take approaches different from those of other presidents, a trait best exemplified by his North Korea policy.\n\nMr. Kim is the undisputed master of his totalitarian system, the official said, and so it made sense to accept an invitation to meet with the one person who can actually make decisions instead of repeating the long slog of the past.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe real question, then, becomes whether the only two leaders who can make decisions can make one together.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Meeting With Kim Jong-un Is Another Pledge to Do What Nobody Else Can", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

Because steel and aluminum aren\u2019t final goods \u2013 nobody directly consumes steel. Instead, they\u2019re intermediate goods, basically used as inputs to other U.S. manufacturing sectors. And while tariffs that raise primary metal prices may increase production of those metals, they make the rest of U.S. manufacturing less competitive.\n\nTrade economists used to talk about this kind of thing a lot. Back when most developing countries were trying to promote manufacturing with tariffs and import quotas, we used to talk about effective protection, which depended on the whole structure of tariffs. Sometimes effective rates of protection were very high: if you imposed, say, a modest tariff on cars but none on imported auto parts, the effective rate of protection for auto assembly could easily be in the hundreds of percent. Sometimes, however, rates were negative: if you put a tariff on parts but not on cars, you were actually discouraging auto assembly.\n\nClearly, we can apply this kind of analysis to the Trump tariffs.

Many of them had spent the previous two weeks frantically lobbying the administration for a permanent exemption, but the White House said late Thursday that those nations would have until May 1 to negotiate \u201csatisfactory alternative means\u201d to address the national security threat that America faced from a reliance on foreign metals.\n\nIn addition to the metals tariffs, the White House announced levies on up to $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, a move that provoked immediate promises of retaliation by China and sent stock markets into a tailspin. On Saturday morning, the Chinese vice premier for financial and industrial policy, Liu He, told Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a phone call that the United States\u2019 actions against China violate international trade rules and run counter to American, Chinese and global interests. He warned that China has the strength to defend its national interests.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump boasted that his approach would produce better trade deals for the United States, including what he said was a breakthrough in negotiations with South Korea. \u201cSome tremendous trade deals are being made with various countries,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re negotiating very long, very hard, but very quickly.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Keep Allies, Markets and Industry Guessing", "authors": []}

Shanks, Ford Motor\u2019s chief financial officer, said commodities markets had already started to price in increases for steel and aluminum on the expectation that Mr. Trump would impose the tariffs. The effect on Ford, he said, is \u201cnot positive\u201d given the automaker uses those metals in the cars they produce.\n\nThe European Union detailed a three-step plan to penalize $3.5 billion of American trade \u2014 the same amount of European steel and aluminum the bloc estimates would be harmed by the planned tariffs. It proposed taxing American exports including bourbon, bluejeans, orange juice, cranberries, rice and motorcycles. The European Union could then take action to protect their own metal makers from a surge in imports, and bring a case against the United States at the World Trade Organization.\n\nA European Union official said that the bloc had been preparing for the announcement for months and that everything was in place for a swift, proportionate response.\n\nThe measures were intended to put pressure on politically sensitive areas, trade analysts said. Harley-Davidson motorcycles are made in the home district of Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Orange juice comes from the swing state of Florida.

But the Soviet economy collapsed largely because it relied on commodity prices, a vulnerability that remained in place during Russia\u2019s catastrophic free-market 1990s and still today.\n\nAnd the American economy was more centralized during the Cold War than is widely remembered. Though Americans told themselves that their geopolitical advances sprang naturally from private enterprise, many came from state-led projects, such as those that developed the space program or the internet. The country also poured money into strategic industries such as automobiles and steel during a period, the 1950s and 1960s, when vast international markets were opening up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet now the United States is drifting into a strange place where it really does have the decentralized, unguided economy that it told itself it had during the Cold War, but it is now also closing access to the international trade that such a system requires.\n\nAnd China, long unwilling to choose between an open or a closed world, is being pushed toward the latter. The country certainly presents itself as economically self-sufficient, something that becomes more true as its middle class grows into a robust domestic market. And its ability to direct vast resources to state-led projects, such as solar power or artificial intelligence, do promise the sort of geopolitical gains once achieved in the United States.\n\nBut the modern Chinese economy really dates only to the early 1990s, and it has always relied on American-led free trade, particularly access to the United States itself. While many critics of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs argue that a self-imposed American decline will naturally aid China\u2019s rise, this is merely another version of Mr. Trump\u2019s zero-sum worldview. Maybe it\u2019s correct. But it\u2019s also possible that China, however tentatively, bought into the American-led order for a reason, and that the decline of this system will hurt Beijing, as well.\n\nThe safest bet, however, is almost always on the forces of the status quo. Mr. Bush\u2019s 2002 foray into protectionism also initially looked like an end to the then-much-younger era of Chinese buy-in to the liberal world order.

Chinese officials had assumed that would keep Mr. Trump from following through on his trade threats, as he had suggested more than once.\n\nWhen it became clear this year that cooperation on North Korea would not be enough to placate trade hawks in the Trump administration, Mr. Xi redoubled efforts to head off the tariffs, dispatching his senior economic adviser, Liu He, to Washington last month.\n\nThat mission ended, however, in a humiliating snub. Though Mr. Liu was acting as Mr. Xi\u2019s personal envoy, Mr. Trump declined to meet him.

But to prevent anything this dreadful from ever happening in the future, Trump added that he was \u201ccalling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills.\u201d After members of the House and Senate finished rolling around on the floor laughing, the world moved forward.\n\nExcept for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who told a Fox interviewer that he thought it would indeed be a good idea to allow the president to wipe out any pieces of the congressional budget that he didn\u2019t like. When informed that line-item veto power had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, Mnuchin said, \u201cWell, again, Congress could pass a rule, O.K., that allows them to do it.\u201d\n\nThis is an administration that goes through high-ranking officials like Raisinettes at a movie.

Commerce has tended to plunge, with the working class suffering lost jobs and diminished livelihoods. Alliances have been frayed, heightening international tensions.\n\nMany economists and international-relations experts assume that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could play out much the same way, isolating the United States while imperiling a global economic expansion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot least, the tariffs seem likely to present the World Trade Organization with a potentially existential crisis.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe organization has been described as the referee for global commerce, settling disputes on the basis of rules adopted by consensus among its 164 members. Now, the referee may be on the verge of losing control of the game.\n\nIn justifying its tariffs as a response to a supposed threat to national security \u2014 a contention that has drawn derision from economists \u2014 the Trump administration has virtually ensured a challenge from the European Union via a complaint filed with the trade organization. That would put the institution in a predicament in which any course risks undermining its authority.\n\nThe trade organization could rule in favor of the United States, deferring to American sovereignty and its right to determine its national security policies. But that would hand every country on earth a template to break with the norms of international trade.\n\n\u201cThis would open the floodgates to everyone bringing in broad exceptions,\u201d said Ms. Crowley, the Cambridge expert.\n\nOr the body could rule against the United States, rejecting the argument that metal forged in Europe poses a mortal peril to Americans. The Trump administration might then ignore the ruling and carry on, forcing the W.T.O. to give countries the right to retaliate.\n\nHostilities would most likely expand well beyond steel and aluminum. Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge of tariffs has enraged and astounded American allies whose fortunes are tied to producing these metals, like Japan, South Korea, Germany and Taiwan.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Union outlined plans to retaliate with tariffs on a variety of American goods, including motorcycles, rice and bourbon. If reprisals continued, Europe might limit exports of other American agricultural products, intensifying its push against genetically modified crops. In the most extreme case, Europe might even impede American investment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real chance that everyone reacts very negatively,\u201d said Jennifer A.

An eye for an eye will leave us all blind and the world in deep recession.\u201d\n\nTrade frictions are a constant in the global economy. Governments wield tariffs, import quotas and other instruments to protect sensitive industries. But a trade war is different, holding the potential to damage living standards on multiple continents.\n\n\u201cYou start viewing it as a conflict between nations,\u201d said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research institution in Washington. \u201cYou put a premium on doing damage rather than deterring bad behavior.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Trump and his advisers appear to be calculating that, as the largest economy on earth, the United States possesses enough muscle to dictate the terms of world trade.\n\n\u201cThey are under the delusion that the United States has been screwed by the global system that it created,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cThey apparently think that everyone else will fold if they stand up.\u201d\n\nThat idea, he added, is about to be exposed as wrong.\n\nAs the United States grappled with the Great Depression, a Republican-controlled Congress seized on protectionism as the fix, adopting the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to wall off American farms and factories from foreign competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe law sharply increased tariffs on hundreds of goods \u2014 from sugar to shoes to iron. American trading partners responded with their own tariffs, and commerce deteriorated, deepening the depression.\n\nAfter Democrats captured control of Congress and the White House in 1932, tariffs fell sharply, bolstering American trade. But Britain, France, Germany and other European powers maintained steep tariffs. Trade disintegrated, exacerbating nationalist animosities that exploded into World War II.\n\nThe last substantial outbreak of trade hostilities played out in the 1980s, as the United States grappled with the consequences of a rising Japan. The American auto industry \u2014 caught unprepared for the public\u2019s embrace of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles \u2014 lobbied Washington for tariffs to limit a surge of Japanese imports. President Ronald Reagan ultimately pressured Japan to voluntarily restrict auto exports to the United States.\n\nJapanese-made automobiles sold in the United States soared in price. Seeking to avoid tariffs while improving trust, Japanese car companies began setting up plants to make their vehicles in the United States, employing American workers.\n\nTrade advisers to Mr. Trump cite this history as an example of how an aggressive stance can set up fruitful trade negotiations. But major differences separate that episode from today.\n\nBack in the 1980s, auto plants needed to be built somewhere to serve swelling American demand for small cars. Japan was firmly dependent on good relations with Washington for its security, making it prone to avoid conflict.\n\nToday\u2019s primary American trade antagonist is China, ruled by the apparent president-for-life Xi Jinping, whose nationalist credo does not leave room for caving to pressure from Washington. The world faces a glut of steel, much of it made in China. Whatever tariffs the Trump administration maintains, foreign steel manufacturers are not likely to construct new plants in the United States.\n\nAmong proponents of liberalized trade, the most hopeful history may be the most recent chapter.\n\nIn 2002, President George W. Bush put tariffs on steel to protect American producers against imports. Then, as now, companies that make products using steel vastly outnumbered those that produce the metal. As automakers and other steel buyers confronted higher costs, the tariffs eliminated some 200,000 jobs, according to one study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nForeign steel producers filed a challenge at the W.T.O., which ruled that the United States had acted without justification. Europe prepared a list of American goods to stick with retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Bush backed down.\n\nBut if the global trading apparatus successfully defused that crisis, the current situation presents a different challenge given the nature of the commander waging the attack.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental view of this administration seems to be, somewhat bizarrely, that the United States has not benefited from trade,\u201d Ms. Crowley said. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s not really registering how damaging this could be.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Warning Shot on Trade Risks Igniting a Wider Conflict", "authors": ["Peter S.

Mr. de Blasio said that, sitting at a table in Gracie Mansion at 10 p.m. Sunday, he offered Mr. Carranza the job and Mr. Carranza said \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe will be paid $345,000, which the mayor said was his salary in Houston. Ms. Farina made $244,430, but after decades working in the city\u2019s school system she also collected a pension.\n\nThe speed of the announcement underscored Mr. de Blasio\u2019s need to find a replacement for Ms. Fari\u00f1a, 74, who seemed to already have one foot out the door. Her goodbye party at Tweed Courthouse, the Education Department\u2019s headquarters, was held on Friday, after which she flew to Florida, where she has a home. But at Monday\u2019s news conference, she suggested that she would be around for a while, saying that there would be two chancellors for a period. And she wants to continue to work on a high schools initiative even after Mr. Carranza takes over, she said.\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a sent a valedictory email on Friday to the city\u2019s teachers, thanking them for their dedication and offering one last bit of advice.\n\n\u201cI want to remind you how strong our school system is, and that we must remain focused on the work ahead,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOur system is bigger than one single person; it is powerful because of our collective strength and belief that to reach all students, we must focus on each.\u201d", "title": "Trying Again, de Blasio Names a New Schools Chancellor", "authors": ["William Neuman", "Elizabeth A.

Nakesha had more friends who stuck by her and maintained an interest in helping her; I felt more alone. Many of my good friends \u2014 though certainly not all \u2014 acted toward me with an attitude like disgust, once it became clear that I needed help.\n\nI suffered from bipolar disorder, however, not some form of schizophrenia with paranoia, like Nakesha. I was able to accept help. I stayed in shelters almost every night \u2014 in two years I don\u2019t think I slept on the street once \u2014 and eventually was given housing by the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health. Nakesha, by contrast, feared psychiatric treatment and the assistance of social workers and state agencies. This is the curse of paranoid people, especially intelligent and perceptive ones. They are aware of the wretchedness of their situations, but are prevented, by their delusions, from engaging with forces that will heal them, shelter them or rescue them.\n\nThank you for turning Nakesha Williams back into a human being \u2014 and for doing it on the front page of The New York Times, where, maybe, Nakesha\u2019s story will reach and touch people who dehumanize and objectify the homeless.\n\nNICHOLAS N. FINKELSTEIN\n\nBOSTON\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThe tragic saga of Nakesha Williams is an all too familiar story of the homeless mentally ill. The tragedy is not only the impact of her illness, likely schizophrenia, which robs a young adult of the promise and opportunity of having a normal life, but also of the failure of the health care system to find a way to treat her. The many individuals who befriended her while she lived on the street, who provided for some of her material needs, failed to get her into medical treatment, which almost certainly would have resulted in a profound reversal of the slide that her life had taken.\n\nAntipsychotic medications would have substantially reversed if not eliminated the paranoid ideas and fears that had crippled her capacity to realize her innate potential. Part of the difficulty in getting her treated was clearly her resistance, but this is the Catch-22 of schizophrenia. The illness itself obliterates an individual\u2019s capacity to have agency for one\u2019s own health. The question of whether she was a danger to herself in need of involuntary treatment was answered by the final chapter of her story.\n\nDANIEL R. WEINBERGER\n\nBALTIMORE\n\nThe writer is director of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThough we lost touch many years ago, I am fortunate to see my friend and former colleague Nakesha\u2019s bright light come shining through in this powerful and heartbreaking story. The evidence of her sojourn here will not be easily forgotten. Nakesha was a teacher, and it is amazing to see how her life is still teaching us all. She has given the invisibility of homelessness a name and a face. I am also struck by the many people who entered Nakesha\u2019s life to provide support along the way.", "title": "Opinion | Trying to Help a Homeless Woman", "authors": []}

In fact, the stories are similar: Both use the children\u2019s school as a stage, with the parents as the stars. \u201cMrs.\u201d is set among the Manhattan 1-percenters who count wine cellars and his-and-hers drivers as necessities, just as the TV version of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is set among the wealthy of Monterey. And as both stories unfold, the pursuit of luxurious lifestyles becomes incidental to survival, revenge and redemption.\n\nConsider a scene from \u201cMrs.\u201d that might as well have been directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e. Two mothers confront John D. Curtis and engage him in combat, eventually wresting from his wife an overdue debt.

The transfer of personnel from the Kurdish-led, American-backed militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or S.D.F., is a blow to Washington\u2019s effort to stamp out the last vestiges of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Americans have insisted that although they are allied with the S.D.F. in eastern Syria, they have no affiliation with the group in the northwest and will not aid any of its operations there. But with its Kurdish coalition allies now streaming to join the defenders in Afrin, that posture will be increasingly difficult to maintain. As a result, in Afrin, the Trump administration is finding itself awkwardly on the opposite side from Turkey.\n\nThe S.D.F. said in a statement on Tuesday that it had made a \u201cpainful decision\u201d to move the fighters from Deir al-Zour to Afrin, citing \u201cthe failure of the international community\u201d to pressure Turkey and \u201cstop its madness within our Syrian borders.\u201d\n\nThe role in Afrin of the Kurdish militia known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., which is the main component of the S.D.F., has raised tensions with Turkey, which considers the militia an extension of a separatist group that is active in Turkey and is listed as a terrorist group by both Ankara and Washington.\n\nFor six weeks, Turkey has mounted a campaign to wrest control of Afrin from the Y.P.G., an offensive that has displaced some 10,000 people and killed several hundred civilians and 41 Turkish soldiers. Mr. Erdogan said this week that 159 Syrians belonging to the Free Syrian Army, which is fighting alongside Turkish armed forces, had also died.\n\nThe Y.P.G. has responded with cross-border shelling, leading to civilian deaths in Turkey.\n\nAdding to the complications, the Y.P.G., which has carved out a zone of de facto autonomy from the Syrian government within Afrin and in a larger swath of northeastern Syria, last week allowed some pro-government militias to enter its territory to help the fight against Turkey.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The videos, in which some people could be seen waving Syrian government flags, could not be independently verified.\n\nThe residents of eastern Ghouta have lived under a harsh government siege since 2013 and have borne the brunt of a heavy bombing campaign that has pounded the enclave for weeks, claiming the lives of over 800 civilians to date. The bombardment has continued despite a unanimously approved 30-day cease-fire agreed to by the United Nations Security Council that was intended to provide respite and an opportunity for civilians to evacuate.\n\nAfter the failed negotiations, about 700 fresh pro-government troops arrived on Wednesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported, in preparation for a push into the urban heart of the rebel-held enclave.\n\nSyrian and Russian authorities maintain that rebels have shelled the humanitarian corridor and prevented civilians from leaving. The Russian Ministry of Defense, in a briefing on Wednesday, maintained that only 17 people had thus far been able to evacuate through the corridor.\n\nSince the onslaught began less than a month ago, pro-government forces have seized about 40 percent of eastern Ghouta, mostly rural areas.

It saves taxpayers money and keeps our few remaining wild remote public lands intact. Most important, it maintains options for future generations.\n\nThe Tongass includes some of the most productive and valuable fish and wildlife habitat in the world. A report by Southeast Conference, a regional economic development organization, shows that Southeast Alaska\u2019s tourism industry supports 17 percent of all jobs while the seafood industry, mostly commercial fishing for salmon, accounts for 9 percent of jobs. The Tongass National Forest makes up 78 percent of the land base in Southeast Alaska and is the mainstay of the region\u2019s economy.\n\nThe targeting of the Tongass is the latest in Senator Murkowski\u2019s efforts to turn back longstanding protections of wild places in Alaska. She championed the lifting late last year of a decades-old ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern Alaska, as well as a land swap announced in January that will allow a road through environmentally important wetlands in the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nWe should keep the Tongass as it is. Rather than passing amendments that micromanage the Forest Service and undo the progress that has been made, Congress should assist the agency on pressing issues like the spiraling cost of wilderness firefighting. To restart road building in Alaska\u2019s most pristine national forests will only repeat history, leading to more lawsuits and uncertainty while undercutting the region\u2019s economic bases of fishing and tourism.", "title": "Opinion | Turning Back the Clock on Protecting Alaska\u2019s Wild Lands", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "Though Mr. Gaiman hasn\u2019t been directly involved in this new version \u2014 earlier this month he finished shooting a screen adaptation of his novel \u201cGood Omens,\u201d written with Terry Pratchett \u2014 Mr. Turnage and Mr. Mullarkey have had plenty to play with. The novel begins when little Coraline Jones discovers that a bricked-up door in the apartment she\u2019s just moved into is a portal to a nightmarish \u201cother world.\u201d Trapped behind the door, she finds a figure with black buttons for eyes who coos that she\u2019s Coraline\u2019s \u201cother mother\u201d and promises her anything she desires, if only she agrees to stay \u201cfor ever and always.\u201d Coraline\u2019s journey home to her real parents is not only a coming-of-age story; it also becomes a mythic quest.\n\nA powerful, self-determined heroine, Coraline is more than a match for operatic heroines like Leonore in Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio\u201d or Rosina from Rossini\u2019s \u201cThe Barber of Seville.\u201d The role is shared in the new production by the sopranos Mary Bevan and Robyn Allegra Parton.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a strong female character,\u201d Mr. Turnage said. \u201cShe\u2019s powerful; she\u2019s going to solve these things. I\u2019ve got a seven-year-old daughter. S he\u2019s too young to read the book, but she saw the film, and she was very taken with Coraline.\u201d\n\nAlthough the opera, like the novel, is aimed at young audiences \u2014 Mr. Turnage has dedicated it to his daughter and his youngest son \u2014 it goes to some genuinely disturbing places. The sense that evil lurks around every corner is palpable; there are heavy hints, too, of abuse in the plotline of parent-like figures who bribe a child to love them. While critics have often compared the book to Lewis Carroll, Mr. Gaiman\u2019s universe is arguably closer to David Lynch or Stephen King in its atmosphere of suspenseful, what-lies-beneath horror.\n\n\u201cI wanted to write about how people who have your best interests at heart may not always pay you the kind of attention that you\u2019d like,\u201d Mr. Gaiman said in a statement. \u201cAnd people who pay a lot of attention to you may not always have your best interests at heart.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Collins agreed that, despite its fairy-tale qualities, this narrative is not for the fainthearted. \u201cThe story is: You can have anything you want in the whole wide world, as long as you let me sew buttons into your eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Turnage clearly relishes the material\u2019s otherworldly side; the score, written for 15 musicians, is astringent and occasionally violent, bringing to mind early chamber pieces such as \u201cOn All Fours\u201d (1983) and \u201cBlood on the Floor\u201d (1996). But \u201cCoraline\u201d does allow audiences some moments of fun. The composer said he enjoyed coming up with Broadway-ish music for the character of Mr. Bobo, an eccentric old man who dwells in the apartment above Coraline and conducts the mouse orchestra. Two retired actresses who live in the apartment beneath, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, are portrayed as divas of a certain age who issue Cassandra-like pronouncements about fate in high-voltage coloratura.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe fantasy element is so heightened,\u201d Mr. Turnage said. \u201cCompletely operatic.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Opera has staged eight new operas for young people and families in the last five years, among them Julian Philips\u2019s \u201cHow the Whale Became\u201d (2013), based on children\u2019s stories by Ted Hughes, and Adriano Adewale\u2019s \u201cHatch\u201d (2017), billed as a \u201csensory experience for children aged 2 to 5.\u201d The profusion indicates how seriously the company is trying to demolish the perceived barriers that surround the art form, and to attract new and more diverse audiences.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It also runs school workshops and outreach projects in towns outside London, including in some of the region\u2019s most deprived areas.\n\nMr. Turnage, who grew up in Essex, not far from London, and was the first member of his family to get a college education, said he hoped audiences for \u201cCoraline\u201d would come from all walks of life. The opera world sometimes wasn\u2019t as outward-facing as it should be, he suggested.\n\n\u201cA lot of opera directors are making opera for other opera directors, and quite a few opera composers are writing for their peer group,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough \u201cCoraline\u201d has been in development for over four years, both he and Ms. Collins said that the theme of a young woman standing up for herself against the odds had acquired particular topicality in the context of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. The classical world has experienced plentiful rumors about sexual harassment, along with some high-profile firings \u2014 notably of the conductors Charles Dutoit and James Levine, who was pushed out of the Met earlier this month.\n\nMr. Turnage said that, while some things had improved over his years in the business, \u201cI\u2019m acutely aware of women working in the opera world and the way that they\u2019re marginalized, and how tough it is. Everybody knows this.\u201d\n\nHe added he was proud that, as well as having created a strong female lead, the production also has a largely female creative team, led by Ms. Collins and the conductor Sian Edwards. \u201cThe world is changing,\u201d Mr. Turnage said.\n\nHe added that he hoped \u201cCoraline\u201d offered a path forward, in its way. He was inspired by a quotation from G.K. Chesterton that Mr. Gaiman uses as the epigraph of the book: \u201cFairy tales are more than true: Not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\u201d", "title": "Turning a Ghoulish Children\u2019s Book Into a Grand Opera", "authors": ["Andrew Dickson"]}

Though Kenny offers little exposition about the era, her austere landscapes and careful attention to color and light evoke the paintings of Andrew Wyeth or Edward Hopper, or the poetry of William Carlos Williams, suffusing the book with a midcentury mood throughout.\n\nLess placid is Kristin Hannah\u2019s \u201cThe Great Alone.\u201d Hannah has written more than 20 books since 1991, and her fan base has grown along with her oeuvre.

He\u2019s been suffering from post-traumatic stress ever since, and Leni and her mother, Cora, suffer too as Ernt moves them from one home to another, trying to find peace in a chaotic world.

Though Leni and Cora have misgivings about leaving their current home in Seattle, they share Ernt\u2019s hope for a restorative new life in the last frontier.\n\nThe family arrives on the picturesque, sparsely populated Kenai Peninsula, where they immediately meet the neighbors.

Shortly thereafter, we meet an elderly man, apparently somewhat unhinged, who offers, \u201cFolks call me Mad Earl.\u201d Folks don\u2019t just have descriptive nicknames in Hannah\u2019s Alaska; they have a tendency to use bumper-sticker-like slogans in everyday conversation.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "Painted quickly in 1634, when Rembrandt was burnishing his reputation as a portraitist to the wealthy in Amsterdam, each portrait depicts one half of a couple, their names unknown. A half-smile plays mildly on the woman\u2019s lips, and her face is ringed with intricate detail, like her frizzy curls, scratched into the paint, and the delicate lace of her collar, molded with calligraphic strokes over thick impasto. The man\u2019s gaze seems softer, with gentle light on one side of his face, which emerges below a wide-rimmed black hat and above the inky black robes of his dress.\n\nThe two paintings, which were given to the museum in 1893, are workhorse Rembrandts, long considered too important to the museum\u2019s narrative of Dutch art and the old masters to remove from the walls. So the Museum of Fine Arts approached the Executive Committee of the European Fine Art Foundation \u2014 or Tefaf \u2014 with a proposal they hoped would put some wind in their sails: If Tefaf could give the museum a grant to help restore the woman\u2019s portrait, the museum would commit to restoring the man\u2019s, as well.\n\n\u201cWe would never do just one,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cThey should always be treated together.\u201d\n\nIn December, Tefaf announced that the museum had won a \u20ac25,000 grant, about $30,000, for the restoration of the painting of the woman (the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga in Portugal was the other recipient of a similar grant, to restore tiles in a chapel on its premises).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important painting,\u201d said Rachel Kaminsky, a longtime art dealer who is a member of the Tefaf panel that selected the grant recipients. By the end of the restoration, she said, the hope is to \u201chave two fantastic paintings that are on regular view at the museum that look their very best, and that they look as close as possible to what Rembrandt originally painted.\u201d\n\nRecently, the Rembrandt portraits came off the walls, bringing Ms. Baer a measure of relief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they look so great in the gallery,\u201d she said, and pointed to the particularly maddening problem on the man: \u201cJust walking by, because he has so much discolored in-painting on the side of his face, it always bothered me tremendously.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTime has been crueler to the man than the woman in part because of a crucial difference in the way their faces were depicted. It was customary at the time to paint women\u2019s faces with a bloom of light, which meant that for light-skinned subjects, a face would be rendered with more lead white paint, which proved sturdy over the centuries. The man\u2019s face, painted in shadow, was composed with umbers and ochers that had a higher oil content than the lead white.\n\n\u201cIt may change more over time naturally, and it\u2019s a little bit more vulnerable to cleaning, in previous centuries, when people didn\u2019t have the same techniques we have,\u201d said Rhona MacBeth, the museum\u2019s head of paintings conservation. \u201cMaybe someone cleaned a little more than they should have done and did some damage to the shadows.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow Ms. MacBeth, who has been assigned to execute the restoration, will get her turn.\n\nTechnical analyses of the paintings reveal the challenges ahead: Ultraviolet light shows multiple layers of uneven varnish, which have grayed and picked up dirt over the years, dulling the images. An infrared image shows secrets belied by the varnish, like buttons painted on the man\u2019s black clothes, or a sharp line in the folds that suggests that he may be wearing a cloak. And there are hints that Rembrandt may have made his own adjustments to the woman\u2019s hair.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. MacBeth swabs the surface of the paintings with a traditional cleaning fluid: saliva, which contains an enzyme that helps swipe grime away. She will use her own.\n\n\u201cNo spirits at lunch,\u201d Ms. MacBeth joked.\n\nNext, she develops a special combination of solvents that can be used to dissolve multiple layers of varnish on the paintings, including a natural resin and a synthetic varnish that was added to them during their last major restorations, in 1977. She will carefully remove the varnish and, with the help of a microscope, use a tiny ophthalmic scalpel to lift grime and varnish from the impasto, where the sculpted layers of paint have trapped grime over time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of cleaning a relief sculpture; that\u2019s what it feels like,\u201d Ms. MacBeth said. \u201cThe tiniest sculpture.\u201d\n\nThe old varnish has almost yellowed the white lace of the woman\u2019s collar and the man\u2019s ruff, dulling the pops of white and the light-reflecting texture Rembrandt used to render its exquisite detail.\n\nAs the varnish comes off, so too will much of the paint from previous restorations \u2014 including, Ms. MacBeth and Ms. Baer hope, the splotches on the man\u2019s face, and another section of retouching on the wall behind the woman.\n\n\u201cEven the background will come alive,\u201d Ms. Baer said.\n\nAny restoration brings risk. Ms. MacBeth must ensure that her solvents do not remove anything they are not supposed to. If she were to clean one painting more than the other, the two would be thrown off balance, so she will work carefully to ensure she does not make any part of either painting cleaner than she can get anything else.\n\nFinally, Ms. MacBeth will revarnish the paintings. And then, working closely with Ms. Baer, she will determine what she needs to retouch. She may put tiny dots of paint on a section of the man\u2019s robes where the paint has grown thin \u2014 but she will do it judiciously, knowing all too well that overzealous retouching can cause problems in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make these look brand-new,\u201d Ms. MacBeth said. \u201cWe just want them to kind of, put their best foot forward, to look the best they possibly can with the understanding that things happen over time.\u201d", "title": "Two Rembrandts Get a Second Chance in Boston", "authors": ["Jess Bidgood"]}

XXXTentacion harks back to the late-2000s Warped Tour, when melodic hardcore and screamo began flirting with hip-hop, in terms of cadences and also production textures. 6ix9ine, on the other hand, is often more reminiscent of New York hardcore than New York hip-hop. When he\u2019s at his most rap-adjacent, it\u2019s in the spirit of the early Ruff Ryders era, one of hip-hop\u2019s rowdiest and rawest moments. (He also nods to the fusion of the \u201cJudgment Night\u201d soundtrack and the horrorcore of the mid- to late 1990s \u2014 a one-man Family Values tour in the making.)\n\n6ix9ine is a brute-force screamer, and \u201cDAY69\u201d is a rough gauntlet of gun and sex talk, invigorating and also deadening. As a rapper, 6ix9ine is a boxer \u2014 he thrives on rasp and repetition, as if constantly looking to pick a fistfight. Occasionally he incorporates a touch of wordplay \u2014 \u201cI need all of mine, try to try me and it\u2019s Columbine/Let that Ruger fly, automatic poppin\u2019 at your guys/You gon\u2019 lose a guy, \u2019tato on the barrel, give \u2019em fries\u201d on \u201cCHOCOLAT\u00c9\u201d \u2014 but mostly he\u2019s landing one jab after the next.\n\nFor both artists, songs are short \u2014 around a 2:08 average for XXXTentacion (including interludes) and 2:28 for 6ix9ine \u2014 because their bursts of energy might not last another 90 seconds, and because there is little infrastructure in place to push them toward more conventional structures. (For what it\u2019s worth, most pop songs are only interesting for about two minutes.) Many of XXXTentacion\u2019s songs don\u2019t feel like much more than demos, experiments that under other circumstances might be thickened up for broader appeal.", "title": "Two SoundCloud Rap Outlaws Push Boundaries From the Fringes", "authors": []}

France has long leaned toward the kind of director-led, concept-driven stage fare that many in Britain, raised on the importance of text and naturalistic acting, find vexing.\n\nYet a few British directors have made the jump to Paris and gained a following there, most prominent among them Peter Brook and Declan Donnellan. Both debuted new productions in the French capital this month ahead of international tours; both have found ways to bridge the cultural gap, with work that combines storytelling and a strong directorial voice.\n\nMr. Brook returned to a theater he has long been associated with, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Bouffes du Nord, to present \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d a philosophical tale about punishment and redemption. While the 92-year-old director is beloved in Britain, where he started his career in the 1940s, he has now resided in France for nearly 50 years.\n\nIn 1974, he discovered the Bouffes du Nord, a dilapidated 19th-century music hall in a less-than-upscale area, which had been closed as a safety measure in 1952. Mr. Brook oversaw its renovation with his theater company, the International Centre for Theatre Research. They preserved its threadbare charm, and while Mr. Brook handed over the reins of his artistic home to Olivier Mantei and Olivier Poubelle in 2008, he has continued to show new work there.", "title": "Two Theater Worlds Collide in Paris", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "Before I turned 17, my family had moved eight times. In Honolulu, we lived in my maternal grandparents\u2019 house, a wooden plantation-style 1940s bungalow shaded from the late-afternoon sun by a copse of pink and red torch ginger that had grown so tall and dense that its leaves poked through the sea-glass-green jalousies. In New York we lived in an apartment building overlooking the East River, where all the residents with children would leave their front doors open during the day, turning the floors into a honeycombed communal space for us kids to inhabit. In Texas, before we moved into a house, we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, my brother and I sleeping in the living room on soft cotton chairs that unfolded into futon-like mattresses.\n\nBecause we were so transitory, I grew up associating the idea of home less with a physical structure than with the objects that inhabited it: A place became ours, mine, only when the 19th-century pine chest was positioned in the living room, when the early American quilt with its worn calico squares was hung on the wall, when our books had been unpacked and placed on the shelves.\n\nThat was one ritual. The other was the leave-taking. And with each place we departed, we left something behind, some evidence that, yes, we had been there, and that for a short time, we had possessed that space. In Baltimore, we left dozens of parrot tulips that had been my father\u2019s pride; in Texas, a vegetable garden of wildly curling squash vines where once there had been only silt; in Irvine, Calif. \u2014 still, in the mid-\u201980s, rising from an empty stretch of clay \u2014 my brother\u2019s and my heights, notched into a white-painted door frame.\n\nThe instinct to mark the place one has occupied in the world is not particular to humans \u2014 animals create middens or nests made of saliva or dung or bits of straw \u2014 but it is, like the very act of collecting objects, one of the impulses from which culture is born and defined. None of us can resist announcing our presence, no matter how temporal or humble our dwelling might be; we write ourselves into walls as a way of protesting the relentlessness, the uncaringness, of time.\n\nSometimes, as in the case of Alfred Liechtenstein and his wife, Alice, that transcription becomes its own sort of decoration. The Austrian castle they live in with their children is both a puzzle and a palimpsest: The first of its 52 rooms were built in the 12th century; Alfred\u2019s family has inhabited it since the 19th. Throughout, proof of ghosts from the past can be seen \u2014 ancestors who have painted their portraits on its ceilings, who have etched their names into its surfaces. Now, the couple is leaving their own mark: a trippy Op Art-inspired elevator; a collection of furniture from contemporary designers. The castle is on loan to them from the generations that will succeed them, but for the moment, it\u2019s theirs.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Polish-French artist Marc Camille Chaimowicz, whose uncategorizable art \u2014 holistically conceived room-size works that smudge the line between decoration and installation \u2014 is inseparable from his own London apartments, one of which he is vacating after nearly 40 years. To see it now, unchanged and preserved since the 1970s, with its palette of eau de nil and peach, its glossy painted chairs and hand-drawn murals, is to wonder whether you are seeing one man\u2019s home ... or an artistic projection of an idea of home. But it is also a reminder of our eternal, collective search for someplace we can call our own, for the place we imagine when we shut our eyes \u2014 a yearning that takes on special meaning in our current age of refugees, who endure one of the great cruelties of the human experience: being forced to forsake their land for another. Chaimowicz\u2019s father, too, was a refugee, from a different era; it\u2019s perhaps not surprising that his very art is the recreation, again and again, of home. We say, with our spaces: We were here. Will you remember us? Memory is brief.

Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, says it has identified more than $6 billion in British real estate bought with possibly ill-gotten wealth, more than one-fifth of it owned by Russians.\n\nBut a law enacted last year allows British law enforcement to investigate where the money for big purchases came from, and to go to court to seize assets. Experts say that aggressive use of the new law could be the most effective way to inflict pain on Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle.\n\nThe risk posed by such unilateral action is not just that Russia could respond, but that its retaliation would be aimed solely at Britain.\n\nShine Light Into Dark Corners\n\nBritish law makes it fairly simple to hide the ownership of assets through opaque shell corporations; the multimillion-dollar homes of wealthy expatriates are often bought by such companies.\n\nWatchdog groups say that it is too easy for people to create corporations for laundering illicit wealth, and that the government agency that tracks companies has neither the authority nor the resources to look deeply into what they do.

Lawmakers of all political stripes have called for the government to deport many of those people, though Russia would almost certainly respond by throwing out British diplomats and intelligence agents.\n\nIn addition to expelling suspected spies, Britain could re-examine some of the other Russians it has allowed to live in the country.\n\nLike many countries, Britain allows wealthy people to bypass the usual laborious process for getting a long-term residence visa. The deal is simple: Invest millions of dollars, and get a visa.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea that money gives you access to state protection is quite ridiculous, quite wrong,\u201d said Kadri Liik, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, based in London.\n\nCritics said for years that the program was too lax and required little in the way of background checks. In 2015, the government tightened the rules, and the number of people receiving investor visas dropped sharply.\n\nIn the past week, analysts have said that Britain could restrict the program more, revisit visas granted under the old rules, and revoke the residency of people with shady histories.\n\nCall on the International Community\n\nBritain can call on NATO, the European Union, the United Nations and the United States to help it take action against Russia, but each approach has drawbacks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince 2014, the European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over its aggression in Ukraine, which have hurt the Russian economy, but have shown no signs of altering Russian conduct. And European countries, heavily dependent on Russian oil and gas exports, have not been eager to strain relations with Moscow further.\n\nNeither the allegations of Russian war crimes in Syria, nor Russia\u2019s meddling in other nations\u2019 elections, nor the downing of an airliner by pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, killing 298 people, prompted new sanctions from the European Union. Any such action in the Skripal case would require solidarity from the European Union at a time when Britain is leaving the bloc and relations with Brussels are uncertain.\n\nWhile European officials were quick to condemn the use of a nerve agent, and an attempted murder on British soil, President Trump, whose administration is enmeshed in investigations into Russian election manipulation, has made no public statement about it.\n\nSome diplomats and security analysts have said that Britain should invoke NATO\u2019s Article 4, which says that member nations \u201cwill consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.\u201d That consultation could be powerful symbolically but might not yield any substantive result.\n\nThe provision is usually interpreted as applying to actions on a far larger scale than attempted murder, said Adam Thomson, a former British ambassador to NATO and head of the European Leadership Network.", "title": "U.K. Has Weapons to Use Against Russia, All With Drawbacks", "authors": ["Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a"]}

Russia is also worried that an increased Islamic State presence in Afghanistan will further radicalize the Caucasus; as a result, according to Central Command officials, Moscow began supporting the Taliban as a counterweight, sending its fighters weapons and night vision goggles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a Senate hearing last week, Lt. Gen. Robert P. Ashley, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the Islamic State in Khorasan intended to \u201cexpand ISIS\u2019 self-declared caliphate and compete with the Taliban for recognition as the dominant militant group in the region.\u201d\n\nHe also said that Al Qaeda had \u201cretained the intent and limited capability to threaten coalition and Afghan forces and interests in the region,\u201d a reference to the American-led NATO coalition that has been fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nThe official line at the Pentagon is that the textbook definition of \u201csafe havens\u201d \u2014 where insurgent groups can plan and conduct operations without disruption by significant external factors like arrest and airstrikes \u2014 has not quite been re-established in Afghanistan.\n\nMilitary officials said American and Afghan forces were doing just enough to pressure training camps and strongholds that the Islamic State had built in remote and ungoverned areas of the country. One high-profile example of that, Central Command officials said, was the \u201cMOAB\u201d \u2014 the massive GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, nicknamed the \u201cmother of all bombs,\u201d that General Nicholson ordered against the Islamic State cave complex.\n\nBut how the largest American conventional weapon came to be deployed, some 16 years after Mr. Bush first vowed that Afghanistan would never again provide safe haven to terrorist groups plotting against the United States, says much about the difficulties of keeping that pledge.\n\nOne year ago, after Islamic State insurgents seized a series of towns and villages in the east, American and Afghan Special Operations forces responded with Operation Hamza to take back the territory. In its initial stage, American commandos helped run the extremists from the area. But officers in the Afghan 201st Corps at the nearby Tactical Base Gamberi were reluctant to secure the territory to keep the extremists from returning.\n\n\u201cThey did not have the appetite to go into southern Nangarhar and fight Daesh,\u201d said Maj. Richard Anderson, an American operations adviser to the 201st Corps, using another name for the Islamic State. During a fight a month earlier, the 201st Corps lost 16 men in one night.\n\nSo General Nicholson ordered that the huge bomb be dropped on Achin. Though it did initially clear the area of Islamic State fighters, many have since returned. And Afghan troops have urged American commanders to simply drop more bombs instead of launching ground battles.\n\n\u201cThey said: \u2018You dropped the MOAB. Why don\u2019t you just drop another MOAB?\u2019\u201d Major Anderson recalled in an interview at Gamberi in August.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut securing territory \u2014 generally with constant patrols and ground intelligence \u2014 is necessary to prevent safe havens from being created. And now, Afghan and American officials said, the same area that was obliterated by the United States\u2019 biggest conventional bomb is once again being used by extremists to plot attacks against the Afghan government and the West.", "title": "U.S. Braces for Return of Terrorist Safe Havens to Afghanistan", "authors": ["Helene Cooper"]}

That same year, government officials and private researchers at CrowdStrike tied Iranian hackers to a digital strike at Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s biggest oil company, which wiped data on some 30,000 Aramco machines, replacing it with an image of a burning American flag.\n\nLess than two years later, Iranian hackers pulled off a similar feat at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, after its owner, Sheldon Adelson, advocated a nuclear strike on Iran. The hackers deployed malware that brought the casino\u2019s operations to a halt, wiped data off its machines, replaced websites with a photograph of Mr. Adelson with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and signed their online screeds the \u201cAnti W.M.D. Team.\u201d\n\nBut security experts note that Iranian attacks have dropped off since the signing of the nuclear deal. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on their best behavior because of the nuclear deal,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cTo avoid having the nuclear deal collapse, they have not been willing to risk it.\u201d\n\nBut on Friday, the government said that a new group of hackers stole innovative work and intellectual property from the computer systems of 144 American universities, the Labor Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states of Hawaii and Indiana.\n\nThey also infiltrated the United Nations, 176 universities in 21 countries around the world, and dozens of domestic and foreign companies, some in banking, health care and the law, the officials said.\n\nIn a scheme that continued for more than four years, the Mabna Institute is accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, as well as the contents of employee email accounts.

If you don\u2019t put a quota on, then any country that can do whatever they want will become a transshipment point for every other country.\u201d\n\nThe proclamation issued late Thursday declares that Mr. Trump will consult with the director of the National Economic Council, along with United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer and others, in determining any possible quotas.\n\nIt also said Mr. Trump would decide by May 1 whether to continue to exempt those countries, based on the status of negotiations, and it held open the possibility that he could modify the tariffs affecting other countries at any time.\n\nMany of the countries that were exempted are engaged in trade talks in which the United States is trying to win concessions. That includes Canada and Mexico, which are in the midst of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, and South Korea, which is renegotiating its free-trade pact with the United States.\n\nJapan has been a source of ire for Mr. Trump, who has criticized its trade practices going back to the 1980s. The two nations made only modest progress in their economic dialogue last year, with the United States pushing for a new bilateral trade agreement that would ease restrictions on American exports of beef and cars to Japan.\n\nThe tariff exemptions could help prevent retaliatory trade barriers that other trading partners had threatened, including the European Union, which said it would target American exports like Florida orange juice, peanut butter and motorcycles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt would also provide some relief to American companies that use foreign metals in the products they use and make, like oil and gas pipelines, beer cans and food packaging.\n\nBut the move caught those who support the tariffs, including the American steel industry, by surprise.\n\n\u201cEveryone is kind of freaking out,\u201d said Philip K. Bell, president of the Steel Manufacturers Association. He said he was waiting to see the final details of the policy but would have wanted the exclusions to be much more narrow. \u201cThis represents a lot of tons of imports that find their way to our shores, and this could have the effect of watering down\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s trade action.\n\nImposing quotas would offer some help, Mr. Bell said, because without the limits, American companies would face incentives to start buying their steel from excluded countries and domestic mills would be right back where they were pre-tariffs. The exempted countries account for more than half of the $29 billion in steel sold to the United States in 2017.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Commerce Department said the metals were a national security risk because they were degrading the American industrial base.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe administration then floated the potential for exemptions, intimating that nations could be excluded if they found other ways to resolve the national security concerns and to reduce their trade deficit with the United States.\n\nThe United States runs a trade deficit with many nations, including China and Japan, importing more goods from those countries than it exports. Last year, Japan sent about $1.7 billion in steel mill products to the United States, according to IHS Markit Global Trade Atlas. Without an exclusion, it will be the only one of the top six foreign suppliers of steel to the United States to face steep tariffs.\n\nJapanese steel makers argue that they hardly compete with American steel mills, because they make niche, specialized products that are not replicated here, rather than undercutting prices by flooding the market with a cheap commodity.\n\nTadaaki Yamaguchi, chairman of the Japan Steel Information Center, a New York-based trade group, said failing to give Japan the same exemption that was extended to South Korea and Brazil was \u201can outrage and a travesty.\u201d\n\nIf the exempted countries are not subject to any export limits, the administration may need to raise tariffs on all the others if it wants to keep its promise to protect American producers on price. That would hit Japan harder than anyone.\n\nThe leaders of several countries with close ties, including military alliances, with the United States had warned that the restrictions could touch off a trade war and undercut a global economic recovery. They also argued that the tariffs would be mutually destructive and ignore the complexity of modern supply networks.\n\nFor example, the German carmaker BMW operates its largest factory in Spartanburg, S.C., buying about two-thirds of the steel it needs in the United States and importing the rest. BMW is also the largest exporter of cars made in the United States, with China being one of the main buyers, said Harald Kr\u00fcger, the company\u2019s chief executive. \u201cNone of this would be possible without free trade,\u201d Mr. Kr\u00fcger said in Munich on Wednesday.", "title": "U.S. Exempts Some Allies From Tariffs, but May Opt for Quotas", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley", "Natalie Kitroeff"]}

One key benefit of combining with Uber, Mr. Maa said, is that it immediately expands Grab\u2019s food-delivery operations.\n\n\u201cThat has massive, massive benefits to our consumer base,\u201d he said, \u201cbut is also a key driver for our mobile payments business.\u201d\n\nFor Uber, ceding Southeast Asia still leaves it with plenty of challengers elsewhere in the world. Didi Chuxing, based in Beijing, invested alongside SoftBank in Grab last year. It recently raised money from SoftBank and other investors at a valuation of $56 billion \u2014 higher than the $48 billion at which Uber was valued as part of last year\u2019s stake sale to SoftBank.\n\nNow, Didi wants to go global.

But few of them have ventured beyond their home market successfully. Zomato, a restaurant review site similar to Yelp of the United States, expanded aggressively overseas a few years ago, only to scale back and focus more on India and a few countries like the United Arab Emirates. Paytm, India\u2019s leading digital-payments company, has targeted its services to Indian immigrants in Canada, primarily as an experiment geared toward learning how to operate in developed countries.\n\nFor Ola, Australia could be a compelling international opportunity.\n\nFor starters, the country offers room to grow. Fewer than one in five Australians who regularly buy things online used a ride-hailing service in the past year, according to June survey data analyzed by eMarketer, an American research firm. And the typical fares are much higher than in India, meaning Ola could potentially make more money per ride.\n\n\u201cIn the ride-sharing market currently, there are no real enemies,\u201d said Satish Meena, a senior forecast analyst with Forrester, a technology research firm. \u201cEveryone is willing to share the pie.\u201d\n\nAustralian laws also make it generally easy to set up a ride-share business.

If its drivers also drive for other services, Uber could more easily argue that they are free agents instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOla is mostly trying to win drivers over with a better deal.\n\nThe company takes only 7.5 percent of drivers\u2019 fares, with plans to increase that figure to 15 percent. Uber collects 20 to 25 percent. Drivers said that with Ola they could make 50 Australian dollars, or $39, an hour compared with only $30 Australian an hour with Uber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dramatic difference,\u201d said Cheri Gristwood, an Uber driver in Perth, who was an early adopter of Ola. \u201cI work my butt off, and with Ola I come home with a lot more.\u201d\n\nMr. Rohrsheim said that Uber had added incentives of its own last year, including paid wait time and a \u201cno thanks\u201d button that lets drivers refuse up to three rides in a row.\n\n\u201cUber isn\u2019t Uber without driver partners,\u201d he said, \u201cand our success depends on their success.\u201d\n\nOla\u2019s discounted commission has helped the company sign up 7,000 drivers so far. That is nowhere near the roughly 82,000 who drive for Uber, but more than double what Taxify started with in Sydney in December. Taxify did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the new Ola drivers help spread the word about the company. Cecilia Cornu, an Ola customer in Perth, first heard about the service when she asked an Uber driver about the two cellphones he had. One, he said, was for Ola.\n\n\u201cHe told me my ride would have been cheaper if I had booked it through Ola, as they were running a promotion with free rides,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I got to work,\u201d she added, \u201cI downloaded the Ola app.\u201d\n\nOla has not explicitly marketed itself to drivers or riders of Indian origin, but the company does expect that the awareness of its brand among Indians will help. About 1.9 percent of Australia\u2019s population of 24 million was born in India, according to 2016 census data; many more are the children of Indian immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Ola app still signals that connection: India sometimes shows up as the default country when someone in Australia signs up and adds his mobile phone number.\n\nOla\u2019s effort to shift from local to global remains imperfect. Some customers have reported problems with the app continuing to calculate rides after trips have ended. Mr. Ward, one of the Ola drivers in Sydney, said the company\u2019s registration process was less streamlined than Uber\u2019s.\n\nOla\u2019s expansion into Australia may also have a strategic goal beyond higher fares: protection against an unwanted takeover.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is Ola\u2019s largest outside shareholder, and one of the largest shareholders in Uber. It has also invested in other ride-hailing companies around the world.\n\nSoftBank executives have made it clear that they would like to see Uber\u2019s operations in some developing countries merge with local players to avoid a competitive blood bath, allowing the company to focus more intensively on higher-profit, developed markets.\n\nOla recently changed its articles of incorporation to defend against any large investor from forcing a sale of the company. Bhavish Aggarwal, a founder of Ola and its chief executive, is busy trying to raise money from other investors to reduce SoftBank\u2019s influence over his company\u2019s destiny.\n\nMr. Aggarwal declined several interview requests. \u201cWe are very excited about launching Ola in Australia and see immense potential for the ride-sharing ecosystem in a country which embraces new technology and innovation,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAt times, Uber has been a seller. It has left the ride-hailing business in China and Russia, selling its operations in those countries in exchange for stakes in the dominant local competitors.\n\nMr. Meena predicted that Ola and Uber would eventually reach a similar arrangement in India, with the Australian operations of each company possibly added to the mix. Developing a robust Australian business could give Ola a bargaining chip in negotiations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking at capturing market share,\u201d he said, \u201cand then doing a deal with Uber.\u201d", "title": "Uber\u2019s New Rival in Australia: An Indian Upstart", "authors": ["Damien Cave", "Vindu Goel"]}

In February, Uber also settled a longstanding legal fight with Waymo.\n\nOn Monday, Uber halted autonomous car tests in Arizona, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto. It is not clear when the company will revive them.\n\nThe Tempe Police Department said it was investigating the crash, and has not determined whether the car was at fault. A Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle equipped with Uber\u2019s sensing technology struck Elaine Herzberg, 49, while it was going 40 miles an hour in a 45-mile-an-hour zone. According to the police, the car, with one safety driver and operating in autonomous mode, did not slow down before impact.\n\nA video shot from the vehicle\u2019s dashboard camera showed the safety driver looking down, away from the road. It also appeared that the driver\u2019s hands were not hovering above the steering wheel, which is what drivers are instructed to do so they can quickly retake control of the car. Ms. Herzberg, pushing a bicycle across the street, appeared in the camera right before she was hit.\n\n\u201cAs we develop self-driving technology, safety is our primary concern every step of the way,\u201d said Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019re heartbroken by what happened this week, and our cars remain grounded. We continue to assist investigators in any way we can.\u201d\n\nUber has been testing its self-driving cars in a regulatory vacuum in Arizona. There are few federal rules governing the testing of autonomous cars. Unlike California, where Uber had been testing since spring of 2017, Arizona state officials had taken a hands-off approach to autonomous vehicles and did not require companies to disclose how their cars were performing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWaymo and Cruise, a self-driving car company owned by GM, reported their \u201cintervention\u201d numbers to California regulators. Uber\u2019s goals in Arizona were mentioned in internal documents \u2014 Arizona does not have reporting requirements \u2014 and it has not been testing self-driving cars in California long enough to be required to report them.\n\nUber\u2019s first road tests in its self-driving car effort, code-named Project Roadrunner, were actually in Pittsburgh in September 2016. The Phoenix area was added a year ago, and quickly became the company\u2019s main testing ground, with 400 employees and more than 150 autonomous cars driving local roads because of \"favorable regulatory environment, favorable weather conditions,\u201d according to a company document.\n\nWhen Mr. Khosrowshahi took over as Uber\u2019s chief executive, he had considered shutting down the self-driving car operations, according to two other people familiar with Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s thinking.\n\nBut he became convinced that it was important to Uber\u2019s long-term prospects. His visit to Phoenix was seen by the Arizona team as a critical opportunity to demonstrate their progress, according to the people familiar with the company\u2019s operations in the Phoenix area. They wanted to take him on a ride without human interventions to demonstrate that the cars could handle so-called edge cases, tricky road situations that are hard to predict.\n\n\u201cWith autonomy, the edge cases kill you, so you\u2019ve got to build out for all the edge cases,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said at a conference in November. \u201cWhich makes it a very, very difficult problem.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Uber tallied its second million in 100 days and added its next million at an even faster clip, according to company documents.\n\nEarly on in Phoenix, there were two groups of test drivers. A smaller group \u201cstressed\u201d the cars by putting them in challenging situations where, without human intervention, they would have crashed.\n\nA larger group of drivers was focused on picking up customers in the autonomous vehicles. Those drivers were expected to pay more attention to little details, often taking control to prevent a \u201cbad experience\u201d like hard braking, according to a company document.\n\nAround October, Uber merged the two groups to get to a point where it could offer a truly driverless car service to customers \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The customer pickup service was mostly dropped so drivers could focus on accumulating miles and gathering data to help the system become more reliable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround the same time, Uber moved from two employees in every car to one. The paired employees had been splitting duties \u2014 one ready to take over if the autonomous system failed, and another to keep an eye on what the computers were detecting. The second person was responsible for keeping track of system performance as well as labeling data on a laptop computer. Mr. Kallman, the Uber spokesman, said the second person was in the car for purely data related tasks, not safety.\n\nWaymo had also moved from two operators at all times to one in some situations in late 2015, said Johnny Luu, a Waymo spokesman. Waymo still uses two test drivers when it is adding new systems or moving to a new location.\n\nBut Uber\u2019s autonomous cars are not operating nearly as well as those of its competitors. Cruise reported to California regulators that it went more than 1,200 miles per intervention. After its strong California results, Waymo is now testing cars in Chandler, Ariz., a Phoenix suburb, with no safety drivers.\n\nMr. Kallman said miles per intervention was not a measure of safety but a rate of system improvement that could differ depending on where and how the cars were driven.\n\nWhen Uber moved to a single operator, some employees expressed safety concerns to managers, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. They were worried that going solo would make it harder to remain alert during hours of monotonous driving. Mr. Kallman said it delayed the start of its single-driver initiative to allow for more training and to make sure drivers felt comfortable for the new role.\n\nUber also developed an app, mounted on an iPad in the car\u2019s middle console, for drivers to alert engineers to problems. Drivers could use the app anytime without shifting the car out of autonomous mode. Often, drivers would annotate data at a traffic light or a stop, but many did so while the car was moving, said the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations. Mr. Kallman said it designed the app to meet government safety guidelines for in-car software to minimize distractions.\n\nWaymo had a different solution when it moved to a single safety driver. It added a button on the steering wheel for drivers to create an audio explanation when they took the car out of autonomous mode.\n\nNot all drivers followed Uber\u2019s training. One was fired after falling asleep at the wheel and being spotted by a colleague. Another was spotted air drumming as the autonomous car passed through an intersection, according to the two people familiar with Uber\u2019s operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUber was planning to seek regulatory approval by December to start a self-driving car service in Arizona, according to company documents. Uber said the vehicles would have to be safer than human drivers before they would commercialize it. They would not operate around the clock and would stop for bad weather or traffic. And the service did not need to prove \u201clonger-term financial viability.\u201d\n\nAlready, one milestone will be missed. Mr. Khosrowshahi will not travel to Phoenix next month, because of scheduling problems that came up before the crash, Mr. Kallman said. But it is unclear how the crash will ultimately affect Uber\u2019s plans for autonomous vehicles.\n\n\u201cThe collection of bad news around Uber creates a reputation in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Michael Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cEvery other company would get a black eye, too, but they might be forgiven.

In a business model that is similar to its ride-hailing service, Uber doesn\u2019t actually handle the deliveries but works behind the scenes to create a marketplace for truckers and shippers.\n\nThe company said it was working out of two primary transfer hubs in Arizona \u2014 one in Sanders near the border with New Mexico and another in Topock near the California border.\n\nUber isn\u2019t saying much about its self-driving trucks. It won\u2019t disclose how many trucks it is using, how many miles they\u2019ve driven or how often the human safety drivers had to intervene and assist the autonomous system. It is also not revealing many details about how the transfer hubs would work \u2014 including what they would look like, where they would be located and how the company planned to roll them out.\n\nWhen it comes to the politically sensitive question of whether Uber\u2019s technology will eventually eliminate trucking jobs, the company walks a fine line. For now, Uber said it believed the introduction of self-driving trucks would bring about more driving jobs, not fewer, in part because of greater demand as delivery costs fall. However, the nature of a trucker\u2019s job may change \u2014 becoming something akin to a parcel delivery driver, shuttling trailers between the hub and local destinations.\n\nWhile autonomous systems may one day be able to do everything a human truck driver does, Uber said it was not training its trucks to do it all, like back up to a loading dock or navigate around a busy industrial area.\n\n\u201cThat is beyond the window of what we\u2019re looking at,\u201d Mr. Woodrow said.

We are, in fact, putting more emphasis in sexual harassment\u201d complaints, Mr. Brown wrote in an email. \u201cIn addition, 60 percent of the fair housing complaints we receive are disability related, and the majority of those have to do with service animals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most significant fight over fair housing under Mr. Trump is taking place in Houston, a sprawling metropolis ranked in numerous studies as one of the United States\u2019 most segregated cities, where overt opposition to a housing development based on race and income has drawn the attention of career HUD investigators.\n\nIn January 2017, before Mr. Obama left office, HUD lawyers accused Houston officials of violating fair housing requirements cited in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The city\u2019s mayor, Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, had killed a 233-unit mixed-income, mixed-race housing development slated for an affluent white area known for its high-end shopping and excellent schools.\n\nHUD told the city to undertake specific remedies as a condition of continued funding, including the approval of the development, known as the Fountain View Project, and the adoption of tough new zoning laws.\n\nIn a scathing letter, HUD officials accused Mr. Turner, who is African-American, of succumbing to \u201cracially motivated local opposition,\u201d claiming that he caved to protests by white business owners and residents.\n\nMr. Turner has denied the accusation, arguing that he opposed the development because only 23 apartments were set aside for low-income families. He also objected to the idea of forced integration, putting him in agreement with Mr. Carson.\n\n\u201cI have chosen to stay in the neighborhood where I grew up, and I will not tell children in similar communities they must live somewhere else,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who grew up in an all-black development.\n\nBut he might have had other reasons for opposing the project. In one meeting, Mr. Turner privately admitted that he hoped his position on the project would coax white Republican state legislators to support a bill needed to restructure Houston\u2019s ailing pension system, according to a former federal official who attended the meeting.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe mayor denied that account.\n\n\u201cHe never told anyone he opposed the Fountain View Project to win votes for his pension overhaul,\u201d said Mary Benton, a spokeswoman for Mr. Turner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, few Democrats have done quite so well in negotiating with the Trump administration as Mr. Turner, who began pressing Mr. Carson to release the city from the order shortly after Mr. Carson was confirmed.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, with Mr. Carson\u2019s blessing, began negotiating directly with Mr. Turner and other city officials. She largely excluded the career lawyers who had already begun drafting a tougher order \u2014 one that required the city to pay the Houston Housing Authority, Fountain View\u2019s developer, as much as $14 million if it insisted on blocking the deal, according to an official in Houston.\n\nBut Mr. Turner, who believes the case to be a distraction from his city\u2019s rebuilding effort, prevailed.\n\nThis month, Ms. Far\u00edas signed a new, less stringent agreement that other Houston officials eager to get federal money flowing into hard-hit neighborhoods \u2014 including Representative Al Green, a Democrat and harsh Carson critic \u2014 hailed as a victory.\n\nBut a coalition of local advocacy groups and national organizations are suing to block the disbursement of $5 billion in HUD recovery money unless the city abides by civil rights-era fair housing laws.\n\n\u201cIf this isn\u2019t a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, then damn it, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d said John Henneberger, a director of Texas Housers, an advocacy group that filed a lawsuit last week in Federal District Court to enforce the original HUD letter.\n\n\u201cFountain View was kind of the last stand,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent eight or nine years documenting systematic and pervasive racial discrimination in Houston \u2014 it is an open-and-shut case.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown, the HUD spokesman, said the agreement required the city to \u201cput in place new procedures for the building of affordable housing\u201d and a study on how to increase affordable housing in the city\u2019s Galleria district, where Fountain View was to be built.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are other signs of change within HUD that could make it far less likely that similar cases would ever be pursued.\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, according to six current department officials, has told HUD managers that she intends to replace her top subordinate, Timothy Smyth, who played a central role in the Houston case. Bryan Greene, another senior manager, will be reassigned as part of the shake-up, the officials said.\n\nMr. Brown, in an email, said no one had been reassigned yet \u2014 but he added that it was \u201cwell within the assistant secretary\u2019s authority after 120 days to reassign senior-level personnel.\u201d\n\nMorale at the division is sinking. At a meeting this month of HUD regional housing directors in Atlanta, Ms. Far\u00edas \u2014 a former vice chairwoman of the Bexar County, Tex., Republicans and a Trump campaign supporter \u2014 told one of the directors that she preferred older HUD employees because they were more likely to have had experience working for Republican administrations.\n\nEarlier, according to two aides who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, she had told her staff that it was her intention to root out people she viewed as \u201cObama plants.\u201d\n\nMs. Far\u00edas, through a spokesman, denied making those statements.", "title": "Under Ben Carson, HUD Scales Back Fair Housing Enforcement", "authors": ["Glenn Thrush"]}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very good chemistry right from the beginning,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday morning as he described his relationship with Mr. Pompeo.\n\nChemistry is vital between any president and his chief global emissary. But the shift disrupts the delicate balance of power in the administration\u2019s national security team.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Tillerson and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, had run something of a tag team to keep the president in check, finding common ground on policies from the Middle East to East Asia before stepping into the Situation Room. For the better part of a year, that put Mr. Trump in the position of having to overcome their unified advice, which also was sometimes aligned with the White House national security adviser, H. R. McMaster.\n\nOne senior administration official who often sat in the backbenches of those meetings last week described Mr. Trump\u2019s growing frustration at being hemmed in by his two principal national security cabinet members.\n\nThat seems particularly true on Iran, and Mr. Trump singled out that issue on Tuesday as he was preparing to leave for California. He said he and Mr. Tillerson \u201cdisagree on things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the Iran deal \u2014 I think it\u2019s terrible. I guess he thought it was O.K.,\u201d the president said, referring to Mr. Tillerson. \u201cI wanted to either break it or do something. And he felt a little bit differently.\u201d\n\nHis comments are certain to alarm European allies who have spent the last few days negotiating with Mr. Tillerson\u2019s closest aide, Brian Hook, on a way to add to the agreement that limited Iran\u2019s nuclear program, rather than reopen or scrap the deal. Those moves were intended to keep Mr. Trump from ditching the agreement in mid-May, when he faces a deadline over continued suspension of American nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first Mr. Hook heard of Mr. Tillerson\u2019s ouster was when a reporter for The New York Times called him for comment on Tuesday morning, shortly after the secretary\u2019s 405-day tenure was ended by presidential tweet.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s denouement seemed rife with the symbolism of the change to come. After Mr. Trump was revealed to have used a vulgarity to disparage several African nations, he dispatched Mr. Tillerson on a lengthy trip to the continent last week to make it up to them.\n\nBut while the secretary was away, Mr. Trump agreed to the meeting with Mr. Kim, catching Mr. Tillerson by surprise \u2014 even though he was the one who had long been arguing for opening up a diplomatic channel to North Korea. While in Africa, Mr. Tillerson took a day off to recover from what the State Department said was exhaustion from long nights catching up by phone with Washington.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen he got food poisoning, cut his travels short, and was fired upon landing in the United States.\n\nIt was clear in recent months that Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Trump were barely talking. The frequent dinners the chief diplomat shared with the president last spring, when the two men were forming their views of how to approach the world, had ended.\n\nMr. Trump had hired Mr. Tillerson because he liked his record of profits and expansion at Exxon, and thought his mane of white hair gave him the look of a secretary of state. But more recently, the president told aides he thought Mr. Tillerson was \u201cweak\u201d \u2014 the ultimate insult in Mr. Trump\u2019s world. His affinity for Mr. Pompeo grew as the men bonded over intelligence warnings and authorizations for covert actions.\n\nMr. Pompeo\u2019s rise will solve one central problem in American diplomacy over the past year: When Mr. Tillerson spoke, few thought he was speaking on behalf of the president.\n\n\u201cIt creates the possibility that someone who is up to speed with the issues, and has a comfortable working relationship with the president, is now in the chair,\u201d said Richard Haass, who served several Republicans and Democrats in senior State Department and National Security Council positions.\n\nAmerica\u2019s interlocutors, Mr. Haass added, will now believe the secretary of state \u201cis speaking with the power and backing of the president.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe question is whether, when President Trump speaks, it sounds like he has consulted his secretary of state,\u201d Mr. Haass, now the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a call from India.\n\nThe one arena where Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are still a mystery is Russia. While serving in Congress, he was a critic of President Vladimir V. Putin. As C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo said he believed intelligence assessments that Mr. Putin was behind the effort to influence the 2016 election \u2014 even though Mr. Trump has dismissed those reports for fear it would undercut the legitimacy of his election.\n\nMr. Pompeo has not, however, gone the next step to describe what he thought the United States should do to counter Russia\u2019s actions.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn contrast, Mr. Tillerson had let known his increasing concern about Russia\u2019s activities, and even about Mr. Putin, who famously presented him with an award for his deals with Russia while at Exxon. On Monday, his last day as secretary of state, he agreed with the British government that Russia was most likely behind the nerve gas attack on a Russian living in England \u2014 while the White House has hedged about Russia\u2019s responsibilities. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s views are not known.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest unknown in the ascension of Mr. Pompeo is how it will affect any negotiations with North Korea.\n\nHe has warned many times, since last summer, that Mr. Kim is \u201ca few months\u201d away from acquiring the ability to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. That is based on a calculation of how long it will take the North to solve the final problems of designing a warhead that can survive re-entry into the atmosphere atop an intercontinental missile.\n\nBut Mr. Pompeo has also been in charge of an active covert campaign against the North, which he has alluded to elliptically on several occasions. The question now is whether that covert effort \u2014 believed to include sabotage of North Korea\u2019s supply chain and renewed cyberattacks on its missile and nuclear programs \u2014 will buy Mr. Trump enough time, and leverage, to make a negotiation work.\n\nNo agency has been more skeptical about the chances of Mr. Kim\u2019s giving up his arsenal than the C.I.A. itself, under Mr. Pompeo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a presentation last fall at George Washington University, one of the agency\u2019s top Korea analysts said that in the C.I.A.\u2019s view, no amount of sanctions pressure would persuade Mr. Kim that it was worth giving up the weapons that he believes are his only defense from having his country overrun by the United States and its allies.\n\nAssociates of Mr. Pompeo say he shares that view \u2014 which would suggest that while he may soon be running the North Korea negotiations, his expectations of success are limited.\n\nIn retrospect, Tuesday\u2019s shift could explain some comments Mr. Pompeo made over the weekend. In interviews on Fox and CBS, he said he had spent part of the weekend reviewing the C.I.A.\u2019s internal history of American negotiations with North Korea for the past quarter-century. That would have been an odd way for a C.I.A. director to spend his reading time; it makes a lot of sense for a future secretary of state.", "title": "Under Pompeo, a Foreign Policy That Fits the President\u2019s Worldview", "authors": ["David E.

Although the new policy will only affect a fraction of the company\u2019s customers, \u201cit\u2019s one more step on the path of creating a more transparent pharmacy supply chain,\u201d Mr. Fein said.\n\nThe amount of rebates can vary widely, with some drugs, like Humira and Enbrel that treat rheumatoid arthritis, being deeply discounted. Others, like medicines for rare conditions where there is no significant competition, have little to no rebates. Patients, employers and the public have little information on what any one drug costs and whether the discounts ultimately flow back to customers.\n\n\u201cThe industry is taking criticism from a lot of different people,\u201d said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan. It is significant that UnitedHealthcare \u201cfelt compelled to do something,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Trump administration recently floated the idea of requiring private drug plans under Medicare to pass on the savings to consumers at the pharmacy counter. On Tuesday, Alex M. Azar II, a former executive at Eli Lilly and the new secretary of health and human services, called UnitedHealthcare\u2019s move \u201ca prime example of the type of movement toward transparency and lower drug prices for millions of patients that the Trump administration is championing.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These are hung near some 50 Japanese prints that played a role in the development of van Gogh\u2019s distinctive style, as well as Japanese lacquerwork and painted scrolls.\n\nVan Gogh first encountered Japanese prints in 1885 while he was working in the Belgian port city of Antwerp, whose docks he said were teeming with Japanese wares: They were \u201cfantastic, singular, strange,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe Van Gogh Museum exhibition begins about a year later, when he moved into his brother\u2019s apartment in Paris and discovered that the German art dealer Siegfried Bing \u2014 who sold Japanese artworks and decorative objects \u2014 had an attic full of Japanese woodcut prints at very reasonable prices.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe immediately bought about 660 prints for just a few cents a piece. Ms. Bakker said that van Gogh originally held an exhibition trying to resell the prints, but it wasn\u2019t successful, and instead he hung onto them, tacked them to the walls of his studio and used them for inspiration. About 500 survive, and are now part of the Van Gogh Museum\u2019s permanent collection.\n\nAt first, van Gogh simply copied the works in both sketches and oil paintings: For example, in 1887 he traced in pencil and ink the cover of an issue of the magazine Paris Illustr\u00e9 devoted to Japan and also made a large-scale oil painting, \u201cCourtesan (After Eisen),\u201d based on the image.\n\nThe Japanese art he pinned to the walls of his studio also appears in the backgrounds of a number of his portraits, such as his \u201cPortrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy,\u201d who sits in front of a wall of prints. (This is the only major painting with Japanese influences that the Van Gogh Museum could not get for the exhibition; it belongs to the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in Paris, and according to Ms. Bakker was too fragile to travel.)\n\nPhoto\n\nBy the time the artist moved to Arles a year later, he was fully in the thrall of Japan. On the train from Paris, he repeatedly checked out the window, he wrote to his friend Paul Gauguin, \u201cto see \u2018if it was like Japan yet\u2019! Childish, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe first year in Arles, everything is Japan,\u201d said Bakker. \u201cLater, after his breakdown, that changes, and he still refers to it but it\u2019s less important. The nature of his admiration had changed. It has become integrated into his style but it\u2019s no longer his artistic model.\u201d\n\nThe impact was more subtle, more buried in his technique: For instance, he sometimes divided the canvas using diagonal lines, rather than using horizontal perspective planes, as was the norm in western painting, and he would streak his paintings with diagonal rain, as he had seen in Japanese prints.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Japanese dream was over, perhaps, but the fascination with Japan was not. Tsukasa Kodera, a Japanese curator who worked on the exhibition, has studied van Gogh\u2019s interest in his country for more than 30 years, and spent the last six researching the final phase of van Gogh\u2019s life.\n\nHe discovered that when van Gogh moved to the town of Auvers-sur-Oise, outside of Paris, in 1890, he pursued friendships with two artists with direct ties to Japan: Louis-Jules Dumoulin, a Frenchman who had traveled to the country, painting and taking photographs there, and Edmund Walpole Brooke, an Australian-born artist who had lived in Yokohama in his youth.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t try to make contact with other painters in Auvers \u2014 only these two,\u201d said Mr. Kodera in a telephone interview. \u201cHis dream was broken but he still was interested in Japanese art,\u201d he added.\n\nFollowing van Gogh\u2019s death in 1890, Japanese artists and art-lovers read van Gogh\u2019s letters, which were translated into Japanese in 1915. They made pilgrimages to his grave in Auvers-sur-Oise in the 1920s and \u201930s. The home of van Gogh\u2019s friend Paul Gachet, who was also his doctor and sometime model, became a destination for these kindred souls; more than 140 Japanese names can be found in the guest books.\n\n\u201cHe was interested in our culture and that says something to Japanese people,\u201d said Mr. Kodera. Even though van Gogh\u2019s art wasn\u2019t widely reproduced and accessible in Japan until decades later, he added, \u201cThey had also Van Gogh visions, van Gogh dreams.

(It should be noted that the choice of the word \u201cmaven,\u201d a Yiddish word that implies expertise, was intended by Mr. Safire, according to Mr. Safire, to be taken not completely seriously.)\n\nMr. Pinker takes umbrage with the \u201cprescriptive\u201d rules of language, commandments that include \u201cdon\u2019t split infinitives\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t dangle participles,\u201d among many others.

I don\u2019t know whether to chalk that up to suggestibility or if the Cox-Rathvon team made that happen somehow.\n\nYou see, you run this passage, from Moira Marsh\u2019s \u201cPractically Joking,\u201d backward from 176, the final square at the bottom right, to 1. You also read the attribution of the quote from V to A, in the clues, rather than regular alphabetical order.\n\nThe most disconcerting part about solving this puzzle for me was keeping the numbers straight.

{"date": "2018-03-24 00:00:00", "text": "VARIETY PUZZLE \u2014 Cryptic crosswords are a unique form of punishment. If you like tricky clues in regular grids, though, you owe yourself to try them. At first, if it seems as if the rules are inscrutable, don\u2019t bail out; this is a very popular type of puzzle in other spheres, so there\u2019s great, detailed solving information available online (Deb Amlen recommends this guide \u2014 try using it as a road map today).\n\nI\u2019ve worked on cryptic puzzles for years, and have grown very fond of them. The experts say that the key to understanding each clue is recognizing its two parts; one is a standard definition or synonym, and the other is some form of paronomasia that adds a layer of interest and possibly leads you to an unusual solution. You definitely develop a knack for seeing the twist on each clue, but it also especially helps, in these puzzles, to recognize the fun in the journey and not beat yourself up for being unable to finish without an assist (especially from your fellow solvers in the comments).\n\nThe easiest clues for me are the anagrams; they\u2019re akin to multiple choice, as far as I\u2019m concerned, as the answer is there, just scrambled. There will usually be a tip that the scramble needs to happen in the clue: look for a word like \u201cdoctor\u201d (17D), \u201crocks\u201d (23A), or \u201cdeciphered\u201d (27A). Any word meaning disrupt, rearrange, or change can be a clue to what to do.\n\nFor example, the 27A: \u201cAcrostic deciphered: a country\u201d (5,4). First of all, as in most cryptics, you\u2019re given a hint in letter count that indicates more than one word, in this case a two-word phrase of five and then four letters. I look at the number of letters in each word; in this case, acrostic has eight letters, but if you add that \u201ca\u201d in \u201ca country,\u201d you get nine, so that\u2019s a good tip. If you rearrange the letters in \u201cacrostic,\u201d and add an a, with an eye to the information above, you arrive at COSTA RICA. Not bad, right? You can do this with those other two clues above \u2014 \u201cdoctor claimed,\u201d for 17A, to get MEDICAL, and \u201cpaper said rocks\u201d for the other, DISAPPEAR. The order of the words in a clue can sometimes be altered to further challenge the solver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe anagram can also be one ingredient in a more complex recipe, like at 9A and 19A, among others. Let\u2019s look at 19A: \u201cMull liquor in blended tea\u201d (8). The anagram indicator is \u201cblended,\u201d so I guessed that \u201cliquor in,\u201d comprising eight letters, might be anagrammed for the answer, perhaps a synonym to \u201cmull.\u201d I came up empty, though, but the misdirection got me thinking of words like \u201cmull\u201d: ponder, consider, cogitate. \u2026 How about RUMINATE?

The officer was finally charged with murder \u2014 but only after a judge ordered the video released.\n\nA Justice Department investigation has since found that the police routinely used excessive force against black and Latino citizens.

Historical endeavors, such as the Ken Burns-Lynn Novick 2017 PBS documentary, or the Vietnam War exhibitions presented by the New-York Historical Society and the National Archives, would surely be different. They were not. All presented the Vietnam War along the same conventional trajectory that treats the Vietnamese perspective and experience as an aside.\n\nOut of the myriad photos, videos and oral histories compiled and presented by the historical society and the National Archives, the Vietnamese were granted minimal space. Certainly, there was no outright exclusion, which would have been ludicrous and damning. But one got the sense that the Vietnamese elements were perfunctory, added only to allow the exhibitions to claim inclusion. By contrast, painstaking care was devoted to showing the full range of the American experience, from the mundane and ordinary to the more pressing immediacy of war.\n\nWith respect to the PBS documentary, almost universally lauded as definitive, one might object to my characterization by pointing to the many South Vietnamese who were in fact interviewed for the series. The truth is, despite professed desires to include multiple perspectives, this series privileges the American perspective, whether it is supportive or critical of the American war effort.\n\nIt could have embarked on the worthwhile project of soothing American souls and healing divisions without sidelining the Vietnamese. The South Vietnamese were portrayed as incompetent and corrupt, their government bordering on illegitimate. This was done in a subtle and sophisticated way, not in the imperial manner of the past in which the West pontificates about the shortcomings of the native. South Vietnamese interviewees were allowed to express themselves in their own words.\n\nBut hovering above the cacophony is the seemingly more objective and reliable narrator, Peter Coyote, whose disembodied voice signaled omniscience. His narrative was peppered with adjectives like corrupt or weak or beleaguered when describing the South Vietnamese.\n\nAs a writer, I know that I write about a minor character differently from how I do my main character. The protagonist is carefully developed and infused with an active voice. By contrast, I might use my author\u2019s prerogative of description and prescription for minor characters. From tone to space to treatment, I know that the South Vietnamese is the minor character in the American historical exposition of the Vietnam War.\n\nIn the section of the PBS series about the Tet offensive of 1968, for example, there were hardly any South Vietnamese soldiers whose voices were included. Instead, their experiences were described and summarized. Even the postwar \u201cre-education camps\u201d and the suffering of the hundreds of thousands of \u201cboat people\u201d merited little time.

U.M.B.C., the champion of the America East Conference, shot 26 for 48 from the field, including 12 for 24 from beyond the three-point line. The underdogs were not intimidated. If anything, that problem belonged to Virginia, which through the season had made nearly 40 percent of its three-point attempts but made only 18.2 percent on Friday. The Retrievers played on the vulnerabilities Virginia had all along, and that had made many doubt whether the Cavaliers could truly make a deep tournament run.\n\nPhoto\n\nVirginia does not play like other teams. On offense the Cavaliers milk the shot clock. Their defense is a specialized system. And they are s-l-o-w: this season, they ranked dead last in possessions per 40 minutes.\n\nThe combination left Virginia vulnerable when U.M.B.C. kept the score close \u2014 at one point making three unanswered 3-pointers so that the halftime score was tied. Then the Retrievers went on a 16-2 run at the start of the second half. Virginia found itself down 12 with four minutes left, needing to make up a lead in a hurry: the one thing the team was not designed to do.\n\nJuxtapose Virginia\u2019s postseason track record with Virginia\u2019s stylistic quirks, and one is inescapably tempted to reach a particular conclusion. It is the same conclusion that the baseball general manager Billy Beane seemed to draw when explaining how his unusually assembled Oakland Athletics of the early 2000s had tremendous regular-season success but never got to the World Series. \u201cMy stuff,\u201d he said (though he didn\u2019t say \u201cstuff\u201d), \u201cdoesn\u2019t work in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nBeane said last week that his notorious line was a reference to the flukiness of baseball\u2019s playoffs, not to the way the A\u2019s played. The dissonance between Virginia\u2019s regular-season and postseason performances, he insisted, is most likely pure luck.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a systemic flaw in what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Beane added.\n\nVirginia partisans might explain the Cavaliers\u2019 postseason flailing as a fluke combined with injury trouble \u2014 the appendectomy that limited Justin Anderson\u2019s minutes in 2015; the unknown illness that sidelined Isaiah Wilkins in last year\u2019s elimination game. Last week, right on cue, De\u2019Andre Hunter, who was named the A.C.C.\u2019s sixth man of the year, broke his wrist.\n\nBut there are enough trademarks in Virginia\u2019s way of playing to argue that, yes, there may well be something about Virginia\u2019s stuff that works less well in the playoffs.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBecause of the way they play, as great as it is \u2014 I love the way they play \u2014 there is a chance for a smaller margin of error,\u201d said Seth Greenberg, who went 3-3 against Bennett\u2019s teams while coaching Virginia Tech and is now an ESPN analyst.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause of the Cavaliers\u2019 style, they may be slightly more likely, in Greenberg\u2019s words, \u201cto pick a bad day to have a bad day.\u201d\n\nAnd in March and early April\u2019s single-elimination environment, your bad day is your last day.

But it takes time to work, and typically does not feature players who can create their own shots and go get a basket by themselves in crunchtime. In the last five minutes of 2015\u2019s loss to Michigan State, for instance, Virginia trailed by 6 points with five minutes left \u2014 and proceeded to take just 11 shots, making only 5, including a pair of missed layups.\n\n\u201cWhen we needed a key stop or a bucket to be made, it wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Bennett said after that game. \u201cIf you look at it, we took 17 more shots than they did. We had trouble finishing and trouble making shots.\u201d\n\nVirginia plays the so-called Pack Line Defense. It was innovated by Bennett\u2019s father, the former Wisconsin coach Dick Bennett. It is a man-to-man scheme, except defenders retreat to an invisible arc several feet shorter than the three-point line (the \u201cpack line\u201d). When the ball goes to their man, they rush out; otherwise, they bunch together along the line, discouraging entry passes. It is effective at denying post-ups and avoiding open shots, but is susceptible to teams whose contested shots tend to find their way into the basket.\n\nPhoto\n\nMost of all, on offense and defense Virginia plays slow. Generally, this simply means that Virginia\u2019s leads are larger than they appear. They are like dog years: You have to adjust them. Scoring eight unanswered points versus Virginia \u2014 which is going to make you work for it on offense and, when you\u2019re on defense, take a bunch of time off the game clock \u2014 is not like scoring eight unanswered points against an average team.\n\n\u201cThey get up on you,\u201d said the North Carolina senior Joel Berry II, who has played Virginia eight times in his college career. \u201cAnd then they put pressure on you, thinking, you have to come down, and you\u2019re thinking you have to get a quick shot to try to get that lead back. And then next thing you know, you take a bad shot, and then you\u2019ve got to go back down and play defense for 30 seconds again.\u201d\n\nHowever, as with cigars, sometimes eight points are just eight points. If your shots go in, your shots go in. That is how Syracuse was able to erase a 15-point deficit in a game\u2019s final 10 minutes two Marches ago: \u201cWe just got hot,\u201d Syracuse assistant coach Adrian Autry said recently. And it is how U.M.B.C. built a moat of a lead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPlaying slowly leaves better teams more vulnerable to upsets, said John Harris, a mathematics professor at Furman University who, with two other faculty members, Kevin Hutson and Liz Bouzarth, has studied N.C.A.A. tournament upsets.\n\nHe groups teams into \u201cGiants\u201d and \u201cKillers.\u201d The Giants are always the better team. The variable is what improves the underdogs\u2019 chances. The answer, it turns out, is when the Giants\u2019 giant-like qualities are minimized, because a slow pace means there is literally less basketball being played.\n\n\u201cPicture it in terms of an extreme case,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIf each team had one possession, a Killer is more likely to upset a Giant. The more possessions you give a Giant, the more likely it is they\u2019re able to separate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason,\u201d he added, \u201cwhy you don\u2019t play the World Series in one game.\u201d\n\nThe N.C.A.A. tournament is essentially six straight single-game World Series.

{"date": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "Virginia, which began the season unranked in the Associated Press poll, might be considered the prohibitive favorite, as much as the notoriously anarchic tournament can be said to have one. The Cavaliers have been superb for most of Coach Tony Bennett\u2019s nine seasons, with four regular-season titles in the traditionally tough A.C.C. Yet they have not made the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, with their last national semifinal coming in 1984, when they were knocked off by a Houston team led by the star center Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nBut the South Region will present Virginia with a tough road to the Final Four in San Antonio. On the second weekend, in Atlanta, the Cavaliers may face a major-conference champion in either Arizona or fifth-seeded Kentucky (24-10), the Southeastern Conference champion. Waiting in the regional final could be No. 3-seeded Tennessee (25-8) or Cincinnati \u2014 KenPom.com\u2019s fourth-best team overall.\n\nIn the East, Villanova\u2019s toughest competition figures to be fifth-seeded West Virginia (24-10), whose pressing style can fluster even the most poised opponent; fourth-seeded Wichita State (25-7); and, should both arrive in the regional round in Boston, No. 2-seeded Purdue, which has had its best season in years.\n\nBeyond Xavier, the South\u2019s toughest outs include last year\u2019s runner-up, Gonzaga (30-4), which received a No. 4 seed; red-hot Michigan (28-7), the No. 3 seed and the Big Ten champion; and North Carolina, which will open the tournament in nearby Charlotte.\n\nFor the second straight year, the A.C.C. placed nine teams in the tournament. The Southeastern Conference, which has made a concerted effort to transfer its success in football to the hardcourt, got 8 of its 14 teams into the field.\n\nAnd it is a big year for the Big East, which received two No. 1 seeds, for Villanova and Xavier, and has six top contenders among its 10 teams. Villanova, under Coach Jay Wright, is displaying consistent excellence. Two years ago, it won the tournament as a No. 2 seed, then lost two starters; returned as the No. 1 overall seed, and then lost a national player-of-the-year finalist, Josh Hart; and is now back as the second overall seed.\n\nThe fabled last four in were Arizona State, St. Bonaventure, Syracuse (a team that was not thought even to be on the bubble) and U.C.L.A. The first team out was Notre Dame, which played much of the season without its injured senior star Bonzie Colson. It is only the second tournament Notre Dame will miss since 2009. Rasmussen noted Sunday night, in explaining the committee\u2019s decision to leave out the Irish, that Notre Dame had sustained a couple of bad losses while Colson was healthy.", "title": "Virginia Tops N.C.A.A.

That label is tongue-in-cheek, though just as Mary Shelley\u2019s fevered novel hints at societal fears of miscegenation and \u201cimpurity,\u201d the notion that these baked goods represent unholy unions suggests that there are clear borders in the culinary world that one ought not cross. Two centuries ago, the French led a shift from free-form cooking to codified techniques and built a system for achieving and recognizing mastery that still defines the professional kitchen, pastry or otherwise. So inevitably it\u2019s the croissant that\u2019s seen as being in danger of degradation: the noble, labor-intensive French pastry sullied by its union with the crude, arriviste American doughnut or muffin. (Another iteration was unveiled in January by Vive la Tarte in San Francisco: the tacro, a savory pork- or chicken-stuffed taco with a croissant shell.)\n\nPhoto\n\nYET THE CROISSANT itself was born of crossed borders. The butter-laden layered dough has roots in medieval Arab practice, and the pastry\u2019s shape comes from the Viennese kipferl, said to have been modeled after the Islamic crescent borne on the banners of 17th-century Ottoman invaders. (Although this back story is likely apocryphal, in 2013 a rebel stronghold in Syria banned croissants as symbols of colonialism.) Few dishes, let alone desserts, have remained static over time: Blancmange, a molded milk pudding, was once a chicken casserole; craggy coconut Italian-Jewish macaroons share ancestry (going back to early Sicilian pasta) with the polished round French macarons that have ruffled hems, which languished as solitary disks until someone sandwiched them around ganache a little over a century ago.\n\nIf anything, today\u2019s nouvelle pastries mark a return to the spirit championed by Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, the early 19th-century forefather of French cooking, inventor of the souffl\u00e9 and the croquembouche and architect of monumental confectionery centerpieces that rose up to three feet \u2014 nearly as high as the sculptured hairstyles of his late namesake, Marie Antoinette, the Austrian princess whose own love for viennoiserie may have inspired the myth of her declaring, \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Car\u00eame has disciples in Paris today, including Christophe Adam, known for \u00e9clairs ornamented with edible silver, popcorn and Mona Lisa eyes; Jonathan Blot, conjurer of macarons that taste like bubble gum; and, of course, Pierre Herm\u00e9, who daubs raspberry-lychee p\u00e2t\u00e9 inside croissants and showers them with candied rose petals. Like the original viennoiserie, which were painstakingly elegant pastries designed for the Hapsburg court in imperial Vienna that eventually became indispensable to the city\u2019s sidewalks, their decadence is matched by the virtuosity of their construction and their element of surprise: They are, then as now, as much for beholding as for eating.\n\nTheir contemporary allure is aided by the diminishment of desserts at midrange restaurants, which after the recession of 2008 began to shed pastry chefs, unable to justify the expense for a course that yields little profit. As restaurant desserts have become simpler and homier \u2014 olive-oil cake, anything with chocolate \u2014 once plainspoken baked goods have turned rococo, offering an aura of luxury, enhanced by how difficult they are to procure before selling out each morning. At $4 to $8 each, these small but elaborate edifices seem worthier than the run-of-the-mill pastries available at every urban corner deli and curbside coffee cart, enabling their artisans to cover the ever-increasing cost of basic ingredients, particularly butter, whose price hit a historic high last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, French butter, which has a higher percentage of fat and a pronounced tang from cultured cream, is so desirable across the globe, it\u2019s starting to disappear from grocery shelves in France. This is partly because more people are making pastries than ever before; as a French professor explained to The Economist in November, \u201cChina has discovered croissants.\u201d But if the trend continues, the croissant as we know it \u2014 a straightforward compact of butter, flour, milk, sugar, yeast and salt \u2014 may be no more. And in its place? These overgrown crescents too big to fit in the palm of the hand, spangled and swagged, glutted with fillings, arrayed like objets d\u2019art in austere concrete-walled patisseries where the bakers fuss like apothecaries.

With growing support from autocratic forces in Europe, he must not be emboldened to think he will be unchecked. While President Trump has allowed Mr. Putin a free hand to meddle in American politics, he cannot ignore yet another attempted murder of a Putin foe on allied soil. The administration needs to enforce sanctions Congress has already passed and press NATO to do more, perhaps banning travel by Putin cronies and enacting other restrictions on business activities.\n\nBut while Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said the administration was \u201cstanding with our U.K. ally,\u201d she would not say whether it thought Russia was responsible for the attack.\n\nThe Russians knew that the British would identify the nerve agent, leaving no doubt who was behind the killing. That makes Mr. Putin\u2019s typically cynical treatment of the killing doubly outrageous. When the British \u201csort out\u201d the killing, he said nonchalantly, then he will comment on it. At the same time his top propagandist on state television, Dmitry Kiselyov, was feeding the outlandish story that Britain poisoned Mr. Skripal to create a pretext for boycotting the 2018 World Cup tournament in Russia. Why would Russia bother to go after a double agent of no use to either side, Mr. Kiselyov sarcastically wondered?\n\nNot to silence him, presumably, because the Russians themselves had released him to Britain in 2010 in a swap for a network of sleeper agents rounded up in the United States. The likely answer was provided by Mr. Putin himself a few months after Mr. Skripal was traded to the West. Asked during his annual give-and-take with reporters in 2010 how he would treat treason, Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. agent, replied: \u201cTraitors will kick the bucket, trust me. These people betrayed their friends, their brothers in arms. Whatever they got in exchange for it, those 30 pieces of silver they were given, they will choke on them.\u201d\n\nMrs. May demanded that Russia immediately provide complete disclosure of the Novichok gas program to the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Then she said the government was drawing up a full range of retaliatory options.\n\nThese could range from expelling some Russian diplomats, as Britain did after Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s poisoning in 2006, to stronger sanctions. The trouble is that Russia probably doesn\u2019t much worry about diplomatic expulsions, and British sanctions would add little to the broad range of Western sanctions already in place over the annexation of Crimea.", "title": "Opinion | Vladimir Putin\u2019s Toxic Reach", "authors": []}

Mr. Nielsen, who works in Kansas, lives across the border in Missouri, grew up Republican and supports gun ownership \u2014 a wall of rifles was behind him in the shop \u2014 but now votes for Democrats. \u201cI think Kobach should be a little more concerned with Russians picking our president than with Mexicans voting,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2016, Federal District Judge Julie A. Robinson in Kansas ruled that the proof-of-citizenship requirement of the state law that Mr. Kobach championed violated federal law. If Judge Robinson rules against Mr. Kobach in the current trial, thousands of Kansans who attempted to register to vote at a Department of Motor Vehicles office but did not provide proof of citizenship will see their registrations reinstated. If Mr. Kobach prevails, it could become more difficult for residents without proof of citizenship to vote in the 2018 elections.\n\nEarly in the trial, Judge Robinson reprimanded Mr. Kobach, who frequently stumbled on legal procedure, for attempting to display documents that had not been formally introduced as evidence. \u201cEvidence 101 \u2014 not going to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his opening statements, Mr. Kobach, Harvard-educated and Yale Law School-trained, criticized current rules as weak and porous, arguing that a requirement that voters attest on a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles that they are citizens \u2014 risking a penalty of perjury for a false statement \u2014 is not enough. \u201cAll you had to do was check a box,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was essentially it.\u201d\n\nMr. Kobach says that even though he has documented a relatively small number of noncitizens in Kansas who have attempted to vote, he has reason to believe that they are only \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d and that thousands more exist on the state voter rolls.\n\nBut Dale Ho, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U., said that the law Mr. Kobach lobbied for has made it difficult or impossible for some state residents who do not have a birth certificate, passport or other proof of citizenship to vote.

{"date": "2018-03-10 00:00:00", "text": "These new laws may not be as explicitly discriminatory as the poll taxes or literacy tests of the 20th century, but they are part of the same long-term project to keep minorities from the ballot box. And because African-Americans vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, the laws are nearly always passed by Republican-dominated legislatures.\n\nIn a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin\u2019s strict new voter-ID law, a former staff member for a Republican lawmaker testified that Republicans were \u201cpolitically frothing at the mouth\u201d at the prospect that the law would drive down Democratic turnout. It worked: After the 2016 election, one survey found that the law prevented possibly more than 17,000 registered voters, disproportionately poor and minority, from voting. Donald Trump carried the state by fewer than 23,000 votes.\n\nFAILING TECHNOLOGY The legitimacy of an election is only as good as the reliability of the machines that count the votes. And yet 43 states use voting machines that are no longer being made, and are at or near the end of their useful life. Many states still manage their voter-registration rolls using software programs from the 1990s. It\u2019s no surprise that this sort of infrastructure failure hits poorer and minority areas harder, often creating hourslong lines at the polls and discouraging many voters from coming out at all. Upgrading these machines nationwide would cost at least $1 billion, maybe much more, and Congress has consistently failed to provide anything close to sufficient funding to speed along the process.\n\nElections are hard to run with aging voting technology, but at least those problems aren\u2019t intentional. Hacking and other types of interference are. In 2016, Russian hackers were able to breach voter registration systems in Illinois and several other states, and targeted dozens more. They are interfering again in advance of the 2018 midterms, according to intelligence officials, who are demanding better cybersecurity measures. These include conducting regular threat assessments, using voting machines that create paper trails and conducting postelection audits. Yet President Trump, who sees any invocation of Russian interference as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election, consistently downplays or dismisses these threats. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s State Department has not spent a dime of the $120 million Congress allocated to it to fight disinformation campaigns by Russia and other countries.\n\nDISILLUSIONMENT Some people wouldn\u2019t vote if you put a ballot box in their living room. Whether they believe there is no meaningful difference between the major parties or that the government doesn\u2019t care what they think regardless of who is in power, they have detached themselves from the political process.\n\nThat attitude is encouraged by many in government, up to and including the current president, who cynically foster feelings of disillusionment by hawking fake tales of rigged systems and illegal voters, even as they raise millions of dollars from wealthy donors and draw legislative maps to entrench their power.\n\nThe disillusionment is understandable, and to some degree it\u2019s justified. But it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When large numbers of people don\u2019t vote, elections are indeed decided by narrow, unrepresentative groups and in the interests of wealth and power. The public can then say, See? We were right. They don\u2019t care about us. But when more people vote, the winning candidates are more broadly representative and that improves government responsiveness to the public and enhances democratic legitimacy.", "title": "Opinion | Vote.

For at least the past 40 years, the G.O.P.\u2019s central policy goal has been upward redistribution of income: lower taxes for the wealthy, big cuts in programs that help the poor and the middle class. We\u2019ve seen that agenda at work in the policies of every Republican president from Reagan to Trump, every budget proposal from party stars like Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House.\n\nThis policy agenda is, however, deeply unpopular. Only small minorities of voters favor tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations; even smaller minorities favor cuts in major social programs. So how does the G.O.P. stay politically competitive? The answer is that the party has mastered the tactics of bait and switch: pretending to stand for one thing, then doing something quite different in office.\n\nBut if special elections in the Trump era are any indication, voters are wising up. Rick Saccone, the Republican candidate in a deep-red Pennsylvania congressional district that Trump won by almost 20 points, tried not one, not two, but three different bait-and-switch strategies. And on Tuesday he still seems to have suffered a hair-thin defeat.\n\nAt first, Republicans tried to sell their candidate by touting the 2017 tax cuts, which they portrayed as a boon to the middle class.

Under federal law, employers can pay such workers as little as $2.13 per hour \u2014 a rate that has not changed since 1991 \u2014 as long as their hourly wages plus tips add up to $7.25 an hour. This discrepancy hurts workers by putting them at greater risk of wage theft, sexual harassment and other workplace exploitation \u2014 bosses can easily withhold or steal tips, especially from workers they don\u2019t like or who refuse their propositions. These are hardly idle threats, as demonstrated by the recent allegations of abuse against prominent chefs and restaurant owners and the multimillion-dollar wage theft settlements workers have secured in recent years by suing unscrupulous employers. The Department of Labor\u2019s wage and hour division estimated that nearly 84 percent of full-service restaurants it investigated between 2010 and 2012 had violated labor standards, including but not limited to tip violations.\n\nMost states, including many of the 29 that have a higher minimum wage than is federally required, maintain a subminimum wage for tipped workers, who number about 4.3 million nationwide. In New York City, the minimum wage for tipped workers at businesses with 11 or more employees is $8.65, compared with $13 an hour for other workers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has directed his labor commissioner, Roberta Reardon, to hold hearings starting next month on whether the state ought to eliminate that discrepancy through administrative action.\n\nThe restaurant industry asserts that raising the tipped wage would hurt small businesses, forcing some to close. Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Reardon should not be swayed by this scare tactic. While there is no doubt that bringing tipped workers up to the minimum wage could reduce profits for some businesses, the experiences of other states show it would not devastate the industry. Consider California. It has for decades required businesses to pay tipped employees the same minimum wage other workers get, yet the state has a thriving restaurant scene that includes everything from mom-and-pop taquerias to fine dining establishments \u2014 look no further than the heated debates in foodie circles about the relative merits of eating out in New York versus Los Angeles and San Francisco.", "title": "Opinion | Wage Theft in Restaurants", "authors": []}

The joint effort appeared to be successful.\n\nMs. Hearst, who now runs a \u201cCosmo Hurts Kids\u201d campaign aimed at stopping the sale of the magazine to children under 18, was not involved in the center\u2019s current push, according to according to Haley Halverson, the organization\u2019s vice president for advocacy and outreach.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The magazine has written multiple articles about the #MeToo movement, as well as the sexual assault and consent issues at its center.\n\nIn an article for Vogue, Michelle Ruiz, a former sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan, wrote that the publication has long advocated for consensual adult sex and has recently shifted its focus to women\u2019s sexual pleasure.\n\nJohn Harrington, a publishing industry consultant who until 2015 published a newsletter covering the magazine business, linked Walmart\u2019s decision to larger trends. As magazine sales continue to decline, Mr. Harrington said, it was likely that Cosmopolitan\u2019s sales at Walmart were following that trend.\n\nBut he also said that the retailer historically had appeared more responsive than other retailers to pressure from outside groups.\n\nIn the past, \u201cthey have occasionally moved magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour on an issue-by-issue basis,\u201d Mr. Harrington said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2003, Walmart announced plans to obscure the covers of those two publications, as well as Redbook and Marie Claire.

Since 2010, they have sold a co-branded prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, which offers savings on certain drugs bought at Walmart\u2019s pharmacies.\n\nThe two companies, one of the people briefed on the matter said, are discussing how to expand that partnership in ways that would help drive more traffic to Walmart\u2019s 4,700 United States stores, while increasing Humana\u2019s enrollment.\n\nAs part of that initiative, analysts said, Walmart could open urgent care clinics inside its stores or hold community events, like bingo nights, that cater to enrollees in Humana\u2019s insurance plans.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSeniors will come into their stores, visit the pharmacy, see a doctor and do some shopping while they are there,\u201d said Ana Gupte, a senior analyst at Leerink, a small investment bank specializing in health care.\n\nThe discussions are in their early stages and could fall apart, the people briefed on the matter said.\n\nTwo months ago, Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway announced that they wanted to form some sort of health care venture for their employees, indicating a willingness to shake up the insurance market.

With the threat of competition rising, and with an uncertain antitrust and regulatory environment in Washington, Humana and other insurers have been forced to look for new partners, like retailers.\n\nMs. Gupte predicted in a research note in December that Walmart and Humana might soon pursue a deal.\n\nHumana\u2019s largest block of business is in private Medicare Advantage plans for older Americans. Because of the way it is paid by the government, the company makes more money if it can lower the overall costs of caring for its customers.\n\nIn recent years it has begun investing in its own health care clinics and teaming up with medical providers who can help it manage customers with chronic conditions and try to keep them out of a hospital.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Walmart deal could provide an opportunity to substantially expand that effort, by housing retail medical clinics in rural communities around the country.\n\n\u201cThe strategy is aimed squarely at the senior market, to leverage Wal-Mart\u2019s retail presence to redefine primary care in Medicare Advantage,\u201d John Gorman, the executive chairman of Gorman Health Group, a consulting firm for government health businesses, said in an email. \u201cWalmart has hundreds of pharmacies, and Humana is investing heavily in Conviva, its clinic business. Imagine those two side by side in every Walmart store.\u201d\n\nBut there would be challenges. Neither company has extensive experience in providing health care directly, and doing so well could be crucial to their integration.\n\nAnd while some of the major insurers contend that these kinds of tie-ups are aimed at lowering costs for consumers and controlling health care costs over all, there is little evidence so far that consumers will benefit if more consolidation leads to less competition.\n\nTalks between Walmart and Humana were first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nFor decades, Walmart has driven growth by running stores that sell everything from eggs and light bulbs to pocket books, and dominating local markets with the lowest prices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe rising threat from Amazon has forced the company to re-engineer its brick-and-mortar network and make a string of online acquisitions, including the hip men\u2019s clothing line Bonobos and Jet.com. But the company has never strayed far from its core retail operations.\n\nThe shifting whims of consumers have forced Walmart and other retailers to look more radically for other ways to bring customers into their stores.\n\nLast month, the supermarket operator Albertsons said it would buy the remnants of the Rite Aid drugstore chain. Its bet is that the increased foot traffic to its in-house pharmacies, which will be rebranded Rite Aids, will also bring more customers to the food aisles.\n\n\u201cIt is not necessarily about synergies,\u201d said Brian Owens, vice president of retail consulting at Kantar Consulting. \u201cThis gives Walmart another opportunity to keep the shopper in their box.\u201d", "title": "Walmart in Talks to Strengthen Ties to Health Insurer Humana", "authors": ["Michael Corkery", "David Gelles", "Margot Sanger-Katz"]}

That\u2019s not going to do much for your privacy, considering that an overwhelming amount of what you do on Facebook involves engaging with other people. All of your friends (and their friends, too) would also have to delete their accounts in order to have any sort of meaningful effect.\n\nWhat other things are you losing access to if you delete Facebook? Why do so many apps require a Facebook login?\n\nOne painful part of breaking up with Facebook would be potentially losing access to the many third-party apps and websites that are tied to your account. Over the past decade, many shopping sites and apps teamed up with Facebook to use the company\u2019s login tool, Facebook Login.\n\nFacebook Login became popular because it was a good product. By clicking a button, you could sign up for an account with an app or website just by sharing your Facebook account data. That allowed you to skip manually entering details like your name and email address \u2014 a process that is especially cumbersome on a small smartphone screen. This sped up the process of signing up for an account to buy that pair of shoes you saw go on sale.\n\nIf you were to delete Facebook, you would break your access to many sites and apps that you signed up for using Facebook Login.

Of the 141 countries that had enough data from both 2008-10 and 2015-17 to measure how their happiness had changed, the United States ranked 107th, with a drop of 0.315 in its average happiness rating.\n\nExplaining why one country is happier than another is a dicey business, but the report cites six significant factors: G.D.P. per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity and corruption levels.\n\nDr. Sachs noted that the happiest countries have very different political philosophies from the United States\u2019. Most of the top 10 are social democracies, which \u201cbelieve that what makes people happy is solid social support systems, good public services, and even paying a significant amount in taxes for that.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s report also focused heavily on how migration affects happiness. Most notably, it found that the happiness of a country\u2019s immigrants is almost identical to that of its population at large \u2014 indicating, Dr. Helliwell said in an interview, that \u201cpeople essentially adjust to the average happiness level of the country they\u2019re moving to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe closeness of the two rankings shows that the happiness of immigrants depends predominantly on the quality of life where they now live,\u201d the report\u2019s executive summary said. \u201cHappiness can change, and does change, according to the quality of the society in which people live.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis cuts both ways: A person who moves to a country high on the happiness list will probably become happier, and a person who moves to a lower-ranked country will probably become less happy.\n\nThe study did not examine how national immigration policies affect happiness. However, it did examine the findings of Gallup\u2019s new \u201cmigrant acceptance index,\u201d which measured public attitudes toward immigrants in various countries. These attitudes are not always correlated with national policies: The United States, for example, ranks highly on the migrant acceptance index, even though the Trump administration has pursued more restrictive immigration laws.\n\nIn countries with high migrant acceptance indexes \u2014 that is, countries where the populace is generally receptive to newcomers \u2014 immigrants \u201care happier than their other circumstances would indicate, and so were the people who were born there,\u201d Dr. Helliwell said. \u201cThat sort of openness turns out to be good for both.\u201d", "title": "Want to Be Happy?

Where they store it brings peace of mind, whether it is in a vault high above the ground or a bomb shelter below it.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically providing the optimal environment for the wine,\u201d said Avner Schneur, president and chief executive of GRM Document Management, which owns Mana Wine Storage. \u201cWe\u2019re providing the capability to monitor it.\u201d\n\nDuring Hurricane Sandy in 2012, he noted, personal cellars and several storage facilities were flooded. \u201cOur warehouse is above the ground, so we don\u2019t have the flood risk,\u201d he said.\n\nTo people who keep only a few bottles of wine around the house, such focus on storage may seem strange. But collectors take it seriously for several reasons.\n\nSpace is an obvious need. Dr. Mark Connolly, a cardiovascular surgeon, has always lived in apartments in and around New York. He has focused his collection on Italian red wine.\n\nBut using a storage service has created its own problem: an overabundance of wine. Because Dr. Connolly, 63, never had to worry about managing his inventory, he just kept collecting.\n\nHe has 7,000 bottles, and he knows he will never finish them in his lifetime. \u201cI always tell my kids, \u2018You can\u2019t sell it,\u2019\u201d Dr. Connolly said. \u201c\u2018You have to drink it or give it to your friends.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTim Gallagher, 49, has a cellar in his home in New Canaan, Conn., that holds 2,200 bottles of wine. He keeps an additional 1,300 bottles in storage facilities to age before they\u2019re ready to drink, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike Dr. Connolly, Mr. Gallagher, who works in finance, uses storage facilities because he is buying more wine than he is drinking.\n\n\u201cI try to buy in quantities of three or six bottles,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not seeking to acquire a lot more bottles. My goal is to have lots of variety.\u201d\n\nStorage facilities also provide records, or provenance, for people who might want to sell their collection one day. Just as art collectors want to know who has owned a work, wine collectors want to know that rare vintages have not been stored in a car trunk.\n\nWine can be damaged by excessive heat or cold if it is not stored properly.\n\n\u201cWith a wine that is heat damaged, the fruit dries out, and it could be tart,\u201d said Per Holmberg, former head of the wine department at Christie\u2019s auction house and now director of the private client group at Wine Source. \u201cWhen wine gets too cold, it starts to expand, and you only have a certain amount of space before gases get pushed out through the cork.\u201d\n\nA lack of provenance can affect a wine\u2019s value, particularly when people are bidding for it at an auction, Mr. Holmberg said. Knowing where the wine has been will help increase the bidding, he said.\n\nShipping wine in the country is tightly controlled by a web of state laws, and it is illegal for individuals to ship wine themselves across state lines. Having wine storage in different states can ensure that collectors get the wine they want regardless of where they live.\n\nThat is one of the reasons Mr. Wallick has wine in New York and New Jersey. Mana also has licenses that allow it to ship a bottle to a friend in another state as a gift.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Gallagher keeps his wine in four locations. Outside of his own cellar, he has wine at the Chelsea Wine Vault in Manhattan, some of which has been there for more than a decade. Other wine is in River Valley Wine Cellars in Westchester County, which is closer to his home. But recently, he has been storing wine at a facility in northern Connecticut called Horse Ridge Cellars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost storage facilities maintain the right humidity and temperature for aging wine, but there is nothing special about them. Horse Ridge, though, has a hook the others cannot match: It stores wine in its nuclear bomb shelters.\n\nOne shelter was built by a group of Hartford insurance companies in the 1950s to store their documents and protect their top executives in the event of a nuclear attack.\n\n\u201cWhen I bought the property in 2000, there were a lot of leftover documents here, and I found all the minutes from board meetings,\u201d said Jed Benedict, president of Horse Ridge Cellars. \u201cThey fully intended to have this massive, awesome bomb shelter to hide out in, and then the only thing left in the world would be insurance executives.\u201d\n\nNow the bomb shelter protects hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of some of the greatest wines ever produced. Six years ago, when it filled up, Mr. Benedict built another one.\n\nThe natural temperature of these shelters is perfect for wine. The humidity is easy to manage. And security is not difficult to explain: The original bomb shelter has a 12-ton vault door, is eight feet underground and has a series of backup generators that would, well, protect your wine from Armageddon.\n\nBut Horse Ridge is two hours from New York, and proximity matters for many collectors. So Mr. Benedict said he was generally in and around New York every week for pickups and deliveries.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Schneur of Mana markets the convenience of his operation and its climate-controlled vans.\n\n\u201cIf you decide you want to get a bottle of wine and ship it from New Jersey to New York, it\u2019s illegal for you, but we have the licensing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can pick it up for you. We can deliver it for you. We can do it in a rush if it\u2019s for tonight\u2019s dinner or tomorrow or next week.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDelivery fees vary. As with anything else, if you wait until the last minute, it will cost you more. Mana charges a minimum fee of $40 to deliver wine to Manhattan, whether one bottle or five cases, which Mr. Schneur said was reasonable.\n\n\u201cTo cross the tunnel, it\u2019s $15 for the toll,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not nickeling and diming you.\u201d\n\nThere are other charges, too. Horse Ridge charges $40 an hour for additional services, like taking an inventory of wine or packing up a collection for shipment.\n\nStorage fees can be as low as $1.25 a month per case of wine, which holds 12 regular bottles or six magnums. Of course, wine collectors rarely store just one box, and they are not putting it there for just a month.\n\nMana has a monthly minimum of $45, which covers 20 cases of wine. That breaks down to 19 cents a bottle. For people who want their own \u201cwine cage\u201d \u2014 a space that holds 100 cases \u2014 the cost starts at $100 a month.\n\nBut for the serious collectors with hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in wine, these charges are of little matter.

Yet cleaning up your timeline is an exercise I recommend in moderation if you care about your privacy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s how I did it \u2014 and what I learned.\n\nTesting the Cleaners\n\nSince Facebook and Twitter offer no simple method for doing a mass purging of timelines, you will likely have to rely on third-party tools. I picked two well-reviewed programs: TweetDelete for cleaning up my Twitter account and Social Book Post Manager for handling my Facebook account.\n\nTweetDelete was simple to put to work. It\u2019s a web app you install by visiting the tool\u2019s website, tweetdelete.net, and authorizing the application to connect with your Twitter account.\n\nFrom there, you can choose to delete tweets that are more than a week old. The app takes a few minutes to delete large batches of your tweets. One major caveat: Because of a technical limitation, TweetDelete can delete only the last 3,200 tweets on your account. So to clear out roughly 14,000 tweets that were more than a year old, I had to run the app four times. (I\u2019ve had a lot to say on Twitter over the last decade, O.K.?)\n\nMy Facebook timeline was tougher to manage. After skimming my last 14 years\u2019 worth of Facebook posts, I concluded there was nothing worth keeping. So I opted to purge everything.\n\nI installed Social Book Post Manager, a free add-on for the Chrome web browser. This app was more rudimentary: It essentially scrolled through my timeline and clicked on the \u201cdelete\u201d button for each of my posts for me.\n\nSocial Book Post Manager lets you delete months\u2019 or years\u2019 worth of content \u2014 or everything, which I chose. The problem was, even after I used the app to scrub through my entire timeline six times, the tool missed about a dozen posts. There is a setting to adjust the speed at which the app deletes posts, and I had to choose the minimum speed to do a complete purge.\n\nVideo\n\nThe process was agonizing: I watched years of my youth play back in slow motion, including dated, satirical jokes and photos of myself wearing vintage clothing back when that was a fashion trend, before the tool deleted each post one at a time.\n\nIs It Worth the Effort?\n\nAfter I finished scrubbing my Facebook timeline, I concluded that my delete-everything approach was probably not worth most people\u2019s time. And even after all that time, my Facebook timeline was still decorated with posts that my friends had published about me \u2014 including photos from my 21st birthday (need I say more?) \u2014 because that content was not mine to delete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGennie Gebhart, a researcher who follows privacy and surveillance issues for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights nonprofit, found a simpler approach. She connected her Facebook and Twitter accounts with the app Timehop.\n\nTo help people reminisce, Timehop every day surfaces photos and posts published from years past on Twitter and Facebook. Ms. Gebhart uses the tool to incrementally audit her timeline to see if there was something from the past she might not want lingering around.\n\nShe said that she rarely found posts worth deleting, but that most people might enjoy this light exercise for peace of mind \u2014 and to protect their public reputations.\n\nFacebook representatives said that based on feedback, the company recognized that people had different needs for managing their timelines. So it offers a privacy setting for people to limit the visibility of their older timeline posts.

Since 2010, eurozone membership can also demand acquiescence to the European Central Bank, which can essentially ask for and veto national economic legislation.\n\nThe result? Much of Europe has become nearly ungovernable. As voters across the Continent see their ability to influence policy taken away, they have lashed out, neutering the traditional center and giving rise to disruptive populists. Italy\u2019s election, in other words, says much about everything that\u2019s wrong with the European Union.\n\nThe center left has been hit especially hard. Germany\u2019s Social Democrats, France\u2019s Socialists and most recently, Italy\u2019s Democratic Party have lost millions of voters. Part of this is driven by a rejection of the immigration and refugee policies over which centrist governments have presided. In eurozone countries, voters have had extra reason to lose faith: Despite their rhetorical commitments to social welfare and redistribution, these parties have overseen cuts in welfare spending, loosened labor laws and reformed pensions. Over the past two decades, center-left parties have justified the elevation of a technocratic European ideal over the claims of both democracy and the actual, daily economic experience of millions of Europeans.\n\nItaly is the epicenter of the problems facing establishment European politicians for both recent and more historical reasons. The external immigration pressures that have roiled politics are especially acute in Italy, which is the first point of entry for migrants and refugees coming from North Africa. Consequently, the League surged from 4 percent of the vote in 2013 to about 18 percent this week, thanks in large part to the party\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cItalians First.\u201d\n\nAbove all, though, have been Italy\u2019s particular tribulations with the euro, which have struck at the heart of the country\u2019s democracy. In the fall of 2011, the European Central Bank wrote to Mr. Berlusconi, then the prime minister, saying that its purchase of Italian bonds was conditional on legislative reforms. When Mr. Berlusconi refused to cut pensions, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany encouraged the Italian president at the time, Giorgio Napolitano, to end Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s premiership. Germany essentially strong-armed the president into appointing a cabinet of technocrats led by Mario Monti, a former European commissioner. Since then, Italy has not had an elected politician as minister of economy and finances. The role has been taken by Mr. Monti himself, a former central banker and former official at the International Monetary Fund.", "title": "Opinion | Want to Understand What Is Wrong With Europe?

Nolan, an immunologist at Stanford University, got wind of the U.F.O. documentary, \u201cSirius,\u201d while it was still in production.\n\nDr. Nolan emailed the producers and offered to look for DNA in the mummy. The skeleton\u2019s owner agreed to X-ray images as well as bone marrow samples taken from the ribs and right humerus.\n\nOnce Dr. Nolan and his colleagues received the samples, they were able to retrieve fragments of DNA from bone marrow cells without much struggle. \u201cWe could tell this was human right away,\u201d said Atul Butte, a computational biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author of the new study.\n\nThe scientists eventually managed to reconstruct much of Ata\u2019s genome.

Some have already been linked to conditions ranging from scoliosis to dwarfism to having an abnormal number of ribs.\n\nBut some of Ata\u2019s mutations are new to science. It\u2019s possible some caused her skeleton to mature quickly even while failing to grow to normal stature.\n\nMs. Bhattacharya speculates that such a disorder would have caused the child to be stillborn.

On that score, they have produced the most thorough and riveting account so far \u2014 riveting, that is, as long as you don\u2019t mind falling into paroxysms of political outrage and dismay.\n\nAlthough the authors make their view clear from the start, referring to Russian help as the perceived \u201coriginal sin\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency, it is to their credit that they present both campaigns in an unfavorable light. The book will surely infuriate readers on either side of what should be the most urgent question facing the nation today: the vulnerability of our democratic institutions to Russian manipulation.\n\nFor aggrieved Clinton supporters, reading \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d will be like reliving a nightmare. Trump supporters, too, should wince at the cringe-worthy embarrassments that would have derailed any other candidate.\n\nIn one scene inside Trump Tower, the candidate\u2019s aides debate how to respond to the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape in which the future president boasts about grabbing women by their genitals. According to the authors, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, her face reddening and eyes filling with tears, urged her father to make a full-throated apology. He did not. He simply dismissed what he said as \u201clocker room banter\u201d without denying anything he did.\n\nIt should have been a moment for Team Clinton to celebrate a knockout blow to Trump\u2019s insurgency \u2014 except that the video landed on an inauspicious day for them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBarely an hour earlier, the director of national intelligence and secretary of homeland security issued a statement saying that the intelligence community was \u201cconfident that the Russian government directed\u201d the hacking of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s email system. The subsequent leak of thousands of emails was a tactic \u201cconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.\u201d\n\nThis was the Watergate burglary of the internet age, yet the revelation was all but drowned out by the release of the tape. \u201cThe Clinton staffers hit the phones, calling reporters they had worked with, urging them to give more attention to the Russia story. They weren\u2019t having much luck.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd still to come was the third October surprise of the day. WikiLeaks announced that it would begin dribbling out thousands of emails to and from John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, that proved hugely embarrassing to the candidate.\n\nThat day \u2014 Oct. 7 \u2014 may prove to be a turning point in American history.

In it we reported on the F.B.I.\u2019s inability to substantiate what appeared to be ties between the Trump Organization and a private Russian bank, Alfa, even as its agents were following an array of other leads. Some of them were detailed in the \u201cdossier\u201d of Christopher Steele, the former British agent hired to conduct opposition research.\n\nWhile evidence of many accusations remains unclear, the authors argue that the article and headline wrongly focused on the absence of proof rather than the main point, which was that there was an investigation into \u201cpossible links between the Russian government and the Republican presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nThere are, in the end, no heroes in \u201cRussian Roulette.\u201d The bureau\u2019s director, James B. Comey, deserves significant scrutiny (and he has his own book coming). During the investigation into her private email server, Clinton and her staff were so suspicious of the bureau that when agents first came to the Brooklyn headquarters to inform them of the Russian hacking, the campaign manager, Robby Mook, refused to meet them, fearing they were there to ask about Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe suspicions boiled over when Comey made an 11th-hour statement that the bureau was reviewing \u201cnew\u201d emails found in a separate investigation, into Anthony Weiner, the disgraced husband of Clinton\u2019s close aide Huma Abedin. By doing so, Comey hurled a thunderbolt into the election only days before the vote \u2014 something aides quoted anonymously claim he wanted to avoid.\n\nHistorians may long debate who had a bigger influence on the outcome: the F.B.I. director or the Russian leader.\n\nFor anyone who believes in the better angels of American politics, \u201cRussian Roulette\u201d is a depressing book. The Russian hacking, it is now clear, simply exploited the vulgarity already plaguing American political campaigns, which churn on spin and strategy (and money) far more than vision or values.\n\nThe book does have its flaws. The simplistic vilification of Russia \u2014 without evidence or better context \u2014 reinforces the view of some thoughtful Russians that Americans have become irrationally hostile toward the country and even the culture. The sourcing is also sloppy in places. The authors are respected journalists, and one can trust their use of anonymous sources or not, but in the span of four pages describing the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013, for example, they quote four different ones. There is \u201ca Miss Universe associate\u201d (whatever that means), \u201ca Miss Universe official,\u201d \u201ca Miss Universe staffer\u201d and \u201canother Miss Universe staffer.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMiss Universe official\u201d states that only Putin could have approved holding the pageant in Moscow, which is absurd. Putin controls much in Russia, but only in the fevered imagination of a pageant official does he dictate the location of beauty contests. The \u201canother Miss Universe staffer\u201d suggests Trump winnowed the finalists in his pageants by rejecting dark-skinned contestants and those who \u201csnubbed his advances.\u201d That is an explosive accusation to attribute to a single source among a muddle of them.\n\nStill another anonymous source reveals one of the book\u2019s most significant revelations. A Russian insider had been providing the American Embassy in Moscow with unconfirmed but what turned out to be prescient information about Putin\u2019s inner circle around the same time Trump was presiding over the pageant. Among the disclosures was the racially tinged disdain senior Russians felt for Barack Obama, all dutifully reported back to Washington in top-secret cables.\n\nThis source \u2014 described not as an intelligence asset but as a sympathetic political insider, who as a young man had been \u201cheartened by Ronald Reagan\u2019s anti-Soviet rhetoric\u201d \u2014 told his interlocutor as early as 2014 that the Kremlin was planning to undermine democracy in the West. It was, the authors suggest, one of many missed signals of what was coming.\n\n\u201cAnybody who had any doubt about Putin\u2019s intentions,\u201d the source\u2019s American interlocutor is quoted as saying, \u201cjust wasn\u2019t reading what we reported.\u201d", "title": "Was the 2016 Election a Game of \u2018Russian Roulette\u2019?", "authors": ["Steven Lee Myers", "Michael Isikoff", "David Corn"]}
{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Two weeks before his speech, Johnson had received an unusual C.I.A. study examining the likely implications of a Communist victory in Vietnam. The 33-page report, a distillation of the opinions of more than 30 C.I.A. officers, concluded that a failure in Vietnam would not open the way to devastating setbacks, much less lead to a major war. On the contrary, the study asserted, \u201csuch risks are probably more limited and controllable than most previous argument had indicated.\u201d\n\nRichard Helms, the director of central intelligence, knew this conclusion would not sit well with a president who had ordered American forces into combat two and a half years earlier and steadily increased the American commitment ever since. In a covering note, Helms assured Johnson that the C.I.A. was not arguing that the United States should end the war any time soon. \u201cWe are not defeatist out here,\u201d he wrote from his office in Langley, Va. Yet the report plainly suggested that the scale of America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam was out of line with that country\u2019s actual importance to the United States.\n\nThe study, titled \u201cImplications of an Unfavorable Outcome in Vietnam,\u201d acknowledged that a Communist victory would amount to \u201ca rather dramatic demonstration that there are certain limits on U.S. power, a discovery that would be unexpected for many, disconcerting for some, and encouraging to others.\u201d But none of this, Johnson was told, would amount to a disastrous blow to American security. For one thing, the report said, it would hardly come as a surprise that a highly motivated and well-supplied guerrilla movement could defeat a militarily superior power. \u201cThis is not a novel discovery,\u201d the C.I.A. pointed out.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

To reinforce the point, the C.I.A. looked to the past: \u201cHistorically, great powers have repeatedly absorbed setbacks without permanent diminution of the role which they subsequently played\u201d in international affairs.\n\nThe report also questioned the contention that defeat in Vietnam would cause governments around the world to doubt the willingness of the United States to live up to its international commitments. Since the Eisenhower years, leaders had justified their decisions to escalate American involvement in Vietnam in part on the supposition that its alliances could unravel \u2014 and Communist challenges to American interests could multiply \u2014 if other nations had reason to question Washington\u2019s resolve when it confronted challenges.\n\nIn fact, the C.I.A. study asserted that damage to national credibility would be limited and temporary. The Soviets would continue to act with \u201ctheir usual caution\u201d and would pull back in the face of new indications of American strength, according to the report. It even speculated that willingness to accept defeat in Vietnam might improve the reputation of the United States with its NATO allies, who might view Washington\u2019s willingness to cut its losses in a region of secondary importance as a sign of maturity rather than unreliability.\n\nA secretary\u2019s notation on the document, which was declassified in 1993, indicates that Johnson read the study, but there is no record of his reaction. None of his aides could recall speaking with him about it. It\u2019s not difficult, though, to imagine why he would have ignored it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost obviously, he might have dismissed the document as irrelevant, since he remained convinced that the United States was on course to achieve its basic objectives in Vietnam. That, after all, would be the central theme of a major effort undertaken by the administration later in the year to re-energize the nation\u2019s commitment to the war.\n\nPolitical calculations may also have played a role. Just as in earlier years, Johnson feared that backing down in Vietnam would jeopardize his re-election in 1968 and the prospects of the Democratic Party more broadly. The party had already suffered setbacks in the 1966 congressional elections, and bigger disasters loomed if Republicans could paint their rivals as irresolute cold warriors. Closely related, perhaps, was Johnson\u2019s concern for his own reputation and legacy. A man of towering ambitions, he shuddered at the thought of becoming the first president to lose a war.\n\nOr it may be that Johnson simply could not see past pervasive assumptions about the monumental stakes of the war. To be sure, he had occasionally questioned the importance of Vietnam during private conversations with aides and was well aware that many prominent Americans in and out of government had long doubted the need to fight there.\n\nBut he was also steeped in a Cold War mind-set that assumed a defeat anywhere in the world could unleash domino effects, irrevocably damage American credibility, and invite larger wars. To defy this conventional wisdom, particularly at a time when thousands of Americans had already died to uphold it, would have required exceptional intellectual and political courage.\n\nIt also, though, might have been the right thing to do. Instead of seriously reckoning with the issues raised in the report, Johnson continued to insist that core American interests demanded success in Vietnam, even after events forced him in 1968 to open negotiations. His successor, Richard Nixon, was even more adamant about the dangers to American power internationally if the Communists won, and 20,000 more Americans died in the failed effort to prevent that outcome after Johnson left office.\n\nOnly after 1975 would Americans see what the C.I.A. had pointed to eight years earlier: Defeat in Vietnam, whatever the political and social traumas it produced for the United States, brought no geopolitical disaster.", "title": "Was the Vietnam War Necessary?", "authors": ["Mark Atwood Lawrence"]}

The Frisbee\u2019s lip creates a stabilizing turbulence that keeps it flying horizontally (at least when properly thrown).\n\nEric Cooper, a senior at the college, worked out the mathematics of the seed\u2019s flat disc.

With Henry Ford\u2019s top architect, Albert Kahn, as their consultant, the Soviets squeezed wealth out of the countryside on the road to creating a socialist society after an initial epic fail. \u201cThe Russians have no more idea how to use the conveyor than a group of schoolchildren,\u201d Freeman quotes Bourke-White saying. \u201cOne Russian is screwing in a tiny bolt and 20 other Russians are standing around him watching, talking it over, smoking cigarettes, arguing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the Russians eventually figured out how to make manufacturing advance both their socialist culture and their economy, inspiring the East Europeans, all of whom later inspire Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen setting up Chinese government-backed shops in Shenzhen and Guangdong.\n\nFreeman\u2019s final chapter, \u201cFoxconn City,\u201d is the finest and most searing profile of wealth-makers in the bunch, revealing the sheer drudgery of overworked people who make sneakers and iPhones but can\u2019t afford to buy them and the quiet deal-making machinations fueling Silicon Valley\u2019s billionaire class.\n\nQuoting the Apple executive Tim Cook, the mastermind behind offshoring production to Taiwanese-owned contractors in China before his ascent to chief executive, Freeman shows how just-in-time production flourishes on the backs of poorly paid workers who are shifted from one factory to another in an entirely different region practically at the stroke of his keyboard. When it comes to inventory, Cook said, \u201cyou kind of want to manage it like you\u2019re in the dairy business.

More robust retraining and access to need-based college financial aid? Incentives to resettle elsewhere? A New Deal for the displaced and drug-addicted?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s beyond the purview of a historian to wrestle with such questions.

This enables limited resources to be deployed efficiently: Specially trained rangers can pinpoint the poachers\u2019 exact locations to set up ambushes and arrest them, while local aid groups focus on training community members in skills like farming, food preparation and weaving to reduce their dependence on forest products, an approach that\u2019s proved effective in discouraging wood-gathering, fishing and other illegal activities in the park.\n\nThese strategies are succeeding in some of the world\u2019s most heavily poached landscapes. Tiger populations are recovering at key sites in Nepal, Thailand and Indonesia, and there is now hope for critically endangered lions in West Africa, where the poaching of their prey is one of the biggest threats.\n\nBig cats are resilient, but so are the criminals poaching them. In Bolivia, where jaguar hunting has been outlawed since the 1975 treaty on the international trade in endangered species banned the global trade of the animals\u2019 coveted pelts, reports of a resurgence in jaguar killings have recently emerged. The journal Nature has reported that between August 2014 and February 2015, Bolivian authorities confiscated 186 jaguar fangs from packages bound for Asia. Radio ads broadcast in parts of the country offer $100 to $150 for jaguar fangs, most likely for necklaces to be sold as trinkets. Experts worry that as tiger parts become harder to obtain, a new illicit trade in jaguar parts will take hold.\n\nConservation teams stationed in poaching hot spots are best positioned to anticipate emerging threats like these and respond quickly. Front line officers are striving to stay one step ahead of the criminals with counterintelligence; elite ranger training; and advanced technology borrowed from police and the military like night vision equipment, thermal drones and forensic genetics.\n\nDespite the insatiable and ever-changing demand for big cats and their parts, conservation groups and law enforcement agencies working together across the entire illegal supply chain \u2014 from source to transit to destination \u2014 have proved that they can disrupt the criminal networks that lie behind these serious crimes. Arrests, prosecutions and convictions of poachers are on the rise, and big cat populations \u2014 where diligently protected \u2014 are on the rebound.\n\nAs the results in Manas show, a focused effort on locking down key tiger sites can increase tiger populations. A 2010 study by some of the world\u2019s leading tiger experts suggested that it is relatively inexpensive to protect tiger sites effectively. Adjusted for current conditions \u2014 and excluding the investment already being made by governments, particularly India, as well as by international donors and nongovernmental organizations \u2014 it would take about another $50 million a year to secure the 50 or so remaining recoverable tiger sites across Asia.", "title": "Opinion | We Can Stop the Poaching of Big Cats.

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "Dr. King passionately believed that a commitment to God is a commitment to bettering humanity, that the spiritual practices of prayer and worship must be translated into concern for the poor and vulnerable. Dr. King would want us to live his specific faith: work to defeat racism, speak out in principled opposition to war and combat poverty with enlightened and compassionate public policy.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his lifetime, he was disappointed in the complacency of both black and white churches. He would be as disappointed today. The white church largely remains a bastion of indifference to the plight of black people. White evangelicals continue to focus on personal piety as the measure of true Christianity, while neglecting the Social Gospel that enlivens Jesus\u2019 words for the masses. Dr. King saw faith as an urgent call to service, a selfless ethic of concern that, he said, quoting the Hebrew prophet Amos, made \u201cjustice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.\u201d\n\nToday, in the midst of resurgent bigotry and deep divisions in this country, faith is too often viewed as an oasis of retreat, a paradise of political disengagement. On this Easter Sunday, as we mark 50 years since Dr. King\u2019s death, it is a perfect and necessary time to remember his faith \u2014 and rekindle its urgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. King often declared his preacher\u2019s vocation by citing something like a biblical genealogy of black sacred rhetoric that traced through his family: \u201cI grew up in the church. My father is a preacher, my grandfather was a preacher, my great-grandfather was a preacher, my only brother is a preacher. My daddy\u2019s brother is a preacher. So I didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. King\u2019s faith underwent significant change. At first, he was discouraged from the ministry by a strain of black preaching that was long on emotion and short on reason. Then, at Morehouse College, his encounter with preachers like the school\u2019s president Benjamin Mays convinced him that the ministry was intellectually respectable.\n\nA midnight kitchen experience over a cup of coffee after he received phone calls threatening to blow out his brains and blow up his house during the Montgomery bus boycott gave the fear-stricken Dr. King a sense of God\u2019s unshakable presence. He said that instead of inherited faith, he had to forge the terms of his own relationship to the Almighty.\n\n\u201cI had to know God for myself,\u201d he explained. \u201cI could hear an inner voice saying to me, \u2018Martin Luther, stand up for righteousness, stand up for justice, stand up for truth. And lo, I will be with you, even until the end of the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the rest of his life Dr. King did just that. His faith propelled him to fight Jim Crow, the ugly hatred it bred in the white soul and the haunting inferiority it left in black minds. It led him to speak valiantly against the lynching, bombing and shooting of black people who merely wanted what white people took for granted: a cup of coffee at any lunch counter, a room at any hotel they could afford, a drink at any water fountain they passed, a seat on a bus wherever they pleased and a desk in the nearest schoolhouse.\n\nDr. King\u2019s faith put him at odds with white Christians who believed it was their mission to keep separate the races \u2014 the same people whose forebears believed it was their duty to enslave Africans and punish blacks who sought to escape their hardship. Dr. King realized that he wasn\u2019t simply in battle against a society built on legal apartheid, but that he also had to fight against a racist culture that derived theological support from white Christianity.\n\nWhite evangelicals were opposed to Dr. King because they conveniently divided body and soul: Race was a social issue that should be determined by rules in society and laws generated by government. Such a view meant that the racist status quo was sacred. The point of religion was to save the souls of black folk by preaching a gospel of repentance for personal sin, even as segregation often found a white biblical mandate. After Dr. King spoke at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in 1961, the most prominent institution of the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, many white churches in the South withheld financial contributions to the school.\n\nIf rabid racists were a clear threat to black well-being, it was the white moderates who claimed to support civil rights but who urged caution in the pursuit of justice who proved to be a special plague. In 1963, eight white Alabama clergymen issued a statement pleading for black leaders to slow their aggressive campaign against segregation in Birmingham, Ala. The clergymen cited \u201coutsiders\u201d who had come to Birmingham to lead demonstrations that were \u201cunwise and untimely.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe white clergymen blamed the black protests for inciting hatred and violence through their \u201cextreme measures,\u201d arguing that their cause \u201cshould be pressed in the courts and in negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTheir statement led Dr. King, imprisoned for his protests against injustice, to draft his well-known \u201cLetter From Birmingham Jail,\u201d in which he \u201calmost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens\u2019 Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than to justice.\u201d It was the same white moderates who led Dr. King near the end of his life to conclude that \u201cmost Americans are unconscious racists.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only the white church Dr. King had to combat. In 1961 he joined other black ministers who were dissatisfied with the conservative leadership of the National Baptist Convention to form a rival body, the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Dr. King reserved some of his harshest criticism for the black church. Less than two months before he perished, Dr. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference organization convened a meeting of ministers in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to Miami to play,\u201d Dr. King warned his listeners in an address titled \u201cTo Minister to the Valley.\u201d And he didn\u2019t. \u201cLet us admit that even the black church has often been a taillight rather than a headlight,\u201d Dr. King preached. As social injustice roared, these ministers kept silent \u201cbehind the safe security of stained-glass windows.\u201d As their members struggled with poverty, they mouthed \u201cpious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities.\u201d\n\nThen Dr. King came in for the kill: \u201cLet us honestly admit that all too often we\u2019ve been more concerned about the size of the wheelbase on our automobiles, and the amount of money we get in our anniversaries, than we\u2019ve been concerned about the problems of the people who made it possible for us to get these things.\u201d Dr. King argued that \u201cthe great tragedy is that Christianity failed to see that it had the revolutionary edge.\u201d\n\nChristianity is again failing to see that edge.\n\nWhile black bodies are punished or disappear into oblivion, under the repressive reign of police brutality, many white churches remain silent. Instead, an overwhelming number of white evangelicals line up in support of a president who has evinced even less of a public embrace of religion than Ronald Reagan did. Yet President Trump has been prayed for by white evangelicals as his administration and his words have preyed on black people, immigrants, transgender people and the poor. There are some brave contrarians among Southern Baptists, like the Trump critic Russell Moore, who have dared to dissent. But their voices are too few.\n\nThe black church\u2019s behavior has been shameful as well. With a few notable exceptions, black churches have often been chronically indifferent to the fight against white supremacy. . On this Easter Sunday, many ministers will dutifully preach about a crucified God without dwelling on the death in Sacramento of 22-year-old Stephon Clark in a police shooting that even the city\u2019s mayor, Darrell Steinberg, said was \u201cplain wrong.\u201d\n\nInstead, black churches have been invested in personal prosperity and upward climbing at the expense of the Social Gospel that Dr. King preached. For every progressive pastor like Frederick Douglass Haynes in Dallas, there are hundreds more who turn their dire warnings about sin into bigger cars and more cash for their lucrative pastoral anniversaries. For every preacher of the virtue of social conscience, like Gina Stewart in Memphis, there are so many more pastors who use the Bible only to reprimand fornicators and backsliders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome black ministers have even frowned on Dr. King for his moral failures as an excuse to avoid the message that he trumpeted as an itinerant preacher for social justice. To Dr. King\u2019s credit, he acknowledged his flaws and warned people against making him a saint.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was a man of faith who didn\u2019t mind making trouble for God. He believed his purpose in life was to bring justice to as many of God\u2019s children as possible while proclaiming the revolutionary power of belief. And that wasn\u2019t a mere metaphor: He believed that America must undergo a \u201crevolution of values\u201d so that it might begin to fulfill the mandate of the Gospel to look after those who needed God\u2019s help the most.\n\n\u201cGod didn\u2019t call America to do what she\u2019s doing in the world now,\u201d Dr. King said in his famous \u201cDrum Major Instinct\u201d sermon, delivered from his home pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta two months before his assassination. \u201cGod has a way of even putting nations in their place. The God that I worship has a way of saying, \u2018Don\u2019t play with me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs America in its present incarnation, with its present leadership, teeters toward an arrogance, isolationism and self-importance that are the portals of moral decline and political self-destruction, the nation must recall the faith of Martin Luther King Jr. He saw faith as a tool for change, a constant source of inspiration to remake the world in the just and redemptive image of God. On this holy day, instead of shrinking into the safety of faith, we should, as Dr. King did, bear the burdens of the less fortunate and rise again to serve humanity.", "title": "We Forgot What Dr. King Believed In", "authors": ["Michael Eric Dyson"]}

(The application was open to anyone of any age, but we were especially interested in hearing from college students and recent graduates.)\n\nHow did The Edit start, and how do you plan to use it as a platform?\n\nThe Edit launched a few years ago and began as a curated list of Times stories that we thought would interest college students.\n\nA lot of those readers sent us feedback saying they wanted to see more of their voices represented in The Times. Based on that, we decided that we should relaunch The Edit and find a way to incorporate their perspectives.\n\nOnce we choose our contributors from the applications we received, we will feature their stories and voices in the newsletter.\n\nThe relaunch of The Edit is part of a larger effort by The Times to engage with college students and recent graduates. Why is The Times focusing more on these readers, and how are we changing to appeal to them?\n\nI don\u2019t think it was surprising for any of us to hear that readers say they sometimes don\u2019t see themselves represented in The Times. If we\u2019re leaving out such a large part of the population in our report, that must mean our coverage is missing something.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow did you react when you saw thousands of applications coming in?\n\nMaybe we were being na\u00efve, but we initially thought we might get a couple of hundred applications. But soon after the post went up, it went viral and the responses started pouring in. We were blown away by the excitement and quickly realized we were in for something much bigger. (I also had to adjust my email settings.)\n\nMost people found the application on social media, where they shared it with their friends. We ended up extending the deadline because there were so many people who wanted to apply.\n\nWhat was the application process?\n\nWe asked applicants to write a few sentences about themselves and then choose one of four prompts to answer.\n\nWhat are some of the themes you\u2019re seeing in the responses?\n\nGoing through the applications has been really fun. I\u2019m glad the questions we asked allowed people to go in a lot of directions with their responses. One prompt was \u201cWhat\u2019s your biggest pet peeve about the way that people write about your generation?\u201d There are only so many stereotypes that we all know about millennials and Gen Z, so a lot of the answers draw upon the same themes. But with that question, you can see how strong of a writer an applicant is and how compelling of an argument he or she can make.\n\nFor another prompt, we asked applicants to write about something they\u2019re obsessed with. This question led to the widest range of responses. Some people wrote fun odes to mozzarella sticks and cold showers. Others took on weightier issues like climate change and housing reform. There\u2019s no right answer to a question like this, so it\u2019s great to see how people chose to respond.\n\nWhere did candidates send applications from?\n\nWe\u2019ve heard from people all over the world, from West Virginia to West Africa. I\u2019ve really been surprised by the number and diversity of international applicants. It\u2019s also great to see that people wrote to us from across the United States. I\u2019m glad we were able to get such a wide range of applicants, and hope our contributors will reflect that diversity in their work for The Edit.\n\nWhat qualities does the ideal candidate have? Is a background in journalism important?\n\nThe most important thing is that the applicants have ideas. When college students and recent graduates say they don\u2019t see themselves in The Times, then the next question is, What do you want to see? If they can come up with ideas for improving our coverage and topics that will interest their peers, that\u2019s the real sweet spot. The applications that excite me most have ideas that I never would have come up with, or that touch on something I didn\u2019t even know existed.\n\nA strong foundation in writing is a plus, of course, but we\u2019re not necessarily looking for journalists. This isn\u2019t a traditional media position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWho's reading the applications, and what\u2019s the process for reviewing them?\n\nWe have a team of editors and others from around The Times, mostly from our newsroom. We\u2019re dividing up all the applications and closely reading each and every one.\n\nWe\u2019re doing the first round right now and will be in touch with people who are moving on to the second stage. We aren\u2019t sure how many rounds there will be yet.\n\nHow many people will you choose? When will they be announced?\n\nWe initially planned to select five contributors. Because of the huge response we got, we are probably going to increase that number.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten a ton of emails and messages on social media from people wondering when they\u2019ll find out about their applications. Since we\u2019re still reviewing them and planning the relaunch of The Edit, all I can promise is that we\u2019ll be in touch as soon as we have news. That should be in the coming months, if not the coming weeks.\n\nWhat are some of the subjects that the contributors will write about? What form will their stories take?\n\nWe have an awesome opportunity to feature a mix of stories.\n\nIn the weeks since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., you can\u2019t help but notice the many high schoolers who are speaking up about gun violence, and see a need for more opportunities for students to share their views on real issues. I think there\u2019s also room to approach topics that you wouldn\u2019t find elsewhere in The Times. Maybe that\u2019s a meme or a YouTuber who wouldn\u2019t normally have a place in the report. This is a great chance to shed light on some of those things, too.\n\nWe\u2019re also really open to different story formats, like reported articles and personal essays. It will just depend on what the story is and how we think it\u2019s best told. I would love to incorporate video and other media.\n\nHow frequently will the contributors write?\n\nThat\u2019s a bit up in the air right now. There was so much excitement about the application that we\u2019re thinking about increasing the frequency of the newsletter, which comes out every other week right now. However that shakes out, we\u2019ll work with the writers to figure out a cadence that makes sense for them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow long will these first contributing positions last?\n\nWe said that we were looking for people to work with us this year. This is a new program, so depending on where we are and where they are toward the end of that period, the positions could last longer.\n\nWill there be another application for the next group of contributors?\n\nI hope the relaunch is a huge success and that we\u2019ll be able to do another callout relatively soon. There\u2019s clearly a lot of interest from college students and recent graduates to work with The Times.\n\nWill there be other opportunities for applicants who aren\u2019t chosen as contributors?\n\nDefinitely! We\u2019re thinking a lot about how we can offer other ways to get involved. We\u2019ll be in touch with applicants in the coming months about some of those opportunities.", "title": "We Want to Elevate the Voices of College Students and Recent Graduates. 20,000 Responded.", "authors": ["Lara Takenaga"]}

Those women will now have to line up behind the studio\u2019s secured creditors \u2014 who themselves are likely to be paid pennies on the dollar, according to bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nThe upshot is that women alleging abuse may now have a harder time recovering damages.\n\nThe filing, which was expected, ended a chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat.\n\nIn the fall, after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations of sexual harassment and rape, Mr. Weinstein\u2019s younger brother and partner in the studio, Bob Weinstein, unsuccessfully scrambled to line up bridge loans to keep the company operating. He then sold \u201cPaddington 2\u201d rights to Warner Bros., which bought time but resulted in a lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy early February, to the disbelief of many in the film industry, it seemed as if the Weinstein Company had found a way forward. A group of investors, including the billionaire Ron Burkle and Lantern Capital, had made an offer to buy most of the studio\u2019s assets, which include the TV series \u201cProject Runway\u201d and the rights to \u201cLion,\u201d \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d and about 275 other films.\n\nThe investor group, managed by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, had offered to pay off what it believed was the Weinstein Company\u2019s debt \u2014 about $225 million. In return, it would receive most of the studio\u2019s assets, which Ms. Contreras-Sweet planned to use to start a new, female-led film company.\n\nBut then Mr. Schneiderman threw the brakes on a sale, filing a lawsuit alleging that the studio and the Weinstein brothers had violated various state and city laws. He also said the proposed sale to Ms. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group was unacceptable because it did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct would not be rewarded.\n\nThe Weinstein Company and the investor group moved to address those concerns, but the studio\u2019s board announced on Feb. 25 that it would file for bankruptcy because Ms. Contreras-Sweet had not delivered on a promise to fund the studio\u2019s operations until a transaction was completed.\n\nMr. Schneiderman was able to get the deal back on track earlier this month, when he hosted a meeting between the two sides at his offices. He did so after the buyers and sellers had committed to various terms, including establishing a victims\u2019 fund worth up to $90 million. The Weinstein brothers, who jointly own about 42 percent of the studio, would receive no cash from the sale.\n\nBut the sale collapsed a few days later after the investor group discovered that the studio had an additional $55 million to $65 million in debt.", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements", "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"]}

But in a society where government is increasingly ineffective, company towns are nevertheless likely to be welcomed, or at least tolerated.\n\n\u201cIt may be the best option for many, just as a benevolent dictatorship can be O.K. for as long as the benevolence lasts,\u201d Mr. Green said.\n\nNo Free Wi-Fi\n\nOnly seven years ago, Silicon Valley had a very different attitude about building housing for workers, much less the community. A gaunt Steve Jobs, in what would turn out to be his last public appearance, made his case before the Cupertino City Council for a new Apple headquarters.\n\nMr. Jobs told council members how great the new doughnut-shaped headquarters was going to be. It would have a lot of trees, a theater, curved windows. Architecture students would come from all over to study it.\n\nCity Council member Kris Wang had a question: How could the 60,000 Cupertino residents benefit from this new campus?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to continue to stay here and pay taxes,\u201d Mr. Jobs said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t, we\u2019d have to go somewhere like Mountain View.\u201d\n\nMs. Wang, a former Cupertino mayor, persisted. \u201cDo we get free Wi-Fi or something like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a simpleton,\u201d Mr. Jobs replied. \u201cI always had this view that we pay taxes and the city should do those things. That\u2019s why we pay taxes. If we can get out of paying taxes I\u2019d be glad to put up a Wi-Fi network.\u201d\n\nSince that June 2011 meeting, the number of hours commuters in Silicon Valley lose every day to congestion has doubled to 66,000.

That problem was compounded by the company\u2019s apparent lack of interest in where its new employees would live. Decisions like these are no longer acceptable from a public relations point of view, and would not be smart for the companies in any case. If Silicon Valley continues choking on its traffic, the companies will find hiring not merely difficult but impossible. Even for a tech programmer, a $2 million house is a hurdle.\n\nSo the virtual companies are being forced to grapple with the most intractable physical issues.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Google, for instance, thought they were going to have to get into the transportation business,\u201d said Allison Arieff, editorial director of San Francisco Bay Area Planning and Urban Research Association, a research organization. \u201cBut they now have a giant swath of the company devoted to getting people around.

So could Stanford University students. Traffic flowed naturally.\n\nHowever enticing this past might seem, efforts to put the brakes on growth have had limited success.\n\nMeasure M, a 2014 effort to restrict development in Menlo Park\u2019s downtown, was soundly defeated by voters.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "When a bank receives a fraud claim or detects suspicious activity, it typically assigns an investigator to piece together what happened. If the bank determines that the customer was an innocent victim, it will usually help him or her try to recover the missing money. But if the bank finds signs that the customer has engaged in illegal activities, like money laundering or fraud, it is supposed to report the issue to law enforcement and close the customer\u2019s accounts.\n\nMany Wells Fargo customers, however, have complained that the bank was too quick to freeze or close accounts after signs of fraud \u2014 even if they themselves reported the suspicious activity. The consumer bureau\u2019s complaints database contains dozens of reports from aggrieved customers who said their accounts had been shut down after they were victimized. Some customers who unknowingly deposited fake checks, for instance, said their accounts had then been terminated, often with little warning or explanation. That can temporarily block customers\u2019 access to their funds \u2014 and make it more difficult to recover any money they lost.\n\nWells Fargo said it was working with regulators on the matter.\n\n\u201cAs always, our goal is to protect our customers and the bank from fraud, and we want to do so in ways that minimize the risk and impact on our customers,\u201d Mr. Seitz, the bank spokesman, said.\n\nTimothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief executive, said at an investor conference in December that the bank was reviewing its procedures for handling accounts with signs of suspicious activity.\n\nAccording to Mr. Valles\u2019s lawsuit, it was standard practice at Wells\u2019s Portland office to close customer accounts rather than investigate the suspicious activity.\n\nInstead of looking into fraud claims, the bank would instead \u201csave money by simply closing accounts under the pretext of a \u2018business decision,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valles said in his complaint, filed in Oregon\u2019s Multnomah County Circuit Court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had first complained to the company\u2019s management about the account closings the next year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, Wells Fargo fired him, saying he had violated a security policy by leaving his notebook, which contained internal case numbers, on his desk overnight. It was the last in a string of reprimands that Mr. Valles said he had received from the bank after he complained \u2014 a response that he said constituted retaliation.\n\nDespite the acrimony surrounding his departure from the bank, Mr. Valles said Wells Fargo had shown signs of progress in recent months.\n\nSoon after the bank\u2019s disclosure of the consumer bureau\u2019s investigation, a new group of people arrived to the Portland office, he said. They set up new computers and put up an \u201cAudit Department\u201d sign over their section of the office.\n\nAfter that, employees stopped using the blanket \u201cbusiness decision\u201d justification for closing accounts and began conducting more thorough investigations, Mr. Valles said. If they did decide that an account had to be closed, he said, they cited more specific evidence of fraudulent acts, such as a counterfeit check or an unauthorized electronic deposit.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working on fixing the problems,\u201d Mr. Valles said. \u201cA lot needed to be done.\u201d\n\nBut those changes will not help customers whose accounts have already been affected, like Michael and Mary Ellen Mervis, a couple who had accounts with Wells Fargo for decades.\n\nIn 2015, they discovered that one of their accountants had removed a six-figure sum from their checking account without their consent over the course of several years. The Mervises filed a police report in Milwaukee, where they lived at the time, and alerted the bank. Soon after, Wells Fargo told them that it was closing their checking and brokerage accounts and would not let them open new deposit accounts with the bank.\n\nThe Mervises protested. The bank responded by noting its \u201cresponsibilities to oversee and manage risks in its banking operations,\u201d and said the decision was final.

Dylann Roof, who murdered nine African-American people at a historically black church in Charleston, S.C.; Stephen Paddock, who killed 58 people at a concert in Las Vegas, and Mr. Conditt were not.\n\nSome legal experts say that the word \u201cterrorism\u201d is being applied too broadly today, both under the law and by people who want to emphasize the horror of the crime.\n\n\u201cAfter 9/11, the definition expanded and continues to lose its coherence and continuity,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law expert at George Washington University who has served as counsel in a number of national security and terrorism cases. The notion of terrorism \u201chas almost become an exclamation point for criminal cases,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf someone like Mr. Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, is considered a terrorist, \u201cthen every serial killer in history would be a terrorist,\u201d Mr. Turley said. \u201cIf everybody is a terrorist, then the actual crime loses its definition and meaning.\u201d And ultimately, he said, there could be an expansion of the government\u2019s power to investigate, as well as tougher sentencing.\n\nThe news media often wrestles with this issue as well. For the most part, journalists tend to follow the lead of law enforcement on whether to call a crime an act of terrorism. The New York Times called the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing an act of terror, but not the 2002 Washington-area sniper attacks.\n\nMajor news outlets did not label the Austin bombings as terrorism. The editorial board of the Austin American-Statesman disagreed with that decision. \u201cThere is no mistaking the fear these attacks inflicted on an entire city,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cThat makes this terrorism.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions has used the term \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d to describe some incidents, like the killing of Heather Heyer at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. But people cannot be charged with the federal crime of domestic terrorism as they can be charged with international terrorism.\n\nThis is one reason killers who support designated international terrorist groups are referred to as terrorists by law enforcement officials.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Mateen could be charged with terrorism after the Pulse nightclub shooting because he expressed support for the Islamic State. \u201cThe government pointed to the fact that he had made statements that suggested he was trying to advance the goals of a foreign terrorist organization,\u201d said Faiza Patel, a director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nPeople found guilty of terrorism can receive tougher sentences.\n\nEven though there are plenty of crimes with which killers can be charged, it is still important to treat domestic terrorism as the crime that it is, Mary McCord, a professor at Georgetown University Law School and a former national security official at the Justice Department, wrote after the Charlottesville rally.\n\n\u201cIt is time that our federal criminal laws recognize domestic terrorism for what it is: the moral equivalent of international terrorism,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere is also a perceived bias against people who are not white or Christian when it comes to deciding on who is a terrorist, said Victor Asal, a professor and a director of the Project on Violent Conflict at the University of Albany who focuses on terrorists and insurgents. \u201cThe distinction between what is terrorism and what is not matters a whole heck of a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think of serial killers and terrorists in very different ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a country, we need to be more aware that if you are killing people for a political or ideological purpose, regardless of what the perpetrator looks like, they have to be thought of as terrorists,\u201d Professor Asal added.\n\nThis belief is one of the reasons the debate over how we define terrorism is so charged and brings up sensitive issues around race and religion.\n\nThere have been several instances where law enforcement and the media did not give nonwhite suspects \u2014 or even victims \u2014 the same consideration. Eddie S. Glaude, the chair of the center for African-American studies at Princeton, said those decisions became \u201cmarkers in the culture that signal which people are valued more than others.\u201d\n\nBy eschewing the word \u201cterrorist\u201d in favor of \u201ctroubled,\u201d law enforcement made Mr. Conditt more empathetic, Professor Glaude said.\n\n\u201cIf I describe this as an act of a person who has suffered, it orients the listener differently than if I say it\u2019s the act of a terrorist or a madman,\u201d Professor Glaude said. \u201cThe language we use carries a moral and ethical weight.

Teachers in Oklahoma have been talking about mounting a West Virginia-style statewide walkout in early April if the Legislature does not raise their pay by then. In Kentucky, a pending bill to reduce pensions for retired teachers has prompted protests and talk of strikes.\n\n\u201cUnions have tended throughout most of their histories to be forces that seek stability, not unrest,\u201d said Joseph A. McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown University. \u201cWhen they are weakened, we\u2019re more likely to see the re-emergence of instability and militancy, and the kind of model that we\u2019re seeing happen in West Virginia.\u201d\n\nThat model, driven by grass-roots anger, can flummox politicians. Mitch Carmichael, the Republican president of the West Virginia Senate, opposes collective bargaining for public employees, but he acknowledged that the decentralized aspects of the strike made it difficult to reach a settlement that would satisfy the teachers.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not negotiating with a particular, a unique set of participants,\u201d Mr. Carmichael said. \u201cThere\u2019s just this organic sort of \u2014 I don\u2019t know what to call it.

When they defied union leaders\u2019 calls to end the strike on March 1, the strikers redoubled the pressure on lawmakers to deliver on their pay raise.\n\nThe lesson, experts said, is that undermining public sector unions, as the Janus case seeks to do, will not guarantee labor peace.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat it does show is that this Janus decision will force workers to look at other strategies,\u201d said Ken Fones-Wolf, a professor of history at West Virginia University. \u201cWithout this institutional voice, it does make it harder to sort of organize this kind of thing.

That pattern of labor activism changed with the passage of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, sometimes called the Wagner Act, giving most workers a federally protected right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.\n\nThe Wagner Act does not cover public employees, though, and some states, like West Virginia, do not give public employees the right to bargain collectively. For that reason, the state\u2019s two teachers\u2019 unions, the West Virginia Education Association and the state branch of the American Federation of Teachers, do not function as those in other states might, although they do lobby for teachers and help with grievances. Membership is voluntary and far from universal.\n\nEven so, they were quick to respond as frustration built over rising health insurance costs and other issues earlier this year. It was the unions that started the long walkout by conducting a vote and calling for the statewide work stoppage, which began on Feb. 22.\n\n\u201cIt started off with the membership following their state leaders,\u201d said Gary Price, the superintendent of schools in Marion County, who, like his colleagues around the state, kept schools closed during the walkout. \u201cBut when the state leaders made a decision that the employees didn\u2019t like, they took it in a different direction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt that point, the course of the strike was in the hands of teachers in each of the state\u2019s 55 counties making their own separate decisions about what to do, though they monitored the mood elsewhere over social media. In Mr. Price\u2019s county, teachers gathered for a heated meeting at a high school, where people stood up and cried out every time they heard that another county\u2019s schools would be closed the next day.\n\n\u201cOnce they started to all fall, we were going to fall in line with the rest of our state,\u201d said Allyson Perry, president of the Marion County Education Association. \u201cThat\u2019s been the theme of this the whole time.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, teachers and bus drivers from Boone County had huddled informally at the Capitol to make their decision. \u201cNone of our union reps were over there,\u201d Robin Muncy, a bus driver, said afterward. \u201cWe just did it as a whole, because we felt we were being lied to.\u201d\n\nWill Lawrence, 53, a cook at an elementary school in Charleston who is not a member of any union, said, \u201cWe had to drag our leaders kicking and screaming \u2014 that\u2019s why it seems so disorganized.\u201d\n\nAnd in Morgantown, it was Anna Simmons, 26, who called the meeting at the mall, intending to talk over the idea of defying the union leadership and staying out with some of her colleagues at the elementary school where she works as a counselor. She was stunned when so many teachers from other schools showed up.\n\n\u201cI think our reps realized change needed to happen,\u201d Ms. Simmons said. \u201cThey ended up with a forest fire, and once it was lit, they didn\u2019t know how to contain it.\u201d\n\nWest Virginia\u2019s strike is over now, but the problems and the activism that drove it are not. In Oklahoma on Wednesday, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union announced it was accelerating its timeline for a statewide walkout, catching up with the fast-moving plans of activist teachers who had already been organizing a work stoppage in protest of low pay \u2014 on average, the lowest in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe have proven this was long overdue,\u201d said Larry Cagle, an English teacher in Tulsa who has been one of the main grass-roots organizers of a walkout. \u201cThe union, they don\u2019t know how to do this.\u201d", "title": "West Virginia Walkouts a Lesson in the Power of a Crowd-Sourced Strike", "authors": ["Jess Bidgood", "Campbell Robertson"]}

What activities make you feel more alive?\n\nIn \u201cAlone at Sea,\u201d Elizabeth Weil writes about Aleksander Doba, who kayaked across the Atlantic Ocean (for the third time) at age 70:\n\nOcean kayaking is catastrophically monotonous. The primary challenge is not physical. Doba describes the tedium as a form of dementia: \u201cHundreds, thousands, maybe millions of repetitions. The brain is removed from the process.\u201d Alone at sea without his hearing aids, Doba joked, he grew so disoriented that he started shouting at himself \u201cso that I could hear.\u201d (Doba is fairly deaf but didn\u2019t bring the aids along because they\u2019re expensive and not waterproof, and there was no one to talk to anyway.) He intended to keep muscle tone in his legs by swimming, but he had to abort that plan because his body in the water attracted sharks. He was assaulted by hailstorms of flying fish. \u201cDo you know how fast they go?\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not feel good.\u201d When he couldn\u2019t sleep, because of the unrelenting stuffiness of his cabin and the waves crashing through the portal onto his head, Doba thought about his wife, children and his young granddaughter. He thought about his dead parents. He communed with the turtles, whose shells he tapped while they swam alongside him to make sure they were alive, and the birds, who landed on Olo for a rest and often entered his cabin and did not want to leave. He did have a satellite phone, and he texted with Arminski, who, as his trip navigator, sent a regular forecast for wind and weather. Doba also called his wife, twice. But after she got the bill for $500, she says, \u201cthe desire to talk\u201d decreased. Doba rotated through three kinds of freeze-dried porridge for breakfast, four kinds of freeze-dried soup for lunch and an assortment of a dozen freeze-dried entrees. (He ate all the meat options first.) He also snacked on dried fruit and his wife\u2019s plum jam, but he ran out of that halfway across the ocean. Every time he closed his eyes, Doba told me, \u201cI dreamed I was paddling in the winter in Poland.\u201d He lost 45 pounds. Still, the trip was perfect. Ninety-nine days after leaving Senegal, Doba arrived in Brazil. He was greeted by one journalist and the Polish ambassador. Nobody cares if you cross the Atlantic in a kayak. The fact that Doba knows this is clear in his eyes. In photos from the ends of his trips, he looks ecstatic and feral, in the best possible sense, intrinsically wild and free.\n\nStudents: Read the article up to the close-up photo of Mr. Doba in a white tank top, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Can you understand why Mr. Doba looked as if he were feeling \u201cecstatic and feral, in the best possible sense, intrinsically wild and free\u201d while kayaking? Why or why not?\n\n\u2014 What activities do you do that give you a feeling of being more alive? Why do they make you feel that way?\n\n\u2014 What activities can you see yourself doing when you reach Mr. Doba\u2019s age, so you still feel \u201cwild and free\u201d?

Fantasy, in its broadest and most benign form, has been a godsend for major sports leagues, providing a (mostly) harmless way to keep fans engaged in a world of growing entertainment options.\n\nWhatever the catalyst, Americans are now betting more than $150 billion annually on professional and college contests. (All but $250 million of it is illegal, which is why definitive figures are hard to come by.) By comparison, the non-betting sports industry \u2014 ticket sales, media rights, advertising revenue \u2014 is expected to reach around $74 billion next year.\n\nGambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it\u2019s a homecoming of sorts to sports\u2019 roots.\n\nThere\u2019s no record of it, but it\u2019s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole \u2014 golf! \u2014 so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.\n\nMore relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world\u2019s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball \u2014 both, it should be noted, invented in England.\n\nUntil the mid-17th century, cricket was played almost exclusively by children, what with working people (who included teenagers back then) having little leisure time for much besides eating, sleeping and creating more little cricketers. But the twin engines of the English Civil War (1642-51) and the Industrial Revolution (about 1760-1840) gave working-class Britons their first taste of individual liberty and free time \u2014 the men, at least. That brought grown-ups to the cricket pitch. And they, in turn, brought the gamblers.\n\nBetting was so integral to cricket\u2019s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.", "title": "Opinion | What Americans Really Think About Sports Betting", "authors": []}

A February 2017 study by the Government Accountability Office found that Customs and Border Protection had not shown the extent to which fencing and walls have secured the border.\n\nThe House on Thursday approved spending money on border fencing, but not a border wall. The bill would fund nearly $1.6 billion for border security, including technology and repairs to existing barriers. That includes $641 million for about 33 miles of new border fencing in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe administration wants to spend $18 billion over the next 10 years to build a wall on nearly 900 miles of the Southwest border. Currently, there are nearly 700 miles of wall and fences on the border.\n\nThe Democratic report concluded that funding requests for a wall far exceeded proposed spending on border technology and personnel, which border agents identified as critically needed.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget request for the 2019 fiscal year includes $43 million for remote video surveillance systems along the border and more funding for other security technology.\n\nIt also includes $255 million to hire and retain agents at the Border Patrol, which has been shedding personnel faster than it can hire. Agency documents indicate the Border Patrol must recruit 133 applicants to fill a single agent\u2019s position. Mr. Trump wants to hire 5,000 new agents.\n\nA program to detect drug tunnels beneath the southern border \u2014 another security priority cited by agents \u2014 was not funded in Mr. Trump\u2019s budget request, the Democratic report noted.", "title": "What Border Agents Say They Want (It\u2019s Not a Wall)", "authors": ["Ron Nixon"]}

Superstar freshman Deandre Ayton was held to a quiet 14 points.\n\nCJ Massinburg had 19 points and Buffalo shredded Arizona\u2019s defense at a 55-percent clip for the program\u2019s first N.C.A.A. tournament win.\n\nThe Bulls move on to face Kentucky in Saturday\u2019s round of 32.\n\nPhoto\n\nLoyola-Chicago Scores Tournament\u2019s First Upset\n\nThe N.C.A.A. tournament is about buzzer-beaters, and the first one in this year\u2019s event came from No. 11 Loyola of Chicago.\n\nIt was a close game throughout, but Miami took the lead late, and Lonnie Walker IV went to the line with his team up by 1 and 9 seconds left.\n\nHe missed, and Loyola raced down court to try to take the lead. Donte Ingram fired from 3-point range, and with .3 seconds left, it swished in, giving Loyola the first upset of the tournament, 64-62.\n\nCelebrating the win was Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, the 98-year-old nun who serves as the team chaplain for Loyola.\n\nThe 11th-seeded Ramblers (29-5) matched the school record for wins from their 1963 national championship team in their first N.C.A.A. trip since losing to Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in the Round of 16 in 1985. They advanced to face third-seeded Tennessee on Saturday. Next up for Loyola is Tennessee.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sixth-seeded Hurricanes (22-10) led most of the second half in their third straight trip to the tournament but couldn\u2019t pull away in the final minutes and lost in the first round for the second straight year.\n\nAmong those selecting 11th-seeded Loyola over sixth-seeded Miami was former President Barack Obama.\n\nBuffalo shot 54.8 percent from the field, but its defense was what stood out, holding Ayton to a quiet 14 points, as he was double- and even triple-teamed on almost every possession.\n\nMichigan\u2019s Defense Stifles Montana\n\nA suffocating defensive performance lifted Michigan past Montana, 61-47, in the final game of what wound up being an eventful first night.\n\nOpening the game with a 10-0 lead, the Grizzlies were quicker and more energetic than the Wolverines, who looked to be shaking off some rust after an extra week off following the early Big Ten tournament this year.\n\nBut by halftime, Michigan was back in shape. And in the second half, they held Montana more than 10 minutes without a field goal. The Grizzlies finished with only seven field goals in the entire second half.\n\nThe No. 4 seed Wolverines would never be confused with an offensive juggernaut, but their defense has been terrific of late. Thursday night was just the latest example.\n\nPhoto\n\nRob Gray\u2019s 39 Points Keep Houston Alive\n\nAn up-and-under scoop layup through traffic by Rob Gray with 1.1 seconds remaining beat San Diego State, 67-65, and sent No. 6 Houston to the second round.\n\nThe Aztecs\u2019 Trey Kell had a look at a buzzer-beating 3-pointer, after a pass the length of the court found him surprisingly open. But it clanged out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt had been an amazing comeback by the Aztecs, who trailed by 13 early in the second half. The No. 11 seed found a way to tie it with 1:08 remaining on a 3-pointer by Devin Watson.\n\nThen Gray answered with a 3-pointer to go back ahead. Then it was Watson again, from the corner, to tie the game a second time.\n\nBut Gray, the senior guard, was not going to be denied. He wove his way through traffic and somehow flipped a layup through for his 39th point. It was all the Cougars needed.\n\nTexas Tech Avoids Big Upset\n\nIt looked like it would be the biggest upset of the day, but No. 3 Texas Tech found a way to get past No. 14 Stephen F. Austin, fighting off a hot team to advance with a 70-60 victory on Thursday.\n\nThe Red Raiders had lost five of the team\u2019s last seven games going into the tournament but were still deemed 11-point favorites by most sportsbooks despite Stephen F. Austin having been on a roll with 10 wins in 11 games.\n\nKeenan Evans led Texas Tech with 23 points, while Ivan Canete led Stephen F. Austin with 17.\n\nWhile the Lumberjacks flirted with an upset all game, the Texas Tech defense ranked No. 4 in the nation by KenPom.com \u2014 locked things down in the second half, not allowing a field goal in the last 5 minutes and 24 seconds of the game. That plus an offensive surge led by Evans, who scored 19 of his 23 in the second half, sealed Stephen F. Austin\u2019s fate.\n\nTexas Tech will now advance to face the winner of Thursday\u2019s matchup between No. 11 St. Bonaventure and No. 6 Florida.\n\nPhoto\n\nKentucky Holds Off a Scrappy Davidson Team\n\nThey looked shaky at times in the second half, but No. 5 Kentucky managed to hold on against No. 12 Davidson to advance, 78-73.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGive the young \u2019Cats credit. They made the plays down the stretch, while Davidson went cold.\n\nIt was tied, 54-54, with just over seven minutes remaining, after Davidson rebounded from a 10-point halftime deficit. But then they went dry: 1 of 12 from the field down the stretch, while Shea Gilgeous-Alexander (15 points) and Kevin Knox (21 points) hit their shots. Not many people gave this freshmen-led Kentucky team much of a chance when they lost four in a row in early February. But they\u2019ve now won 9 of their last 10.\n\nIt was the first time since Nov. 1988 that Kentucky won a game despite not making a single 3-pointer, breaking the longest streak in Division I history, according to Stats, Inc.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeton Hall Advances by Beating N.C. State\n\nNo metropolitan New York City team had won an N.C.A.A. tournament game since 2004. That streak ends, with No. 8 Seton Hall evading No. 9 N.C. State, 94-83.\n\nIt\u2019s the first win in three tournament tries for the Pirates\u2019 seniors Angel Delgado, Kadeem Carrington, and Desi Rodriguez. They combined for 59 points and now get to prepare to take on top seeded Kansas on Saturday.\n\nCarrington scored 26 points, Rodriguez added 20, Myles Powell had 19 and Angel Delgado scored 13 for the Pirates (22-11), who led the entire way a year after a late meltdown cost them an early exit against Arkansas.\n\nAllerik Freeman hit six 3-pointers and had 36 points to lead the No. 9 Wolfpack (21-12), who returned to the tournament under first-year coach Kevin Keatts for the first time in three years. Torin Dorn added 18 points and 12 rebounds, and Lennard Freeman contributed 13 points.\n\nThe only thing that slowed down the high-scoring, up-and-down matchup was the whistles. The teams combined for 53 fouls, resulting in 66 total free throws. Seton Hall had two players foul out \u2014 Delgado was one of them \u2014 and the Wolfpack had three players relegated to the bench.\n\nPhoto\n\nOhio State Avoids Dreaded 12-5 Upset\n\nWith the game tied at 70, a four-point play by Kam Williams with 1 minute 36 seconds remaining gave Ohio State what it needed to outlast No. 12-seeded South Dakota State and avoid the dreaded 12-5 upset.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouth Dakota State made a late run at the Buckeyes, scoring 10 straight points to tie it at 70-all.\n\nWilliams answered \u2014 by being fouled on a pair of 3-pointers. He finished off the four-point play for a 74-70 lead and made all three free throws on the second, making it 77-70 with 64 seconds left.\n\nMike Daum likely ends his career with the Jackrabbits with 27 points and six rebounds, while three Buckeyes scored at least 20 points, led by Keita Bates-Diop (24 points, 12 rebounds).\n\nOhio State was one of college basketball\u2019s biggest surprises in coach Chris Holtmann\u2019s first season. He didn\u2019t take over the program until June and the Buckeyes were picked to finish 11th in the in Big Ten.\n\nYet behind Bates-Diop, the Big Ten player of the year, Ohio State finished second in the conference behind Michigan State to earn its first NCAA Tournament berth since 2015.\n\nPhoto\n\nKansas Stumbles Early, but Holds Off Penn\n\nAfter sending a few shivers down the spines of fans all across Kansas, Penn, the No. 16 seed in the Midwest region, isn\u2019t going to wind up in the history books.\n\nA poised Quakers team took it to the top-seeded Jayhawks early, looking like a team that truly believed it had a chance to pull off the unthinkable: a No. 16 seed beating a No. 1.\n\nBut, as has happened 133 times before in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Kansas held on for a 76-60 victory. The Jayhawks could not turn it into the blowout that usually results in these first-round matchups; credit Penn for hanging tough throughout the second half. But Kansas\u2019 star guard Devonte Graham (29 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists) led a late first-half turnaround that was ultimately the difference.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t for six straight points from Graham to spark that run, perhaps this would be a different story. Penn, winners of the Ivy League tournament, had a 21-13 lead, momentum and the look of a team that wasn\u2019t intimidated by the Big 12 conference champions. As it turned out, it was just a slow start for the Jayhawks, who shot 46 percent from the field in the second half and hit 15 of 17 free throws.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDuke Routs Iona to Advance\n\nMike Krzyzewski keeps wringing his hands about his team\u2019s youth. And then Duke and its roster of N.B.A.-bound freshmen get on the floor against a more experienced opponent and the Hall of Fame coach\u2019s fears largely vanish.\n\nHaving Marvin Bagley III certainly helps.\n\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year did whatever he wanted against game but overmatched Iona, pouring in 22 points to go with seven rebounds in his N.C.A.A. Tournament debut as the Blue Devils pulled away for an 89-67 victory on Thursday. The 6-foot-11 freshman forward made 10 of 14 shots in 32 minutes \u2014 even making his lone 3-point attempt \u2014 as Duke rolled into a second-round Midwest Region matchup with seven-seeded Rhode Island on Saturday. The Rams held off Oklahoma in overtime in the opening game of the tournament.\n\n\u201c(This is) what we\u2019ve had to go through the whole year, you know, the first road game, the first conference game, the \u2014 you know, the first 10:00 of game, you know, all of those things,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cSo this is a first for them.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNo. 4 Gonzaga Outlasts U.N.C.-Greensboro\n\nWell, that got interesting.\n\nA 3-pointer by redshirt freshman Zach Norvell Jr. with 20.8 seconds remaining was the difference for No. 4-seeded Gonzaga, which just sneaks past a pesky No. 13 U.N.C.-Greensboro that fought valiantly in the second half.\n\nThe Bulldogs allowed the Spartans to keep hanging around because they could not make free throws. They were an abysmal 12 of 23 from the stripe, including four straight misses down the stretch. The Spartans kept up the full-court pressure, happy to let Gonzaga shoot from 3-point range (4 of 22 before Norvell\u2019s clutch shot) or fouling when the Bulldogs tried to move it inside.\n\nFor a while, that strategy seemed to be working. A Greensboro putback by Jordy Kuiper gave the Spartans the lead for the first time since the first half with 1 minute, 46 seconds left.\n\nBut junior guard Josh Perkins answered with a jumper with 56 seconds remaining. After a wild miss by Federico Alonso, Norvell pulled up from 3 and drilled it for the go-ahead shot in Gonzaga\u2019s 68-64 win in Boise.\n\nPhoto\n\nRhode Island Knocks Out Trae Young and Oklahoma\n\nTrae Young was the best player on the floor, as expected. But Rhode Island was better than Oklahoma in a tightly contested opener to the N.C.A.A. tournament, winning 83-78 in overtime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was more attention than usual on the game because of Young, and Oklahoma\u2019s strange season. The freshman led the nation in points and assists. And, unfortunately, turnovers. Oklahoma had looked like one of the best teams in the country but by March only barely squeaked into the tournament.\n\nNeither team could pull away in this game. No. 10 Oklahoma led by 4 at the half, behind 4-for-4 shooting by Young. In the second half he ramped up his point total and finished with 28 and seven assists.\n\nRhode Island was the team with a chance to win it in regulation however. After Young made two free throws to tie it at 69-69, Rhode Island missed a jumper by Jeff Dowtin and a Stanford Robinson putback.\n\nIn overtime, Rhode Island was the better team, winning, 83-78. The extra period included two long, long 3 point tries by Young, both with Oklahoma leading and both of which missed. A 3 by E.C. Matthews was the killer that won it for Rhode Island. Young finished with a game-high 28 and seven assists, and Matthews had 16 for Rhode Island.\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, no problems for Tennessee against Wright State; the final score was 73-47.

The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Professor Palen said, caused countries like Italy to abandon American imports and resume trading with the Soviets, forging trade links that persist today.\n\nA textbook case of one country\u2019s \u201cwinning\u201d a trade war occurred during the late 19th century when a newly unified Italy imposed steep tariffs on imports from France in order to spur domestic industrialization. France, which was much richer and stronger, retaliated with tariffs against Italy, and Italian exports to France collapsed. Even after Italy abandoned its tariffs, France continued to punish Italy for years with high tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFrance won in the sense that the trade war was brutal for the Italians,\u201d said John Conybeare, emeritus professor of political science at the University of Iowa, and the author of the book \u201cTrade Wars.\u201d\n\nProfessor Conybeare said an enduring lesson from that trade conflict was that if there is a wide disparity in economic strength between two countries, the stronger country will probably prevail. \u201cTrump must be thinking that the large size of the U.S. domestic market gives it a lot of bargaining power in any trade dispute,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile that may be true with much smaller, weaker countries, it is not the case with trading partners of equal or even larger size, such as the European Union and China. \u201cWithout that large disparity in economic strength, both sides lose,\u201d Professor Conybeare said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States \u201clost\u201d the war.\n\nThe biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.\n\nThere were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy.\n\nPhoto\n\nMuch the same can be said of the United States steel industry, which since World War II has probably received more protection from tariffs and quotas than any other industry. \u201cThey just used the protection to raise prices, fatten profits, pay their executives more and avoid automating and reducing costs,\u201d Professor Conybeare said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t use the breathing space they gained to modernize. So much of the U.S. steel industry is using obsolete technology, which is why they can\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nDecades of tariff protection have done little to stem the industry\u2019s decline. Domestic steel employment dropped from 135,000 in 2000 to 83,600 in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nMuch like Mr. Trump, President George W. Bush veered from Republican free trade orthodoxy in 2002 when he imposed tariffs of up to 30 percent on certain steel products to counter what he claimed was a surge of imports (Canada, Mexico and a number of developing countries were exempted). Although the tariffs were loudly condemned by many Republicans, politicians from steel-producing states supported the move and protectionist Democrats like Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri argued that the measures did not go far enough.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe European Union filed charges with the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were illegal and discriminatory and authorized up to $2 billion in retaliatory measures. The E.U. threatened tariffs on a variety of American products, including autos and Florida oranges.\n\nMr. Bush abandoned the tariffs in December 2003. He claimed that they had served their purpose, but subsequent studies suggested that they had little impact on employment in the industry and led to a loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in industries that use steel as a raw material.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s pronouncements on trade this week \u201csound like a very archaic, 19th-century argument,\u201d Professor Palen said, referring to a time when protectionism was Republican orthodoxy and Representative William McKinley of Ohio, who later became president, was successfully promoting his Tariff Act of 1890, which raised the average duty on imports to nearly 50 percent.\n\nThe act is widely considered by historians to have been a disaster that led to higher consumer prices and inflation and provoked a voter backlash. Republicans lost their House majority in 1890 and lost the White House and both houses of Congress in 1892. The act was repealed in 1894.\n\nIn any trade war, as that example suggests, \u201cthe big losers are consumers, who are the vast majority of people,\u201d Professor Palen said. \u201cA few industries may benefit, but there are way more losers than winners. And the poor are the biggest losers of all. People like Trump may not care that much about paying a few extra dollars. But a lot of people don\u2019t have that luxury.\u201d", "title": "What History Has to Say About the \u2018Winners\u2019 in Trade Wars", "authors": ["James B. Stewart", "Common Sense"]}

The purpose of democracy, Whitman wrote, is not wealth, or even equality; it is the full flowering of individuals. By dispersing responsibility to all adults, democracy \u201csupplies a training school for making first class men.\u201d It is \u201clife\u2019s gymnasium.\u201d It forges \u201cfreedom\u2019s athletes\u201d \u2014 strong and equal women, courageous men, deep-souled people capable of governing themselves.\n\nWhitman had hoped that the end of the Civil War and Lincoln\u2019s sacrificial death would bring the nation together. But instead there was corruption, division, demoralization and inequality. For Whitman, America\u2019s great foe was feudalism, the caste structure of Europe that Americans had rebelled against, but that always threatened to grow back: \u201cOf all dangers to a nation, as things exist in our day, there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off from the rest by a line drawn \u2014 they not privileged as others, but degraded, humiliated, made of no account.\u201d\n\nWhitman feared economic and social feudalism, but above all he detested cultural and moral feudalism. He believed that writers, artists, musicians, poets and preachers were the real legislators of mankind, and in America they were detached from the nitty-gritty American experience. They still looked back to Europe \u2014 to the parlor, the perfumed courtier and the spirit of gentility \u2014 for their models of character, manners and education. They looked down on America\u2019s democratic mass.\n\nThat left a spiritual vacuum, he believed. Americans had no way to see how their daily exertions contributed to a common spiritual cause. They saw no way to achieve individual salvation through community effort.\n\nAmerica has created a brilliant political constitution, Whitman wrote. It has amassed untold wealth. But it has not created a democratic culture that captures, celebrates and ennobles the way average Americans live day to day.\n\n\u201cThe problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious, and is to be finally met and treated by literature.\u201d When there is no common sense of mystical purpose, you end up with alienation, division, distrust, \u201cuniversal ennui,\u201d a loss of faith in the American project. \u201cNever was there, perhaps, more hollowness at heart than at present, and here in the United States,\u201d he observed.", "title": "Opinion | What Holds America Together", "authors": []}

What special challenges might sailors face, and why?\n\nIn \u201cThe Northwest Passage That Might Have Been,\u201d Brian Castner writes:\n\nIn the summer of 1789, a young fur trader named Alexander Mackenzie led an expedition in search of a Northwest Passage. He and his voyageurs and Chipewyan guides were attempting, 14 years before Lewis and Clark, to cross North America, paddling birch bark canoes down a river they hoped would pierce the Rocky Mountains. Mackenzie was a businessman who wanted to speed the pace of trade by connecting New York and China via an interior passage through the continent. He did find such a route, without knowing it. Mackenzie died thinking he was a failure, when he was really just 200 years early. Some ideas are fantastically ahead of their time. In 1636, Ren\u00e9 Descartes created contact lenses, using glass tubes filled with water; unfortunately, the wearer was unable to blink. Charles Babbage invented digital \u201cdifference engines\u201d \u2014 essentially modern programmable computers but powered by steam \u2014 in the 1820s. And Kodak developed digital cameras in 1974 but discarded the product idea because it thought no one wanted to look at photos on televisions. In a particularly ill-timed episode, Giovanni Caselli invented the fax machine in 1856. Letter writers could scribble a message onto electrically charged foil, and the portions covered by ink would block the flow of current. The stylus of Caselli\u2019s device then scanned each line of text, transmitting the signal via telegraph lines to a second machine, which would scrawl out a \u201cfac simile\u201d of the letter.\n\nHe continues:\n\nLike the fax machine and computer, Alexander Mackenzie\u2019s Northwest Passage was too forward-looking to be practical or useful. Today the melting Northwest Passage \u2014 along the North Slope of Alaska, through the maze of Canadian Arctic islands, then back down along Greenland\u2019s west coast, to the Atlantic \u2014 is regularly in the news.

And the long-term trends show a planet that is warming, especially in the Northern Hemisphere.

The trends are clear, even if you can make a snowball in March in Central Park.\n\nReally, though \u2014 is there some connection between climate change and this cold weather?\n\nScientists have been looking at phenomena like cold spells, which occur when air from the Arctic dips south. After all, the Arctic is warming as a result of climate change, and that appears to be weakening the jet stream, which tends to hold that cold air up toward the top of the world. As Marlene Kretschmer, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told The Times in January, the connection is not yet fully established. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of agreement that the Arctic plays a role, it\u2019s just not known exactly how much,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complex system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is thundersnow?\n\nOn Wednesday, parts of New York shook with a thunderclap.

There is a notable drive toward streamlining, with fewer galleries this year \u2014 a total of 198 from 31 countries at Piers 92/94, the contiguous exhibition space. The timeline is being tightened, as well, to create less of a divide between the past and the present, between post-World War II art (usually found on the sleepier Pier 92) and newer work. It\u2019s a smart move, since much \u201chistorical\u201d art from the 1950s, \u201960s and \u201970s is now being shown in contemporary galleries anyway. The impulse is toward slow looking and away from flashier displays. There are live discussions with artists: Carolee Schneemann at 1 p.m. on Saturday, and JR with the gallerist Jeffrey Deitch at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday. There is plenty of historical work here that has not been seen before \u2014 or seen much \u2014 as well as commissioned projects and a very good mix of international, emerging and blue-chip galleries. Here are some currents I saw running through the fair. Fiber and Textile There has been a strong interest in fiber and textile art in the last half-decade, circling back to the \u201950s and \u201960s, as well as newer work. Textiles also honor traditions outside or alongside the Western painting canon. Jeffrey Gibson is a painter, but he also makes ceremonial-style garments, inspired by Native American Ghost Dance shirts. Several wonderful examples, presented by the gallery Kavi Gupta (Booth 611) and Roberts Projects (Booth 714), are suspended from the ceiling in Pier 94.\n\nShe continues:\n\nDigital A range of digital art and video, both historical and recent, is here.

Plus, studies show that adult film has become a form of sex education for young people around the world.\n\nIt is also, now, a regular subject in the news.

This may sound inconsistent, but it\u2019s not that hard to understand.\n\nAccording to Abramowitz and Webster, in 2016, \u201clarge majorities of Democrats and Republicans truly despised the opposing party\u2019s nominee.\u201d Voters were motivated to go to the polls to cast ballots against the opposition\u2019s nominee much more than to support their own party\u2019s choice. The key factor \u201cin predicting party loyalty in the 2016 presidential election was how voters felt about the opposing party\u2019s presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Abramowitz and Webster found that \u201cthis measure was twice as important in predicting loyalty as feelings toward the candidate from one\u2019s own party.\u201d Partisan loyalty remained \u201cvery high because both Democratic and Republican identifiers overwhelmingly viewed the opposing party\u2019s candidate with deep hostility.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s, about a quarter of all voters split their tickets, voting for presidential and congressional candidates of different parties. Now, not even one in 10 does so. The result:\n\nIn 2016, all 34 Senate elections and 400 of 435 U.S. House elections were won by the party winning the presidential election in the state or district.\n\nIn their analysis of negative partisanship, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that voting on the basis of hostility has an unexpected consequence: It lessens pressure on the winner to be accountable to his or her supporters, effectively freeing winners to thumb their noses at many of the voters who put them in office:\n\nWhen citizens\u2019 support for a candidate stems primarily from their strong dislike for the opposing candidate, they are less subject to the logic of accountability. Their psychic satisfaction comes more from defeating and humiliating the out-group, and less from any performance or policy benefits that might accrue from the victory of the in-party. For this group of voters, candidates have every incentive to inflame partisan negativity, further entrenching affective polarization.\n\nBy this logic, Iyengar and Krupenkin argue that\n\nIf partisans care less about their own party\u2019s performance and instead focus on their distrust of the opposition party, elected officials no longer need campaign on their own merits; instead, they have good reason to try even harder to denigrate the opposition.\n\nIn other words, Trump critics who anticipate a collapse of support when he fails to deliver on campaign promises are likely to be disappointed. According to Iyengar and Krupenkin,\n\nThe primal sense of \u201cus against them\u201d makes partisans fixate on the goal of defeating and even humiliating the opposition at all costs. This negativity bias in voting behavior undermines traditional theories of electoral accountability that rest on incumbents\u2019 ability to deliver policy and performance benefits.\n\nCandidates and incumbents, Iyengar and Krupenkin continue, \u201care less likely to be sanctioned for demonstrating incompetence, dishonesty and unethical behavior.\u201d\n\nTo make their point, the authors cite Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama last December, pointing out that under partisan conditions \u201ca candidate accused of molesting teenage children is able to attract 91 percent of the vote from his copartisans.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | What Motivates Voters More Than Loyalty?

I feel like there\u2019s programs out there that can get the job done.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday morning, William had not yet contacted Ogunbowale, but she said she would probably tell her before Sunday\u2019s tip-off: \u201cYou\u2019re an all-American. You\u2019re supposed to do that. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut William drew a distinction between her shot and Ogunbowale\u2019s. Her own shot had stopped UConn\u2019s record winning streak, providing both an epic upset and cathartic redemption after the Bulldogs had lost by 60 points to the Huskies in the 2016 N.C.A.A. tournament.\n\nBoth shots were great, William said, but she added, \u201cFor us to hit that shot and beat them, I just won\u2019t compare it.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, perhaps it was inevitable that William effectively ran out of gas in the 2017 championship game.\n\nShe had scored 41 points to help defeat Baylor in overtime in the final of the Oklahoma City Regional. The 66-64 victory over UConn also extended into extra time. William did not get to bed after the game until 4 a.m., when the celebration and interviews and adrenaline finally ebbed. Then she was up early the next morning for more interviews, practice and an autograph session.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBeating UConn takes so much out of you,\u201d said Kara Lawson, an ESPN commentator who played in three Final Fours at Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had any juice left. Think about it. You hit that huge shot, your Twitter is blowing up, your Instagram, your phone. You\u2019re not in bed till late. The next day, you\u2019re playing for the national championship. I think that all hit her.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe day after the championship game, William went to the gym at Mississippi State and practiced her shooting. \u201cMy safe haven,\u201d she called it. She did not complain about being benched and has not complained this season about sharing more playing time with her fellow point guard Jazzmun Holmes. Coach Vic Schaefer does not owe her an explanation, she said.\n\nHe has said repeatedly that he will play the point guard with the most energy and the hottest hand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know a player in college basketball who\u2019s been complaining to the coaches,\u201d William said. \u201cLet me know if you find one and see if they\u2019re on the team next week.\u201d\n\nThose who have known her the longest say that she has always been this way, stoic, even-keeled. She has spent her career disproving those who said she was too short. She has had to overcome the loss of her stepfather, who put a basketball in her hands when she was 3 years old and died of a heart attack when she was a senior in high school.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a positive kid,\u201d said Andy Landers, a former coach at Georgia whose summer camp William attended. He joked, \u201cShe thinks the glass is half full because her height won\u2019t let her see the other half.\u201d\n\nThis season, William\u2019s scoring is less urgent. It is her job to facilitate the dominance of the 6-7 center Teaira McCowan (21 points, 25 rebounds in Friday\u2019s semifinal win over Louisville) and the perimeter shooting of forward Victoria Vivians (25 points in the semifinals).\n\nBut Dionnah Jackson-Durrett, an assistant coach at Mississippi State, has implored William to be ready to take over when others languish. In the fourth quarter on Friday, William blocked a layup attempt by a Louisville player who is a foot taller. Then she assisted on a 3-point shot that forced overtime.\n\nWith 46 seconds remaining in the extra period and Mississippi State holding a 1-point lead, William hit two free throws. Then, with her back to the basket, she intercepted a long pass. That essentially put the game beyond reach for Louisville, which finally succumbed, 73-63.\n\n\u201cShe is a tough, competitive cuss,\u201d Schaefer said.\n\nAsked if she would prefer to hit another game-winning shot on Sunday, William smiled and said, no, she would prefer a comfortable lead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to hit a buzzer beater,\u201d she said, \u201cbut no one wants it to come down to that.\u201d", "title": "What N.C.A.A.

These demonstrations demand our respect. They reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society. That support is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms. But the demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform. They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.\n\n_________\n\nExcerpt 2: In \u201cAfter the March, Follow This Gun Reform Battle Plan,\u201d Steve Israel, a Democratic representative from Long Island from 2001 to 2017, writes:\n\nIt has been 38 days since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.; 174 days since the shooting at a concert in Las Vegas; 1,011 days since the killings at a church in Charleston, S.C.; and 1,926 since the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Ten days ago, students organized a nationwide school walkout to demonstrate their outrage about these and other shootings. On Saturday they plan to amass in Washington to pressure a Congress that has done nothing meaningful to protect American children in classrooms, movie theaters, churches, malls \u2014 because, thanks to the National Rifle Association, many of their elected representatives are too busy protecting their re-election. My advice to the students? When you finish marching on the mall, march into the specific congressional districts where you can actually make a difference.\n\nHe continues:\n\nYou can stage marches and school walkouts, but then walk into the swing congressional districts that matter. In the end it\u2019s not about standing up to be heard. It\u2019s about changing who sits in Congress.\n\n_________\n\nExcerpt 3: In \u201cStop Shielding Gun Makers,\u201d Brad S. Karp, the chairman of the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, and H. Christopher Boehning, a partner there, write:\n\nSenator Charles Schumer has proposed three measures to reduce gun violence: expanded background checks, protective orders to disarm individuals at risk of violence or self-harm, and an assault weapons ban. These proposals are critically important. But there is another effective response that has been largely ignored: repeal of a law that prevents suits against the gun industry. A bedrock principle of the American legal system is accountability for wrongdoing. Businesses that cause harm may be held legally responsible in a court of law. Through the imposition of financial liability, our legal system encourages businesses to reduce harm to consumers by making their products safer and disclosing the risks associated with their use. Thanks in part to the accountability imposed by lawsuits, society knows more about the dangers of smoking, and tobacco companies market their products more responsibly. Automakers continually develop and install new safety features, and these innovations deliver results: From 1975 to 2016, the rate of motor vehicle deaths decreased by nearly half. While motor vehicle deaths have declined over the last two decades, firearm deaths have not: According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people now die from firearms than motor vehicle accidents.\n\n_________\n\nExcerpt 4: In \u201cWhy Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America,\u201d Robert Leonard, the news director for the radio stations KNIA and KRLS, writes:\n\nIt\u2019s been many years since I hunted squirrels and rabbits with my Grandpa Leonard. I grew up around guns and remember the pride I had when I completed my N.R.A.-sponsored gun safety training in Boy Scouts, back when the N.R.A. was a group primarily known for teaching gun appreciation and safety rather than lobbying. I have come to understand and appreciate arguments for more gun control. But guns are important to the culture in my conservative community in Iowa, and people around here reject most gun control legislation. So I do my best to understand where they are coming from. One morning after the mass shootings in Parkland, Fla., I spoke about them with a police-officer friend. He has led active-shooter trainings in our schools. He believes that better background checks might help prevent some gun violence, and that people need to do a better job securing their firearms (especially from suicidal teenagers). But he doesn\u2019t believe that significant gun control measures will ever meet approval in rural America, including a ban on AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America\u2019s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.\n\n_________\n\n\n\nStudents: After reading the four excerpts above, tell us:\n\n\u2014 Why does this topic interest you?

In the last 15 years of data in North Carolina general elections, it barely happened once.\n\nThe fact that something hasn\u2019t happened before doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen in November. The growing affluence and educational attainment of white Democrats might give them a much better chance of earning a turnout advantage than in the past.\n\nBut so far, Democrats have not been able to sustain the same advantage in higher-turnout elections, such as in the general elections in New Jersey and Virginia, or in the special congressional election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District.\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats still appeared to have a turnout advantage compared with all registered voters, but not a big one. The Republicans had an advantage in the Georgia Sixth runoff election between Jon Ossoff and Karen Handel, the highest-profile race of all. And while Democrats fared well over all in these elections, the party\u2019s showing was not especially impressive compared with what they have often pulled off in lower-turnout elections.\n\nThe relatively unimpressive Democratic performance in Virginia and New Jersey is particularly noteworthy: The two elections are usually entirely omitted from analysis of recent races, even though more votes were cast in those two elections than in all of the special elections combined.\n\nThe Democrats could still fare extremely well even if their turnout advantage is diminished. Indeed, they did well in the special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District and in the Alabama Senate race. Turnout was quite high for both sides in the two races. On the other hand, one could argue that these races aren\u2019t an easily replicable model for Democratic success.\n\nThere isn\u2019t enough data to definitively resolve this question. But if, on average, Democrats are benefiting from unsustainable turnout, it seems reasonable to suppose that they might still fare a bit worse in the general election than in the broad set of special elections.

He has reportedly invited government representatives to brief the White House on their approach to drug trafficking, including their use of capital punishment. Mr. Trump seems to believe he can learn a thing or two from Singapore.\n\nThis is convenient for the Singapore government, which has been using the global opioid crisis as an argument for the retention of capital punishment. While the American media reported Mr. Trump\u2019s praise for Singapore\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d stance, the country hanged a 39-year-old Ghanaian named Billy Agbozo on March 9, and a 56-year-old Singaporean, Hishamrudin bin Mohd, on March 16.

Putin did not push the button on that missile, but he created the conditions for it to shoot down that plane \u2014 and he walked away from it as if the plane were brought down by lightning, making up one implausible story after another. He got slapped on the wrist with a few sanctions, but his complicity faded away into a mist of baldfaced lies.\n\nWho wanted to confront Russia, with all its gas exports to Europe and all its oligarchs throwing money around London or buying condos in places like \u2026 Trump Tower in New York?

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "Moreover, critics argued, the primary roots of opposition to the American-backed government in Saigon were indigenous and deep rooted, not just in North Vietnam, but throughout the South.\n\nIndeed, from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s the bulk of Communist-led fighting was carried out by southern guerrillas of the National Liberation Front, known to its enemies as the Vietcong. Only after the war was well underway did large units from North Vietnam arrive on the southern front. Antiwar opponents also challenged the claim that South Vietnam was an \u201cindependent nation\u201d established by the Geneva Accords of 1954. Those agreements called for a temporary partition of Vietnam to be shortly followed by a nationwide election to choose a single leader for a unified Vietnam. When it became clear to both Saigon and Washington that the Communist leader Ho Chi Minh would be the overwhelming victor, the South Vietnamese government of Ngo Dinh Diem, with American support, decided to cancel the election.\n\nThus began a two-decade failed effort to build a permanent country called \u201cSouth Vietnam.\u201d The government in Saigon was never a malleable puppet of the United States, but it was nonetheless wholly dependent on American military and economic support to survive against its enemies, including many non-Communist parties and factions in the South.\n\nArmed with these criticisms, many opponents of American policy in the 1960s described Vietnam as a civil war \u2014 not like the relatively clear-cut North-South division of the American Civil War, but a nationwide struggle of Communist-led forces of the South and North against the American-backed government in the South. By 1966, this analysis was even embraced by some mainstream politicians, including Senator William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Eugene McCarthy, who ran as an antiwar presidential candidate in 1968. Both men called attention to the \u201cSouth Vietnamese civil war\u201d to emphasize the strength of the southern insurgency and the failure of the Saigon government to gain the broad support of its own people.\n\nBy 1972, the idea that Vietnam posed a threat to Cold War America was so discredited, it sometimes sounded as if America\u2019s only remaining war aim was to get back its P.O.W.s (President Richard Nixon bizarrely claimed that Hanoi was using them as \u201cnegotiating pawns\u201d). Even more mind-boggling were Nixon\u2019s historic 1972 trips to Beijing and Moscow. Many Americans wondered how Nixon could offer toasts of peace to Mao Zedong and Leonid Brezhnev while still waging war in Vietnam. As the journalist Jonathan Schell put it, \u201cIf these great powers were not, after all, the true foe,\u201d then the war in Vietnam \u201creally was a civil war in a small country, as its opponents had always said, and the United States had no business taking part in it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

According to this position, the war was best understood not as a Cold War struggle between East and West, or a Vietnamese civil war, but as an anticolonial struggle, similar to dozens of others that erupted throughout the Third World in the wake of World War II. When the French were defeated by Vietnamese revolutionaries (despite enormous American support), the United States stepped in directly to wage a counterrevolutionary war against an enemy determined to achieve full and final independence from foreign control.\n\nThis interpretation was shared by many on the antiwar left, including Daniel Ellsberg, the once-hawkish defense analyst who turned so strongly against the war that he was willing to sabotage his career by making public 7,000 pages of classified documents about the history of the Vietnam War, the so-called Pentagon Papers. Ellsberg made his argument most succinctly in the 1974 documentary \u201cHearts and Minds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe name for a conflict in which you are opposing a revolution is counterrevolution,\u201d he said. \u201cA war in which one side is entirely financed and equipped and supported by foreigners is not a civil war.\u201d The question used to be, he added, \u201cmight it be possible that we were on the wrong side in the Vietnamese war. We weren\u2019t on the wrong side; we are the wrong side.\u201d\n\nIn the decades since 1975, all three major interpretations have persisted. Some writers and historians have embraced President Ronald Reagan\u2019s view that the war was a \u201cnoble cause\u201d that might have been won. That position has failed to persuade most specialists in the field, in large part because it greatly exaggerates the military and political virtues and success of the United States and the government of South Vietnam. It also falls short because it depends on counterfactual claims that victory would have been achieved if only the United States had extended its support for Diem (instead of greenlighting his overthrow), or tried a different military strategy, or done a better job winning hearts and minds. However, the war as it was actually conducted by the United States and its allies was a disaster by every measure.\n\nIn recent decades, a number of historians \u2014 particularly younger scholars trained in Vietnamese and other languages \u2014 have developed various versions of the civil war interpretation. Some of them view the period after the French defeat in 1954 as \u201cpost-colonial,\u201d a time in which long-brewing internal conflicts between competing versions of Vietnamese nationalism came to a head. As the historian Jessica Chapman of Williams College puts it, \u201cThe Vietnam War was, at its core, a civil war greatly exacerbated by foreign intervention.\u201d Others have described it as a civil war that became \u201cinternationalized.\u201d\n\nWhile these scholars have greatly enhanced our knowledge of the complexity and conflict in Vietnamese history, politics and culture, they don\u2019t, in my view, assign enough responsibility to the United States for causing and expanding the war as a neocolonial power.\n\nLet\u2019s try a thought experiment. What if our own Civil War bore some resemblance to the Vietnamese \u201ccivil war\u201d? For starters, we would have to imagine that in 1860 a global superpower \u2014 say Britain \u2014 had strongly promoted Southern secession, provided virtually all of the funding for the ensuing war and dedicated its vast military to the battle. We must also imagine that in every Southern state, local, pro-Union forces took up arms against the Confederacy. Despite enormous British support, Union forces prevailed. What would Americans call such a war? Most, I think, would remember it as the Second War of Independence. Perhaps African-Americans would call it the First War of Liberation. Only former Confederates and the British might recall it as a \u201ccivil war.\u201d\n\nI would reverse Chapman\u2019s formula and say that the Vietnam War was, at its core, an American war that exacerbated Vietnamese divisions and internationalized the conflict. It is true, of course, that many Vietnamese opposed the Communist path to national liberation, but no other nationalist party or faction proved capable of gaining enough support to hold power. Without American intervention, it is hard to imagine that South Vietnam would have come into being or, if it did, that it would have endured for long.\n\nMoreover, no other foreign nation deployed millions of troops to South Vietnam (although the United States did pressure or pay a handful of other nations, Australia and South Korea most notably, to send smaller military forces). And no other foreign nation or opponent dropped bombs (eight million tons!) on South and North Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. The introduction of that staggering lethality was the primary driver of a war that cost three million lives, half of them civilians.\n\nIf we continue to excuse American conduct in Vietnam as a well-intentioned, if tragic, intervention rather than a purposeful assertion of imperial power, we are less likely to challenge current war managers who have again mired us in apparently endless wars based on false or deeply misleading pretexts. Just as in the Vietnam era, American leaders have ordered troops to distant lands based on boundless abstractions (\u201cthe global war on terror\u201d instead of the global threat of \u201cinternational Communism\u201d). And once again, their mission is to prop up governments that demonstrate no capacity to gain the necessary support of their people. Once again, the United States has waged brutal counterinsurgencies guaranteed to maim, kill or displace countless civilians. It has exacerbated international violence and provoked violent retaliation.\n\nOur leaders, then and now, have insisted that the United States is \u201cthe greatest force for good in the world\u201d that wants nothing for itself, only to defeat \u201cterror\u201d and bring peace, stability and self-determination to other lands. The evidence does not support such a claim. We need a new, cleareyed vision of our global conduct. A more critical appraisal of the past is one place to start.", "title": "What Was the Vietnam War About?", "authors": ["Christian G. Appy"]}

People who secreted more or less insulin lost no more or less weight in general on either a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet. Genetics didn\u2019t make a difference either. People who had genes that might indicate that they would do better on one diet or the other didn\u2019t.\n\nIn fact, when you look at how every single participant in this study fared on the diet to which he or she was assigned, it\u2019s remarkable how both diets yielded an almost identical, curving range of responses \u2014 from lots of weight lost to a little gained. It wasn\u2019t just the averages.\n\nSome have taken this study to prove that avoiding processed foods, eating more whole foods, and cooking at home leads to weight loss. While I\u2019d like that to be true \u2014 I have advocated this healthful approach in my Upshot article on food recommendations and in a recent book \u2014 that\u2019s not what this study showed. Although that advice was given to all participants, there was no control group in which that advice was omitted, and so no conclusions can be made as to the efficacy of these instructions.\n\nOthers have taken this study as evidence debunking the idea that counting calories is the key to weight loss. While that wasn\u2019t the main thrust of this study, nor the instructions given, participants did reduce their intake by an average of 500-600 calories a day (even if they didn\u2019t count them). This study didn\u2019t prove the unimportance of calories.\n\nThe researchers also asked everyone, not just those in the low-carb group, to avoid \u201cadded sugars.\u201d Therefore, we can\u2019t really say anything new about added sugars and weight loss.\n\nWhat this study does show is that people who have staked a claim on one diet\u2019s superiority over another don\u2019t have as strong a case as they think. It\u2019s hard to overstate how similarly these two diets performed, even at an individual level.\n\nIt shows us that the many people, and the many studies, suggesting that we can tell which diets are best for you based on genetics or based on insulin levels might not be right either. Almost all of the studies that backed up such ideas were smaller, of shorter duration or less robust in design than this one.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "This isn\u2019t a minor debate. The misattribution obscures the organizational nature of the firm, which is partly what makes the building significant. Corporate clients such as Union Carbide chose Skidmore precisely because it married the architectural language of European modernism with American business ethics; crucially, the architect remained invisible. This made it seem as if the building had arranged itself around the corporation\u2019s internal drives. The corporation was de facto the architect.\n\nIt\u2019s true that architectural guidebooks usually list Bunshaft as the architect of Union Carbide, along with other midtown Manhattan landmarks as Lever House, Manhattan House and the Pepsi-Cola building. But in a 1989 oral history conducted by the Art Institute of Chicago, he evades this attribution for those buildings. He depicts himself as the conduit through which a corporation\u2019s mission was translated into architectural form. He credits his administrative partners, who headed up research specific to each commission and oversaw logistics, and the designers who produced drawings and thus helped to work out various kinks in the design.\n\nBunshaft always put the corporation first. But he also makes clear that he set the architectural parameters and, just as important, sold them to progressive chief executives, whom he wonderfully equates with Renaissance princes: \u201cThey were the new Medicis, and there were many of them.\u201d\n\nToday, the Seagram Building, a few blocks north of Union Carbide on Park Avenue, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, is universally acclaimed as the pinnacle of postwar modernism. But when it was completed in 1958, another architect, Louis Kahn, criticized it as stunning but somehow false. \u201cShe is a beautiful bronze lady but she is all corseted inside,\u201d Kahn said. \u201cShe is not true.\u201d Set 50 feet back in an isolated plaza framed on either side by green marble monoliths, it asked to be admired, but refused to participate in the everyday life of the avenue.\n\nUnion Carbide, by contrast, fills its entire site. The base of the block, however, is dematerialized with a glazed ground story: it looks as if the tower miraculously rests on thin planes of glass. Twin escalators lift you into a double-height, glass-walled atrium. The sensation is one of levity, suspension and translucence, yet the building remains human-scaled. The energy of the city\u2019s grid is carried right up onto the building\u2019s facade by the I-beams, which rise almost from street level. The architectural language is similar to Seagram, but Union Carbide\u2019s looser syntax results in a totally different, much more pragmatic compositional effect.\n\nAlong with Wallace Harrison\u2019s Time & Life Building, from 1957, and Eero Saarinen\u2019s CBS skyscraper, from 1964, which face each other on Sixth Avenue, Union Carbide and the Seagram Building exemplify the post-World War II cultural narrative: the United States\u2019 vision of itself as a savior of Western civilization and heir to the great traditions of antiquity.\n\nThis narrative was imparted through an aesthetic of massed shimmer. The totemic majesty of ancient monolithic architecture was joined with the limpidity of the glass curtain wall. These skyscraper colossi positioned postwar American corporations as gateways to the world\u2019s boundless resources and cultural treasures, which existed to be exploited, just as the buildings exploited the possibilities of epic form. Their noble, classicizing piers and temple-like porticos, which recall Greek and Roman architecture, and the soaring romantic I-beams, which recall the intricate ribbing of Gothic cathedrals, proclaimed that a democratic, capitalist country like the United States could carry on the traditions of a great civilization \u2014 \u201cAmerica\u2019s humanistic nationalism,\u201d as the religious scholar Martin E. Marty said at the time.\n\nWhen corporations or governments say they need to demolish an architecturally or historically significant building, it is almost always under the guise of needing more space. But there is also always an underlying ideological cause. The nature of capital, and its place in American culture, has changed. The Union Carbide tower will no doubt be replaced by an even more transparent, yet paradoxically completely opaque skyscraper of inhuman proportions that better represents the menacing ethics and aesthetics, and vague nature, of global finance.", "title": "Opinion | What We Will Lose When the Union Carbide Building Falls", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "The announcement at the White House on Thursday evening that President Trump will meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, within two months raises more questions than it answers. While the unpredictability of a meeting between these two unconventional leaders provides unique opportunities to end the decades-old conflict, its failure could also push the two countries to the brink of war.\n\nThe South Korean national security adviser, who had met with Mr. Kim in North Korea on Monday, made the announcement at the White House after meeting with Mr. Trump. He said that the North would consider denuclearization, agree to cease weapons testing for now and accept the start of the annual United States-South Korea military exercises this spring.\n\nAfter more than a year of heated rhetoric between the two leaders, and several North Korean missile tests, the United States and North Korea appeared headed for a collision course in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, last month. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s cold shoulder to the visiting North Korean dignitaries at the Games presaged for many that the temporary respite of sports diplomacy would give way to a dangerous military crisis. The temperature on the Korean Peninsula seems to have been lowered for now.\n\nWhile the South Korean government deserves credit for turning an impending crisis into an opportunity, there is no denying that Pyongyang\u2019s apparent change of heart stems partially from the economic bite of Mr. Trump\u2019s global sanctions, his so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign.

{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "The human heart of song and story is a changeable, if not fickle, thing. But in one crucial sense, the organ has been seen as immutable. Scientists long thought that mammalian hearts stop producing most of their new cells shortly after birth, and that when they grow bigger, they do so primarily because the size of their existing cells increases. A recent study in The Journal of Physiology, however, confirms that exercise can substantially increase the number of cells in the hearts of young lab rats \u2014 and it also indicates, for the first time, that these additional cells are still present in mature hearts.\n\nResearchers in Australia took young, healthy male rats and kept some of them sedentary while making others run on treadmills. This active cohort was divided into three groups, each of which began exercising at a different stage of life. In human terms, these starting points corresponded to childhood, adolescence and adulthood. After the rats were put through a month of daily hourlong workouts at a moderate pace, the hearts of some of them were examined microscopically. Exercise was then curtailed for the rest of the rats, which spent the next several months (roughly equivalent to 10 human years) inactive. Once they reached full adulthood, their hearts were also scrutinized.\n\nThe treadmillers had bigger hearts than their inactive counterparts, a finding expected by the researchers. Exercise makes hearts larger, more efficient and healthier. But the pathways to this change differed greatly depending on the rats\u2019 ages when they started running. Those that began exercising as adults had bigger cardiac-muscle cells but not more of them. The hearts of the childhood runners, though, teemed with about 20 million additional cardiomyocytes \u2014 the type of heart cell that contracts \u2014 compared with the hearts of the sedentary rats of the same age. The adolescent runners also showed small increases in the number of cardiomyocytes, but many fewer than the youngest runners gained. Perhaps most interesting, the extra heart cells found in both young and adolescent rats remained in their hearts after they reached adulthood, despite the cessation of exercise.\n\nThe study involved rodents, not people, so the findings shouldn\u2019t be overhyped, cautions Glenn Wadley, an associate professor in the Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition at Deakin University, who conducted the experiment with a graduate student, Yasmin Asif, and colleagues from the University of Melbourne and Monash University. But even so, the results do hint at human implications. A heart attack kills tens of millions of cells in an instant; a reserve of cardiac-muscle cells built up during childhood could conceivably affect the likelihood of surviving an attack as an adult, as well as influence how well a heart functions over the course of a lifetime. \u201cExercise is beneficial for the heart at any age,\u201d Wadley says. His study provides \u201ca new reason\u201d for people to be active when their hearts are still young and unburdened.", "title": "What Young Rats\u2019 Workouts Could Tell Us About the Human Heart", "authors": ["Gretchen Reynolds"]}

It\u2019s not the case, for instance, that the news media didn\u2019t cover President Trump\u2019s supporters or listen to their voices, or that reporters failed to visit the middle of the country. Scores of reporters have the datelines and airline receipts to prove it.\n\nFor me at least, the real problem of 2016 was a failure of imagination.\n\nMuch of campaign reporting is an exercise in imagination, informed by experience. You travel the country and talk to voters and activists and local officials, and you form a theory of what the electorate wants. You study public opinion and recent history to gauge which outcomes are possible and which are not. You meet candidates and size them up, on and off the record, assessing how knowledgeable, intellectually agile, and comfortable with criticism and combat they are.\n\nAnd you ask yourself: Can I imagine this person scrapping their way through a debate? Or negotiating with hardheaded legislators? Or empathizing with constituents who don\u2019t look like them?\n\nSometimes you misread a person.

{"date": "2018-03-03 00:00:00", "text": "For a counterexample of how a time of intense political bitterness can start to tear this country apart, look back exactly half a century to 1968. In that chaotic year, America slashed and clawed at itself amid the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the riots that followed; the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy as he ran for president; swelling antiwar demonstrations on college campuses amid growing recognition that the government had been lying about the course of the Vietnam War; and the police beatings of protesters in Chicago outside the Democratic National Convention.\n\nFactors like the draft and the race relations of the period made that tumultuous year a particular historical moment. But one difference between then and now is salient: Arguably, there was little reason to believe that the November 1968 election was likely to provide immediate relief.\n\nWe are lucky that so far 2018 does not look like a new 1968. But the relative calm may be like an unexploded bomb, its volatility not so much defused as contained by the thought that Trump Republicans will be punished in the Nov. 6 midterm elections. These expectations are widespread. After the big Democratic special election victories in places handily carried by Mr. Trump in 2016, from Virginia and Alabama to Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers in purple districts are retiring to avoid ending their careers in humiliating defeats.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, relish visions of a new congressional majority wielding its subpoena power to flay the Trump administration with oversight investigations. They can see it now: Making public Mr. Trump\u2019s hidden tax returns and otherwise laying bare any financial dealings between foreign governments and his businesses. Inviting the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct to testify at a televised hearing. Unearthing what his appointees have been doing in places like the Environmental Protection Agency, where collection of fines from polluters has plummeted.\n\nAlmost taking a House flip for granted, Democrats whisper that a tsunami-level wave would also flip the Senate and stop Mr. Trump\u2019s assembly line for turning conservative lawyers into life-tenured federal judges. Some even fantasize about impeachment.\n\nSuch vivid anticipation steers those sputtering at Mr. Trump's presidency to take deep breaths and bide their time until Nov. 6, which draws closer every day: The 2018 campaign cycle formally starts this week with primary voting in Texas.\n\nBut a significant Democratic wave may not materialize. Good economic news, for example, tends to blunt anti-incumbent sentiments. The country is still mostly using House districts that were redrawn after the 2010 census, just as Republicans\u2019 big 2010 midterm wave victory gave them an unusual degree of control over state legislatures. Beyond deliberate partisan gerrymandering, the impact of a Democratic turnout surge would be partly diluted by their voters\u2019 disproportionate concentration in cities, piling up extra votes in districts Republicans would have lost anyway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut inevitably, many eyes would turn to Russia. It appears to still be covertly spreading disinformation and amplifying tensions on American social media with the intention of having \u201can impact on the next election cycle,\u201d Mike Pompeo, the Central Intelligence Agency director, told Congress last month.\n\nAnother poll-defying election night surprise, like 2016\u2019s, would further fuel suspicions of unseen manipulation. After all, the public only later found out \u2014 apparently thanks to the National Security Agency contractor Reality Winner, whom the Justice Department is prosecuting for leaking \u2014 that shortly before the 2016 election, Russian hackers infiltrated the servers of an elections systems software supplier and tried to trick 122 state elections officials into downloading malware. While there is no evidence that Russian hackers tampered with Election Day results last time, the government has disclosed that it thinks they probed elections systems in 21 states and penetrated several.\n\n\u201cThere should be no doubt that Russia perceives its past efforts as successful and views the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations,\u201d Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, recently testified. \u201cThroughout the entire community, we have not seen any evidence of any significant change from last year.\u201d\n\nAgainst that backdrop, disappointed Trump opponents will be primed to believe the worst: that Russia rigged two elections in a row for Republicans. And if their anticipatory catharsis and faith in the democratic process evaporates, the anger could seek a different outlet \u2014 in turn risking a backlash from Trump supporters and a downward spiral.\n\nThe White House\u2019s approach to issues raised by Russian election meddling has been backward-looking, minimizing the problem in a way that seems to preclude focusing on protecting the country from future threats. Preoccupied with defending the legitimacy of the 2016 results, Mr. Trump repeatedly insists not only that his campaign did not collude with Moscow, but also that Russia\u2019s effort to torque that election was either \u201ca made-up story\u201d or had no impact on the outcome. Asked recently whether Mr. Trump has specifically directed the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the N.S.A. to take actions to confront and blunt continuing Russian influence operations, their respective directors testified that the president has not done so.\n\nIntelligence community leaders say their agencies are nevertheless trying to mitigate the risk, helping states strengthen cyberdefenses and hinting at other, classified steps. Such efforts to bolster the credibility of the election system are crucial, but may prove insufficient if there is another expectation-defying result.\n\nThree days after the directors\u2019 testimony, the Justice Department announced that a grand jury had indicted a group of Russians accused of running the social media manipulation operation. The unsealed indictment quoted internal Russian documents obtained by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. In them, the Russians were said to have described the original stated goal of what they called \u201cinformation warfare against the United States of America,\u201d before it morphed into helping Mr. Trump win, as spreading mistrust toward \u201cthe American political system in general.\u201d\n\nThis November, if the wave turns out to be a mere trickle, we could see the accomplishment of that goal take hold.", "title": "What if Republicans Win the Midterms?", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"]}

I looked at the puzzle from time to time, but couldn\u2019t manage to get eight entries into one puzzle. I concluded it couldn\u2019t be done, but then I was trying to fit all entries horizontally. I revisited the idea and came up with something I could make work by making two of the entries vertical. I had had four unthemed puzzles published in The New York Times by this time, but no themed ones, although I\u2019ve had many themed puzzles published elsewhere. My efforts were an inconsistent mix of easy and difficult entries and clues.\n\nI contacted Andrea Carla Michaels because I felt I needed help from someone who has a lot of experience with devising an early-week puzzle. In a lengthy exchange of approximately 70 emails, we honed the puzzle until we got something we felt was worth submitting. We considered ROY G. BIV as the reveal (\u201cMnemonic for remembering a list of seven of which the starred entries all contain elements\u201d), but went back to RAINBOW.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we think the final version contains a minimum of difficult entries.\n\nAndrea Carla Michaels: Although Michael Wiesenberg and I have yet to meet in person, I have a soft spot for him because my father\u2019s name was Michael Eisenberg, so I felt an instant kinship.\n\nWe have been corresponding for almost 10 years since meeting virtually on cruciverb.com.

I reviewed some of his back burner ideas to see if there were ones that were salvageable or would complement our disparate styles and strengths. I\u2019m super proud of this effort.\n\nI was in awe that Michael could get eight theme entries into a Monday!

At the beginning, I was surprised to be criticized by fellow activists because I was not a Mexican immigrant. I did not have to walk across the border; my family came to this country from Ecuador on an airplane, with a tourist visa. My parents bought an apartment before we arrived. Because I was more privileged than many others, I tried to put them front and center when reporters came to talk to us. Learning to give up your seat so others can have a voice helps legitimize and strengthen your movement.\n\nThis is very important for the Parkland teenagers, many of whom are white and well off \u2014 the kind of kids the news media typically pays the most attention to. They have met with students from Chicago, where young people have long been speaking out about gun violence without much national attention. But they can and ought to do more.\n\nAt the same time, as a woman, I also knew I had to speak out, because my voice was often ignored. One day, two male reporters asked me, \u201cWhere are the students who are walking?\u201d\n\nI smiled and said, \u201cI am one of them, how can I help you?\u201d\n\nThey looked at me and said, \u201cNo, the people who are walking, where are the boys?\u201d\n\nThis kept on happening. Maybe they didn\u2019t think a woman could walk 18 miles a day, or maybe they thought that because I was overweight, I couldn\u2019t possibly do this. After a CNN interview during which I had to force myself into the conversation, I shared what I had been experiencing with my fellow walkers. They decided that from then on, I would be the first person to speak at events.\n\nPerhaps the hardest thing about being part of a youth movement is transitioning out of it. I am now 33. It\u2019s been 17 years since the introduction of the Dream Act, and still it has not passed. Part of me feels like I have failed.\n\nI am still involved, but not at the forefront of the fight. I realized I could no longer go days without sleep, working on strategy and giving interviews. I needed a succession plan. And I wanted to help mentor other smart and motivated young people. Perhaps the Parkland students will be luckier than we were, and will see stricter gun control enacted before they hit their 30s. But if not, they will have to pass on the baton.

Such is the starting point of \u201cThe Insult,\u201d a film by Ziad Doueiri, which is up for an Academy Award in the foreign-language category on Sunday.\n\nMatters could have ended there.

And not in the real Lebanon either: Some weeks back, just a few months before the next general election is expected to be held, another insult set the country ablaze.\n\nIn late January a video appeared online showing Gebran Bassil, the foreign minister (and the president\u2019s son-in-law), calling Nabih Berri, the speaker of the National Assembly, a \u201cthug.\u201d Some streets of Beirut broke out into scenes that could have been lifted from the movie: angry youth, blocked roads, burning tires \u2014 as ever, the specter of civil strife.

The 13th National People\u2019s Congress has promised to accelerate the reform program once more, with a renewed commitment to put \u201cthe market\u201d at the center of the economy. We will see.\n\nPerhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.\n\nChina has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.\n\nAnd as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.\n\nFor these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nOver time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.\n\nNone of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China, a quarter of a century ago.

Tejal Rao has a beautiful riff about dried beans in The New York Times Magazine right now, about how she traffics beans home from her travels around the world, \u201cauntie-style, rolled up in old plastic bags, concealed between the folded clothes in my suitcase.\u201d\n\nThe essay conspires to make obvious a great plan for this weekend, the last before Easter and the start of Passover, too. Cook beans and then either make Tejal\u2019s new recipe for beans and garlic toast in broth (above) or the old one that exists in her memory and prose: red beans \u201ccooked simply with crushed tomatoes and a mash of ginger, garlic and green chiles, with a glug of cream added somewhere near the far end of cooking and a pile of chopped cilantro on top.\u201d\n\nPut that on rice and leave me alone. That\u2019s my Saturday night right there. Me and Dua Lipa: \u201cNew Rules.\u201d\n\nThough maybe we\u2019ll get some grill time going this weekend as well, first of the season for us in New York: chicken wings bathed in oak or apple smoke, maybe a spice-rubbed fillet of salmon as well, alongside grilled broccoli, a couple of grilled leeks.

I\u2019m just back from Florida, where I spoke to chefs in Miami, caught a huge tarpon in Everglades National Park and spent a perfect evening on the southwest coast cooking my in-laws chicken shawarma in the Ronco rotisserie oven that they drag out of storage when I visit because rotisserie is really the best way to make shawarma, every time.

I wrote about it for The Times this week, in an \u201cEat\u201d column with the headline \u201cMost House Salads Are Terrible. Make Yours Shockingly Superb.\u201d It\u2019s what Iacono calls a \u201cbottom of the bowl\u201d salad, the dressing reminiscent of what\u2019s left after a long dinner with family and there are just a few slices of tomato left alongside an olive or two, a slice of red onion, all of it marinating in red-wine vinegar and oil.\n\nAt the restaurant, he layers the tomatoes above and below cold, crisp lettuce, adds a final drizzle of dressing and serves the salad with a meatball on top. But the salad goes as well plain alongside a pizza or under sausage that\u2019s been simmered in sauce, with stuffed shells or lasagna or eggplant Parm. You don\u2019t need fancy tomatoes or lettuce with bona fides, just strong vinaigrette and enough time to allow the tomatoes to bleed out in it before you assemble the salad and serve.", "title": "What to Cook This Weekend", "authors": []}

It is time to corn the beef.\n\nYou can simmer the result with vegetables next Saturday or make Irish tacos (above) instead. It\u2019s an easy business to do the corning, and the process will deliver far better meat than you may recall from past holidays or meals at McGillicuddy\u2019s.

Samin calls her sweets brown-butter mochi cakes (above), and wrote about the process of discovering them in The Times this week. Brown-butter mochi cakes prove to be the best kind of recipe, the sort that leaves you wondering how something so complex and delicious turns out to be so simple to make.\n\nAnd Sunday isn\u2019t just Easter, remember. It\u2019s also April Fools\u2019 Day, and the best day of the year to make and serve and yap about Rozanne Gold\u2019s insane and actually delicious recipe for a cherry cola-chocolate-mayonnaise-sauerkraut cake.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "In 2015, it was a tossup between \u201cBoyhood\u201d and the eventual winner, \u201cBirdman.\u201d In 2016, with lots of experts betting on \u201cThe Revenant\u201d or \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d the prize went to \u201cSpotlight.\u201d Last year, nearly all the forecasters declared \u201cLa La Land\u201d the presumptive winner, and for two and a half minutes, they were correct, before an envelope snafu was revealed and the rightful winner, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d was crowned.\n\nThis year, awards watchers are unequally divided between \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d the favorite, and, \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d (which is the Bagger\u2019s prediction), with a few forecasting a Hail Mary win for \u201cGet Out.\u201d\n\nBut all of those films have historical Oscar-voting patterns against them. \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d has 13 nominations, more than any other film, and was also named the year\u2019s best by the producers\u2019 and directors\u2019 guilds. Yet it was not nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble; and no film has won best picture without previously landing at least the actors\u2019 nomination since \u201cBraveheart,\u201d in 1996. This year, the best ensemble SAG ended up going to \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d which is significant because actors make up the academy\u2019s largest branch; that film, while divisive, also won the best drama Golden Globe and the Bafta. But its filmmaker, Martin McDonagh, was not nominated for best director, and apart from \u201cArgo,\u201d movies that land best picture without also earning best director nominations are few and far between.\n\nMeanwhile, many viewers feel that the year\u2019s best film was \u201cGet Out.\u201d While the academy\u2019s influx of younger, more diverse members might have helped the film secure nominations for best picture, director, actor and original screenplay, no film has won best picture with fewer than five total nominations since \u201cCavalcade,\u201d from 1933, according to the movie maven Kristopher Tapley at Variety.\n\nEclipsed by all of this is Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk,\u201d which, in terms of worldwide box-office receipts, blew away the rest of the best picture nominee field. It earned $525.6 million worldwide; \u201cGet Out\u201d accounted for the next best haul, with $255 million. (The lowest earner of the bunch was \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d which took in $29 million globally.)\n\n\u201cDunkirk\u201d ought to have been a coup for Mr. Nolan. It was his most Oscar-minded film, told a historically pivotal story, was beautifully shot, and clocked in, mercifully, at two hours. But it didn\u2019t have acting nominations, and on the awards circuit Mr. Nolan, who received his first directing nomination for this picture, could not outshine the jovial favorite, Guillermo del Toro, who showed up to at least one party toting a case of tequila. When Mr. Nolan\u2019s \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was snubbed in the best picture and director categories in 2009, that outrage led the academy to expand the top prize to 10 nominees, from five; but it looks like Mr. Nolan\u2019s Oscar dreams will, yet again, be deferred.\n\nAnd while the acting categories are pretty much sewn up by baby boomers \u2014 Frances McDormand, Gary Oldman and Allison Janney \u2014 and one Gen-Xer, Sam Rockwell, this year\u2019s nominations made winners out of a new generation of actors, bringing to the world\u2019s attention the talents of Daniel Kaluuya (\u201cGet Out\u201d), who went on to star in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, the young lead of \u201cCall My by Your Name\u201d who, by several accounts, gave the best performance of 2017. Margot Robbie\u2019s nomination cements her graduation from the ing\u00e9nue holding pen, not that really she needed it; she is starring as Elizabeth I in the forthcoming \u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d across from her fellow best actress nominee, Saoirse Ronan, who, at 23, is already considered a great.", "title": "What to Expect (and Not Expect) at the Oscars", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "Here\u2019s a look at what economists and money managers are expecting:\n\nJan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs: \u201cPublic remarks by Fed officials suggest a broad shift in the committee\u2019s outlook towards a potentially faster pace of tightening, and we expect the median dot to show four hikes in 2018, up from three at the December meeting. Additional hawkish changes\u2014a move to three hikes in 2019 or an increase in the longer-run funds rate estimates\u2014are also possible but not our base case.\u201d\n\nMichelle Meyer, Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Ms. Meyer says she expects the Fed raise rates this meeting, but \u201cunlike December where there were two dissents, we expect this decision to be unanimous given the shift in voters this year in the hawkish direction. The focus will be on the evolution of the dots: we look for the median to hold at three hikes for this year, but to shift up from two to three hikes in 2019. We also think the long-run dot will edge up to 2.875%. This would show a Fed that is more confident about its ability to deliver rate hikes, but without an urgency to front-load the tightening.\u201d\n\nIan Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Powell \u201cis bound to be faced with questions along the lines of \u201cWhy are you not raising the dots in the wake of the substantial, unfunded fiscal easing?\u201d. His reply, we suspect, will be something like: \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to tell Congress how to conduct fiscal policy, and it\u2019s too soon to assess the impact of the tax cuts and spending increases. Much of the easing of policy could be saved rather than spent, and there are encouraging signs that productivity is picking up, so any upturn in wage growth as a result of fiscal loosening need not necessarily generate higher inflation. In any event, with inflation well below target, gradual normalization is the best way to balance the risks of both future inflation and the premature ending of the cycle via excessive tightening.\u201d\n\nStephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont: \u201cThe bulk of the interest in this week\u2019s F.O.M.C. meeting will come from the updated dot and economic projections as well as any meaningful tweaks to the key elements of the F.O.M.C. statement. Any changes to the dots and statement language are likely to be in the hawkish direction, though I would expect that the new information will be more evolutionary than a radically different.\u201d\n\nSteve Rick, CUNA Mutual Group: There is \u201ca very strong case for not only raising rates this week, but potentially doing so in a more aggressive manner than previously forecasted at the end of 2017. I think we could see projections get updated to call for four hikes instead of three, with plans for lifting rates more in coming years as well.\u201d\n\nChris Zaccarelli, Independent Advisor Alliance: \u201cWhether we have 3 or 4 rate hikes this year shouldn\u2019t be that big of a difference to the economy, but it WILL have a big impact on market prices and market psychology. Every statement \u2013 whether spoken or written \u2013 will be highly scrutinized looking for clues as to whether the Fed Funds rate will be 1% higher (or only 75 bps) a year from now.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump, tariffs and the G20\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security.\n\nIn an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced \u201crelatively quickly.\u201d\n\nMr. Mnuchin said:\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don\u2019t think anything should be a surprise. This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States\u2019 national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.\n\nCountries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds. Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nPhoto\n\nPressure continues to mount on Facebook.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy, reports Cecilia Kang of the NYT.\n\nThe probe comes after reports that information on 50 million users was improperly obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.\n\nThe investigation, started in recent days, adds to the mounting pressureagainst Facebook in the United States and in the United Kingdom about its handling of the data. Cambridge Analytica used the information to help President Trump\u2019s presidential campaign profile voters during the 2016 election.\n\nThe F.T.C. and Facebook reached a settlement in 2011 after the agency accused the company of deceiving customers \u201cby telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public,\u201d according to a statement at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFacebook could face fines of thousands of dollars a day per violation if the commission finds Facebook violated terms of the settlement, Bloomberg reports.\n\nShares of Facebook are down 2.5 percent in early trading.\n\nFacebook\u2019s worst day in ages\n\nExhibit A: Its stock closed down nearly 7 percent, its worst performance in four years.\n\nExhibit B: Its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, plans to leave after disagreements about how much the company should share about misuse of its platform.

C.E.O.s without that protection might do more to tackle a big problem because it more directly threatens their job security.\n\nMore on Cambridge Analytica: An undercover investigation by Channel 4 News of Britain captured the firm\u2019s C.E.O., Alexander Nix, suggesting the entrapment of a potential client\u2019s political opponents with women and bribes.

For those that don\u2019t, membership in organizations like the American Society of Home Inspectors can give you some assurance about an inspector\u2019s professionalism.\n\nInterview potential inspectors before hiring one. Ask about their experience and whether they\u2019re familiar with the type of home you\u2019re buying. Find out what will be included in the inspection and report.\n\nWhat the Inspector Should Look At\n\nDuring a home inspection, the inspector should thoroughly evaluate the physical structure of the home as well as critical internal systems. You should make sure the examination includes the following:\n\n\u25cf Electrical system\n\n\u25cf Plumbing system\n\n\u25cf Heating and cooling systems\n\n\u25cf Radon detection equipment, if applicable\n\n\u25cf Walls, ceiling and flooring\n\n\u25cf Windows and doors\n\n\u25cf Roofing\n\n\u25cf Foundation\n\n\u25cf Basement\n\n\u25cf Attic\n\n\u25cf Insulation\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhile an inspection will give you an idea of a house\u2019s overall condition, it might not uncover hidden problems such as pests, mold or asbestos. It also won\u2019t turn up flaws in areas that are below ground or otherwise inaccessible to the inspector, like wells and septic tanks. To identify those types of problems, you\u2019re going to need additional inspections.\n\nFor example, a Wood Destroying Insect Inspection can identify termites, carpenter ants and other pests. \u201cMore than 30 states require a pest inspection before a home loan can close,\u201d Leslie Wyman, the owner of Epcon Lane, a pest control company said. \u201cBut even if you live in a state where it\u2019s optional, it\u2019s a really important safeguard.\u201d\n\nWhat Should You Do During the Inspection?\n\nYou should make every effort to be present when the inspection is taking place. You can follow the inspector around the house and ask questions so you can learn more about your potential new home. If you can\u2019t make it for the inspection, you should meet with the inspector to go over the report in detail.\n\nIf you have questions about potential issues or how to take care of parts of the home, feel free to ask the evaluator. Take care, however, not to get in the inspector\u2019s way. Don\u2019t start inspecting the home yourself, either. If you test a sink while the inspector is testing a shower, for example, you might alter the results.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that \u201can inspection is only a snapshot in time on the day of the inspection,\u201d said John Bodrozic, a co-founder of HomeZada. So if you\u2019re buying a house in the middle of summer, try to consider how the home might perform in different conditions, like the winter or fall.\n\nA Home\u2019s Report Card\n\nOnce the inspector completes an evaluation, you will receive a report with the inspector\u2019s findings. Don\u2019t be alarmed if you see a lot of deficiencies noted. Home inspections are detailed, so reports often include between 50 and 100 issues, most of which are relatively small.\n\nThe report should include information about how severe each listed problem is, plus estimates on how much it would cost to fix each problem. Ask the inspector for clarifications on this if necessary.\n\nIf the inspection finds more problems than you\u2019re comfortable dealing with, you can choose to back out of the sale or try to negotiate to have the seller make the repairs or lower the price. If you\u2019re satisfied with the condition of the home or the shape it will be in after the seller meets the arrangements of your negotiations, you can move into your new home with more peace of mind.", "title": "What to Expect From a Home Inspection", "authors": ["Megan Wild"]}

Also, property taxes previously had no limits in being deductible against federal income tax, but now the deduction of property and other state and local taxes is capped at $10,000.\n\nBoth provisions will most affect upper- and upper-middle-income families in states with relatively high housing prices and high state and local taxes: Think Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California.\n\nFor example, a married couple in Connecticut with a $300,000 annual income aiming to borrow $1 million toward a $1.2 million house would be able to deduct about $33,000 in mortgage interest in the first year of their loan, compared with about $44,000 under the previous law. Because they would be in the 24 percent federal marginal tax bracket, buying that house would cost them about $2,650 more in the first year of the mortgage after taxes than under previous law.\n\nMoreover, that family\u2019s state income tax obligations would push them over the $10,000 deductibility limit on their own, meaning the family would effectively lose the ability to deduct property taxes of around $22,000 a year, depending on the jurisdiction. That represents another reduction of this family\u2019s tax advantage from homeownership by about $5,000 a year.\n\n(Our hypothetical family may not be losing out as much as those numbers suggest because they would have faced the alternative minimum tax under the old tax system \u2014 evidence of just how complex these calculations can be.)\n\nEven people whose mortgages are well below $750,000, or who are in lower-tax states, may find the tax law could shift the incentives for buying compared with renting. The new law roughly doubles the standard deduction that all households can take, to $24,000 for a married couple, which means that more households will find that they get no net tax savings from taking on a mortgage. They are better off just taking the larger standard deduction whether they buy or rent.\n\nOver all, Moody\u2019s Analytics estimates that the tax law will reduce home transaction prices by 4 percent, a number that reflects both the direct impact of tax changes and higher interest rates caused by larger deficits.", "title": "What to Expect From the Housing Market This Spring", "authors": []}

Since we can\u2019t magic away the inconvenience of carrying a bag around, the next best thing is a convertible bag that\u2019s flexible enough for different needs. Ms. Misra suggests the Patagonia Lightweight Travel Tote, which transforms into a backpack to carry a change of clothes and water bottle if you\u2019ll be out all day, converts back into a tote for walking between shops and restaurants, and (while Ms. Misra notes that doesn\u2019t come with a vanishing spell) it can be packed down into its own pocket when empty.\n\nSun protection. \u201cA hat with a bill to shade your face is essential,\u201d noted Ms. Glusac.

In \u201cEx Gurus,\u201d her first commercial gallery solo in New York, Ms. Verzutti uses raw bronze, gold in color, as canvas; combines papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with concrete; and in \u201cCemetery Inline,\u201d makes a bumpy Carl Andre floor piece resembling a ragtag row of tombstones from chunks of cobblestone, unbaked clay and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 with color added. More subtly, Ms. Verzutti pits the translucence of oil paint against the implacable opacity of acrylic.\n\nThis contrast is especially evident in \u201cFloral,\u201d where the shapes of a wilting flower and perhaps a beehive carved into the surface of raw bronze, are veiled in blue or yellow; dots of acrylic jump all around them like bees. Ms. Verzutti usually creates a specific physical place for color in her bronze surfaces (see the extremely satisfying \u201cAstrology\u201d). Except when she doesn\u2019t: In \u201cHomeopatia,\u201d arguably the show\u2019s star, lozenge-shaped indentations of brilliant color dot the raw bronze surface while other lozenges are painted flat on the surface, which creates strange spatial ambiguities. It resembles a painter\u2019s palette and an entomologist\u2019s beetle collection.\n\nDespite Ms. Verzutti\u2019s love of color, her mind seems alive with sculpture. Past works have referred to Robert Gober and Jeff Koons. \u201cDias da Semana\u201d evokes some of Brancusi\u2019s sexier sculptures while also \u2014 seen from a certain angle \u2014 recalling her penchant for casting fruits and vegetables. In two dark bronze reliefs named \u201cWitch\u201d and \u201cPilates\u201d she drags little stones or clumps of bronze down the surface, creating deep ruts and leaving the forming implements in place. They\u2019re mini-earthworks that pay tribute to the Italian artist Lucio Fontana.

Meredith Ward Fine Art, 44 East 74th Street, Suite G, Manhattan; 212-744-7306, meredithwardfineart.com.\n\nThis show brings the painter Edith Schloss (1919-2011) one step closer to the small but definite niche that is her due. Following a larger, somewhat confusing retrospective at the Sundaram Tagore Gallery in 2015, this show, \u201cBy the Sea,\u201d zeros in on her best work: a group of small, delightful still lifes from the 1960s and \u201970s. They were made in Italy, to which Schloss decamped for good in 1964, after about 18 years of marriage to the photographer/filmmaker Rudy Burckhardt and active participation in the nascent downtown New York art scene.\n\nThese paintings make good on Schloss\u2019s longtime interest in still life, partly by taking cues from the painters Cy Twombly and Giorgio Morandi, both of whom she knew in Italy. The canvases feature a set cast of vases, pitchers and occasional toys (her son\u2019s) that Schloss was never without, even when traveling. She would fill the vessels with blooms \u2014 thick circles in hearty shades of blue, orange or red balanced by whites and pinks and sometimes by patches of bare canvas. Especially in paintings from 1967 and \u201968 titled \u201cRignalla\u201d and \u201cOn the Ledge\u201d from 1976, she lines up the vases on a high horizon, giving them a personable lean and monumental scale reminiscent of Philip Guston\u2019s late works. In others, the bouquets line the bottom edge of the canvas or paper, as if on a windowsill overlooking a beach or the sea stretching beyond. At this point in her life, Schloss painted with consummate ease and abundant charm, sketching in her subjects and then applying color as needed. But don\u2019t be fooled. Her best works are primers on the shortest route to a good, original painting.\n\nROBERTA SMITH\n\nThomas Demand\n\nThrough April 7. Matthew Marks, 523 West 24th Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com.\n\nPhoto\n\nThomas Demand is a hybrid photographer. He trained as a sculptor and is best known for making cardboard and paper models of momentous events and politically charged sites \u2014 the meager kitchen in Saddam Hussein\u2019s last hide-out in Iraq or the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan \u2014 and photographing them to look deceptively realistic. In his current show at Matthew Marks, however, Mr. Demand shifts his primary focus to recreating photographs taken with his cellphone.\n\nIn the front gallery the walls are covered with gray wallpaper depicting school or workplace lockers (overtones, perhaps inadvertently, of American school shootings). Two videos shown on monitors suspended from the ceiling and a handful of photographs reproduce saccharine or banal subjects that Mr. Demand photographed with his cellphone: a red bow tied to a fence; a box with electrical wiring; blinking stoplights and balloons attached to a plastic clip. In the rear gallery are three large photographs in Mr. Demand\u2019s recognizable style, depicting the ruins of an unidentified bombardment, the interior of a barracks tent and the warmly lit workshop of a Bavarian violin maker \u2014 all near-perfectly sculpted in cardboard and paper and photographed.\n\nThe cellphone-derived works, titled \u201cDailies,\u201d are not as dramatic or captivating as the historical scenes. And yet, they accurately depict the present, merging Mr. Demand\u2019s anesthetized aesthetic with a world in which people are attached to their smartphones, capturing images they will never look at again. In this sense, Mr. Demand memorializes the banal and the forgotten with the same painstaking care he gives to more charged moments in history and suffuses the \u201cDailies\u201d with an uncanny absurdity and pathos.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMARTHA SCHWENDENER\n\nCarissa Rodriguez\n\nThrough April 2. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens; 718-361-1750, sculpture-center.org.\n\nPhoto\n\nConstantin Brancusi made an iconic, egg-shaped marble head, which he called \u201cLe Nouveau N\u00e9\u201d (\u201cThe Newborn\u201d), in 1915. In 1993, Sherrie Levine made a mold of the piece for a show at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which owns it, and subsequently cast versions in foggy white crystal and black sandblasted glass. Carissa Rodriguez\u2019s new video, \u201cThe Maid,\u201d on view in the middle of SculptureCenter\u2019s main gallery, visits several of these casts in the richly appointed collectors\u2019 homes and the sterile white warehouses on both coasts where they\u2019ve ended up. No people are visible, except for the gloved hands of two preparators and a cleaning woman seen through a window, and the only sound is minimal electronic music. In New York, the weather is snowy and dark; in Los Angeles, staggeringly bright.\n\nIf Ms. Levine\u2019s appropriation was a one-to-one critique of the male artist-hero mythos that congealed around Brancusi, Ms. Rodriguez\u2019s reframing would seem to be a critique of the old-fashioned matrix of money and power in which even Ms. Levine\u2019s feminist reversal was still inextricably embedded. But what makes the video not merely effective but strangely moving is its air of scientific detachment. Taking in both Ms. Levine\u2019s casts themselves and the tokens of wealth and access with which they\u2019re surrounded \u2014 Warhols, sports cars, snapshots of the Clintons \u2014 with the same impartial attention, Ms. Rodriguez makes the entire complex social phenomenon of art making and collecting seem as blindly mechanical as evolution. If there is a critique, it\u2019s in the suggestion that we could have dissolved our idols already just by looking at them more closely.\n\nWILL HEINRICH", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": ["Roberta Smith", "Holland Cotter", "Martha Schwendener", "Will Heinrich"]}
{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "The stated mission of this new TriBeCa project space, founded by a former partner at David Zwirner, is to exhibit artists who\u2019ve had significant foreign impact but little exposure in the United States. Its inaugural show certainly qualifies: This is the first American solo outing for Michel Parmentier (1938-2000), one of the most undeviating abstract painters of postwar France, whose radically simple paintings fused minimalism, performance and institutional critique.\n\nMr. Parmentier is best known as one-quarter of the swashbuckling but short-lived group known as B.M.P.T. (The letters stand for the last names of the artists Daniel Buren, Olivier Mosset, Mr. Parmentier and Niele Toroni.) I n 1967, its members voiced their intolerance for gestural abstraction by painting ultra-minimal canvases at a Paris salon \u2014 in Mr. Parmentier\u2019s case, horizontal stripes exactly 38 centimeters wide, done with spray paint \u2014 and then quickly withdrawing them from view. Four paintings here feature his trademark stripes, in blue or silver or red or black, spanning the unstretched canvas and bulging out from the wall; you can see the creases where he folded the canvas and the punctures where staples held it to his studio wall.\n\nMr. Parmentier broke from B.M.P.T. just a year after the group\u2019s debut; he gave up painting from 1968 to 1983. His second phase also comprises horizontal stripes on unstretched supports, but now he has used delicate paper rather than thick canvas, and composed the stripes with dense freehand marks in pastel, paintstick or pencil. These fragile later works are as dispassionate and skeptical of gesture as his early striped canvases, though instead of the extreme authorial abnegation of spray paint, here the handmade marks marry restraint and repetition with subtle individuality.\n\nFrench abstract painting of the 1960s, dismissed at the time by chauvinistic American critics, is having quite a moment in New York: Elsewhere in town now are exhibitions by Martin Barr\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois Morellet. But there is a particular satisfaction, in today\u2019s snapping and yapping New York art world, in rediscovering this most stringent painter of all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJASON FARAGO\n\nMadeline Hollander\n\nSaturdays from 2 to 6 p.m. through March 24. The Artist\u2019s Institute at Hunter College, 132 East 65th Street, Manhattan; theartistsinstitute.org.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe project notes for Madeline Hollander\u2019s \u201cNew Max\u201d are probably the best way to describe her current installation at the Artist\u2019s Institute at Hunter College. \u201cPerformance begins at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and dancers continuously hit a new maximum temperature each round.\u201d Lower on the page are directions for the four dancers to pause (\u201cdancers rest\u201d) before performing another of the 16 cycles in the work as the temperature in the room, controlled by four air-conditioning units, four heat sensors and four light panels, rises from a low of 65 degrees to a high of 85.\n\nIf \u201cNew Max,\u201d which clearly descended from 1960s systems-based artwork, sounds dry, it is not. The four young dancers, clad in stylish silver boxing shorts, specially designed black chemises and Keds sneakers, perform a series of movements choreographed by Ms. Hollander that fall somewhere between an Yvonne Rainer sequence and stuff you\u2019d do in an exercise class. (Many dancers make their living teaching various types of Pilates-Yoga-Gyrotonics, which inevitably surface in their choreography.) The overall impression is of a 21st-century version of the graces in Botticelli\u2019s \u201cPrimavera\u201d (1477-1482), but here dancing is a form of mechanized labor rather than a lyric pleasure.\n\nThe performance-installation gains further heft from a smart essay by A. E. Benenson, printed for visitors on thermal paper, as if it were a long drugstore receipt. The essay touches on the history of air-conditioners, climate change and the alt-surrealist Georges Bataille\u2019s musings on energy and consumption. \u201cHeat is the universe\u2019s choreography,\u201d the essay states, concluding that \u201cwe have built a kind of planetary-scale air-conditioner. It\u2019s just stuck facing wrong-side-out,\u201d with greenhouse gas trapped with us inside. Meanwhile, Ms. Hollander\u2019s graces dance silently before you in the slowly rising heat of the room.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Aperture Foundation, 547 West 27th Street, fourth floor, Manhattan; 212-505-5555, aperture.org.\n\nAperture Foundation often produces exhibitions to complement issues of its photography quarterly, Aperture magazine. Such is the case with \u201cPrison Nation,\u201d a stirring show about mass incarceration in the United States, with the historian Nicole R. Fleetwood doing double duty as curator and issue editor.\n\nBetween what\u2019s on the wall and what\u2019s in print there\u2019s a lot of history. In the magazine, the lawyer Bryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery, Ala., and author of the 2014 memoir \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d traces the disproportionate degree of African-American incarceration back to 18th-century slavery, when American citizenship was restricted to property-owning white men. And in photographs in the show from the 1960s and \u201970s by the folklorist Bruce Jackson, we see 20th-century East Texas prison farms that were, in effect, cotton plantations that used racially segregated forced labor.\n\nFar from being coolly documentary, though, many of the images in the show are personal. The artist Jamel Shabazz, renowned for his images of contemporary black street fashion, and his fellow New York photographer Lorenzo Steele Jr., both worked as correction officers on Rikers Island in the 1980s. Their on-the-job pictures of colleagues offer a counterweight to the usually negative view of prison staff.\n\nAnd, in general, the show gives a warmer image of prison life than we\u2019re accustomed to seeing: in Jack Lueders-Booth\u2019s beautiful 1970s color portraits of inmates at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution-Framingham, one of the oldest women\u2019s prisons in the country; in Lucas Foglia\u2019s images of prisoners tending to Rikers Island flower gardens; in the artwork created from soap bars and newsprint photographs by a former inmate, Jesse Krimes; and in Deborah Luster\u2019s extraordinary, monumental 2013 portraits of prisoners dressed for roles in an Easter passion play in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.\n\nThe humanizing perspective of \u201cPrison Nation\u201d is deeply moving and long overdue. It\u2019s crucial to remember, though, the unforgiving realities of incarceration. A majority of the prisoners at Angola, which is built on the site of several former slave plantations, are serving life sentences, either by judicial decision or by default. According to a text accompanying Ms. Luster\u2019s photographs, some 90 percent of inmates who enter Angola, at whatever age, for whatever crime, are expected to die there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHOLLAND COTTER", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": ["Roberta Smith", "Will Heinrich", "Jason Farago", "Martha Schwendener", "Holland Cotter"]}

The anti-establishment and populist movement has capitalized on widespread disaffection for Italy\u2019s traditional parties.\n\nThe main issues and promises\n\nPhoto\n\nThough Italy has one of the lowest percentages of migrants per capita in Europe, immigration emerged as the campaign\u2019s major theme. The issue was highlighted by an act of violence last month: the shooting of six African migrants by a right-wing sympathizer who ran with the League in a local election.\n\nCandidates across the political spectrum have played up fears of immigrants in Italy, a country that has struggled with a wave of people arriving by the Mediterranean in search of a better life. Recent polls indicated that 70 percent of Italians were concerned about safety, partly because of fears of undocumented migrants.\n\nAnother major concern was the economy. Even as Italy has seen a slight uptick in growth over the past year, the national debt is at 130 percent of the gross domestic product, the second-highest level in the euro area, after Greece. But campaign speeches had mostly steered clear of any belt-tightening measures that might be required to lower that debt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Support in for the bloc\u2019s common currency is among the lowest in Europe, and there is a lingering nostalgia for the lira, which some parties, including Forza Italia, have considered reintroducing.\n\nThe turnout\n\nPhoto\n\nItalians generally vote in large numbers, but the turnout on Sunday \u2014 a little over 71 percent, according to the Italian Interior Ministry \u2014 was a decrease from the 75 percent turnout in 2013 and 80 percent in 2008.\n\nPolls had suggested there would be higher abstention rates on Sunday than in previous elections, except among those who back the Five Star Movement. The number of undecided voters has reached a record high, estimated at 30 percent to 40 percent, with many women among them.\n\nVoters cast ballots for a candidate, a party or a coalition. The vote will determine the 945 members of Parliament, as well as the party or coalition that will run the country for the next five years.\n\nWhat happens after the election\n\nPhoto\n\nPreliminary results based on exit polls will be released on national television and news websites. Official results will be available on Monday.\n\nBut it will take weeks before the next Italian government is sworn in. The new Parliament will hold its first session on March 23 and will vote to elect the speakers of the Lower House and the Senate, a first litmus test to gauge the political majority.\n\nAfter that, Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, will start consultations to see which party or grouping in Parliament has the consensus to win a confidence vote.\n\nAfter hearing from the parties, Mr. Mattarella will ask a lawmaker to try to form a government.\n\nIf no clear winner, with a certain majority, emerges from the election, Mr. Mattarella could confer an \u201cexploratory mandate\u201d to a lawmaker, or even the speakers of the two houses, to see if a broad coalition might be possible.\n\nIn case of a stalemate, the president could envision a nonelected person chosen on the basis of expertise in forming a government.

The scene pays homage to the nationalist grit expressed through Churchill\u2019s speech to the House of Commons \u2014 \u201cWe shall go on to the end,\u201d and so on \u2014 but it also keys into the experience of an individual soldier (James McAvoy), who can think only about getting back to the woman he loves (Keira Knightley). Based the novel by Ian McEwan, \u201cAtonement\u201d has the elegance and sweep of a classic wartime romance, in which the emotion intensifies with each falling bomb.

Produced for HBO and the BBC, \u201cThe Gathering Storm\u201d catches up with Churchill six years earlier, when he was plugging away on a biography on the Duke of Marlborough at his home in Chartwell, in rural Kent.\n\nAs the title suggests, the film is about Churchill\u2019s growing alarm over German rearmament under Adolf Hitler and his difficult return to relevance, aided by government officials like Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) who share his concerns and reject the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). Albert Finney won an Emmy for his dyspeptic Churchill \u2014 as did Brendan Gleeson\u2019s Churchill in the lesser 2009 sequel, \u201cInto the Storm\u201d\u2014 and Vanessa Redgrave lends fine support as his wife, Clemmie, whose faith in her husband sometimes wavers dramatically.\n\nClick to read about four other complementary movies.\n\n\u2018Dunkirk\u2019\n\nA scene from \u201cDunkirk.\u201d Warner Bros.

If you value \u201cDunkirk\u201d as much as the Academy does, here are a few streamable films that are bound to resonate, whether in story or aesthetic.\n\n\u2018Dunkirk\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk\u201d is not a remake of this 1958 British film from director Leslie Norman, though it bears the same title and portrays the same event. Norman\u2019s version is a far more conventional telling of the Dunkirk evacuation, done in a traditional style, with none of the shifting time frames of Nolan\u2019s interpretation. It is, however, a tightly crafted, hard-nosed war picture, told mostly through the eyes of two protagonists: one a British soldier (John Mills) awaiting evacuation from Dunkirk beach, the other a British reporter (Bernard Lee), who covers the events and then leads the charge of civilian boats assisting the rescue. It may not be as formally flamboyant as Nolan\u2019s telling, but it\u2019s a brilliant antecedent.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Battle of Britain\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBarely a month after the Dunkirk Evacuation, the Royal Air Force\u2019s extended defense of Britain from German Luftwaffe began. That campaign, which lasted nearly four months, is the basis of this 1969 war film from director Guy Hamilton. Hamilton was best known for such classic Bond films as \u201cGoldfinger\u201d and \u201cDiamonds Are Forever,\u201d and his work here is less winking but just as technically impressive; the large-scale flying and battle sequences are spectacular, their scale, scope and intensity not unlike those in Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk.\u201d\n\nBut Hamilton pays just as much attention to his human interactions. The all-star cast (which includes Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, Christopher Plummer, Susannah York and Robert Shaw) shines, and the film takes great pains to include the perspective of German soldiers and officers, rather than paint them as background cartoon villains. That choice lends \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d a moral complexity that helps it transcend the usual war movie conventions \u2014 much as \u201cDunkirk\u201d does.\n\n0\n\nClick here to read about four other complementary movies.\n\n\u2018Get Out\u2019\n\nAllison Williams and Daniel Kaluuya in \u201cGet Out.\u201d Justin Lubin/Universal Pictures\n\nAhead of this film\u2019s release last year, director Jordan Peele programmed a retrospective in Brooklyn titled \u201cThe Art of the Social Thriller,\u201d which offered fans rare and direct insight into the films that influenced him.

Peele told The New York Times that the movie resonated with him in an extra way. \u201cYou could write an interesting essay about how the lead in \u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019 is a man living in fear every day,\u201d he said, \u201cso this is a challenge he is more equipped to take on than the white women living in the house.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Guess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA Civil Rights Era film with a social message, \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner\u201d follows a young doctor (Sidney Poitier) as he meets his white girlfriend\u2019s liberal parents (Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy) for the first time. Peele explained to GQ how the movie, released in 1967, influenced the awkward scenes in his film. One of the great things about \u201cGuess Who\u2019s Coming to Dinner,\u201d he noted, was that \u201canybody can relate to is the uncomfortableness of meeting your in-laws for the first time and being at a party where you\u2019re the outsider.\n\n\u201cSo the layer of race that enriches and complicates that tension\u201d in \u201cGet Out,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecomes relatable.

Huppert plays a director recovering from a stroke, who casts a famous con man (Kool Shen) in her new project, gets sucked into his mind games. The film is based on a similar event from Breillat\u2019s life, and the chemistry between the leads sells its story of a smart woman who gets scammed by a man she always knew was a scammer.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Dior and I\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix, Amazon Prime\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cWe decided early on that Reynolds Woodcock wasn\u2019t the greatest couturier in the world,\u201d Mark Bridges, who designed the Oscar-nominated costumes for \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d explained to Vogue.

Ehrlich and Goldsmith aren\u2019t only preoccupied with the specifics of the Papers (though they certainly cover those bases).

Grant and Russell\u2019s mile-a-minute, love-hate banter is priceless, but don\u2019t undervalue the snappy, wiseacre dialogue of the supporting players, a crew of seen-it-all newsmen who talk shop and swap lingo with growling, offhand wit.\n\nClick to read about five other complementary movies.\n\n\u2018The Shape of Water\u2019\n\nSally Hawkins with Doug Jones, as the Asset, in \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\nGuillermo del Toro isn\u2019t simply one of our most imaginative and innovative filmmakers; he\u2019s also an enthusiastic film historian and collector, so his films often function as both absorbing narratives and carefully curated exhibitions.

Advances in technology allow him to add a few notable bells and whistles, including moving gills and lights under his merman\u2019s skin, but the basic shape and face of the Asset is unmistakably close to the Gill Man\u2019s from \u201cBlack Lagoon.\u201d (The filmmaker said this about the Gill Man: \u201cI can only tell you I drew that monster all my childhood. It\u2019s the most beautiful monster, one of the top three ever made.\u201d) \u201cCreature\u201d also contains the seeds for the primary conflict in del Toro\u2019s film: the question of whether to preserve and study the aquatic creature (in the interest of science), or kill it (in the interest of safety and survival).\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Swamp Thing\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, YouTube\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nLike \u201cWater,\u201d Wes Craven\u2019s 1982 adaptation of the \u201cSwamp Thing\u201d series from DC Comics gives us government scientists working on top-secret projects, a creature from the deep, the beautiful woman who loves him and a winking sense of homage and self-awareness.

This idea of a citizen who blurts out uncomfortable truths about her small-town community recalls the \u201cpoison pen\u201d letters in the French melodrama \u201cLe Corbeau\u201d by Henri-Georges Clouzot, in which an anonymous whistle-blower nicknamed the Raven exposes local secrets including extramarital affairs and illegal abortions.

But Dr. Joshua C. Denny, a biomedical informatics researcher at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and co-author of the new study, suspected that it only revealed the tip of a genetic iceberg. Much larger databases including DNA and records for hundreds of thousands of people are being built, and searching them may uncover many more hidden mutations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole bunch else out there that we will discover,\u201d Dr. Denny said.\n\nHe and his colleagues gathered data from Vanderbilt\u2019s massive electronic health records system, which includes more than two million patients. More than 225,000 have signed up as volunteers for genetic research, allowing scientists to analyze their DNA.\n\nThe researchers picked out 21,701 patients from the database and surveyed all the symptoms recorded for each one. They then compared the symptoms to those seen in 1,204 Mendelian diseases.\n\nIt was a difficult task. These disorders can produce a number of symptoms, and each patient may have a different combination of them.\n\nAnd some symptoms linked to a Mendelian disease may also be signs of other diseases. Cystic fibrosis can cause asthma and recurrent infections, for instance \u2014 but those symptoms alone aren\u2019t enough to diagnose the disease.\n\nDr. Denny and his colleagues developed a scoring system to determine how likely it was that each patient in their study suffered each Mendelian disease. If a patient had a rare symptom linked to a disease, she scored a lot of points. A common symptom earned her far fewer points.\n\nThe researchers identified groups of people with symptoms strongly suggesting they shared a Mendelian disease. The researchers went on to examine the DNA of these patients to see if they also shared a mutation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Denny would have been happy just to find a few undiagnosed patients. Instead, the team found 807 patients carrying mutations in genes linked to 17 different diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or hemochromatosis, a disorder that causes iron to build up in the blood.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnly eight of these patients had gotten a test that revealed the mutation. In other cases, doctors had tested for the wrong disease and gotten a negative result. Many times, the doctors hadn\u2019t ordered any genetic tests at all.\n\nTypically, these disorders can be passed down in one of two ways. A dominant disease, like Huntington\u2019s, requires inheriting just one defective copy of a gene from a parent. Recessive diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, usually require two defective copies of the same gene.\n\nThe mutations that the scientists discovered often didn\u2019t fit the standard profile for the diseases. Many of the patients had conditions that are considered recessive, yet they carried a just single defective copy of the gene.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Two copies of the gene cause a disease known as primary hyperoxaluria, which can result in kidney failure in toddlers. The patients identified in the new study also suffered kidney problems \u2014 but not in the first few years of life.\n\nOne patient who turned up in their search had kidney stones at age 15. That\u2019s unusual \u2014 but apparently not enough to lead the patient\u2019s doctors to suspect primary hyperoxaluria.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as what we learned in high school genetics,\u201d Dr. Denny said.\n\nThese results are all the more surprising given how modest Dr. Denny\u2019s search was. He only looked for a limited number of mutations in a relatively small group of people, all of whom were of European descent. (Much of what is known about gene variants that cause disease was discovered by researching predominantly white populations.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised we found anything. The fact that we did means there\u2019s maybe a lot out there that we don\u2019t know,\u201d Dr. Denny said.\n\nHeidi L. Rehm, a molecular geneticist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital who was not involved in the study, said many doctors do not suspect that their patients are suffering from a Mendelian disorder unless they suffer severe textbook symptoms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey simply never order any genetic testing, and then you never develop an understanding that it\u2019s genetic to begin with,\u201d she said.\n\nOverlooking the genetic causes of diseases can seriously harm patients. \u201cThere are people here who had kidney and liver transplants that could potentially have been avoided,\u201d Dr. Denny said.\n\nUndiagnosed hemochromatosis, for example, can lead to liver failure. Of the 40 people Dr. Denny and his colleagues identified with hemochromatosis, four needed liver transplants.\n\nYet hemochromatosis can be readily treated by having patients donate blood on a regular basis, which helps rid them of excess iron.\n\nThe strategy employed by the research team was startlingly effective at identifying potential causes of disease. In the long run, Dr. Denny and Dr. Rehm agreed, the best solution might be to sequence the entire genome of every patient \u2014 in childhood, or even at birth.\n\nBut such a policy would create an unmanageable glut of genetic data.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to do that,\u201d Dr. Denny said.", "title": "What\u2019s Behind Many Mystery Ailments?

K-12 website, which includes This is Statistics, resources, professional development, student competitions, curriculum, courses and careers.\n\n_________\n\nUpdated: March 15, 2018\n\nWith a series of high-profile mass shootings (defined as indiscriminate, multiple killings by one shooter), researchers have been digging into data to see if they can find associations between number of mass shootings and some variable. Here, by country, we see the association between mass shootings and the number of guns for countries around the world. But, we could have also looked for associations between number of mass shootings and measures of violence, crime, racial divisions, mental health care, video games or strength of gun legislation. Statisticians have the tools to analyze all of these variables, if they have accurate data. Since 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors public health threats such as diseases, auto and food safety, and much more, has seen cuts to its funding for research into gun violence as a public health issue. Data for the United States is not complete and the same is probably true for other countries.\n\nAcknowledging these limitations, the two graphs come from the New York Times article \u201cWhat Explains U. S. Mass Shootings? International Comparisons Suggest an Answer\u201d and was published on November 8, 2017. It uses data from the annual Small Arms Survey, an independent research project of the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva (Switzerland).\n\nSome of you said that you did not have enough information. Tommy of NJ wanted to see more countries represented. Rachel from Jackson wanted to know the year of the data. Many wanted all data points labeled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHenry of Detroit noticed when he removed the United States outlier data point, there seems to be no association between guns and mass shooters. For example, in Graph B, France, Canada, and Iraq all seem to have about the same number of guns per 100 people, but very different mass shooters per 100 million people. He wondered if there is no association. This is counter to most other responses. Before we come to any conclusion on association, we need to dig deeper into the data to investigate what we wonder. I would suggest getting a copy of the cited report by Alan Lankford and looking at the Small Arms Survey.\n\nHere are some questions you may want to think about critically.\n\n\u2022 Why were there two graphs? What additional insight did we gain with Graph B?\n\n\u2022 Statisticians are careful to note that just because there is an association between two variables, it does not mean that changes in one variable are causing the value of the other variable to change. Do you think it is possible to say that having more guns is the cause of increased mass shootings? Or, are there other factors that may cause increased mass shootings? What could be the other factors?\n\n\u2022 The United States is an outlier (defined below) in both graphs. How do you interpret its being an outlier?\n\n\u2022 Other than the United States, none of the countries that are identified on Graph A are identified on Graph B. Even without this identification, what might you know about these countries regarding their rate of gun ownership and mass shooters?\n\n\u2022 In Graph A, what do the identified countries have in common? How about for Graph B?\n\nBelow in Stat Nuggets, we define and explain scatterplot, total and per capita data, and outlier. Look into the archives to see past Stat Nuggets terms.\n\nThank you for participating in \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d, which is intended to have you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data in a news story. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Data visualizations, like this graph, are an important part of statistics. They help us to understand and communicate about data.\n\nKeep noticing and wondering. Come up with conjectures based on the graphs. We continue to welcome more responses.\n\nSee you next month on Tuesday, April 10, for our next \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\n\n_________\n\nStat Nuggets for \u201cWhat Explains U. S. Mass Shootings?\u201d\n\nSCATTERPLOT\n\nA scatterplot is an x-y graph that is used to investigate the relationship between two quantitative variables, one on each axis.\n\nScatterplots can be described in terms of direction (+ or upward, - or downward, or neither), form (linear, curved, scattered, etc.), unusual data points that are out of the pattern, and strength (strong to moderate to weak, based on how \u201ctight\u201d the form is).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cWhat Explains U. S. Mass Shootings,\u201d the number of mass shooters (vertical y-axis) is plotted against the number of guns (horizontal x-axis). The direction is neither positive nor negative. The form is scattered with no association for the countries\u2019 data points in the lower left corner. The most unusual countries are the United States and Yemen in the per capita graph. They are outliers, as explained below. Ignoring the outliers, there is at best a very weak association between the number of guns and the number of mass shooters.\n\nTOTAL vs. PER CAPITA DATA\n\nSome quantitative variables count the number of times something occurs for a group. To calculate a per capita (\u201cper person\u201d) rate, simply divide the number by the total number of people in the group.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Explains U. S. Mass Shootings,\u201d Graph A shows countries in terms of their number of guns and number of mass shooters without regard to their population size. In contrast, Graph B shows these values as a proportion of the country\u2019s population. Note that the rate is multiplied by a larger number \u2014 100 people for guns and 100 million people for mass shooters, to avoid decimals, which can be hard to comprehend in rates. This scaling of the data does not change the order of the countries; it just makes the values more understandable.\n\nOUTLIER\n\nAn outlier is a data point that is out of pattern by being distant from other points.\n\nIn \u201cWhat Explains U. S. Mass Shootings,\u201d the United States is an outlier in both graphs and Yemen is an outlier only in Graph B. For both countries, the number of guns per 100 people and the number of mass shooters per 100 million people are unusually large compared to the other countries.\n\n_________\n\nThe graphs for \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney, the Statistics Content Director at Mass Insight Education.

The clothes conspicuously retain store labels. (She returned them for credit after the shoots.)\n\nPhoto\n\nLike the fabrics, the backdrops in the photographs are intensely patterned, in the manner of the \u201cdazzle camouflage\u201d painted on British warships as protection from airplane bombers during World War I. \u201cIt was used not to hide the battleships but to confuse enemy aim by making it unclear what you are looking at,\u201d she explained in a phone interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to the portraits, which come from a series she calls \u201cCargo Cult,\u201d Ms. Syjuco has included in the exhibition a series of passport-style self-portraits (taken with her cellphone) with her face obscured, alluding to the anxiety presently felt in immigrant communities in this country.\n\nPhoto\n\nPaul Mpagi Sepuya, 35, also critiques photography portraiture, from a vantage point that is more formally inventive and politically oblique than Ms. Syjuco\u2019s. Black and gay, with an interest in investigating his racial and sexual identities, Mr. Sepuya uses collages and mirror shards to fragment the image; and he raises out of their customary invisibility the black cloths and tripods of a photographer\u2019s studio. His photographs were included in the recent \u201cTrigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon\u201d at the New Museum and the current \u201cTag: Proposals on Queer Play and the Ways Forward\u201d at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia.\n\nAlong with large inkjet prints on the wall, in the MoMA show he has a table with found objects, both photographs and books, to provide context (a presentation style associated with Wolfgang Tillmans). Mr. Sepuya is a postmodern portrait photographer, but one who chooses to reshuffle real material rather than compose on Photoshop. \u201cThere\u2019s a codedness,\u201d he said, describing his work. \u201cI\u2019m interested when someone can piece together another layer of meaning from a fragment of a body or the location of a room.\u201d\n\nAnd he relates his formal strategy to his sexual orientation. \u201cThere is a history of queer social spaces inhabiting the back room,\u201d he said. \u201cIn these darkroom portraits, I\u2019m thinking that being under the black cloth is like being in the back room.\u201d It is a space \u201cof creative friendship and sexual exchange all happening in the same places.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough photographers have always been acutely conscious of what lies just outside the edges of their pictures, the viewer may overlook this central fact. Mr. Sepuya is not alone in wanting to highlight what usually goes unseen. Andrzej Steinbach, 34, a Polish-born photographer based in Berlin, photographed three young people together, as if in a fashion shoot, and then displayed the portraits as a sequence, where a person who is mostly out of the frame in one picture becomes the central figure in the next. \u201cThey switch places and they switch clothing,\u201d Ms. Gallun said. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling.\u201d\n\nMatthew Connors, 42, likens his position as a photographer to the unreliable narrator in contemporary fiction. The body of work he is showing comes from five trips he made to North Korea between 2013 and 2016. Earlier, he took pictures in Egypt during the street demonstrations that culminated in the fall of President Mohamed Morsi. If that job description makes him sound like a photojournalist, he quickly dispels the notion. \u201cI would be a terrible photojournalist, because I\u2019m very slow and I\u2019m not always training myself on the event that\u2019s unfolding,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn many of his photographs of North Korea, where he was invariably accompanied by a couple of handlers, he emphasizes how partial his images are. He photographs electronic billboards in which the image is incomplete because some of the lights are out. He depicts a dark cave decorated for tourists with projected patches of colored lights \u2014 a stand-in for the cave in Plato\u2019s allegory, where only the shadows of outside life are visible to those chained within. Both the photographer and his subjects see each other indistinctly, a fact that the sharpness of Mr. Connors\u2019s digital images doesn\u2019t deny.\n\nWe are a long way from MoMA\u2019s most famous photography exhibition, Edward Steichen\u2019s \u201cThe Family of Man\u201d of 1955, which presented people from all around the world as being more alike than not. Some of the most striking of Mr. Connors\u2019s photographs are portraits of North Koreans: three schoolgirls as frozen as waxworks, one young man affectionately touching another at a public swimming pool. The pictures are compelling but resist easy understanding. The emblematic photograph in Mr. Connors\u2019s contribution to the show appears in a print twice the size and separate from the North Korea pictures: a mask held in a fist at a New York anti-Trump rally. Because of the positioning of the tape and the eyeholes, what we see looks like a crude rendition of a face, but it is actually the back of the mask.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of Mr. Connors\u2019s images \u2014 the geometric reflections in a nighttime swimming pool, the rushing cascades in a water park \u2014 are reminders of the pleasures that photography can provide when practiced by a technically skilled artist. Even more daringly retrograde in the embrace of tradition is Sam Contis, 35, who sometimes shoots with film and a vintage view camera (as well as a digital one). She has made repeated visits over the last five years to photograph the students at Deep Springs College, a small, all-male institution in a remote valley in eastern California.

It is down 3.7 percent since the Commerce Department\u2019s announcement, and 3.1 percent since Mr. Trump announced his intentions. The decline encapsulated how trade tension might hurt specific businesses, in particular, Boeing\u2019s.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nBlame Boeing\n\nMuch of the Dow\u2019s underperformance can be traced to the aircraft maker\u2019s stock.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s trade policies have hit Boeing, the most-heavily weighted stock in the Dow, particularly hard.\n\nAluminum makes up about 80 percent of the weight of most commercial aircrafts, according to Brooke Sutherland and David Fickling of Gadfly. That means tariffs on imported aluminum would likely raise Boeing\u2019s costs more than its competitors. Boeing also views China, the main target of the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist trade policies, as an important growth market. The country is set to overtake the U.S. as the biggest aviation market by 2022, Ms. Sutherland and Mr. Fickling write.\n\nChina could target Boeing if the country decides to retaliate against the U.S.\n\nBoeing is down 3.6 percent today, shaving more than 80 points off the blue-chip index. Since the Commerce Department released its report calling for tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, the stock is down 8.7 percent, worth more than 200 points off the Dow.\n\nBoeing drove the Dow higher for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, more than doubling during his first 12 months in office.\n\nBoeing\u2019s climb has had an outsized impact on the Dow. The index is price-weighted, meaning that the higher priced stocks have a bigger pull on the index.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoneyBeat\u2019s Ben Eisen noted that at the end of January, the stock accounted for 9.4 percent of Dow, up from 6 percent a year earlier. By comparison, Boeing makes up just 0.8 percent of the market capitalization weighted S.&P. 500.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s not just Boeing that is falling on trade tensions\n\nChinese tech stocks are also tumbling.\n\nShares of Alibaba are off 4.2 percent, Tencent 5 percent and Baidu 4.3 percent in the wake of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports.\n\nThat is much worse than their American counterparts. Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet are down between 1.2 percent and 2.2 percent by comparison.\n\nShares of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 collectively known as BAT \u2014 have soared over the past year, pushing their combined market value above $1 trillion.\n\nAs these companies have grown, so have their ambitions. All three have moved to expand beyond their core business and home market and have aggressively invested in Americantech start-ups to help them do so.\n\nChina\u2019s largest internet companies \u2014 the BAT plus the e-commerce company JD.com \u2014 have invested $5.6 billion in 48 tech deals in the United States over the past two years, according to CBI Insights data via CNBC.\n\nSuch investments have raised concerns in the United States.

But the two have merged.\u201d Even today \u2014 she\u2019s just published her 20th Inspector Lynley novel, \u201cThe Punishment She Deserves,\u201d which debuts on the hardcover fiction list at No. 2 \u2014 she still finds journaling useful.\n\nThe first Lynley book, \u201cA Great Deliverance,\u201d came out in 1988. The series has gone on for so long, George says, that \u201cit can be a delicate dance\u201d to introduce new readers to her characters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give out every single detail about their pasts, which would be tedious for faithful readers,\u201d she says, \u201cso at this point I only repeat the information that\u2019s relevant to the current book.\u201d The other big challenge of writing a series? While she doesn\u2019t have any problems recalling the details of her characters\u2019 lives, \u201csometimes I have to double-check the names and places in their pasts. For example, Daidre Trahair\u201d \u2014 Lynley\u2019s love interest \u2014 \u201chas a brother and sister with very unusual Cornish names, so I usually have to leaf through a past book and make sure I\u2019ve got it right.\u201d\n\nGeorge, a meticulous researcher, visits England multiple times to investigate her settings. \u201cSeeing the place is really helpful in developing the plot, because if I don\u2019t go, there are things I simply won\u2019t know,\u201d she explains. \u201cFor example, for the new book I went to Ludlow, and when I visited the police station, it was closed.

That became a hugely important plot point in the book.\u201d\n\nGeorge\u2019s knowledge about the inner workings of New Scotland Yard is so exhaustive \u2014 and her understanding of class issues in British society so finely tuned \u2014 that some readers profess surprise when they learn she is American. How, they ask, can she turn out novels with such a distinctly British flavor? \u201cThe reality is very simple.

{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "These demonstrations gave birth to a small generation of anti-authoritarian, left-wing and nonpartisan militants, who kept protesting for subsequent years over all kinds of issues. They have been dismissed as thugs, vandals, political pawns or simply ineffectual. (That last accusation may not be completely inaccurate.) But now, they are also being held accountable for the right wing\u2019s advance in Brazilian politics and for the impeachment of the former President Dilma Rousseff.\n\n\u201cWe were hasty in thinking that 2013 was democratic,\u201d Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the popular former president and an icon of the Brazilian left, said last year. \u201cI sincerely believe that Ms. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment would not have occurred were it not for the June Journeys,\u201d wrote Fernando Haddad, the former mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo and a prominent figure in Mr. da Silva\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cIn my opinion, it was when the coup started,\u201d Mr. da Silva tweeted in January.\n\nWhy do these left-wing politicians see the decidedly left-wing protesters as agents of the right? Well, in part because it\u2019s easy to feel anxious about an uncontrollable, leaderless, movement with pluralistic demands. But there\u2019s another reason. After June 2013, some people protested against political corruption as a whole, including the Workers\u2019 Party, which was in power at the time. This eventually resulted in five big right-wing street demonstrations demanding the ouster of Ms. Rousseff, the elected president who came from the Workers Party. The right-wing demonstrators got their wish in August 2016.\n\nBut there\u2019s no straight line that runs from the 2013 protests to the 2016 impeachment. The street rallies weren\u2019t the golden opportunity they were all waiting for to take down Ms. Rousseff, nor were they the main factor that finally enabled them to seize power. After all, many on the right worked with the Rousseff administration. (Remember that President Michel Temer was Ms. Rousseff\u2019s vice president.) Nor did the right \u201chijack\u201d an intrinsically anarchic movement, considering the fact that many other people have kept on holding their own progressive rallies, small but pretty inconvenient. (See, for example, the demonstrations against the 2014 World Cup. Back then, criticizing the event for any reason was considered an affront to the governing left.)\n\nThat view is simplistic and only serves to evade the burden of responsibility. In 13 years of Workers\u2019 Party rule, the traditional left missed many crucial opportunities to effectively change Brazil. Now they need someone else to blame for their losses. And the current scapegoat seems to be the protesters of the far left \u2014 those who dared to criticize the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s decisions in the past.", "title": "Opinion | What\u2019s the Use of Protesting?", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-31 00:00:00", "text": "But bondsmen have extraordinary powers that most lenders do not. They are supposed to return their clients to jail if they skip court or do something illegal. But some states give them broad latitude to arrest their clients for any reason \u2014 or none at all. A credit card company cannot jail someone for missing a payment. A bondsman, in many instances, can.\n\nUsing that leverage, bond agents can charge steep fees, some of which are illegal, with impunity, according to interviews and a review of court records and complaint data. They can also go far beyond the demands of other creditors by requiring their clients to check in regularly, keep a curfew, allow searches of their car or home at any time, and open their medical, Social Security and phone records to inspection.\n\nThey keep a close eye on their clients, but in many places, no one is keeping a close eye on them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a consumer protection issue,\u201d said Judge Lee V. Coffee, a criminal court judge in Memphis. Before recent changes to the rules there, he said, defendants frequently complained of shakedowns in which bondsmen demanded extra payments. \u201cThey\u2019re living under a constant daily threat that \u2018if you don\u2019t bring more money, we\u2019re going to put you in jail.\u2019\u201d The pressure, the judge said, \u201cwould actually encourage people to go out and commit more crimes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike payday lenders, the bail bond industry deals with potential criminals whose very involvement with the law raises questions about their trustworthiness. But in the United States criminal justice system, the Supreme Court has affirmed, liberty before trial is supposed to be the norm, not the exception \u2014 the system is intended to allow defendants to stay out of jail.\n\nSome bail bond practices have drawn the ire of judges who complain that payment plans are too lenient on people accused of serious crimes, allowing them to get out for just a few hundred dollars or even no money down. Those judges say it should be more difficult for the accused to walk free.\n\nOther judges see some bondsmen as trampling the rights of defendants. One judge in Lafayette, La., Jules Edwards III, held in contempt two bondsmen who were brothers for intercepting a defendant on his way to court and sending him, instead, to jail.\n\nThe judge said the commercial bail industry had put its financial interests above justice and public safety. \u201cIf he\u2019s not in compliance with the contract, sue him. How do you get to snatch his body and hold him hostage?\u201d Judge Edwards said in a phone interview.\n\nHe added that defendants do not have to go with their bondsmen unless there is a warrant out for their arrest, but many of them do not know that. \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is intimidating and coercing and lying,\u201d he said. The brothers declined to comment.\n\nIn both Mr. Egana\u2019s case and this one, the bondsmen would not have been on the hook for the defendants\u2019 failure to appear, because they diverted the defendants from court dates for unrelated cases, not the ones for which they had bailed them out.\n\nThe bond agency, Blair\u2019s Bail Bonds, stopped Mr. Egana, who had prior felony convictions, from going to court on charges of fleeing an officer, but had bailed him out in June 2016 after he was arrested on charges of possession of marijuana, a firearm and stolen property.\n\nHad Mr. Egana been wealthier, he might have been able to post his full bail of $26,000, then gotten it back when he returned for court. But like most defendants, Mr. Egana had to turn to a commercial bail bond agent that charges a nonrefundable fee for the service of guaranteeing the bond.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot only could Mr. Egana not afford the full bail, he could not afford the fee, $3,275. He arranged to pay it in installments. After his release, he said, Blair\u2019s informed him that on top of the premium, he would have to pay $10 a day for an ankle monitor, though the judge had not ordered one. Guilty or innocent, Mr. Egana would never see any of that money again. Blair\u2019s has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.\n\nSome customers feel they have no choice but to pay bond agents\u2019 fees \u2014 no matter how outrageous they seem. When a home health care aide wanted to bail her son out of Rikers Island in New York City, she was charged $1,000 to have a courier walk her money a few blocks to the courthouse.\n\nA defendant in a serious domestic violence case in Santa Clara, Calif., suffering from a dangerous heart condition, had to have his ankle monitor removed each time he went to the hospital, and was forced to pay $300 to have it put back on afterward.\n\nA woman in Des Moines woke one morning to find that her 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix had been repossessed during the night. Had she put up her car as collateral in a typical loan, she would have been notified that she had fallen behind and given 20 days to pay.\n\nBut instead, the car was collateral for a bail bond for her child\u2019s father. She owed $700 to the bail agents. They not only took the car, but turned the father over to the jail. Ultimately the misdemeanor assault charges against him were dismissed.\n\nThe bond agents in the Lafayette, New York, Santa Clara and Des Moines cases declined to comment. But Jeffrey J. Clayton, the executive director of the American Bail Coalition, an industry group, said that credit bonds, as the payment plans are called, should be more tightly regulated and require at least a minimum down payment. However, he said, any rules should preserve the benefit to the customer, namely, \u201cIf you have the ability to pay it, just not right now, you can get out right now.\u201d\n\nBond companies fall into a sort of regulatory gulf between criminal courts and state insurance departments, which are supposed to regulate them but seldom impose sanctions. With rare exception, defense lawyers and prosecutors are too busy with their caseloads to keep bond companies in line. Further complicating things, it is often unclear whether consumer protection laws apply, and insurance departments say they lack the resources to investigate complaints.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Egana, who worked as a carpenter, it did not take long for him to fall behind on his payments. But he thought that since he was routinely showing up to court, he would be fine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was wrong. The bond company detained him several more times, according to court records. At one point, two men with guns and bulletproof vests came to the home where he was working as a contractor and forced him into a car. Each time, they demanded that his mother pay more money.\n\nJeffrey Orey, a spokesman for Blair\u2019s Bail Bonds, while denying any wrongdoing, declined to comment on the specifics of Mr. Egana\u2019s lawsuit. He said the company had never charged interest or assessed penalties for late payment. The lawsuit, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center on behalf of Mr. Egana and alleging violation of consumer lending laws, says Mr. Egana\u2019s mother paid at least $5,450 \u2014 or almost two times the original premium \u2014 to keep her son out of jail. Some of her money, the lawsuit says, was applied to older debts that Mr. Egana still owed.\n\n\u201cIt was kidnapping,\u201d Mr. Egana said. \u201cThey saw the love that my mom has for me, and they used that to their advantage.\u201d\n\nIn May, Blair\u2019s decided it no longer wanted Mr. Egana as a customer and handed him over to the jail.\n\nSiphoning Millions From Poor", "title": "When Bail Feels Less Like Freedom, More Like Extortion", "authors": ["Jessica Silver-Greenberg", "Shaila Dewan"]}

Women with the disorder have heavy, agonizing periods along with a litany of other symptoms depending on where the rogue cells lurk. If they congregate near the bladder, urinating hurts; near the sciatic nerve, pain can shoot down the legs; inside the lung (a rare event), breathing can be stifled.\n\nAfter one bout \u2014 \u201cas sudden as a thunderclap.

So she didn\u2019t know how to assign a number to it: \u201cBad enough that I couldn\u2019t ignore it, which made it definitely higher than a four or five.\u201d She questioned whether she was a six or higher and whether the doctor would believe her anyhow.\n\nNorman repeatedly told doctors that sexual intercourse ached \u201clike a dull pinch, that resonated to my pelvis.\u201d No one paid attention until her boyfriend accompanied her and mentioned his frustration. \u201cBecoming a disappointment to a man,\u201d she writes, \u201cseemed to do the trick.\u201d\n\nNorman is a terrific storyteller with a gift for weaving memorable anecdotes, some drawn from medical history, others from recent scientific debates and most plucked from her own travails. We learn about Sigmund Freud and his views of his \u201chysterical\u201d female clients. We read about baby monkeys who grew up with emotional issues because their real cuddly moms were removed at birth and replaced with pretend wire-doll monkey-mothers. We learn of recent ideas challenging long-held notions about the origins of endometriosis. Many experts no longer believe the disease is triggered by uterine cells that escaped the womb, but rather by uterine-like cells that originated outside of it.\n\nNorman\u2019s life is much more than a disease.

How does a columnist knit together a series of free-ranging articles \u2014 a sequence of portraits captured in real time, featuring disparate topics and voices? Some publish collections. Others add connective tissue. Leland chose to do the latter, grafting in material from many origins. He cites research findings. He quotes sages ranging from Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, to James Brown and Jack Kerouac. (Leland is also the author of \u201cWhy Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of \u2018On the Road\u2019\u201d and \u201cHip: The History.\u201d) He embeds his own struggles \u2014 relating to an aging mother, starting over after a divorce \u2014 as a quiet throughline. But mostly Leland adds self-help, sprung from a single axiom: \u201cIf you want to be happy, learn to think like an old person.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThat choice is disappointing. Americans spend $1 billion on self-help books each year. \u201cHappiness Is a Choice You Make\u201d feels like part of that hard sell: a relentless process of extrusion. The morals of the story, forced from the raw material of human lives, quickly overshadow the action and characters. \u201cThe good news about getting old is that there is good news,\u201d Leland announces. \u201cWhat the elders had discovered, I began to see, was not just a preparation for death but a prescription for life at any age.\u201d\n\nThe author has a flair for showmanship, treating this \u201cprescription\u201d like a powerful elixir that he has tested, with salubrious results, on his own life.

Many offer administrative or back-office support, handling tasks like soliciting proposals and mailing checks. They can also serve as gatekeepers, buffering donors from excessive grant requests.

The foundation focuses on helping children in poverty, particularly those affected by the incarceration of a family member, as well as community building and environmental justice, which seeks to protect the poor and powerless from adverse environmental conditions. It gave away about $2 million in 2016.\n\nShe credits the Philanthropic Initiative with helping her family learn how to conduct in-person assessments of charities. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of site visits,\u201d she said. Once, she showed up to meet with leaders of a small nonprofit and quickly realized that the group had not told her that it was being evicted from its offices; boxes of files were stacked for relocation. The foundation still funded the group, she said, but the visit prompted a conversation about transparency.\n\nDonors can do very basic early sleuthing themselves because of digital information. An essential first step, for instance, is verifying that a potential grant recipient is qualified as tax exempt. Eligibility can be verified instantly online, through GuideStar\u2019s nonprofit tracker, Charity Check.\n\nAdvisers typically dig deeper into the details of the group\u2019s financial reports; talk to their contacts in the field, as well as the group\u2019s leaders and existing donors; and arrange site visits.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf you really want to have an impact, it takes some work,\u201d said Henry L.

Such findings are not necessarily deal breakers, he said, but warrant further inquiries.\n\nDonors may also be wary of a group\u2019s overhead \u2014 the spending for staff, office space and support services \u2014 or the amount it spends fund-raising. Some online nonprofit watchdogs, like Charity Navigator, rate charities based on the proportion of funds spent on administration and fund-raising. While such spending is a consideration, many advisers say, they caution donors that it must be considered in context.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep in mind what\u2019s required for the staff to actually achieve their mission,\u201d said Betsy Brill, president of Strategic Philanthropy, an advisory firm in Chicago. A nonprofit providing mental health services, for instance, likely needs doctors, lawyers and psychiatrists, and such professionals tend to receive higher salaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSimilarly, a group\u2019s financial statements cannot be read in isolation, Ms. Brill said. Expecting a small nonprofit to maintain, say, a reserve of two years of operating expenses may be unrealistic.\n\nAnd while a group running a deficit is a concern, it also needs to be evaluated with additional information. \u201cIs it an ongoing issue?\u201d she said. \u201cOr is it a one-time problem?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNeil Gobioff, president of the Gobioff Foundation, a private grant maker in Tampa, Fla., that supports the arts and social justice causes, said the foundation\u2019s grants are relatively small \u2014 $6,000 on average. But that amount can be significant for small arts groups, so it is important that the funds are used wisely. The foundation ran into at least one problem, he said, when a grant recipient did not use funds as specified.\n\nThat led to some changes, Mr. Gobioff said, with the help of Foundation Source, which provides advice and back-office services to foundations. Previously, the Gobioff Foundation would mail checks to recipients with letters stating terms of the grant; cashing the check meant the recipient agreed to the rules as outlined. But in this case, the recipient claimed that the person responsible for the grant was never made aware of its requirements. So the foundation changed its approach. \u201cNow we require a signed letter\u201d acknowledging acceptance of the grant terms, he said, before any checks are presented.\n\nSome donors avoid fledgling organizations, in favor of more established, high-performing nonprofits that may be seen as less risky. But Janis A. Reischmann, executive director of the Hau\u2019oli Mau Loa Foundation in Honolulu, said her organization was willing to back groups at early stages.In 2009, she recalled, the foundation funded an organization that had $500 in the bank and a new executive director. \u201cThere was a lot of risk in that,\u201d she said. But the foundation had faith in the director and the group\u2019s board. \u201cWe felt if anybody could make it happen, they could.\u201d\n\nThat bet paid off.

In the 1970s, a game called Death Race, which required players to simulate hit-and-run killings from behind the wheel, was described by the National Safety Council as \u201csick, sick, sick.\u201d\n\nIn the 1980s, Dr. C. Everett Koop, the United States surgeon general, voiced concerns that video games might be detrimental to young people, who he said could become addicted to them \u201cbody and soul.\u201d\n\nBut by the early 1990s, concern had morphed into panic. Rhetoric about an epidemic of violence ran rampant, fueled by fears of teenage gangs and murderers. On Dec. 7, 1993, a gunman killed six people on a crowded Long Island Rail Road train during rush hour.\n\nNot long before, the intensely popular and extremely bloody arcade game Mortal Kombat had become available for home gaming systems. Players squared off against opponents in one-on-one fights; the victor could employ a character-specific \u201cfatality\u201d that allowed the winning avatar to tear out the loser\u2019s heart or execute some other coup de gr\u00e2ce.\n\nMortal Kombat\u2019s first iteration featured weapons, but no firearms.\n\nCongressional hearings, then a ratings system\n\nThe brutal game became a favorite target for critics of violence marketed to children, along with a more obscure game called Night Trap, whose premise involved a surveillance agent protecting teenage girls from blood-craving monsters.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Lieberman led the charge in denouncing such games as desensitizing young players. The same month as the Long Island train massacre, he spearheaded a series of congressional hearings into the influence of video games on real-world violence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about video games that glorify violence and teach children to enjoy inflicting the most gruesome forms of cruelty imaginable,\u201d he said at a news conference that December.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmid the growing concern, MTV ran a special called \u201cGeneration Under the Gun,\u201d in which teenagers discussed their relationships with firearms.

The board\u2019s rating system, largely modeled after the one used by the movie industry, assigned letter grades to video games based on their content, with the most violent games reserved for players 17 or older.\n\nThe industry promised the new system would be in place in time for the 1994 holiday buying season.\n\nA persistent political debate\n\nBut politicians and lobbyists from both sides of the aisle would continue to point to video games as a possible culprit in mass shootings.\n\nThe two teenage gunmen who killed 12 fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School in 1999 were said to have played the first-person shooter game Doom, which led Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, to accuse Hollywood and computerized games as having \u201cundermined the core values of civility.\u201d\n\nA few months after the shooting, President Bill Clinton asked the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how violent media, including video games, was being marketed to children.\n\nRegulatory efforts were stymied in 2011, when the Supreme Court blocked a California law that sought to ban the sale of violent video games to young people.\n\nBut in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School the next year, President Barack Obama asked Congress for funds to research the effects of violence in video games.\n\nA generation grown up with violent games\n\nNearly 25 years have passed since the 1993 hearings, and video games are vastly more realistic and social, with gamers capable of participating in 100-person \u201cBattle Royale\u201d-style death matches.\n\nThe ratings system is generally considered to have been effective in keeping children from directly acquiring violent games, although many still find ways to get hold of them.\n\nAnd the prospect of legislative action seems to have faded.\n\n\u201cNow, there are very few legislators under 60 who don\u2019t have kids who play video games or who don\u2019t play themselves,\u201d said Michael Pachter, a video games analyst with Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different society now.\u201d", "title": "When Mortal Kombat Came Under Congressional Scrutiny", "authors": ["Tiffany Hsu"]}

Not all. Instead, you and your neighbors should try to persuade your landlord to see the program as an asset, not just a chore.

It\u2019s not just the parent saying, \u2018Is it done?\u2019 It\u2019s about students trying to figure out the best way to explain something. It\u2019s more about conversation than about completion, and they\u2019re having fun together.\u201d\n\nThe fundamental premise behind Family Playlists, which teachers assign as homework intermittently \u2014 typically at the end of a unit \u2014 is that when students are asked to teach something, they learn it at a deeper level and strengthen their sense of self-reliance. That was my experience as a child, and it appeared to be shared by the eight sixth graders from South Bronx Prep I recently interviewed.\n\nJesmari Cruz, 11, was surprised to discover that her father, Luis, was good at math. However, she found that he had forgotten some things, like how to calculate perimeter. \u201cSo I had to teach him,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst I explained it and gave him his own shape and let him do whatever work he understood, but then I had to explain it more to him, and help him break it down.\u201d\n\nMadison Toro, 12, had a similar experience teaching her father, Eugene. \u201cWhen we did polygons and shapes, I made mistakes and he corrected me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I taught him about dividing fractions and how to make an improper fraction and a mixed number.\u201d\n\nThe students found that after having led parents and other relatives through a number of lessons, their parents started reminding them less often to do their homework \u2014 reflecting, perhaps, increased trust and confidence. Their biggest difficulty was having to translate math concepts for parents who weren\u2019t fluent in English. And their most common complaint was about parents being too busy with work and caring for younger siblings \u2014 and too distracted by cellphones \u2014 to give them their full attention.

Other occupations, like journalism, became more professionalized later in the 20th century by developing an agreed-upon set of norms and best practices.\n\nIn most cases, said Tracey Adams, a sociologist who studies professions at the University of Western Ontario, the workers tended to be driven by a sense that they were improving society, not just adding to the bottom line. In return, the public and government officials often deferred to them in the areas where they asserted authority. This netted them the resources to do their jobs, the independence to exercise their judgment and widespread public esteem.\n\nThat has changed in the past few decades, however. \u201cI think that most professions would find that there are a number of forces chipping away at a lot of those tangible and less tangible benefits,\u201d Professor Adams said. \u201cIncreasingly people say, \u2018I\u2019m not sure I trust you more than the next person.\u2019\u201d", "title": "When Professionals Rise Up, More Than Money Is at Stake", "authors": []}

Bush\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations by a Republican-controlled committee is worth revisiting for what it revealed about Mr. Bolton and what it may portend for our national security.\n\nOne moment singularly derailed his nomination. Testifying before the usually staid Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April 2005, Carl W. Ford Jr. \u2014 the former assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research \u2014 called Mr. Bolton a \u201ckiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\u201d and a \u201cserial abuser\u201d of people beneath him in the chain of command.

After two hours of taking in \u201cGolden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient Americas,\u201d he left and headed toward the fountain on the northern end of the plaza out front, which bears the name of its benefactor, David H. Koch. Mr. Saltz was carrying a long strip of paper that had been printed to blend in with the granite used for the fountain. The words on it matched the typeface of the fountain\u2019s inscription. Mr. Saltz then attached his sign to the fountain, so that it no longer read \u201cDavid H. Koch Plaza.\u201d Instead it declared, \u201cClimate Change Denier Plaza.\u201d\n\nPeople cheered and clapped and took out their phones. Mr. Saltz, who is married to the co-chief art critic of The New York Times, Roberta Smith, picked up the scraps of tape he had used that had fallen to the ground \u2014 he did not want to litter \u2014 and shared a picture of his act of guerrilla resistance with his 502,000 followers on Twitter. The Met removed the sign quickly and offered no comment when I called its spokesman to ask how the gesture was received. Had the museum banned him from going back, Mr. Saltz told me, he would have prostrated himself before its executives and begged to be readmitted. \u201cI can\u2019t live if living is without the Met,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI know the act is riddled with protest, but it was a guttural response.

Among the many recipients of the family\u2019s largess is, for instance, the Competitive Enterprise institute, a nonprofit libertarian think tank that published a blog post several years ago comparing a prominent Penn State climate scientist, Michael Mann, to the former football coach and pedophile Jerry Sandusky, arguing that Mr. Mann had \u201cmolested and tortured data in the service of politicized science.\u201d\n\nThe Trump presidency has, in many ways, been like a tuning fork applied to the city\u2019s soul, causing it to vibrate again after years in which it had seemed incapable \u2014 dulled and flattened by the growing presence of Rite Aid and meal kits and complacency and billionaire dormitories.

For many campus conservatives, the invitations are driven by a sincere desire to give their values an airing and set off debate. It is, of course, also fun to annoy people who disagree with you.\n\nIronically, or perhaps predictably, tonal tensions are escalating at a time when actual policymaking has ground nearly to a halt, with budgets and major legislative packages hopelessly stalled in Congress after Congress. The attempt to find common ground over the \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 the group of undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children \u2014 for instance, ultimately involved a brief shutdown of the federal government and a near miss of one. The left labeled the right racist; the right accused the left of hating America. No substantive policy change resulted.\n\nSo maybe it makes sense that political squabbling across much of America has become increasingly aesthetics-focused and content devoid: It\u2019s no coincidence that at the moment the alt-right leader Richard Spencer was sucker-punched on camera, he was explaining the elaborate in-joke signaled by his Pepe the Frog lapel pin. Nor that when Russians allegedly tried to meddle in the last presidential election, they chose to do it in meme form, with Facebook ads featuring Jesus and the Devil arm wrestling over the prospect of a Hillary Clinton victory, or promoting \u201cBuff Bernie\u201d pro-L.G.B.T. coloring books. Differences remain as fundamental as ever, but the way we talk about them is so superficial as to have become incoherent.\n\nBut that has done little to restrain the all-consuming ferocity of the fighting. Nor have the consequences been restricted to the internet. The tonal differences go all the way to the top: If Barack Obama\u2019s \u201ccling to guns or religion\u201d statement was a perfect distillation of the smug style in liberal politics, Donald Trump is impeccably suited to an increasingly post-ideological Republican landscape where the point-scoring is the prize.\n\nOne of the primary reactions to this new framing of the political debate has been exactly what you\u2019d expect: Many sane, self-respecting people no longer want anything to do with either side. Barely half of the respondents to the last round of Gallup\u2019s long-running question about partisan affiliation could bring themselves to pick a party at all, with just 28 percent identifying as Republicans and 27 percent as Democrats. (Happy start of midterm season!) And even when Gallup tried to force people into bicolor boxes, by asking the 46 percent identifying as independents which way they lean, the totals still come only to 46 percent on team red and 44 percent on team blue.\n\nIt is from the reluctant partisans and the remaining 10 percent of stalwart independents that hope must spring.

He was just, well, Donald Trump: a septuagenarian cable-TV addict ill-suited for the responsibilities of his office but still fully capable of attempting to exercise its powers. Which meant that the containment game had to last, not weeks or months, but three more long years to work.\n\nAnd it may not last that long. From his exciting new steel tariffs to his promised summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, Trump has been acting lately like a man less inclined to listen to his handlers \u2014 and now those handlers have begun to disappear. The firing of Rex Tillerson, on the heels of Gary Cohn\u2019s departure about a week ago, evokes the wildly chaotic atmosphere that characterized Trump\u2019s first few months in office. But as my colleague Maggie Haberman tweeted, this time it seems less like something happening to Trump and more like chaos orchestrated from the Oval Office: \u201cThe narrative of Trump unglued is not totally wrong but misses the reason why \u2014 he was terrified of the job the first six months, and now feels like he has a command of it. So now he is basically saying, \u2018I\u2019ve got this, I can make the changes I want.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump knows that he\u2019s been constrained and tamed \u2014 for all I know he might have read my columns, or at least the headlines, saying so \u2014 and doesn\u2019t want to play the incapacitated Twitter president anymore. He wants to actually use the office, and not just occupy it \u2014 and since he is the president, nobody can stop him from trying.", "title": "Opinion | When Trump Takes Charge", "authors": []}

On Sunday, the legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, passed a constitutional amendment erasing a limit of two presidential terms and setting Mr. Xi on course to run China for at least another decade.\n\nMr. Xi began his second five-year term as president after a unanimous vote by legislators on Saturday. Officials have said that extending Mr. Xi\u2019s time in office beyond this term will assure stable policies for decades. The swift, secretive way in which Mr. Xi secured his extended reign let officials know that Mr. Xi would bulldoze past any resistance to get his way.\n\n\u201cXi effectively is signaling to opponents of his policy agenda that they cannot wait him out and that they need to get on board with his agenda,\u201d said Ryan Hass, a former director for China at the National Security Council who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t take this step, and expose himself to such risk, unless he felt it was needed to bust through opposition to his agenda.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi has already established sweeping authority, through his anticorruption drive, and by creating a plethora of new powers and leadership groups that channel decisions to him. His overhaul of the military also demonstrated a willingness to take on entrenched bureaucracies.\n\nA reorganization of ministries and agencies revealed at the congress on Tuesday may let Mr. Xi and other leaders better steer bureaucracies. And a new government lineup, to be announced on Monday, is likely to put Mr. Xi\u2019s close allies atop his administration, making it easier to communicate and refine orders. One such ally, Wang Qishan, became vice president on Saturday.\n\nBut Mr. Xi\u2019s centralization of power over the sprawling bureaucracy can also create confusion and overshooting.\n\nPhoto\n\nOfficials are often reluctant to risk making decisions that draw suspicion of corruption or political disloyalty, a Beijing think tank said last year.

{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "AS A CHILD in Bologna, the curator Alice Stori Liechtenstein was enchanted by a scene in Luchino Visconti\u2019s 1963 film, \u201cThe Leopard,\u201d in which the young nobleman Tancredi is asked how many rooms are in his family\u2019s castle. \u201cNo one knows, not even Uncle,\u201d he responds. \u201cHe says a palace in which one knows every room isn\u2019t worth living in.\u201d Twenty years later, in the early aughts, she posed the same question to her future husband, Alfred Liechtenstein, when they first visited his ancestral home, Schloss Hollenegg, in the east Austrian hills. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been in them all,\u201d he replied, even though he had inherited the castle, which has been in his family for nearly two centuries, when he was 26. (There are 52 rooms total, for the record.)\n\nAlfred, now 45, always knew Schloss Hollenegg was a magical place \u2014 like Disneyland, only real \u2014 with its Renaissance-style courtyard built by Abel von Hollenegg and renovated in 1550, its magnificent ballroom painted by Philipp Carl Laubmann in 1750 and its Baroque chapel open to local residents on Sundays. Portraits of his ancestors line the hallways, and a fresco of a family tree stretching back about 30 generations covers the library\u2019s vaulted ceiling. For Alfred, who grew up near the palace, Hollenegg was inexorably linked to his family; not to care for it as an adult would have been an unthinkable breach of duty.\n\nBut his 39-year-old wife, as she says, \u201cfought against this place for 11 years.\u201d Before they relocated to the rural castle in 2014, her life was unquestionably metropolitan; after attending boarding school in England and university in Milan, she began creating exhibitions for the city\u2019s annual Furniture Fair, eventually counting as clients the Milanese studio Atelier Biagetti, the online retailer Yoox and La Triennale di Milano. When she met Alfred, she was in graduate school in Barcelona, renting a one-bedroom apartment. \u201cLiving in a castle in the countryside was not the plan,\u201d she says, so the couple compromised by moving to Graz, 50 minutes from Hollenegg, which has an international airport. At first, she thought the castle would be a weekend getaway, but trying to manage her career throughout Europe, three young children and two homes quickly became untenable; and so, after a decade or so in Graz, the castle became the family\u2019s main residence.\n\nLike many very large old houses \u2014 and especially the hundreds of privately owned, inhabitable castles in Austria \u2014 Schloss Hollenegg was in a state of neglect; it hadn\u2019t been modernized since Alfred\u2019s grandmother died in 1974. The couple had to install proper bathrooms (previously, there were old toilets hidden behind screens in the hallways) and build an internal staircase. (The only access to the third-floor bedrooms was through the outdoor arcades.) Today, the family inhabits less than half of the 21,500-square-foot property, and apart from the early 18th-century Chinese wallpaper and the 18th-century kachelofen (German wood-burning clay stoves), the private quarters are contemporarily quotidian: the kids\u2019 rooms scattered with plastic toys; there\u2019s a projector mounted in the living room for movie nights; and the simple kitchen crowded with stainless steel appliances is smallish by American standards. But many of the largely unused spaces, from the staterooms with their 17th-century silk-covered walls, to the sumptuous \u201cgreen room\u201d with its original coffered ceiling, lack heat or electricity, which helps preserve their finishes in near-perfect condition. Despite the fact that the castle hadn\u2019t been fully occupied since 1991, when Alfred\u2019s grandfather died, all of its rooms require constant upkeep, even the uninhabited ones: There is silver to be polished, plaster to be patched, floors to be waxed. A significant portion of the income Alfred derives from his family\u2019s timber business \u2014 the grounds are thicketed with larches and spruces \u2014 goes toward property maintenance.\n\nThere is, after all, 900 years of history to maintain. The first records of the castle begin in 1163, but the structure is a palimpsest of a near-millennium of architectural trends: The worn limestone of the Renaissance-style stairway dates from 1577 and the bedrooms, with their Flemish tapestries and four-poster beds, from the late 18th century. The couple tried to restore the house with as many historically correct materials as they could \u2014 lime plaster to repair the delicate ceiling details, reclaimed wood to mend damaged parquet \u2014 but decided that any new additions would be unapologetically modern: their way of adding their names to the house\u2019s lineage and writing themselves, and their era, onto its walls. Upon entering the residence, you\u2019re struck with the first of these contributions, a trippy wallpapered and mirrored elevator by the German designer Markus Benesch, who covered the walls and floors with a disorienting pattern of Op Art Dalmatian spots. \u201cIt was a bit of shock the first time I saw it,\u201d Alfred says.\n\nVideo\n\nDESPITE THESE NEVER-ENDING renovations, Alice never quite felt she possessed the castle; something about it always frustrated her attempts to make it as much hers as her husband\u2019s. Then, in 2015 (around the time she reoriented her freelance business from exhibition design to personal curatorial projects), she decided that instead of the house merely being her dependent, it would become her partner. First, she conceived a showcase in Graz, inviting 23 designers whose work straddled art and design, including, among others, the Scottish designer Dean Brown and Peter Mabeo from Gaborone, Botswana, whose furniture fuses African craftsmanship with European influences. After being \u201csurprised when nearly everyone said yes,\u201d she says, Alice had a more ambitious idea: If Hollenegg was far from the world of contemporary design, why not bring that world to Hollenegg? In 2016, she asked Brown, along with the Viennese studio Mischer\u2019Traxler, known for conceptual pieces that blend handicraft with technology, and the Italian duo Dossofiorito, whose work often includes plants, to be her first designers-in-residence. They each spent a few weeks living at the castle, collaborating with Alice to create a site-specific work that would remain in Hollenegg\u2019s permanent collection, residing alongside the centuries-old furnishings. Brown installed a multidimensional \u00e9tag\u00e8re in a passageway overlooking one of the two courtyards to showcase various treasures collected over the years, such as an urn by Hilda Hellstrom and a collection of vases by Studio Furthermore. Dossofiorito created glass vases inspired by antique ceramics to hold bulbs, an homage to Alfred\u2019s grandmother, Princess Ludmilla, who loved gardening.\n\nPhoto\n\nAlice now chooses a few residents annually; with these designers, she is alternately nurturing and stern, encouraging them to draw on the history of the Schloss, to \u201cexplore all the rooms and open all the drawers,\u201d but not to get so lost that they don\u2019t finish their projects. Last fall, the Viennese design studio BreadedEscalope encountered in their wanderings the 19th-century diaries of Alfred\u2019s ancestor Heinrich Liechtenstein, an adventurer who hunted buffalo with U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and brought back redwood saplings from California, which now tower over the castle\u2019s walls. Alice let them cut down one of the trees to carve into a table and pair of stools.\n\nThe residents\u2019 pieces debut each May at a group show installed throughout Hollenegg, along with items from about 20 other visiting international designers whom Alice invites to present work. Last year\u2019s exhibition was titled \u201cMorphosis,\u201d referencing gradual but important adaptations that often go unnoticed. The opening night drew guests from Europe and the Middle East who danced to music played by a D.J. from Ibiza, injecting youth and life into rooms that are normally shuttered and silent. Alice opened the castle to the public for the following month, attracting curious locals who had lived in Hollenegg\u2019s shadow their whole lives yet had never seen its interiors. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cLegacy,\u201d prompting designers to explore the personal and collective importance of heritage, which has captivated Alice since hosting Hollenegg\u2019s first show, \u201cSlow,\u201d three years ago. Then as now, inspired by the pace of her more remote life, she wanted to re-examine the negative connotations that slowness has taken on in a culture that values the technological, the futuristic and the fast above all else. Indeed, now that Alice has embraced her countryside castle, she\u2019s developed a broader sense of family and community, but also of time itself. \u201cWhen you live in the city it\u2019s all about me: my apartment, my job,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, I see life on a larger scale \u2014 it\u2019s not about the next generation, but the next three generations.

The system was supposed to keep unfiltered outside air from entering the home.\n\nMore frequently, whenever it rains, Mr. Ghandour said there are several rooms that have water leaks, including an HVAC room with sensitive electronic equipment. The house, which is divided into three separate structures, includes a building that was designed to hold a sauna, steam room and showers. Mr. Ghandour said the leaking is so bad in that building that it sits unfinished and entirely empty.\n\nBack in 2009, when planning for the project began, Mr. Ghandour, the founder of a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm, said he interviewed four contractors and ultimately decided to take the unusual step of hiring a commercial builder after being approached by a well-known company. He said they sold him on the idea that they would be perfect for the job because a home as large as his wouldn\u2019t be like building a typical single-family house. So why hire a typical homebuilder? Plus, the exterior his architect designed would have more in common with an office building or commercial space.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company he hired was Lendlease, best known for its construction work on high-profile projects like the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center, the Sydney Opera House in Australia and the Petronas Twin Towers skyscrapers in Malaysia. \u201cLendlease sold me on that they\u2019d be able to translate that experience into high-end homes,\u201d Mr. Ghandour said.\n\nThough representatives of Lendlease told him they hadn\u2019t yet built any comparable luxury homes, Mr. Ghandour said he was assured that his project would get special attention because it would be their first. \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019ll start a new line of business and this will be the showcase, the showpiece,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nLendlease declined to comment on Mr. Ghandour\u2019s characterization of its proposal or confirm whether the company had previously built any luxury homes of that scale. A spokeswoman said the company has built more than 400 residential projects, mostly in military master-planned sustainable communities for the Department of Defense.\n\nMr. Ghandour said he pleaded with Lendlease to get its subcontractors to fix various problems along the way. At one point, he said, Lendlease stopped responding, so he hired a high-profile construction lawyer, Robert Mann, to pursue a legal claim against Lendlease in 2016. He wants the company to pay for the necessary repairs he has made, plus other damage he still needs to fix. \u201cWhat I was hoping for them from the beginning was that they\u2019d just do a good job,\u201d Mr. Ghandour said. \u201cAnd if they didn\u2019t do that, then they\u2019d fix whatever wasn\u2019t done right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentatives from Lendlease said they were unable to comment on any of Mr. Ghandour\u2019s claims because the case is now in binding arbitration. \u201cWe disagree with Mr. Ghandour\u2019s claims and regret that the matter has gone this far without resolution,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

An exterior stucco wall, for example, was meant to look smooth but instead has the look of crumpled paper that has been somewhat flattened. Mr. Ghandour said Lendlease\u2019s subcontractor unsuccessfully attempted to fix it four times.\n\nOther areas of the house could be even harder to repair. A large room at the top of the stairs was framed crookedly, six inches out of square, said Mr. Mann, the lawyer. Mr. Ghandour said he didn\u2019t notice the error until the room\u2019s hardwood floors had been laid down and there was a gap that required an awkward triangular piece to fill.\n\nNow \u201cit basically can\u2019t be fixed\u201d without reframing the building, Mr. Mann said. He also said the home\u2019s drywall was of a low-quality finish more commonly found in tract homes or lower-end commercial buildings. Replacing it would be extremely costly and would likely require Mr. Ghandour and his family to move out for several months.\n\nMr. Ghandour said the toll on his family life has been \u201cdevastating.\u201d During construction, he moved his family four times, signing short-term leases after receiving assurances that he would be able to move into his home soon. By the time the property was cleared for occupancy, his oldest daughter had gone away to college. He said the stress of the project also took a toll on his marriage. \u201cWe\u2019re still patching it back together,\u201d he said.\n\nJason Kellogg, a South Florida-based construction litigation lawyer who isn\u2019t involved in Mr. Ghandour\u2019s case, said the recent boom in mega-mansion building has prompted a growing number of inexperienced builders to try to get into the business.\n\nThough very large homes are in some ways similar to commercial structures, he said, mega-mansions are still best handled by contractors who have experience building large residences.

I grabbed my family, and we rushed out of that city. But I had to return the next day to report on the victims and their injuries. It was unbearably sad and even though I ran the marathon the next year; even though was supposed to be a celebration of resilience, I did not feel that way at all. I remembered too well what had happened to those bombing victims.\n\nSo, of course, I read the minimum about the Parkland shooting. I knew the basics. A teenager went into a Florida high school on Valentine\u2019s Day, armed with a military style weapon, and began shooting. In six minutes he killed 14 students and three staff members and injured many others.\n\nThen my editors asked me to write about assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used in Parkland and what they do to the human body. My big concern was that the story had to be compelling enough that someone like me \u2014 who would rather not know \u2014 would start it and read it to the end. That meant, as always, writing for an audience of one \u2014 me. And I did not want to be polemical. This was not the place to rail about gun laws. It was going to be a story about the destruction assault type weapons can wreak.\n\nIt began as a solo project. But my editor, Celia Dugger, ultimately suggested bringing in C.J. Chivers. At the start, I knew nothing about guns; C.J., on the other hand, is a Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter who modestly says he has \u201csome seeming fluency here from a lot of years of writing about weapons, and from being in the infantry.\u201d His tweaks to my language describing weapons and bullets made such a difference that it was only right to share the byline with him.\n\nAs for the reporting, I began by finding trauma surgeons who had been in the military and cared for shooting victims. I knew a few, because I had written about Representative Steve Scalise, who was shot while practicing baseball last summer and spent months recovering from a bullet that cracked his bones and rended his internal organs. One surgeon, who said he cannot speak on the record, connected me with others who could.\n\nStill, was I just going to get the same story over and over about trying to repair wounds? Could a surgeon explain more than just how to repair an injury? And was a military assault weapon, the M16, pretty much the same as an AR-15, the gun the shooter used, in terms of the damage they could inflict?\n\nThe effects of the weapons\u2019 bullets, I soon discovered, were pretty much equivalent. Through the eyes of each surgeon, however, I saw a different picture.\n\nOne told me about the nature of the wounds. He\u2019d see a little hole where the bullet entered and think it was not so bad. Then he\u2019d turn the patient over, and see an exit wound that could be a foot wide.\n\nAnother told me what it looks like when a victim arrives at the operating room, bones shattered, organs shredded: \u201cIt\u2019s like a bomb went off.\u201d\n\nFor me, it found that it reading about these horrors was different than reporting on them. It\u2019s hard to explain why; perhaps it\u2019s something like the experience of those who tend to the wounded, that detachment they wear like shields.\n\nWhen I thought I was done with the story, I was put in touch with Dr. Lillian Liao, a surgeon who cared for children shot with an AR-15 in the November Sutherland Springs church shooting. Dr. Liao was professional; she seemed almost dispassionate as she described grievous injuries. But when I asked her if it affected her, she told me two things.\n\nDr. Liao was focused on getting the children stable enough to return home \u2014 although they faced many operations and are still being treated at her hospital, University Hospital and UT Health in San Antonio. She knew they would need rehabilitation to help them learn to walk or use their arms again. She knew they were seeing psychiatrists to help with the trauma.\n\nThen, about two weeks later, she began to think about what had happened \u2014 these children\u2019s lives would never be the same.\n\nShe went on, putting the horror behind her.

There is also the possibility that one partner in a heterosexual relationship is gay.\n\nNew love is intoxicating, and I\u2019m not being metaphorical. A functional MRI study suggests that new love activates the reward centers of the brain and, like opioids, increases pain tolerance. I wonder how much the drug that is new love affects libido? If some men and women are simply on a lower libido spectrum in everyday life, might they revert to that once this \u201clove drug\u201d subsides, leaving those with a higher libido frustrated?\n\nI want women to know that if they are on the wanting end for sex, they are not alone. If you love the person you\u2019re with, then the sooner you speak up, the better. You can try what I did \u2014 sleeping naked and scheduling sex \u2014 because the more you have sex, the more you may want to have it, if you\u2019re doing it right and it feels good. However, if things are not changing in the way you want, you may need help from a couples counselor, a sex therapist, a clinical psychologist or a medical doctor, depending on the situation.\n\nWaiting until months or even years have passed can weaponize the bedroom. It will add so much more complexity because resentment compounds like a high-interest credit card.\n\nSexuality and relationships are complex, and there are no easy answers. It\u2019s not good or bad to have a high, a medium or a low libido. You like what you like, but if you don\u2019t speak up about what you want, you can\u2019t expect the other person to know.\n\nOur society seems almost built on the erroneous idea that all men want sex all the time, so I imagine it would be hard for men to admit to a lower libido, even anonymously.

Last August, the restaurant and accommodation sector had 742,000 vacancies, a historic high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nStemming the flow of low-skilled immigrants could pressure employers to raise wages, compelling many Americans, including millions who are chronically unemployed, to get back to work. \u201cIt may draw all these people, or some fraction of these people, into the labor force,\u201d posited Steven Camarota, research director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration.\n\nIndeed, more people would do blue-collar work they now shun if wages were higher \u2014 but not enough of them would, according to Chris Tilly, a labor economist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWage is not the main issue,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are also expectations and status.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "Foreign policy experts are betting on a fantasy, one mostly confined to the Acela Express. Those experts who seek to shape public opinion, to judge by their columns, interviews and tweets, have faced this responsibility only halfway. The president could not be luckier. Little short of catastrophe will vindicate his critics. Mr. Trump can clear their low bar by being unspectacularly awful. More important, the current debate does nothing to forge a future foreign policy that improves on what preceded Mr. Trump\u2019s election. Far from devising alternatives, experts are shutting down needed debate by collapsing America\u2019s interests into an abstract \u201corder.\u201d They increasingly resemble the \u201cglobalists\u201d whom candidate Trump derided.\n\nThe irony is, Mr. Trump was wrong. Policymakers have always put American interests first, adjusting (or defying) the rules accordingly. In 1945, Harry Truman met Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin in war-torn Potsdam, Germany. If this was the moment of creation of the \u201cliberal international order,\u201d as today\u2019s commentators maintain, Truman did not know it. (Neither he nor his advisers used the phrase.) The frustrated president wrote to his wife, Bess, \u201cI have to make it perfectly plain to them at least once a day that so far as this President is concerned Santa Claus is dead and that my first interest is U.S.A.\u201d\n\nTruman understood what Mr. Trump\u2019s critics implicitly deny: the possibility that American power can come at the expense of others. The foreign policy establishment clings to the fiction that what\u2019s good for America is necessarily good for the world. They condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs as an unthinkable breach even though the United States has employed protectionist measures throughout history. They pretend that Mr. Trump, having vowed to take things from the world, must be diminishing American power when he seeks to expand it. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions may not have their intended effect, but the most logical and cutting response isn\u2019t that he is weakening America but that he\u2019s trying to strengthen it in a way we should not want. His outpouring of militarism and chauvinism may or may not reduce the United States\u2019 influence. It does, however, threaten to turn the world\u2019s sole superpower into an unabashed purveyor of violence and exploitation.\n\nLet\u2019s call Mr. Trump\u2019s vision what it is: radical American imperialism. He does not so much break with tradition as bring forward some of its most retrograde but persistent elements. Recognizing this is the start of an honest conversation about the Trump administration and America\u2019s role in a changing world. So far, however, the right has come closer to grasping this point than the left or the center. Mr. Trump and his supporters do identify a conflict (indeed, almost endless conflict) between America\u2019s interests and the world\u2019s. As Rush Limbaugh recently put it, Mr. Trump wants to restore the \u201cprimacy of the United States,\u201d whereas his critics think \u201cAmerican leadership should preside over the weakening of America.\u201d The point is perverse, but it is coherent. Fearing decline, the Trumpian right seeks to get tough with the world and take all it can.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s challenge can be met. As distributional conflicts surge in domestic politics, they are surging in foreign policy, too \u2014 and those who ignore them lose out to those who inflate them. Citizens seeking a better foreign policy ought to be engaged, not ignored. But recent events cast doubt on whether our current crop of experts is up to the job.\n\nDemocracy requires experts but it also requires something from them: that they facilitate public debate and respect the ultimate power of the electorate to set the aims of the nation. By rallying behind the lowest common denominator of \u201canything but Trump,\u201d they are disengaging the public\u2019s discontent, pulling up the drawbridge until the next election. In that sense, Donald Trump is not the only one who might be called an isolationist.", "title": "Opinion | When the Leader of the Free World Is an Ugly American", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cIt was all about propaganda and P.R.,\u201d said Jonathan Bikker, the curator of the Rijksmuseum exhibition. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the monarchy and the high nobility had such a strong hold on that format. They made it associated with them and them alone.\u201d\n\nThe nobility would often use the full-length portrait to celebrate the union of two influential families. Such was the case with Henry IV, duke of Saxony, and his bride, Catherine of Mecklenburg, whose 1514 portraits by the German artist Lucas Cranach the Elder were opulently adorned in the colors of their coats of arms. The continuation of a powerful dynasty could also by emphasized by the inclusion of children.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe association of the nobility attracted the Dutch bourgeoisie to the format in the 17th century. Having gained wealth and power, they used their portraits to claim a comparable importance. Those who could afford such lavish works of art hung them in the entrance halls of their canalside houses to show visitors that they were members of an exclusive club. \u201cOnly 20 of these portraits that were made in Amsterdam between 1618 and \u201939 have survived, and they\u2019re all of the city elite,\u201d said Mr. Bikker.\n\nArtists had a variety of methods to highlight their clients\u2019 status. Rembrandt, for example, used his masterful skill in depicting texture and fabric to draw attention to the wealth of the prominent Amsterdam citizens Marten Soolmans and his bride, Oopjen Coppit, in their portraits. It is a common misconception that the Dutch of that era wore black out of puritan self-restraint \u2014 as the Rijksmuseum\u2019s curator of costume, Bianca du Mortier, explained, that could not be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cBlack was very expensive because it involved a complex dyeing process,\u201d she said. Wearing it was a sign of status, particularly when it was elaborately embellished, as in the Rembrandt example.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the 18th century, when the full-length portrait was at its peak in Britain, two very different social groups took advantage of its promotional opportunities. Aristocratic women, like Jane Fleming, would flaunt their beauty and elegance with help from masters of the genre such as Joshua Reynolds, while aristocratic men would show off their personal or professional accomplishments. The intention was the same: to enhance their reputation in society.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the other group were the growing ranks of professional actors and actresses whose successes had made them independently wealthy. They commissioned portraits in their most admired roles as a form of self-promotion. Both groups benefited from the creation of the Royal Academy, Britain\u2019s first combined art school and exhibition space, where many portraits were first exhibited, giving them unrivaled public exposure.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Belle \u00c9poque, the period of optimism and economic prosperity in Europe from 1871 to 1914, was the heyday for this most sumptuous of portrait formats. In the aftermath of the French, American and Industrial Revolutions, a newly rich clientele clamored for the ultimate drawing room accessory to emphasize their entry into high society.\n\nFor women like Virginie Gautreau, a noted Paris beauty who prided herself on pale skin that she maintained by drinking arsenic, \u201cit was important to be painted at full-length because it really showed that you belonged\u201d to the elite, Mr. Bikker said. However, for Madame Gautreau, it backfired spectacularly. Her deathly pallor and daringly low-cut dress caused a major scandal when the portrait was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1884. Madame Gautreau was humiliated, and the portraitist, the American painter John Singer Sargent, fled to England. The work (not included in the exhibition) became known as \u201cMadame X.\u201d\n\nIt is doubtful if such a thing would have bothered Marchesa Luisa Casati, a woman who wore live snakes as jewelry and paraded around her hometown, Venice, with a pair of cheetahs on leashes. The marchesa was painted in her prime by Giovanni Boldini in 1908; the bold brush strokes, confident pose and penetrating gaze perfectly sum up a woman whose aim in life was to be nothing less than a work of art.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe striking images created of her and of others like her were drawing attention from fashion designers who realized that having a celebrated sitter dressed in one of their creations was an opportunity for mutual publicity. At the request of Les Modes, a French fashion magazine, Boldini\u2019s painting of the marchesa was exhibited at the couturier Jacques Doucet\u2019s fashion house in Paris, with his creations displayed around it.\n\nIt was an early indicator of the link between personality and commerce that gathered momentum as the century progressed. In the aftermath of World War I, the extravagance of the full-length portrait came to be seen as excessive and the formal society that the portrait relied on began to disintegrate.\n\nA new breed of celebrity turned to news releases and magazine covers to shape their image. But while those ephemeral means are soon forgotten, the full-length portrait will dazzle for centuries to come.", "title": "When the Old Masters Were the P.R.

The city\u2019s Housing Maintenance Code sets minimum standards for things like health and safety, fire protection, cleanliness and building maintenance. According to the code, owners and residents are required to keep roofs, yards and other open spaces clean and free from dirt, filth, garbage and offensive material.

You could also ask the doorman or superintendent for the name. Write the managing agent a letter explaining the situation and asking management to address it. This might be enough to solve the problem. However, if the trash problem continues, call 311 and report the issue to the city. If an inspector finds that the state of the balcony violates city rules, the building will receive a violation.

He has been the most political head of the agency since William Casey in the 1980s. Mr. Pompeo has repeatedly stepped out of the proper role of an intelligence director to be an advocate for hawkish policies.

Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 in an attempt to convince Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un\u2019s father, to halt his ballistic missile program, she attended a mass propaganda performance that included an image of the very missile she was trying to get North Korea to curtail.\n\nJeju Island, South Korea\n\nThe governor of the South Korean island of Jeju has proposed holding the meeting there.

When Marshal Jo Myong-rok, a high-level North Korean military official, visited Washington in 2000 to invite Mr. Clinton to Pyongyang, he first met with Dr. Albright while wearing a business suit.

And in the city, there is a huge Museum of Genocide Victims.\n\nThat, however, is where the glowing picture suddenly becomes murky.\n\nUntil recent years, the museum, in what was once the headquarters for the Nazi S.S. and later the K.G.B., the Soviet secret police and intelligence apparatus, did not even mention the Holocaust, in which the German Nazis used Lithuanian partisans and police to round up and kill the country\u2019s Jews.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore Jews were killed in Lithuania, in actual numbers as well as percentages, than German Jews who died in far more populous Germany.", "title": "Where the Genocide Museum Is (Mostly) Mum on the Fate of Jews", "authors": ["Rod Nordland"]}

Sitting as high as 3,600 feet, Upcountry, as this 200-square-mile area by Haleakala Volcano is called, has cooler temperatures (at night it can approach freezing) and more eucalyptus trees than coconut palms. It became an agricultural center in the late 1700s, when a British naval captain gave Hawaii\u2019s King Kamehameha I a herd of longhorn cattle that spawned an entire ranching industry. There aren\u2019t as many paniolos (Hawaiian cowboys) today as there were in the 19th century, but several big ranches remain, as does a general appreciation for living off the land: In addition to the ranches, there are coffee farms, lavender fields and scenic hiking loops through forest reserves.\n\nMany of Upcountry\u2019s 38,000 residents (less than one-fourth of Maui\u2019s overall population) live in and around its small, historic towns, which include Haiku, Pukalani and Makawao, former pineapple plantations and ranch communities established in the 1800s. As industrialization forced plantation owners to downsize post-World War II, the families of the primarily Hawaiian, Chinese, Portuguese and Japanese workers who remained were joined in the 1960s and \u201970s by a wave of mainland hippies looking to get off the grid. (Willie Nelson and Mick Fleetwood have homes nearby.) Over the past decade or so, the area\u2019s relatively cheap housing and temperate climate have attracted all sorts of wanderers, dropouts and seekers, including jewelry makers, woodworkers and glassblowers, as well as a new generation of farmers growing organic produce (poha berries, lilikoi) for local restaurants. (The cuisine here leans more toward Proven\u00e7al than taco truck.) And so, these days, Upcountry is worth more than just a drive-through on the way to the rocky, rust-colored terrain of the island\u2019s most spectacular national attraction: Haleakala Crater, 10,023 feet above sea level and best experienced at sunrise, when the ghostly fog lifts to reveal peaks and valleys all around.

And through his presence, he has provoked the ire of Scottsdale and neighboring Paradise Valley\u2019s retirees and vacationers, some of who have been complaining about their famous neighbor on social media.\n\nMr. Weinstein has lost weight. He still works his Rolodex \u2014 or at least tries to. But in the Hollywood caste system, the publicists-for-hire, the striving producers, the up-and-coming directors who used to endure his verbal lashings and entertain his every whim now mostly don\u2019t pick up, according to several such people who said they avoid his calls.\n\nThe man behind \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d has already made some efforts to produce his most challenging film yet, these people say: a documentary designed to pave the way for a comeback. So far, no one will touch it.

But paying his legal teams, led by Blair Berk in Hollywood and Benjamin Brafman in Manhattan, and his ongoing divorce, have chipped away at that fortune, said several people close to Mr. Weinstein.\n\nLast week, the Weinstein Company, once a crown jewel of moviemaking, said that it would file for bankruptcy, after the collapse of sale talks with an investor group.\n\nThe failed deal followed a lawsuit filed last month by Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, intended to block the fire sale of Weinstein Company. The suit includes new details about the studio\u2019s \u201ctoxic environment for women\u201d and Mr. Weinstein\u2019s \u201cunlawful conduct,\u201d including using female employees to help him pursue sexual targets and to procure and administer erectile dysfunction medication.", "title": "Where\u2019s Harvey?", "authors": []}

Smith, Pew\u2019s associate director of research, who also noted a nine-point drop among evangelical men. \u201cBoth groups have become less approving over time.\u201d\n\nIf that drop in support translates into a lack of enthusiasm among core Trump supporters in the midterm elections in November, as it did for many of President Barack Obama\u2019s voters in 2010, the Republican Party could be more vulnerable in its efforts to maintain control of Congress. In 2020, it would also possibly open a lane for a primary challenger to the president.\n\nThe women in suburban Dallas all conceded they have cringed sometimes at Mr. Trump, citing his pettiness, impulsiveness, profanity and name calling. Still, they defended him because he delivered on issues they cared most about, such as the appointment of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cCertainly we are all embarrassed, but for the most part he represents what we stand for,\u201d said Ms. Leonhart, who is active in the women\u2019s ministry at her church.\n\nA clear majority of white evangelical women, even in the face of the #MeToo movement and renewed claims of marital infidelity against the president, continue, along with white evangelical men, to form Mr. Trump\u2019s most cohesive block of support.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s ability to connect so strongly with evangelical voters was among the most notable surprises of the 2016 campaign. Since his election, he has courted evangelical leaders aggressively and, more important, has delivered on promises to appoint conservatives like Justice Gorsuch to federal courts. Men who see themselves as leaders of religious conservatives, such as Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, have remained doggedly supportive.\n\nAnd the majority of evangelical women remain in his corner.\n\nBut it has not been easy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know any evangelical woman who is going to defend the character of the president,\u201d said Carmen Fowler LaBerge, host of \u201cThe Reconnect,\u201d an evangelical-centered radio show.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMany things the president says and does are things that many evangelicals use as examples with our kids of what we should not do,\u201d added Ms. LaBerge, who did not support Mr. Trump in 2016. \u201cThis is not who we are as evangelicals. This is not how we treat people.\u201d\n\nSome evangelical women simply keep their views private. Gathered at a well-appointed home in Falls Church, Va., last week, eight Christian women agreed to talk about their feelings about the president, on one condition: that they not be identified.\n\nThey feared reprisal in the workplace, at their children\u2019s schools, even at their church.

One of the women said that her parents had come to the United States illegally from El Salvador and that she was born a short time later. Her father is now a citizen. She supports Mr. Trump and his hard-line plans on immigration.\n\n\u201cI would say that this year has only made me more of a certain supporter,\u201d said another of the women, Joanna, who agreed to be identified only by her first name. \u201cI\u2019ve been really excited to see him come through with his promises, one by one, against incredible odds.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a tension among evangelical women. They said they largely cast their votes against Hillary Clinton more than for Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cAt least in my experience, it was more of an anti-Hillary vote than a pro-Trump vote,\u201d Ms. LaBerge said.\n\nKaren Swallow Prior, a professor at Liberty University who opposed Mr. Trump and voted for a third-party candidate, said, \u201cNow that Trump is in office and we are evaluating his performance then, I am glad to see that people are less in lock step and thinking critically about him as a leader, and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that his overall support would decline from 80 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was one of those culture war evangelicals in the \u201980s and \u201990s,\u201d Ms. Swallow Prior said. \u201cI was appalled by the candidacy and presidency of Bill Clinton. It was hammered into my mind that character mattered, and that did change when Trump came along. In some ways, I felt betrayed by my evangelical peers who taught me and cemented in me the idea that character matters. I didn\u2019t abandon that belief. I feel like some evangelicals did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer outspoken criticism is all the more notable given that the president of Liberty University, Mr. Falwell, remains one of the president\u2019s most vocal defenders.\n\nEvangelical voters, often portrayed as a monolith, are becoming increasingly difficult to define. The support for Mr. Trump reflects a growing pragmatism among evangelical voters who are willing to accept a less than ideal model of Christian faith in exchange for policies that they endorse.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ve become experienced and very practical,\u201d said Frances FitzGerald, the author of the recent book \u201cThe Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America.\u201d \u201cBy large majorities they used to believe that to be elected, you had to be of good character. No longer.

The sanctions also targeted two other organizations and six individuals in response to various cyberattacks dating to March 2016, including a previously unconfirmed attempt to penetrate the American energy grid.\n\n\u201cThe administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyberactivity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyberattacks and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cThese targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.\u201d\n\nMoscow dismissed the move as political. \u201cThis is purely tied to the internal American infighting,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov, a deputy foreign minister, told the Interfax news agency. \u201cThis is also tied to our elections calendar.\u201d\n\nPresident Vladimir V.

What famous, accomplished or fascinating person in history perhaps may not have received a Times obituary and should be added? Why?\n\nIn an introduction to the project, Amisha Padnani and Jessica Bennett write:\n\nObituary writing is more about life than death: the last word, a testament to a human contribution. Yet who gets remembered \u2014 and how \u2014 inherently involves judgment. To look back at the obituary archives can, therefore, be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers. Since 1851, The New York Times has published thousands of obituaries: of heads of state, opera singers, the inventor of Stove Top stuffing and the namer of the Slinky. The vast majority chronicled the lives of men, mostly white ones; even in the last two years, just over one in five of our subjects were female. Charlotte Bront\u00eb wrote \u201cJane Eyre\u201d; Emily Warren Roebling oversaw construction of the Brooklyn Bridge when her husband fell ill; Madhubala transfixed Bollywood; Ida B. Wells campaigned against lynching. Yet all of their deaths went unremarked in our pages, until now.\n\nWilliam McDonald, the Times obituary editor, wrote a companion piece about how obituaries are chosen, and addresses its lacks:\n\nI\u2019d like to think that those portrayed in Overlooked would be prime candidates for an obit in The Times today \u2014 precisely because they fit a broader standard of significance and impact and, by the way, offer compelling stories. So why not more women and people of color on the obituary pages? (Why, for that matter, not more openly gay people, or transgender people?) The larger answer: Because relatively few of them were allowed to make such a mark on society in their own time. Universities may have barred them. Businesses and political parties may have shut them out. The tables of power were crowded with white men; there were few seats for anyone else.\n\nStudents: Scroll through the entire collection, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Which of these women in the first collection interest you most? Why?\n\n\u2014 Were you surprised that some of these women did not receive Times obituaries originally?\n\n\u2014 What do you think the criteria should be for choosing who deserves an obituary in the Times, and why?\n\n\u2014 Would you want to become well-known enough to merit an obituary when you die? If so, what would you want the headline or first line of it to read?", "title": "Who Do You Think Has Been \u2018Overlooked\u2019 By History?", "authors": []}

She served several years as an aide to other politicians, including Gov. Jerry Brown when he was mayor of Oakland, and was elected to the City Council in 2010. Four years later she was elected mayor.\n\nAs a former lawyer, Ms. Schaaf understands the potential pitfalls in warning unauthorized immigrants of an impending raid. But she approaches the issue in the style of an activist.\n\nAsked what her message was for immigrants who are in Oakland illegally, Ms. Schaaf said: \u201cYour city wants you to be safe, wants to keep your family together and is proud to have you as part of our community.\u201d\n\nHousing affordability has been a concern during her tenure.\n\nThe past few years have been a time of wrenching change for Oakland. The wealth generated by the tech industry across the San Francisco Bay is pushing up housing prices and making many neighborhoods unaffordable to any family not earning six figures. The economic pressures have caused the number of homeless people to rise to around 2,800, an increase of more than 25 percent since Ms. Schaaf took office in January 2015.\n\nIn the city that gave rise to the Black Panthers, the African-American community has been shrinking drastically, from 47 percent of the population in the 1980 census to less than one quarter today. As black residents have moved out, Latinos and Asian-Americans have moved in.\n\nMs. Schaaf has had to balance the courting of technology companies with the changes to the traditional working-class character of the city. \u201cHey, Google: You wouldn\u2019t need all those buses if you\u2019d open an office over here,\u201d she was quoted as saying on the day of her swearing in.\n\nIn December 2016, when 36 young people died in a fire at a warehouse that had been converted into an illegal artist colony and party venue, the subtext was that the shortage of affordable housing had pushed artists into dangerous living conditions. In the aftermath of the Ghost Ship fire, as it is known, Ms. Schaaf juggled the competing demands for greater safety with concerns from artists that they might be forced to leave the city if fire codes were strictly enforced. She was criticized for not disciplining or removing the city\u2019s fire chief, who in the years before the Ghost Ship fire had been accused of keeping the department understaffed and disorganized.\n\nA police scandal rocked the city on her watch.\n\nThe Ghost Ship fire was the worst structural fire in America in more than a decade.

Where do you currently reside?\n\nDaytona Beach, FL. And no, I\u2019ve never been to a race.\n\n2. Where and when was your first puzzle published?\n\nSometime in the late 1970s. It was a Sunday New York Times puzzle. That\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know any better. [Sunday crosswords are significantly harder to construct because of their size. I didn\u2019t know any better when I debuted, either. \u2014 D. A.]\n\n3. How did you get into puzzling? What is your first memory of solving?\n\nI remember getting Dell crossword magazines in elementary school \u2014 I always loved puzzles of all kinds, including math ones. And in grad school, I had a friend who did the Sunday New York Times puzzle and tried to get me into it. I was used to Sunday addicts. My grandfather always, always worked that puzzle. If we went over there on a Sunday, he was sure to comment on punny answers, or obscure ones. There was no Google to the rescue back then.\n\n4. What made you decide to try your hand at making a crossword puzzle?\n\nI worked on a weekly newspaper written in very easy English, aimed at ESL students and adults with low reading levels. The editor used a puzzle from some adult education publication. It was supposed to be easy but I could see that it wasn\u2019t: uncrossed letters, unheard-of abbreviations. So I asked if I could spend some time making one up. I started doing it for every issue, kind of developing my own criteria. That\u2019s when I joked I would do one for The New York Times and a co-worker called my bluff. In fact, I am still making up those easy puzzles, more than 35 years after I left that job! They don\u2019t follow standard rules and are great for airports and doctors\u2019 offices.\n\n5. Why do you do this to yourself?\n\nI\u2019m tempted to say, because I can. But really, it\u2019s fun \u2014 at least, most of the time. And it\u2019s a great excuse for not cleaning or shopping.\n\n6. Do you use a computer software constructing program and, if so, which one? What do you like about it?\n\nI use Crossword Compiler. What\u2019s not to like? After doing them by hand for so long, I suddenly didn\u2019t have to reinvent every clue every time, didn\u2019t have to worry about blackening the wrong square, could check for duplications, could see fill options I never would have thought of. A whole new world.\n\n7. How many hours a week, on average, do you spend on refining your tools, like your word list?\n\nRefining my tools? LOL. Hardly ever.\n\n8. What entry or entries would you NEVER put in a puzzle, and why?\n\nOh my gosh, there are so many entries I\u2019ve never used, and which I hope I\u2019m never desperate enough to allow. AMAH. ITEN. ETUIS. TEN A.M./SIX P.M., et cetera. RESEE. AM TOO/ARE TOO/AM SO. It\u2019s a very long list. And I try very hard to avoid things like ACNE and OBESE, which will have unpleasant associations for lots of people.\n\nThank you for spending time with us, Ms. Lempel.\n\nYour thoughts?", "title": "Who Made My Puzzle?: Lynn Lempel", "authors": ["Deb Amlen"]}

One longstanding pagan group, Forn Sed, has encouraged the use of Viking symbols like a wooden Thor\u2019s hammer as an icon for gay pride.\n\nBut some use of the symbols reflects an extremist side of the Viking cultural renaissance taking hold across the Nordic region and beyond.\n\nPhoto\n\nAvowed neo-Nazi groups like the small but violent Nordic Resistance Movement say they draw inspiration from the Viking era and have adopted elements of the region\u2019s Viking past.

Mr. Lundberg said membership in his group required a stated commitment against racial discrimination.\n\nAfter the ceremony by the Viking burial mound concluded \u2014 with offerings beneath a fir tree of carrots, eggs, flowers, grapes and the final sloshes of leftover beer and mead \u2014 Mr. Sonevang, the Nordic Asa Community spokesman, described his organization\u2019s goal as promoting Nordic heritage and tradition.\n\n\u201cThe more the world is in chaos, the more people are looking back to where they come from,\u201d Mr. Sonevang said. \u201cThat is where they feel safe. That is why they turn to Asatru,\u201d he added, using a word to describe the Norse religion.\n\nMr. Sonevang, who changed his first name to Stenar after deciding that Stefan sounded too Christian and therefore inappropriate for a pagan, formerly held positions in his local chapter of the Sweden Democrats. The staunchly anti-immigrant party is expected, according to polls, to consolidate its place in Sweden\u2019s political mainstream in an election in September.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "But the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Earle G. Wheeler, had different goals. He was less concerned about Westmoreland\u2019s immediate priorities in Vietnam than with the state of America\u2019s strategic reserves at home. The picture was indeed dire: By the time of Tet, apart from troops held for a Soviet attack in Europe, only the 82nd Airborne Division and parts of Marine divisions in the United States were left in reserve. Units all across the military had also been stripped of many specialists to properly support the Vietnam force.\n\nIn response, Wheeler had been trying to get Johnson to approve mobilization of the Reserves for nearly a year, but Johnson had turned him down. Wheeler needed a fresh, big appeal. The Tet offensive gave him an opportunity.\n\nEarly in February 1968 the chairman, in back-channel messages to Westmoreland, solicited requests for reinforcements, and told the field commander not to feel bound by previous \u2014 that is 1967 \u2014 force structure ceilings. Westy took the bait; his replies had initially asked for pretty much all the troops left in the strategic reserve as \u201cemergency\u201d reinforcements. Thus a bigger request, which could not be filled by active-duty forces, met Wheeler\u2019s needs.\n\nJohnson approved the emergency augmentation on Feb. 12, the same day Westmoreland sent a dispatch looking ahead to new reinforcements on top of those, as Wheeler had invited him to do. Five days later Johnson went to Fort Bragg, N.C., to watch the Third Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division board planes, and then flitted across the country to Camp Pendleton, Calif., to watch a similar departure of Marines. There remained the question of the bigger troop request.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

He toured battlefields, met with South Vietnamese and American commanders; attended briefings at the headquarters of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam; and conferred with Westmoreland. Together the two generals talked numbers, and they finally asked Johnson for 206,000 more troops for the American force in South Vietnam. (That request, as it happens, was almost identical to Westmoreland\u2019s troop request called Program 5, in early 1967, which had already caught on the shoals of presidential reluctance.) Wheeler\u2019s report to Washington, compiled as his jet winged eastward across the Pacific on Feb. 27, contained statistics on the recent fighting, covered American efforts to improve the South Vietnamese armed forces and argued in favor of the enlarged troop request.\n\nThough the request was secret, it was politically fraught. With public opposition to the Vietnam War mounting, a reserve mobilization would underline that Congress had never declared war, while other legal pillars, like the Tonkin Gulf Resolution, were increasingly shaky. Mobilization also meant increased military spending, with the American economy already overheated. Foresighted investors, wary of inflation, had now begun trading their dollars for gold. Johnson, who had previously sought a tax surcharge to pay for the war, had in front of him the example of Britain, which in 1967 had tried to meet its problems with a disastrous devaluation of the pound. Johnson had an election coming up in November 1968; he did not want to be seen as weak in the face of crisis, but he realized a big troop deployment coming after what had been represented as military victory would resonate poorly.\n\nAt that point the ship of state sprang a leak. At a reception on March 1, 1968, Edwin L. Dale, a reporter with The New York Times\u2019s Washington bureau, heard a college classmate say that top Pentagon officials were opposed to any big troop increase. (The received wisdom is that the official at the other end of this was Townsend Hoopes, under secretary of the Air Force.) So alerted, The Times put its State Department correspondent, Hedrick Smith, and its Pentagon watcher, Neil Sheehan, to work on the story.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSmith needed less than a day to learn the number \u201c206,000\u201d from a Capitol Hill source. The two reporters garnered multiple confirmations, but more important to note is that they had the story quite quickly \u2014 Wheeler\u2019s report had thudded onto Washington desks just five days before its secret was out. The reporters spent some days adding to their story and polishing it, and The Times pushed publication back a day to get the bigger play of a Sunday edition, and then there it was, in The New York Times of March 10, 1968.\n\nSimultaneous events were applying other pressures on the president. The reinforcement request immediately led the new secretary of defense, Clark M. Clifford, to demand an \u201cA to Z\u201d reassessment of the American position in Vietnam. While various draft memorandums for the president argued that the request could be met, they also warned of serious consequences, including budget increases in the billions, balance of payments shortfalls, new tax requirements, a Reserve call as steep as 262,000 men, bigger draft calls and monthly American casualties rates as high as 1,400 \u2014 nearly as extreme as Tet itself.\n\nMeanwhile the secretary of state, Dean Rusk, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the day after revelation of the 206,000 troop request and faced fierce opposition, even from legislators who had been Johnson\u2019s friends. The committee chairman, J. William Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas, warned of all-out war and wanted Congress to be consulted before any big push. Senator Richard B. Russell, Democrat of Georgia, one of Johnson\u2019s closest associates and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, spoke of relying on air power and naval forces as opposed to ground forces \u2014 implying a pullback in troop commitments, not an increase.\n\nThen on March 12, in the New Hampshire primary, Senator Eugene McCarthy, the Democratic peace candidate from Minnesota, came within a few hundred votes of defeating Johnson. Considering the president had the complete cooperation of the Democratic Party machine, the result was stunning.\n\nThese political signs, plus the disheartening Pentagon analysis of the reinforcement requests, left Johnson little choice \u2014 on March 13, he denied both the big troop request and an intermediate option, which the Pentagon had presented as a fallback. Instead, he approved just 24,200 Army troops, along with nearly 6,000 servicemen in Air Force and support units, over and above the 10,500 emergency reinforcements already sent to Vietnam.\n\nSeveral other consequences flowed from these events. They led Johnson into the reflections that persuaded him to drop his campaign to retain the presidency. Then he recalled Westmoreland from Vietnam, kicking him upstairs to become Army chief of staff.\n\nWesty never understood why the troop request came back to bite. As he would put it in a memoir, he was doing what any battlefield commander would do after a hard-fought victory: choosing the optimum time to commit the Reserves, when the enemy losses had opened the door to a powerful counterassault. His na\u00efvet\u00e9 had proved his undoing: He never considered how his role as the optimistic leader throughout 1967 had set him up for a takedown when things went sideways.\n\nNot coincidentally, Wheeler\u2019s nickname was \u201cBus\u201d \u2014 and under a bus is exactly where he threw Westmoreland when he had a chance.", "title": "Who Threw Westmoreland Under the Bus?", "authors": ["John Prados"]}

He replaced corrupt and incompetent officials and personally headed the recovery committee charged with rebuilding destroyed or damaged infrastructure and buildings and resettling over 500,000 people who had fled Communist control. And elsewhere in national politics, new, surprising political coalitions formed to vociferously oppose Hanoi\u2019s aggression.\n\nThese determined nationalist efforts continued to gain momentum during the ensuing months and years. A new pacification and development program, placed under village leadership, largely defeated Hanoi\u2019s southern followers in the National Liberation Front (also known as the Viet Cong). By 1973, the N.L.F. had just 25,000 fighters left. South Vietnam, by contrast, had 748,000 combat troops, along with an additional million citizens in lightly armed self-defense units. The nationalists controlled 90 percent of South Vietnam\u2019s population, 85 percent of which lived in secure communities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouth Vietnam\u2019s economy grew continuously. Elections were held in all villages and provinces, and several times for the national Senate and House of Representatives, bringing into power a wide range of political outlooks, without anyone seriously proposing surrender to Hanoi\u2019s one-party dictatorship.\n\nThe strength of South Vietnam\u2019s newly energized military held up for years; during the 1972 summer offensive, in which Hanoi threw its entire army into the south to take advantage of the withdrawal of American ground troops, the South Vietnamese successfully defended their positions, relying on the United States for air support only.\n\nWhat made this resistance to Communist aggression so effective? It was not as if the South Vietnamese had suddenly discovered nationalist pride in March 1968. Rather, it reached back to millenniums-old traditions of ethnic pride.\n\nPut in simple terms, the fundamental cultural norm for many Vietnamese is dependence on the will of heaven, which gives individualism to each Vietnamese, provides the people good or bad fortune, and mandates a sovereign state for them. It\u2019s also a bad fit for communism, which is Western in its premises about class warfare and government ownership of the means of production.\n\nOf course, historians have largely accepted the notion that the North Vietnamese leadership was at least as nationalist as it was communist. But in fact, that conflation was intentional, and artificial: As early as 1945, party leaders realized that they could never rally Vietnamese to the banner of Communism, so they used the tactic of working through a supposedly non-Communist front, an approach that the Soviets had promoted for the 1920s struggle against feudalism in China, and then against fascism globally.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ties between Communists and nationalists were always tenuous, precisely because the Communists recognized their incompatibility. In 1945, the Communists outlawed two nationalist parties, and murdered the founder of one of them. Two years later, they murdered Huynh Phu So, the charismatic young man who had founded the nationalist Hoa Hao religion in the Mekong Delta in 1939.\n\nAs late as 1960, the 10-point plan proposed by North Vietnam for the formation of the National Liberation Front made no a single mention of communism as the future for South Vietnam. Instead, it leaned heavily on anti-Americanism and the overthrow of the Saigon regime that it said, playing on traditional Vietnamese nationalism, lacked merit-virtue.\n\nSo, in 1968, when ordinary South Vietnamese considered the military failure of the Communists in the Tet offensive, the failure of their fellow citizens to come out in support of Hanoi, and the success of South Vietnamese forces in fighting back, many concluded that heaven had turned the tides of fate their way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nObviously, even this revitalized nationalist spirit alone wasn\u2019t enough to defeat North Vietnam\u2019s aggression. In 1975, Hanoi conquered Saigon, after the Americans withdrew their forces and then, just a few years later, much of their financial and military support.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to understand that the impetus for the American withdrawal was, in large part, a misunderstanding about Vietnamese nationalism by the antiwar movement, which came to dominate much American thinking about the war. While there were American radicals who indeed embraced Ho Chi Minh\u2019s communist vision, the movement in general preferred to see him as a nationalist first, fighting for his country against colony and empire.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Ho fought for independence from France, and then against the Americans for a unified, independent Vietnam. In that limited sense he was true to deep Vietnamese aspirations for cultural autonomy. But that narrow demand for independence did not make him a nationalist, especially in the Vietnamese tradition. Ho wanted independence for a country to be ruled in its culture, society, economy and politics by his party alone.\n\nExcept for a relatively small contingent that found French rule acceptable \u2014 some Catholics, some French-speaking intellectuals and some well-off families \u2014 most every Vietnamese wanted independence without communism. Had the Americans understood this, they might have better understood what motivated South Vietnam, and not moved so quickly to abandon them just as they were coalescing into a unified, motivated political and military force.", "title": "Who Were the Real Nationalists in Vietnam?", "authors": ["Stephen B.

Dodd-Frank introduced more \u201cstress tests\u201d \u2014 fire-drill-like exercises that ensure the banks can handle a major downturn. The Crapo bill reduces their frequency for all the major players\u2019 internal tests, from Citigroup to JPMorgan Chase on down.\n\nThe Crapo bill will introduce a one-word change from \u201cmay\u201d to \u201cshall\u201d that will pave the way for the biggest, most politically connected financial firms to argue that regulations should be tailored to be weaker for themselves, creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic in what has been, so far, fair rules written for all banks to follow together. It allows community banks to violate the Volcker Rule, introduced in Dodd-Frank to prevent banks from engaging in hedge-fund-like gambling with their own funds.\n\nForeign banks that pose major risks, such as the Trump-friendly Deutsche Bank, will see their United States subsidiaries deregulated with the bill. It attacks the supplemental leverage ratio \u2014 an essential reform that provides a clear, straightforward funding rule to ensure banks are stable \u2014 by watering it down for two of the largest eight banks. Reporting shows other large banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are fighting to expand this further. This starts the rule down a path of not being informative or useful for regulators and capital markets. This is why the Congressional Budget Office not only assumes that it is 50 percent likely these megabanks will abuse this loophole, but also that this bill increases the chance and cost of a financial crisis overall. Given the sheer opportunity to abuse porous rules introduced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it is overkill to give finance even more rules to abuse for its own profit.\n\nModerate Democrats could fight for a narrower bill that would benefit small banks \u2014 with the understanding that community banks aren\u2019t actually suffering. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, community banks had $6 billion in profits in the fall of 2017, a rise of 9.4 percent over the previous year. Furthermore, since Dodd-Frank, several waves of deregulation bills for small banks have already passed.\n\nCommunities must have banks that can meet their needs. By rolling back requirements for medium-size banks, the Crapo proposal will accelerate mergers and consolidations rather than postpone them. This could cause even fewer community banks and more concentration in the long run. If we are concerned about a top-heavy financial sector, the way to handle that is with breaking up the banks and structural reforms for the biggest players, not by removing basic rules at the bottom.\n\nThis bill also hurts consumers. It removes protections on mobile homes and appraisal requirements in rural areas, while getting rid of the requirement that smaller banks prove that borrowers can repay subprime loans they make and keep on their own books. All of these read as if they were written to appease a specific lobbying group, rather than out of a concern for consumer security.\n\nThe most serious consumer protection rollback involves banks reporting on the mortgages they offer. The Crapo bill will exempt banks that make fewer than 500 mortgages \u2014 which includes nearly 85 percent of banks \u2014 from reporting important mortgage data. This data is used to ensure that discriminatory or other abusive practices aren\u2019t happening.

As Immanuel Kant well understood, we are not transparent to ourselves and can never exhaustively know why we do what we do. We can never be certain whether or to what extent we have acted for the reasons we think we did (whether because, for example, \u201cit was the right thing to do\u201d), or whether we are under the sway of psychological, neurophysiological or socioeconomic causes that are altogether opaque to us.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that we should (or can) jettison all reference to our stated beliefs, reasons, rationality; indeed, Kant also cogently argued that despite the efforts of all manner of determinists, we cannot coherently explain these away (for any attempt to explain away our rationality would itself represent a use of that faculty). But it does mean that we cannot infer from, say, a society\u2019s widely held belief in toleration and peace that the actions of people in that society will be strictly guided by those beliefs.\n\nWe should thus be wary of any narrative on which historical events are straightforwardly explained by the fact that the people in any society hold whatever religious beliefs they do. It just doesn\u2019t follow from the fact that someone is admirable \u2014 or for that matter, that she is vile \u2014 that it is because of her beliefs that she is so. Given this, we should expect that even in societies where virtuous beliefs are widely held, we will find pretty much the same range of human failings evident throughout history. Buddhist societies are no different in this respect than others.\n\nMany of history\u2019s great Buddhist philosophers would themselves acknowledge as much. Buddhist thinkers have typically emphasized that there is a profound difference between merely assenting to a belief (for example, that all sentient beings deserve compassion) and actually living in ways informed by that belief. To be really changed by a belief regarding one\u2019s relationship to all other beings, one must cultivate that belief \u2014 one must come to experience it as vividly real \u2014 through the disciplined practices of the Buddhist path.\n\nThe reason this is necessary, Buddhist philosophers recognized, is that all of us \u2014 even those who are Buddhists \u2014 are deeply habituated to self-centered ways of being. Indeed, if that weren\u2019t the case, there would be no need for Buddhist practice; it is just because people everywhere (even in Tibet, Myanmar and Japan) are generally self-centered that it takes so much work \u2014 innumerable lifetimes of it, according to many Buddhists \u2014 to overcome the habituated dispositions that typically run riot over our stated beliefs.\n\nThe basic Buddhist analysis of the human predicament makes sense, as well, of the irony of colonialist conceptions of Buddhism and of the misguidedness of colonial attempts to exploit religious identities. According to a Buddhist analysis, we go through life thinking we\u2019re advancing our own interests, while actually producing ever more suffering because we misunderstand ourselves.", "title": "Opinion | Why Are We Surprised When Buddhists Are Violent?", "authors": []}

But there is also some of what Brink Lindsey of the Niskanen Center and the political scientist Steven Teles call the \u201ccaptured economy.\u201d In between these politicians and corporations are economic incentive consultants, tax professionals and lobbyists all providing ways for businesses to maximize their take, and getting a percentage of these incentives in return. Some consultancies are clearly offering valuable services to governments and companies attempting to manage the complex decisions and operations across various locations in the country.\n\nOthers are experts at extracting as many incentives from governments as possible, in some cases moving businesses a few miles away, say, from Kansas City, Mo., to Kansas City, Kan., to qualify them as new investments.\n\nWhat is to be done? One call is to push for more transparency in these policies, requiring governments to provide details on the support they are offering business. If the Amazon HQ2 competition is any guide, many governments will use creative ways to avoid disclosing their bids. Contact your city government and ask whether it sent a proposal to Amazon. I bet the answer will be something like, \u201cWe offered some details but the actual proposal was sent by X, which isn\u2019t a government agency.

On Thursday, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, failed to secure unanimous consent in the Senate to pass the House version of the bill after it was blocked by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate had already passed its version and that he wanted to work on a compromise bill.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a statement, Senator Johnson said the next step would be to persuade the House to pass his version.\n\n\u201cPatients and their families are running out of time,\u201d Mr. Johnson said in the statement. \u201cI promise to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of desperate patients for their right to try \u2014 their right to hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSupporters say that right-to-try measures will eliminate an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy \u2014 obtaining approval from the F.D.A. The legislation includes incentives they say could encourage companies to participate, such as shielding them from lawsuits and preventing the F.D.A. from considering the experiences of patients on the drugs in their eventual decisions about whether to approve them.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do with Right to Try is open up another avenue for patients who need it and aren\u2019t served by existing programs,\u201d said Starlee Coleman, a senior policy adviser at the Goldwater Institute.\n\nThe F.D.A. already approves 99 percent of such applications, and the agency has streamlined the approval process. Drug companies also have many other reasons to bar access \u2014 often, companies do not have enough extra product to give to patients, or they worry that the logistical work of granting access could slow efforts to get the drug approved, when it would become available to any patient who needed it.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the drug does not work \u2014 many experimental products fail in late-stage trials.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Goodman\u2019s son, Jacob, died in 2009 at age 10 of cancer, and she said she asked eight companies for access to their experimental therapies and was turned down every time.\n\nMs. Goodman said that dying patients do need better access to drugs during what she described as the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d period between when there is consensus that a drug works and when it reaches the market.\n\nStill, she said of the companies, \u201cI can understand why they say no, even though my heart was broken so many times.\u201d\n\nSome companies said they would continue to seek F.D.A. permission, even if a right-to-try bill becomes law.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn our view, the F.D.A. plays a really important role,\u201d Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, the chief medical officer of Johnson & Johnson, said in an interview Thursday. Johnson & Johnson initiated a program in 2015 that delegates decisions about early access to a program set up by Dr. Caplan. The F.D.A., Dr. Waldstreicher said, has \u201cinformation that we don\u2019t have necessarily; they see safety and efficacy information on products that may be similar.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is not always clear which patients would benefit under such a law, including those whose names are included in the bills\u2019 title. Both the House and Senate versions carry the name of Jordan McLinn, an Indiana boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative and ultimately fatal disease with no cure. Jordan and his mother, Laura McLinn, have campaigned with Mr. Pence in favor of a law, and a video about them is featured on the Goldwater Institute website.\n\nIn the video, Ms. McLinn discusses an unnamed medicine that she said she believed would allow her son to live a \u201clong, productive life.\u201d But in separate remarks at a public event in February, Ms. McLinn said that her son was in a clinical trial for an experimental drug.\n\nIn an email message Thursday, she said, \u201cOur journey has evolved over time with right To try,\u201d adding, \u201cThere is not a drug that we are presently trying to access.\u201d\n\nShe said she still supported the measure because \u201cwe should have that option if it is a pathway that makes sense and works for a treatment we may want to access in the future.\u201d\n\nMs. Coleman, of the Goldwater Institute, said the video about the McLinns was three years old, \u201cand all of Laura\u2019s statements were accurate at the time and are still reflective of the situation many patients experience.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, more companies have developed formal policies on what is often called \u201ccompassionate use\u201d in the wake of high-profile campaigns by dying patients and their families.\n\nIn 2014, executives at the biotechnology company Chimerix received death threats after refusing to give an experimental drug to a 7-year-old boy, Josh Hardy of Virginia, who was dying from a viral infection. The company ultimately provided the drug to the boy, but the episode led to the departure of the chief executive, Kenneth I. Moch, who has since become a proponent of granting fairer access to experimental drugs. (In 2016, Josh died at age 10 of complications from a rare cancer.)\n\nBefore the Hardy family made its request, Mr. Moch said he and his company had been flooded with pleas, ranging from longtime friends to a billionaire, seeking access to the drug, brincidofovir, which still has not been approved by the F.D.A.\n\n\u201cYou get these requests and you have to make your judgment,\u201d he said.\n\nSince the episode, he said dozens of companies had contacted him for advice. In addition to Ms. Goodman\u2019s group, another organization, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, also provides information about company programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Moch and others who oppose the legislation acknowledged that it has served a positive purpose.\n\n\u201cThe only good thing I see coming out of the right-to-try legislation is the increased awareness within the medical community about expanded access,\u201d he said.", "title": "Why Can\u2019t Dying Patients Get the Drugs They Want?", "authors": ["Katie Thomas"]}

The group delivered its first major set of standards in December.\n\nMike Thelander, an analyst with Signals Research Group, predicted that American carriers will have some 5G services operating in late 2018 but that smartphones that use the technology won\u2019t be ready until 2019.\n\nQualcomm has long been one of the most active contributors of cellular technology, playing a particularly influential role in 3G technology as well as current 4G networks. Yet the effort to develop 5G standards has brought many new players to the fore, including Huawei, a relative newcomer to the field.\n\nHuawei, which makes gear like cellular base stations and other key equipment to operate 5G networks, has been largely blackballed from the United States on national security grounds. But the Chinese company\u2019s sales have surged elsewhere, such as Europe, and Huawei has taken a leading role in submitting technology for inclusion in 5G technical standards.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

A Huawei spokesman said it had been working on 5G since 2009, having spent $600 million on related research already and committing $800 million more in 2018 alone.\n\nMany American carriers also buy cellular equipment from Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, which has long helped set cellular standards and estimates that it has been working on 5G for a decade. Erik Ekudden, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, said its technical contributions had topped those of any other company.\n\nOther major contributors include South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics, Finland\u2019s Nokia and several companies in Japan. Intel, which has been determined to reduce Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in wireless chips, has also significantly stepped up efforts to influence 5G standards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficials appointed by President Trump have pointed to regulatory barriers that have kept the United States behind nations like China, which has a national plan for 5G networks using technology by Huawei and other Chinese companies like ZTE.\n\nLast month, Brendan Carr, a Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission, announced a regulatory plan that would allow wireless carriers to bypass environmental assessments for the construction of 5G wireless infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe rest of the world is very conscious of our leadership in 4G, and they are questioning whether we will have the resolve to take the deregulatory steps necessary to extend our leadership into 5G,\u201d Mr. Carr said.\n\nAjit Pai, the commission\u2019s chairman, said last week in a speech to global telecommunications executives and regulators that the agency was prepared to make more spectrum available for those networks.

A short drive from the restaurant, it sits on a rise with a hundred-mile vista to the south and east, a panorama of big rivers and lava fields. In the distance, Hekla, an active volcano, hulks over the plain. In medieval times it was said that the birds that circle the sleeping volcano were the souls of sinners queuing up for the descent into hell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe water we are drinking fell as rain and snow on that glacier 700 years ago,\u201d Sigfusson said, pointing west to the mountains of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which rise up from the North Atlantic rift that marks the separation of Eurasia from North America.\n\nWe were standing on the hill above Reykholt, where the town\u2019s geyser has been capped with a roughly finished housing of concrete, topped by a ramshackle smokestack. From that source, the village channels steam and hot water that supply part of the heat and power needs of the modern community.\n\nSome of the hot vapor is also diverted to the village\u2019s communal oven, where Mr. Sigfusson proposed to cook our meal. It\u2019s a much safer way to cook in geothermal heat than tiptoeing around boiling geysers.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe opened the geyser oven, propping it up with a fence post so that I could peer in safely. The escaping steam was as hot as a sauna and, at the bottom of the oven, a good deal hotter (about 200 degrees Fahrenheit, or 93 degrees Celsius). It smelled a bit sulfurous, too, but that comes with the territory when tapping the heat of the Earth\u2019s core.\n\nWe agreed to meet the following morning to cook a menu of local fare, including trout from the nearby Tungufljot River and grass-fed Icelandic lamb, a hardy local breed that has the same salty succulence of the famous French agneau de pr\u00e9-sal\u00e9, lamb raised in salt-marsh meadows.\n\nFor dessert, Mr. Sigfusson suggested abrystir, made from the first milk (nutrient-dense colostrum) produced by a nursing cow. \u201cWhenever one of our cows gave birth, my grandma would take some of the milk and put it in a teakettle set into a pan of hot water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so rich that pretty soon it had set into a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e all on its own \u2014 no eggs.\u201d\n\nThe next day broke bluebird-bright, with cotton-candy clouds and a light breeze. \u201cFirst we forage,\u201d Mr. Sigfusson said when we met. \u201cWild herbs are everywhere.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOur small group ranged along the hillside. The ground was carpeted by wild thyme, with purple flowers the size of a gumdrop nestled among tender flavorful leaves. In the lusher folds and hollows, we found angelica, a plant with a floral, almost verbena note and just a touch of bitterness \u2014 well suited to contain the broad flavors of the unctuous lamb.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Sigfusson lopped off two stalks of wild hops to season the broth, a new use \u2014 at least to me \u2014 of the brewmaster\u2019s mainstay.\n\nAs we prepped the meal, he offered us cold beers and appetizers: smoked ptarmigan and cured salmon on rye crackers, with tomato jams and chutneys from the restaurant and, as with just about everything one eats in Iceland, cold fresh butter.\n\nThe ptarmigan had been smoked over dried smoldering sheep dung, which is pretty much the only thing you can use for smoking in this relatively treeless landscape, where a 15-foot fir tree towers like a sequoia.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith the tailgate of his truck serving as our work surface, we separated some greenhouse romanesco into florets and tossed them into a Dutch oven. We cubed baby kohlrabi, did the same with the smoky brined lamb shoulder, then added the herbs, the hops and a half-dozen glugs of cream. As we worked, the geyser would blow its top every seven minutes, and we had to pause, retreating beyond the reach of its warm, misty spray.\n\nNext, we poured the colostrum into ramekins that we set into our bain-marie \u2014 a roasting pan half-filled with water. Then Mr. Sigfusson brought out a two-pound brown trout he had caught himself (\u201con a Hairy Mary salmon fly,\u201d he reported with pride). We stuffed the brightly spotted trout with sorrel, angelica and green onions, folded it up in parchment paper (en papillote is an ideal way to cook in a steam oven) and placed it in with the rest of our feast.\n\nWe left the oven to work its magic and, a few hours later, returned to unburden it of our meal. The bread, Jon\u2019s own variation on this Viking staple, could have easily sufficed for the whole meal had we not exercised some restraint. The trout was flaky and herbaceous. The milk pudding, topped with a jam of green tomatoes, ginger, and honey was super-creamy.\n\nBut the star of the show was the lamb braise. The meat was salty and smoky, the creamy gravy enriched with the captured juices of lamb, romanesco and kohlrabi, and everything suffused with wild thyme, angelica and hops \u2014 which brought the sweetness-enhancing quality of fresh tarragon. I made a note to try it under the skin of my next roast chicken.\n\nThe breeze was gentle, and the ground was soft and dry enough to lie or sit on without getting damp. Late afternoon sun lit up the landscape formed by long ago by lava flows. It looked like pale-green velvet rippled by the breeze.\n\nI\u2019ll admit to a tingle of schadenfreude as I looked over at Hekla to see to see if the soul of anyone on my hit list was plunging into hellfire, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it.

Activism can be empowering. But it can also be experienced as difficult and stressful.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the youth who engaged in activism \u2014 defined by the researchers as participating in a march or rally \u2014 enjoyed the positive benefits of greater educational attainment and larger incomes as they aged. But unlike those who only voted or volunteered, they also went on to engage in higher levels of risky health behaviors such as eating fast food, smoking cigarettes, using marijuana or binge drinking when they were between the ages of 24 and 32.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors propose two possible explanations for this.\n\nFirst, activists have, historically, often been members of counterculture groups where risk-taking may already have been the norm. Second, activists might become discouraged by the glacial pace of social change and turn to poor health habits to manage their frustration.\n\n\u201cWe can help young people reframe their expectations from big ideas to small wins,\u201d Dr. Ballard said. \u201cThe expectation shouldn\u2019t be changing federal policy right away, but getting news coverage and raising awareness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to Dr. Ballard, adults can also help teenagers feel that their activism is effective by making it about connection: \u201cconnecting with others, connecting with a cause and connecting with what\u2019s already going on.\u201d While most teenagers are too young to express their opinions by voting, participating in rallies is a way to make their voices heard.

While some schools have threatened to suspend students who participate, legal scholars say students have the right to demonstrate unless they are disruptive. And dozens of colleges and universities said that any disciplinary actions against those participating in the protests would not affect their admissions decisions.\n\nLooking at the issue from a social science perspective, adults should nurture adolescents\u2019 efforts to catalyze political and social change because civic engagement can help teenagers grow.

Whether you\u2019re in the camp that can\u2019t stand the sound or the one that can\u2019t see what the fuss is about, you might be surprised to learn that where exactly the sound is coming from \u2014 what precisely in the knuckle produces it \u2014 is still a subject of scientific research.\n\nFor more than 50 years people have been publishing scholarly papers about what is going on in your finger as you pull it. Lately an older theory, that the sound arises from the popping of a bubble in the joint, has been challenged by one that holds that the formation of the bubble itself is responsible. On Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, the saga continued: A pair of researchers at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in France reveal a mathematical model of a cracking knuckle and suggest that the old theory could accurately explain the sound.\n\nThe first thing to understand about the knuckle is that it is full of fluid. Where the two bones of the finger meet, a little lake of synovial fluid keeps them from grinding on each other. There is gas dissolved in the synovial fluid, mostly carbon dioxide, and it usually stays there. However, when the bones are pulled away from each other, there\u2019s a sudden drop in pressure in the middle of the joint. Lower pressure allows the gases to come together, forming bubbles. Earlier work had suggested the collapse of such structures was behind the noise.\n\nIn 2015, however, Greg Kawchuk of University of Alberta and collaborators used an M.R.I. scanner to record what was happening in the finger of a volunteer who was a frequent knuckle-cracker. In the images, you can see the sudden appearance of a bulge in the knuckle as it is cracked.\n\nThis is the result, Dr. Kawchuk and colleagues wrote, of the formation of a bubble, which persisted for some time afterward, and whose creation might be responsible for the cracking noise. They posited that the bubble generated a pressure wave in the fluid, producing a sound. However, it was not clear how that wave could be powerful enough to make the distinctive crack.\n\nMore Reporting on Mathematics\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbdul Barakat, a professor of biomechanics at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in France, and Vineeth Suja, then a master\u2019s student, came across the 2015 paper as they grew interested in knuckle-cracking themselves. To see whether even the old theory could produce a sound of that magnitude, they created a simplified mathematical model of a joint with a bubble in it and ran simulations, comparing the theoretical sounds of the bubble collapsing in the model with recordings of Mr. Suja, who is now a doctoral student at Stanford University, and others cracking their knuckles.\n\n", "title": "Why Do Cracking Knuckles Make That Noise?

Researchers sought five different quotes for miles driven each year, from 2,500 miles to 22,500 miles. (The cities tested were Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Cleveland; Houston; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City; Rochester; and Tampa, Fla.)\n\nThe report found that outside California, given drivers with similar characteristics, Progressive and Farmers usually quote the same rates to someone who drives just 2,500 miles a year that they do someone who drives 22,500 a year. (Progressive referred an inquiry to the Property Casualty Insurers Association, an industry group. Farmers didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nGeico offered a small price reduction, the analysis found, while Allstate\u2019s and State Farm\u2019s quotes for the lowest-mileage drivers averaged savings of 11 percent and 13 percent, respectively, compared with the highest-mileage drivers.\n\nDrivers in Los Angeles saw consistent savings for fewer miles driven, the analysis found. Premiums dropped nearly 9 percent on average for every reduction of 5,000 miles driven per year, and very low-mileage drivers were quoted rates of about 30 percent less than very high-mileage drivers. California law requires auto insurers to give mileage driven the second-greatest weight when setting premiums, after the consumer\u2019s driving record, researchers said.\n\nQuotes for drivers in other cities saw average savings of less than 2 percent for every 5,000-mile reduction in annual mileage, or less than $3 in savings per month.\n\nThe Property Casualty Insurers Association said in a statement that the federation\u2019s latest report was \u201cflawed\u201d and showed a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of auto insurance underwriting and rating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInsurers use multiple factors that have proved to be effective in predicting the likelihood of someone filing an insurance claim, the association said. \u201cBy using a variety of rating factors, insurers are able to develop a more complete picture of a driver\u2019s potential for filing a claim and in this way more accurately price the policy.\u201d\n\nAs the report itself says, insurers do consider mileage driven as a factor, the association said, but \u201cas one would expect in a competitive market, it is done so differently among insurers.\u201d\n\nSome insurers, the report noted, have said they don\u2019t emphasize mileage in setting rates because customers often wrongly estimate how much they drive. The researchers suggested, however, that there are ways to verify the accuracy of mileage estimates, like recording odometer readings at the time of policy purchase or renewal, or after accident claims.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about auto insurance premiums:\n\nShould I tell my insurance company if I\u2019m driving less?\n\nYes. \u201cIt\u2019s always worth talking to your agent and saying, \u2018Do you know how much I drive?\u2019\u201d said Doug Heller, a federation researcher who conducted the study with another researcher, Michelle Styczynski. Retirees, in particular, should check in with their agents. They may be charged the same rate as they had previously been, even though they are no longer commuting to work.\n\nHow can I lower my insurance premium?\n\nMargot Gilman, money editor at Consumer Reports, said one of the best ways to make sure you\u2019re getting the lowest rate possible is to comparison shop at least every few years. \u201cCast a wide net,\u201d she said: Get quotes from a dozen insurers, not just two or three.

We began by betting on human wisdom and political realism: Soon enough, Donald Trump, the nationalist, populist candidate, would wise up and become President Trump. Maverick politicians tend to do this in democratic societies.\n\nThen came the \u201cadults in the room\u201d stage.

He confided that many conservative police officers do not want more gun control and that other officers have told him that should they ever have to start taking guns away from people, they will quit their jobs. Like most rural conservatives, he truly believes that taking guns away from law-abiding citizens will never solve America\u2019s gun problems, including mass shootings. He says gun control has never stopped criminals from getting guns, and never will.\n\nTo understand why many conservatives in rural America believe this, you must start with first principles, because the argument ultimately isn\u2019t about guns; it runs even deeper than the Second Amendment. At a 2015 campaign event during the Iowa caucuses, J. C. Watts, the former congressman from Oklahoma, spoke about perspectives on original sin. It helps illuminate the differences in worldview between many conservatives and liberals. Mr. Watts said Democrats think people were born basically good, so when good people did bad things, something in society (in this case, guns) needed to be controlled. Republicans think the fault lies with the person \u2014 the perpetrator of the evil. Bad choices result in bad things being done, in part because the perpetrator lacks the moral guidance the Christian faith provides.\n\nThe reaction to mass shootings highlights this difference. Liberals blame the guns and want to debate gun control. For conservatives, the blame lies with the shooter, not the gun.\n\nTo my conservative friends, it\u2019s a matter of liberty and personal responsibility. Even after a horrific event like the school shooting in Florida, where 17 people were killed, more gun control would be compromising those first principles. For them, compromising those principles would be even more horrific and detrimental to society than any shooting. What my conservative friends see is not gun control, but rather control, period.\n\nNot everyone here is an N.R.A. nut, but they think the N.R.A. may be the last line of defense for the Second Amendment. The apocalyptic videos about gun control from the N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch are over the top, as my conservative friends here know, but they think they are fun for the basic reason that liberals grow faint after viewing them.", "title": "Opinion | Why Gun Culture Is So Strong in Rural America", "authors": []}

Every day has always been an opportunity for attentiveness, gratitude and living into God\u2019s call.\u201d Now he had much less of a desire to \u201cseize the day,\u201d he said, than \u201cto welcome it \u2014 with all its twists and turns, surprises and disappointments, moments of delight and discoveries of yet other areas to which I must pray my goodbyes and let the grieving roll.\u201d And so he did.\n\nNone of us is exempt from periods of pain, doubt and discouragement. Even the Apostle Paul confessed in his second letter to the Corinthians that there were times when he felt the pressures of life pushed him beyond the ability to endure, \u201cso that we despaired of life itself.\u201d\n\nGratitude is hardly restricted to people of faith, just as people of faith are not exempt from ingratitude. This is another way that people don\u2019t fit into tidy boxes. Temperament, disposition and life circumstances all play a factor in determining how we face the world.\n\nBut for many of us of the Christian faith, there are certain events that are sources of continuing thankfulness. Good Friday and Easter Sunday are pre-eminent among them. They reassure us that while suffering is unavoidable, death is not final and hope is eternal, that there are things that lie beyond the joy and anguish of this life. There is gratitude in the conviction that the story doesn\u2019t end and that there are endless new chapters to be written, and that ultimately there is reconciliation and redemption to be found for my broken life and our broken world.", "title": "Opinion | Why I Am Still Grateful", "authors": []}

My family and I talk frequently about firearms and how they should be used. I have a younger brother, and we teach him the rights and wrongs of firearm safety \u2014 and, of course, never to use guns to hurt people.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about guns, as well as about hunting and farming, at school because no one there knows much about those three topics. They\u2019ve been told not to touch or talk about guns, and some of the kids think it is just absolutely wrong for people to own them. That is their opinion, and I respect it and am open to talking about it. But even if people try to be nice, they don\u2019t really want to debate it.\n\n[ALSO READ: The View from Opposite Sides of a Student Walkout in Montana]\n\nAt the school I used to go to, a few miles away across the border in Vermont, it was a totally different culture. There were a lot of parents and kids who owned and used guns, and pretty much everyone hunted. And it was a small town where everyone knew who you were.\n\nThrough the Hartford Area Career and Technology Center, I have met other friends who understand my family\u2019s culture. I study natural resources there for half of the school day, because I want to become a firefighter with a background in land management.\n\nI believe in gun control and that there should be stricter rules that require all gun sellers to do federal background checks. I also think gun sellers have a responsibility to make their own decisions about whom they want to sell a gun to. If you buy a gun from a federally licensed seller, you have to do the federal background check, which can take more than an hour with all the paperwork. The gun seller should use common sense during that time to determine whether the buyer is in the right state of mind and will use a firearm only in legal ways.", "title": "Opinion | Why I Didn\u2019t Join My School\u2019s Walkout", "authors": []}

Here, children are not told to avoid the mighty ocean. They\u2019re taught to be safe in it.\n\nThe approach grew from necessity. As John L. Light writes in his book about children and sport, the first surf lifesaving clubs in Australia began around 1907 after a number of drownings. Nippers followed in the 1960s to keep the lifesaving clubs flush with rescuers, teaching young people two very Australian values along the way: surf safety and a healthy sense of competition.\n\nThere are now roughly 40,000 kids, 5 to 13 years old, giving it a go every summer.\n\nAnd at least in our group at Bronte Beach in Sydney, fear, courage and pragmatism were all in the mix.\n\nOne day, when our beach was closed because of violent rip currents, my son\u2019s group learned about the stonefish \u2014 that\u2019s the one that looks like a rock but is the most venomous fish around, with spiky dorsal fins that will inject poison into your feet if you step on one.\n\nAll the children simply nodded when they were told to keep an eye out for them when playing near the rocks at the edge of the beach.\n\nAgain, they were not told to stay away from the rocks; they were told how to navigate the dangers found there. I was amazed at the matter-of-fact approach, a far cry from the overprotectiveness I\u2019d seen at the Brooklyn summer camp my kids attended before we moved to Sydney and where just being in a shallow pool was a cause for parental fright.\n\nAnd last weekend, I was reminded of that contrast yet again. The waves were big on Sunday \u2014 rolling tubes of aquatic force that only a few surfers decided to brave.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there were the 8- and 9-year-olds, as you can see in the photo above, my son among them, jumping into a more protected area surrounded by volunteer parents in bright orange.\n\nThat community vibe also won me over. The risks every Sunday were managed by neighbors, by friends, by people who knew at least a few of the children and how to handle children that particular age.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe moms and dads were strong. Masters teaching young apprentices, they didn\u2019t scoop the kids out of the water at the first sign of struggle, or when a surge of water pushed them toward panic.\n\nRather, they encouraged our children to keep going.\n\nSometimes a volunteer would swim alongside a boy or girl who was losing motivation. Sometimes a child would recover on a buoy, briefly, before being sent off again.\n\nEven when waves crashed our children into a mess of sand and sea, the adults simply smiled and waited for them to re-emerge.\n\nMy wife and I absolutely loved it, tears and laughter included.\n\nYes, we\u2019ve covered wars and our kids spent most of their lives in Mexico City facing a different set of dangers so I recognize we may be more comfortable with risk than most. And I know I\u2019m not the first outsider or Australian to wax philosophical about Nippers.\n\nBut week after week, I\u2019ve marveled at the scene. It\u2019s been great for my children\u2019s confidence. It\u2019s been even better for their (and our) love of the ocean.\n\nCould that be what Nippers is all about for many of us, engaging with the coast to find joy?\n\nThis is a stunning place, Australia, ringed with ribbons of sand and blue-green waves that much of the world\u2019s population will never see. The water may be threatening \u2014 but how many of us could give it up if we tried.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSurf lifesaving is as much about experiencing the sublime as it is about safety.\n\nAmericans we are, but Nippers we shall be.\n\nDo you have a story about Nippers?

{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "Some things help with that. Like the beach. The view of the sea at sunset. Except that last year, for the first time in my life \u2014 I\u2019m 45 \u2014 I didn\u2019t swim. The waves are still beautiful from a distance, and so is the sight of fishermen uncertainly setting out to sea in the mornings. But now to go into the water is to bathe in raw feces. The sewage-treatment plants aren\u2019t working properly, the result of Israel\u2019s decade-long blockade of Gaza, decaying infrastructure and electricity shortages. Pollution is a health hazard along some 73 percent of the coastline. Abu Aseel, a neighbor and friend who owns a cafe on the promenade, says he has fewer and fewer customers.\n\nAll of this may seem like an old story, just more of the same. But things haven\u2019t improved for so long that they can\u2019t help but get worse. My paternal grandmother, Eisha, was expelled from Jaffa in 1948, during what Palestinians call the nakba, or catastrophe, and since then four generations of hers, of us, have lived as refugees in Jabaliya. The restrictions on Gaza have affected every generation here \u2014 even the dead.\n\nMy friend Donia Ismael, a poet, was visiting relatives in Egypt when her husband, the well-known activist Bassam Aqra, had a heart attack. She couldn\u2019t return to Gaza fast enough; the border is closed in that direction, too. So she had to bid her husband farewell after he had died, by looking at his image on the screen of a mobile phone held up by one of their children.\n\nI remember Bassam from when we were growing up: He was one of the best football players in our camp; he was our Maradona, our Messi, and our hero. Games were a big event. We would play in a small dirt yard behind the souk. It has since been overtaken by the market, along with our playgrounds and the orange orchards.\n\nThe other day I was driving through Remal, in the western part of the city, with my five kids. Suddenly my 5-year-old daughter, Jaffa \u2014 who is named after the city my grandmother Eisha came from \u2014 shouted: \u201cDad! Dad! Pizza! Pizza!\u201d She was pointing to a shop on the other side of the street. She wasn\u2019t hungry; it\u2019s just that seeing a pizza drawn out on a storefront sign made her think of a cartoon she watches. I was thrilled to see her make a connection between the image and the word. It reminded me of a moment during the 2014 war with Israel when Jaffa, just 18 months old then, had tried out another new word for the first time. One night, she sat up on her mattress, and pointing to the dark sky said, \u201cmooooooon.\u201d\n\nChildren are different from us adults: They\u2019re wired to find some joy in everything. I think Eisha would have smiled to see her great-granddaughter \u2014 despite the drones hovering above, despite the warships lined up on the horizon, despite the constant provocations of political leaders near and far \u2014 shout through a car window at a slice of pizza, thinking of a silly cartoon.\n\nIt\u2019s Jaffa\u2019s hope that makes me stay in Gaza. It belongs here, this hope, not elsewhere. It belongs to Palestine.", "title": "Opinion | Why I Stay in Gaza", "authors": []}

In 2006, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president at the time, lifted the ban on the grounds that the presence of women would \u201cpromote chastity,\u201d but his decision was overturned just a month later by the supreme leader. Then in 2012, the barring of women was extended to volleyball matches.\n\nImage A young woman in Iran dressed as a man in an effort to enter a stadium to see a soccer match.\n\nEven Saudi Arabia has opened its stadiums to women: In the fall, following his historic decision allowing women to drive, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman opened Riyadh\u2019s King Fahd stadium, Jeddah\u2019s King Abdullah Sports City stadium and Dammam\u2019s Prince Mohammed Bin Fahd stadium to female fans.\n\nBut Iran\u2019s women are still waiting to be allowed in the stands. Last April, eight women were arrested after sneaking into Azadi stadium to watch a game while dressed as men. The prohibition is the subject of Jafar Panahi\u2019s acclaimed 2006 film \u201cOffside,\u201d which, perhaps unsurprisingly, was banned in Iran. Even Mr. Blatter, a man not otherwise famous for his moral rectitude, called on Iran to end its barring of female fans in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe Tehran Derby is one of the most important matches of the year,\u201d one of the Tehran-based activists behind Open Stadiums, an organization fighting for the rights of women to watch sporting events in stadiums like Azadi, wrote me in an email. \u201cFor many girls and women, their biggest wish is to be there in Azadi stadium. Infantino had a huge opportunity here to make a statement about equality and dignity. It would have been an amazing statement on behalf of Iranian women if he refused to go to the game.\u201d The activist asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.\n\nMr. Infantino, during his visit to Azadi, seemed to ignore questions from a female journalist about \u201cwomen\u2019s rights to be allowed into the stadiums,\u201d according to a tweet from Hadi Nili of the BBC\u2019s Persian service. Meantime, outside the stadium, 35 women were detained for trying to watch the game alongside their fellow citizens and the head of FIFA. According to the activist from Open Stadiums, several other women who dressed as men to sneak into the stadium were also arrested.\n\nWhat a missed opportunity. Just imagine if Mr. Infantino had made a statement explaining why he couldn\u2019t attend the game. Or insisted that he\u2019d attend only in the company of some female soccer stars.

Nearly 3.7 million of those were rifles, including AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles like those used in several mass shootings.\n\nOnly a few of the thousands of licensed firearms manufacturers in the country are publicly owned and must disclose sales figures to investors. Those include American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation, which has reported declines in firearms sales for the past four quarters but generally does not report specific volumes. On Thursday, the company said that revenue from its firearms segment for the third quarter slumped 40.6 percent from last year to $117.6 million, compared with a 13.4 percent upswing in its outdoor products division.\n\nSturm Ruger, another public company, cut its production levels by 24 percent last year and also laid off 28 percent of its employees, according to Wedbush analysts.

The following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Polack.\n\nHow did Jamaica develop a film industry? What was the appeal?\n\nIt started way back in the early 1900s. The most famous movie was \u201cA Daughter of the Gods,\u201d a Fox production that was made in 1916 . They came down to Kingston and sank $1 million to produce a Middle Eastern movie. Jamaicans woke up one morning to find camels walking through the streets of Kingston. Film producers loved Jamaica. The people are very literate. They are relatively sophisticated and this became more important when sound came in because you had to be absolutely quiet on the set and Jamaicans were very disciplined in that regard. We have experienced crew. We are very close to the U.S. mainland. And we have perfect weather. Some film directors and cinematographers will tell you about the light in Jamaica, how beautiful it is. You can have extended production days in good weather with experienced people and a government that\u2019s willing to help you. It\u2019s not like shooting a movie in the boondocks.\n\nWhat are your favorite film settings?\n\nMy favorite is also the favorite of the filmmakers \u2014 Portland, which is in the eastern parish of Jamaica. It is lush. It is beautiful. It has beaches; it has rivers. Its capital, Port Antonio , is a playground for Hollywood stars since World War II.\n\nImage Peter Polack.

{"date": "2018-03-11 00:00:00", "text": "Unlike endangered Senate Democrats in deeper-red states, Mr. Brown, 65, has opposed virtually all Republican-backed policies in Congress, including a new measure loosening bank regulations that is supported by a dozen Democratic senators. Outside of trade, Mr. Brown said in an interview, he sees no evidence that Mr. Trump \u201cstands with workers.\u201d But the senator mainly fixed his criticism on a specific target \u2014 \u201cinterest groups and Wall Street influences in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican establishment has captured the government,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWhen it comes to what they\u2019re really trying to do every day, it\u2019s the bidding of the billionaire Republican establishment \u2014 of Wall Street, of the drug companies, of the gun lobby.\u201d\n\nBoth national parties have a great deal at stake in Ohio. For Republicans, the 2018 elections are a test of their ascendancy across the Midwest, and whether Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal to working-class white voters might lift others on the right. He carried a majority of union households in Ohio, sundering the on-and-off alliance of African-American voters with white union members that has periodically delivered the state to Democrats.\n\nOhio Republicans are fielding a formidable if somewhat ungainly ticket, mimicking the national partnership of old-school Republicans and Trump-style insurgents. The state party has backed Mike DeWine, a low-key former senator who is Ohio\u2019s attorney general, for governor, and Representative Jim Renacci, a more combative Trump ally, for Senate. Mr. Renacci, a wealthy auto dealer, had been battling Mr. DeWine for the nomination for governor, but switched to the Senate race after an appeal from the White House.\n\nAmong national Democrats, Ohio is an urgent priority for reasons both symbolic and practical. Victories in 2018 could help them contest the state in 2020, and winning the governorship could give Democrats a hand in the drawing of congressional maps. Prominent Democratic leaders are already sketching out visits. Ms. Warren has raised money with Mr. Brown and plans to campaign for Mr. Cordray, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has committed to hosting a fund-raising event for Mr. Brown soon, and will campaign extensively in Ohio next fall, people briefed on their plans said.\n\nFor Democrats like Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, the state is an inviting arena to deliver a more pointed message on economic inequality than the one Democrats are likely to deploy in the areas most crucial to control of the House. In their quest to pick up 24 seats, congressional Democrats have focused heavily on courting moderate, suburban voters who dislike Mr. Trump, and for whom issues like trade and union rights are remote considerations.\n\nBut Michael Podhorzer, political director of the national A.F.L.-C.I.O., said that in Ohio, the Democrats\u2019 paramount goal had to be reversing the lurch of working-class whites toward the Republican Party. He said union members have edged away from Mr. Trump in polling conducted by labor groups, but Democrats must overcome skepticism that they \u201care real on populist issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a state that is very suspicious of Democrats on economic issues,\u201d Mr. Podhorzer said. \u201cHow things turn out is going to be a real indicator of whether Ohio\u2019s going to be a battleground state in 2020.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 determination to reassemble a blue-collar coalition was on display recently in Lorain, a once industrial town about 30 miles west of Cleveland, where Mr. Cordray, 58, pitched himself to a crowd of labor officials arrayed in wooden chairs in a fluorescent-lit hall. Mr. Trump fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Lorain County in 2016; President Barack Obama carried it by about 15 points in 2012.\n\nIntroduced to the crowd as a warrior against Wall Street, Mr. Cordray called the governorship a platform to \u201cfight back for working people\u201d and pledged to battle the Republican-controlled Legislature on union rights and defend Ohio\u2019s still-contested Medicaid expansion. In an interview, he said Democrats had erred in 2016 by allowing themselves to be seen as a party of the status quo.\n\n\u201cPeople do want somebody who will fight for them,\u201d said Mr. Cordray, who vowed to compete not just in big cities, but also in the \u201cmiddle-sized towns around Ohio where they feel things moving gradually away from them and nobody seems to care.\u201d\n\nA soft-spoken lawyer, Mr. Cordray acknowledged that he had to reintroduce himself to Ohio after seven years in the Obama administration. In a sign of his campaign\u2019s national import, Mr. Cordray met with Mr. Obama in Washington late last fall, after stepping down from the consumer bureau. Mr. Cordray said the former president had been \u201cencouraging\u201d of his campaign.\n\nMr. Obama has not yet issued an endorsement, and while several Democrats have dropped out of the race to back Mr. Cordray, he must overcome a rowdy set of Democratic rivals in a May primary election. The former Representative Dennis Kucinich, 71, a freewheeling firebrand who has aligned himself at times with both Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, appears to be his most nettlesome foe.\n\nRepublicans, however, are girding for Mr. Cordray. Mr. DeWine, still facing a challenger on the right, has begun swiping at Mr. Cordray, lumping him with a cadre of Democrats that he says mismanaged the state. Wagering that Ohioans are mostly happy with the state\u2019s direction, Mr. DeWine is presenting himself as a steady hand.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the days of Ted Strickland and Richard Cordray,\u201d Mr. DeWine warned last month at a local party dinner in Clinton County, northeast of Cincinnati, linking Mr. Cordray with an unpopular former governor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

In the Senate race, Mr. Renacci, 59, has staked his campaign on his relationship with the president and attacked Mr. Brown for opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts. Both he and the president, Mr. Renacci said in an interview, \u201cwant to make sure Ohio is great again.\u201d\n\nBut the tangled lines of populist politics could complicate that blunt partisan argument: Where Mr. Brown endorsed the Trump tariffs, Mr. Renacci has been more equivocal, calling them a work in progress.\n\nAt a union hall in Dayton last month, Mr. Brown found an audience seemingly friendly both to Mr. Trump and his own campaign. Addressing a Teamsters local about the union\u2019s pension crisis, Mr. Brown was introduced by a pair of labor activists who borrowed from the president\u2019s message to suggest Washington had overlooked them in favor of other vulnerable groups. \u201cWe\u2019re dreamers, too,\u201d declared Rita Lewis, a prominent Teamsters activist who is close to Mr. Brown. \u201cWe\u2019re not illegal aliens. We\u2019re American citizens.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown addressed the group in a confiding tone, hunched over a lectern and upbraiding Washington for siding too often with banks over workers. As Mr. Brown worked the crowd afterward, Greg Thompson, a Teamsters member from Akron, explained that he voted for Mr. Trump because of his stance on trade, but these days considered Mr. Brown a more reliable ally.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think of the president,\u201d said Mr. Thompson, 69. \u201cHe talks out of both sides of his mouth.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Brown, Mr. Thompson said, \u201cWe\u2019re 100 percent behind him.\u201d", "title": "Why Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren Are Eyeing Ohio in 2018", "authors": ["Alexander Burns"]}

But he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement\u2019s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\n\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\n\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X. After the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\n\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and \u201950s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism. It was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on \u201cthe white man\u201d as \u201cthe white devil\u201d). But in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians. That political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism. (Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as \u201ca very great man.\u201d)\n\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions. The faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad. Mr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\n\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is \u201cvirtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,\u201d then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to \u201cmake an example\u201d of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private. Mr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister\u2019s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\n\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the \u201cMillion Man March,\u201d a political and religious revival event in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\n\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\n\u201cFor those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,\u201d Mr. Curtis said.\n\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s remarks about Jews \u201cunbelievably vile,\u201d emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\n\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January. The News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama\u2019s candidacy.\n\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.

Five years, 500,000 troops, was the general estimate Johnson heard. Where would that put the president in early 1968, as his campaign for re-election began in earnest? Right where he found himself as he sat down to deliver his announcement on March 31: in a protracted war with no end in sight.\n\nSo why did he go in? Part of the answer, surely, is that escalation, if done quietly, gradually and without putting the nation on full war footing, offered Johnson the path of least immediate resistance (always a tempting option for a policymaker), especially in domestic political terms. Given his repeated public affirmations of Vietnam\u2019s importance to American security, it made sense that he would remain steadfast, in the hope that the new military measures would succeed, lest he face accusations of backing down, of going soft.\n\nMore than that, Johnson made the leap because for him, \u201cretreat\u201d from the struggle was inconceivable. He personalized the war, saw attacks on the policy as attacks on himself, and failed to see that his landslide victory in 1964 and the international and domestic context in early 1965 gave him considerable freedom of action \u2014 a point Humphrey cogently underscored in his February memo.\n\nFrom Day 1 to the end, Johnson was a hawk on Vietnam, which proves again that doubting warriors can be committed warriors. He always framed his options in such a way that standing firm appeared the only reasonable choice \u2014 it was full retreat, bomb the hell out of China, or stay the course. Never did he fully explore imaginative ways out of the conflict; for him, extrication without victory signified humiliation and defeat.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis didn\u2019t mean Johnson rejected all talk of negotiations. After mid-1965 he pressed Under Secretary of State George Ball for new diplomatic ideas \u2014 although, as Ball later remarked, \u201che really meant merely new channels and procedures.\u201d\n\nWhen negotiations with North Vietnam at last began in Paris in May 1968, Johnson took a firm line. He also continued the bombing and indeed increased it below the 19th Parallel and in Laos. In the 10 months from March 1 to Dec. 31, 1968, the Pentagon dropped a greater tonnage of bombs on Indochina than had been expended in the three years prior. This expanded bombing, Daniel Ellsberg hauntingly concludes in his memoir of the war, was \u201cobediently carried out\u201d by men from Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford \u201con down to flight crews, who believed it served no national purpose whatever.\u201d\n\nHumphrey won the Democratic nomination in 1968, yet Johnson was reluctant to throw his full support behind him, privately accusing the vice president of being cowardly and disloyal whenever he expressed a desire to move policy even modestly in a dovish direction. Some part of Johnson preferred to see Richard Nixon as his successor, expecting, with reason, that the Republican would be more resolute than Humphrey in pursuing the war.\n\nAnd so it ended, the saga of Lyndon Johnson\u2019s presidency, its denouement having been anticipated by him at the beginning. He was a man who dreamed big dreams for the Great Society, who hoped that his prodigious efforts on civil rights, voting rights, education and Medicare would earn him a place alongside Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt \u2014 and who anticipated from the start that Vietnam would ruin it all.\n\nIt bears all the markings of tragedy, but of a certain kind, more Shakespearean than Greek, more Macbeth than Agamemnon. Whereas for the Greek playwrights the universe tends to be deterministic, the hero at the mercy of forces beyond his control, for Shakespeare the tragedy lies in the very choices the protagonist makes. His Macbeth is no mere victim; he contributes to his own demise. The same must be said of Lyndon Johnson.\n\nFor those seeking symbols there is, finally, this: On Jan. 22, 1973, Johnson died at his Texas ranch, two days after hearing Nixon, in his second inaugural address, hint at cuts to the Great Society and remind Americans how far they had come from that bleak time in 1968, when they faced \u201cthe prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home.\u201d The next day, Nixon announced a deal had been reached in Paris to end the war and \u201cbring peace with honor.\u201d", "title": "Why Lyndon Johnson Dropped Out", "authors": ["Fredrik Logevall"]}

Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov on Tuesday dismissed British accusations as \u201cnonsense\u201d and demanded that Britain hand over the nerve agent used against Mr. Skripal and his daughter. Russia, he added, had so far \u201creceived an incoherent response, which amounts to a rejection of our legitimate demands.\u201d\n\nJust as Britain did earlier to Russia\u2019s ambassador in London, the Kremlin on Tuesday summoned the British ambassador to Moscow to demand an explanation.\n\nVladislav Inozemtsev, a Russia scholar currently at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw, said the nerve-agent episode showed that \u201ctalking to Mr. Putin has become senseless.\u201d The Russian president and his senior officials, he said, would \u201cnever assume responsibility,\u201d whatever the facts were, and would only gloat over the suffering of a traitorous former spy \u2014 still unconscious and in critical condition \u2014 while blaming Britain for it.\n\n\u201cThey will stick to the thesis that Westerners kill agents they do not need anymore and then blame Russia,\u201d Mr. Inozemtsev said.\n\nPhoto\n\nRussia under Mr. Putin, said Mr. Galeotti, an expert on Russia\u2019s security services, \u201chas given up on winning respect through soft power and is pursuing what I call \u2018dark power.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis approach, which involves Russia throwing its weight around and then reveling in the outrage this causes, Mr. Galeotti added in a telephone interview, \u201cplays into Putin\u2019s own natural instincts that a great power is one that is feared. It is better and much easier to be feared than loved.\u201d\n\nOf all the virtues in which Mr. Putin takes pride, none has more importance to the Russian leader \u2014 a veteran of a Soviet security apparatus built around a cult of loyalty to the state \u2014 than his commitment to the idea that nobody, especially not spies who defy their vows, can escape punishment for betrayal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he still represented an affront to the principle that betrayal must never go unpunished: He was alive and living comfortably in a pleasant English cathedral town.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs happened after accusations that Russia was responsible for the 2006 murder in London by radioactive poisoning of another intelligence turncoat, Alexander V. Litvinenko, the downing of a Malaysian passenger aircraft over Ukraine in 2014 and meddling in America\u2019s 2016 presidential election, officials and state news media outlets in Moscow responded with a barrage of denials and mockery to the latest outrage. They have scoffed at the idea Russia could possibly have had any role in the attack on Mr. Skripal and even suggested that the whole episode might have been fabricated.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in London, in sneering statements on its website and Twitter feed, refers to the \u201cSergei Skripal Case,\u201d using quotation marks to suggest it does not believe there really is such a case.\n\nRussia has yet to address in any detail the main piece of evidence pointing to a Russian hand \u2014 that Novichok agents have been produced only in Russia \u2014 and has instead developed conspiracy theories involving Ukraine, British revenge for past athletic defeats ahead of this year\u2019s World Cup soccer tournament in Russia and other far-fetched explanations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMoscow has been exasperated that its denials are not taken seriously and have been mocked relentlessly under a Twitter hashtag, #Russiadenies, even though officials have in the past acknowledged what they had earlier denied.\n\nMr. Putin and his lieutenants, for example, denied for weeks that Russian soldiers were involved in the seizure of Ukrainian military bases and government offices in Crimea in March 2014. The action, they insisted, was entirely the work of local \u201cself-defense units.\u201d The following month, however, Mr. Putin made a sharp U-turn, declaring, \u201cOf course our troops stood behind Crimea\u2019s self-defense forces.\u201d\n\nMaria V. Zakharova, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokeswoman, mocked Mrs. May\u2019s statement to Parliament in London as a \u201ccircus show,\u201d adopting a sneering and decidedly undiplomatic tone now in vogue among Russian diplomats and commentators.\n\nBut in an earlier comment, soon after news of the nerve gas attack in Salisbury broke, the evening news host on the state-controlled Channel One gave voice to what, under Mr. Putin, is the Russian state\u2019s view of traitors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish death on anyone, but for purely educational purposes, I have a warning for anyone who dreams of such a career,\u201d the newscaster Kirill Kleimenov told viewers. \u201cThe profession of a traitor is one of the most dangerous in the world.\u201d", "title": "Why Moscow Will Never Apologize for Attack on Ex-Spy", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"]}

Its revenue is a third of Walmart\u2019s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s footing in the grocery business is still small.\n\nAll in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.\n\nAmazon also has a loyal customer base \u2014 it has an estimated 90 million Prime members \u2014 and the public views it relatively favorably.

In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt.

Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.\n\nThat suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.\n\nThat may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months.

The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.\n\nPeter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:\n\nAfter the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Sessions\u2019s recusal left the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, free to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. When President Trump learned of the appointment, he reportedly unloaded on Mr. Sessions, calling him an \u201cidiot.\u201d The attorney general told the president he would resign and later delivered a resignation letter to the White House, though the president apparently returned it with the note \u201cnot accepted\u201d at the top. Since then the president\u2019s temper has periodically erupted at Mr. Sessions publicly and privately, with one report saying Mr. Trump was hoping Mr. Sessions might be embarrassed into resigning.\n\nWednesday\u2019s apparent renewal of that effort was the most startling episode yet. It began when Mr. Sessions suggested that the inspector general for the Department of Justice would handle allegations advanced in a memorandum, endorsed by the Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee, that the department had improperly obtained surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign aide. Such a referral is a normal move for allegations of misconduct, and one that Mr. Sessions\u2019s predecessors from both parties have frequently taken. But it infuriated President Trump, who tweeted, \u201cWhy is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn\u2019t the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!\u201d\n\nMr. Sessions offered this dignified response: \u201cAs long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution.\u201d Mr. Trump may be renewing his effort to push Mr. Sessions out, but this time, Mr. Sessions is not handing in a resignation letter.\n\nLest there be any doubt about that, Mr. Sessions very publicly dined Wednesday night with Mr. Rosenstein and the solicitor general, Noel Francisco. They are the second and third in the line of succession at the department, respectively, should Mr. Trump fire Mr. Sessions. The dinner sent the message that the attorney general\u2019s colleagues support him.\n\nThis is no mere personnel flap. The principle that the president is attacking \u2014 and that Mr. Sessions and his colleagues are standing up for \u2014 is central to the administration of justice in America. It is that the awesome powers wielded by the attorney general and those who work for him should never be deployed for political purposes. Those powers can deprive defendants of their liberty, their property, even their lives. Merely investigating someone can be crushing. That should only be done when demanded by justice \u2014 not the whim of a president. It is a Solomonic solution by Mr. Sessions to refer Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations for initial screening to a neutral fact-finder. Contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweeted suggestion, that is precisely the role of the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.", "title": "Opinion | Why Sessions Is Right to Stand Up to Trump", "authors": []}

At least two physical processes are at work in the dishwasher. The first is perhaps easier to intuit: The dense and heavy metal, glass and ceramic items absorb and hold more heat during the washing process, and retain it for a longer time.\n\nThese items radiate heat, which evaporates residual water for a longer time after the heat is turned off inside the dishwasher.\n\nIn fact, many dishwashers no longer have a heating element for drying, instead relying on the heat from items exposed to the very hot washing water to dry the load of dishes. But plastic items quickly dissipate heat and tend to stay wet.", "title": "Why That Sippy Cup Won\u2019t Dry in the Dishwasher", "authors": []}

Instead, students are encouraged to build their own wardrobes within a prescribed palette. (In nautical stripes and khakis, many children resemble those in a J. Crew catalog.)\n\nClassrooms in the school have been rebranded \u201cstudios.\u201d There are no desks, but rooms include couches, beanbag chairs and tables to stand at while working.\n\nThe Luminaria model claims to balance hard S.T.E.M. subjects, like computer programing, with soft skills like emotional intelligence and teamwork that are increasingly sought by employers. Ms. Wu said the model was based on a concept in physics known as first principles, in which ideas are reduced to their purest form, unencumbered by assumptions, analogies or biases.\n\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that 30 to 50 percent of Australian teachers leave the profession within their first few years of work. Lumineer Academy has sought to capture some of them with a promise of freedom from strict curriculums.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the job advertised, I thought, \u2018This can\u2019t be true,\u2019 \u201d said Kim Staples, a 31-year-old teacher. \u201cI was so frustrated in other systems, because they\u2019re quite prescriptive.\u201d\n\nMs. Staples said she would have stopped teaching if she hadn\u2019t joined Ms. Wu\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was too restricted,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give children the type of learning experiences that I knew was best for them.\u201d\n\nThere is evidence of tech-world thinking throughout the school.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "The rest of the team, meanwhile, had to figure out where all the blood was coming from. Usually, profuse bleeding from the mouth comes from the upper gastrointestinal tract. But when a scope was passed through her mouth and esophagus into her stomach, it did not show anything that would have caused significant bleeding.\n\nThe other possible source was her lungs, and to look there they would need a CT scan of the girl\u2019s chest. She had been in the hospital for nearly a week at this point. She\u2019d had many tests, many needle sticks and no answers; she was worried and frustrated. Another test \u2014 during which she would be uncomfortable and cold and would have one more needle stick (for the contrast dye) \u2014 seemed more than she could bear. Even as she was transported to the scanner, she wept, asking her mother if the test could be canceled. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d she wailed. But she did, breathing when instructed and holding her breath as much as she could between sobs.\n\nThe Cause of the Bleeding\n\nDr. Tej Phatak was both a pediatrician and the radiologist helping to manage her care. Through the control-room window, he saw the girl\u2019s tear-streaked face disappear into the scanner, then watched the pictures click into place on his monitor. Suddenly he saw an irregularly shaped splash of brightness in the bottom of her right lung, in a place that should have been mostly dark. It looked like a tangle of vessels. He recognized it immediately. It was a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or PAVM, an abnormal connection between a pulmonary vein and an artery. Veins are thin-walled structures that carry slow-moving blood and expand or contract depending on how much blood is flowing at that moment. Arteries are thick, muscular vessels built to hold up under the fast-moving, high-pressure blood that comes out of the heart with each beat. The structure he saw was too big to be a vein and too misshapen to be an artery. It had to be a PAVM \u2014 and they are prone to tear, which can result in dangerous bleeding.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He hurried into the scanner room to explain what he saw and what it meant. What she needed, he told them, was a procedure to close off this vessel so that it would never bleed again.\n\nThe patient was sent to Yale-New Haven Hospital for the procedure. The large PAVM in the lower part of her right lung was closed up with loops of fine wire, about the width of a human hair. Blood would clot around the coils of wire, essentially sealing off the vessel for good.\n\nA Solution and Another Problem\n\nFor most patients, a single diagnosis is all that is needed to answer the question \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Not so in this case. These abnormal pulmonary vessels indicate a diagnosis that, in turn, often signals the presence of yet another rarity \u2014 an inherited disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or H.H.T. This disorder, usually passed from parent to child, causes abnormal blood vessels to form, most frequently in the stomach, lungs, nose, liver or brain. In addition, most patients (though not this one) with H.H.T. develop red freckle-size spots, known as telangiectasias, tiny malformed vessels located throughout the body. These abnormal vessels can cause serious bleeding, as in this case, as well as infections or even strokes. Patients with H.H.T. tend to have frequent, even daily, nose bleeds \u2014 as this girl did \u2014 and can experience blood loss through the stomach or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, in their lungs or even in their brains.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA genetic test confirmed that she had one of the mutations that cause H.H.T. Because neither of her parents have the disorder, it\u2019s a mutation that occurred in this girl\u2019s genome just after conception. It was important to confirm the diagnosis, because if she had children, they would have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutation and the disease.\n\nMysteries Remain\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear what made the girl\u2019s heart develop that abnormal, potentially deadly rhythm. It\u2019s not part of the usual manifestations of H.H.T. And her cardiologist wonders if she has a heart problem in addition to her H.H.T. She and her mother hypothesize that the PAVM and bleeding somehow triggered the arrhythmia. And it\u2019s true that she\u2019s had no arrhythmias in the six years since her PAVM was treated.\n\nThe girl is reminded of her disease by her near-daily nose bleeds \u2014 a common problem among those with H.H.T. But she hasn\u2019t let them slow her down. She graduated from college two years ago and has been hard at work in her career ever since.", "title": "Why Was This Teenager Bleeding So Excessively?", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}
{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Cold cognitive abilities are those we use when we are in a calm situation, when we are by ourselves and have time to deliberate and when the most important skill is the ability to reason logically with facts. Voting is a good example of this sort of situation.\n\nStudies of cold cognition have shown that the skills necessary to make informed decisions are firmly in place by 16. By that age, adolescents can gather and process information, weigh pros and cons, reason logically with facts and take time before making a decision. Teenagers may sometimes make bad choices, but statistically speaking, they do not make them any more often than adults do.\n\nHot cognitive abilities are those we rely on to make good decisions when we are emotionally aroused, in groups or in a hurry. If you are making a decision when angry or exhausted, the most critical skill is self-regulation, which enables you to control your emotions, withstand pressure from others, resist temptation and check your impulses. Unlike cold cognitive abilities, self-regulation does not mature until about age 22, research has shown. (This is a good reason to raise the minimum age for purchasing firearms from 18 to 21 or older, as some have proposed.)\n\nThis psychological evidence is backed up by neuroscientific findings. Neuroimaging studies show that brain systems necessary for cold cognition are mature by mid-adolescence, whereas those that govern self-regulation are not fully developed until a person\u2019s early 20s.\n\nIf the voting age were lowered, would that necessitate changing other laws to bring them into alignment? Of course not. We use a wide variety of chronological ages to draw lines between minors and adults when it comes to smoking, driving, viewing violent or sexually explicit movies, being eligible for the death penalty and drinking alcohol. Although the specific ages used for these purposes often lack a good rationale, there is no reason lowering the voting age would require lowering, say, the drinking age, any more than allowing people to drive at 16 should permit them to drink or smoke at that age as well.", "title": "Opinion | Why We Should Lower the Voting Age to 16", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "All of that changed when Khrushchev was ousted by his colleagues in a palace coup in October 1964. His successors, Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, wanted to prove that they were truly committed to an ally in need by providing military aid. The underlying rationale was that the new Soviet leadership faced a deficit of political legitimacy. Aiding Vietnam in a war against \u201cimperialism\u201d helped them in being recognized \u2014 by their people, their clients and allies and the broader world \u2014 as the legitimate heirs to the leadership of the socialist camp. For the same reason, Moscow attempted to improve relations with China.\n\nMao Zedong, however, was not inclined to reciprocate. This became clear during Kosygin\u2019s February 1965 trip to Beijing. Kosygin, the Soviet premier, spoke of the need for \u201cunited action\u201d to help Hanoi\u2019s war effort. Mao responded to his pleas with hostile sarcasm, telling Kosygin that the Sino-Soviet struggle would last for 10,000 years. \u201cThe U.S. and the U.S.S.R. are now deciding the world\u2019s destiny,\u201d Mao said acidly. \u201cWell, go ahead and decide.\u201d He appeared unconcerned by the new round of escalation in Vietnam: \u201cSo what? What is horrible about the fact that some number of people died?\u201d \u2014 and countered Kosygin\u2019s worries about the deepening conflict with optimistic calls for a \u201crevolutionary war.\u201d\n\nEven as Moscow\u2019s relations with China continued to deteriorate, Hanoi moved away from a pro-Chinese stand to a semblance of neutrality. That was because the North Vietnamese needed the Soviet weapons, especially advanced antiaircraft missiles, to protect themselves against American bombing. But the Chinese Cultural Revolution also helped. The Vietnamese leaders resented Beijing\u2019s effort to stir up radicalism among the sizable community of Chinese living in North Vietnam. \u201cAs paradoxical as it sounds,\u201d remarked one Politburo member, Nguyen Van Vinh, in 1967, at the height of American involvement, the Vietnamese \u201cdo not fear the Americans but fear the Chinese comrades.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The North Vietnamese were not consulted and felt betrayed. But there was an even bigger problem: The Chinese and the Vietnamese had very different ideas about their relative importance. The Chinese leaders regarded the North Vietnamese as underlings. They helped them. They instructed them. But they expected deference in return. The Vietnamese refused to defer. After years of fighting against the United States, they felt entitled to claim revolutionary leadership, at least in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis was the message that Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap brought to Moscow in December 1971 just as the Vietnamese geared up for the Spring Offensive to deal the final blow to South Vietnam. Giap promised that the joint Soviet-Vietnamese victory in Vietnam would herald Hanoi\u2019s rise to ranks of the leader of, and the socialist bridgehead to the third world. \u201cWe would like to carry on this mission together with the Soviet Union, because no one can do it without the Soviet Union,\u201d he said. The Soviet leaders embraced the message, especially after Giap promised to allow the Soviet Union naval rights in then-still American-controlled Cam Ranh Bay.\n\nThere were dangers in supporting Hanoi\u2019s militant attitude. The restart of major fighting in March 1972 threatened to derail the move toward the Soviet-American d\u00e9tente. After the Americans responded to Hanoi\u2019s Spring Offensive by massive bombing raids, several in the Soviet leadership, including Kosygin, proposed to cancel the upcoming summit in Moscow. \u201cAre you kidding?,\u201d Brezhnev asked. \u201cWhy not!,\u201d Kosygin countered. \u201cThis would be the right kind of a bomb.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll be a bomb all right,\u201d Brezhnev commented, \u201cbut who will it affect more?\u201d\n\nBrezhnev regarded d\u00e9tente as a personal achievement and was not willing to sacrifice it for the sake of Vietnam. At the same time, though, he was also unwilling to pressure Vietnam for the sake of a better relationship with the United States, the idea known to Kissinger and Nixon as \u201clinkage.\u201d What the American duo did not quite understand was that Vietnam was an important element of Brezhnev\u2019s bid for global leadership. Soviet support for Hanoi was what made the Soviet Union a true superpower and America\u2019s equal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNixon later recalled being taken aback during the May 1972 Moscow Summit when Brezhnev, \u201cwho had just been laughing and slapping me on the back, started shouting angrily,\u201d accusing the United States of committing terrible crimes in Vietnam. Brezhnev did it because he had to defend his credibility in front of his own colleagues and also the North Vietnamese. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that I or my comrades ever had to speak to anyone so sharply and so harshly as we spoke to Nixon about Vietnam,\u201d Brezhnev later told General Secretary Le Duan and Prime Minister Pham Van Dong.\n\nSino-Vietnamese relations at that time had reached new lows. By the summer of 1973, as the United States was completing its disengagement, Le Duan worried about China, telling Brezhnev that he thought Mao planned \u201cto invade all of Indochina and Southeast Asia if the circumstances were right.\u201d Brezhnev promised to help defend Vietnam \u2014 this time against its northern neighbor.\n\nThe costs of postwar reconstruction were enormous. Le Duan and Pham Van Dong were upfront with Brezhnev about Hanoi\u2019s expectations: There would have to be a major Soviet aid effort to help \u201cindustrialize\u201d Vietnam in order to show Southeast Asia the practical benefits of socialist orientation. \u201cWe have nothing,\u201d Le Duan told Brezhnev, suggesting that everything would have to come from the Soviet bloc for the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nBrezhnev agreed to cancel all of Hanoi\u2019s debts. Credits kept coming, though, and by 1990 Vietnam had received more than $11 billion dollars in aid, most of which was never repaid. Subsidizing Vietnam became a serious burden on the Soviet economy in 1980s, contributing to Moscow\u2019s insolvency.\n\nThe Vietnam War ended with the Soviet-Vietnamese victory but, for Moscow at least, it was a Pyrrhic victory. Maintaining clients was good for one\u2019s credibility as a superpower and for the leaders\u2019 political legitimacy, but it wasn\u2019t good for the state budget. Russia\u2019s policy in recent years, in particular its operations in Syria, is reminiscent of the Cold War-era quest for legitimacy in Vietnam. The long-term consequences of this renewed quest will be equally dire.", "title": "Why Were the Russians in Vietnam?", "authors": ["Sergey Radchenko"]}

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "He bases these conclusions on some noncontroversial assumptions, which are widely shared: Stocks are priced at levels that are at the upward edge of historic bounds, and the recovery from the last economic recession remains in place but is now fairly mature and becoming increasingly vulnerable.\n\nFor now, in the odd, contrarian logic of the market, the fact that investors haven\u2019t been overwhelmingly worried worries him. It implies that far bigger declines may be on the way.\n\nThat logic goes something like this:\n\nFirst, consider what has happened in the stock market since it peaked on Jan. 26. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell more than 10 percent by Feb. 8 but didn\u2019t keep dropping; it is now down about 5 percent from that peak. That\u2019s not much of a drop, after the sharp gains of the last nine years, and, especially, in 2017 and early this year. Whenever the market has had sharp declines so far in 2018, it has rebounded quickly.\n\nYes, there have been sequences of ugly days, with declines of more than 2 and even 3 percent a day in the S.&P. 500-stock index. What\u2019s more, the market has often looked absolutely horrendous when converted into the inflated currency of the Dow Jones industrial average, whose raw numbers have been swollen by outlandish gains since March 2009.\n\nWith the Dow in the 20,000-plus-range, a 100-point drop is barely worth noticing: It amounts to less than half a percentage point. Using this crude and misleading measure, the Dow had its biggest single-day decline in history on Feb. 5, with a drop of more than 1,175 points. But that amounted to only a 4.6 percent daily drop, a minor distraction, in percentage terms, when compared with the worst day in history. That was Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow fell 22.6 percent.\n\nStill, this year\u2019s drops have garnered plenty of attention, but they have been followed by rallies, some of them within the same trading day, so that the overall change in the market is minimal.\n\nThe stock market returns themselves provide evidence that there has \u2014 as yet \u2014 been no major panic. But there\u2019s more.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInvestors have not merely supported stock prices in a weak market, they have also failed to bid up the prices of the traditional \u201csafe haven\u201d assets like Treasury bonds, gold, the dollar and defensive stocks like utilities that tend to hold their value when the overall stock market sinks.\n\nMr. Paulsen measured this effect by creating a proprietary Safe Haven proxy index, which combines these \u201crisk-off\u201d assets that tend to spike in value during crises. Treasury bonds, for example, have soared in value during past stock market downturns, but that generally hasn\u2019t happened this time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnd while a stock market confidence index maintained by the Conference Board has fallen since the February decline, there\u2019s little indication that investors have changed their behavior. \u201cFrom the standpoint of behavior \u2014 meaning, what people are actually doing \u2014 there\u2019s no sign that people have been fleeing stocks and moving to these assets,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says that further stock market declines \u2014 or, at least, a hiatus in the market\u2019s long-term upward trend \u2014 may be desirable for stock market bulls. The reason is that stock prices, by many measures, still seem unsustainably high, while the economic expansion that has supported those prices may have entered a new, more fragile phase.\n\nOne valuation metric, for example, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500, based on earnings over the past 12 months, is about 21. A more reasonable level, given historical averages and prevailing bond yields, would be a P/E of about 17, Mr. Paulsen said.\n\nTo get down to that level, prices can fall or earnings rise, or both can happen. The Wall Street consensus is that earnings will rise substantially this year \u2014 perhaps by about 15 percent, thanks, in part, to a boost from the recent tax cut.\n\n\u201cThe problem,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said, \u201cis that the stock market rose so much last year that we\u2019ve already paid ourselves a bonus from the tax cut and from earnings growth. The market needs to catch up with itself.\u201d\n\nA sideways stock market for the next year \u2014 with prices remaining close to current levels while corporate profits grow \u2014 would restore valuations to a healthier level with less pain, he said. That would amount to a gentle, protracted correction, after which the stock market might then be ready to resume its upward trend.\n\nBut a more violent correction is also possible, and, perhaps, more likely.\n\nConsider that the economic recovery is robust enough for the Federal Reserve to have begun raising short-term interest rates, and that the Fed projects further increases over the next two years. With the tax cut stimulating an economy that already has low unemployment, the Fed could be impelled to move more forcefully to fend off rising inflation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut when interest rates rise, many assets, including stocks, are often deemed to be worth less. Rising rates alone could be expected to have a negative effect on the stock market.\n\nThat\u2019s why a further 15 percent drop in the S.&P. 500-stock index would not be shocking. The stock market could easily rebound after such a fall, with one important caveat: the health of the economy at that moment.\n\nRight now, no immediate recession is in sight and, as Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, recently wrote, economists have a miserable track record in projecting recessions a year in advance. The yield curve \u2014 the relationship between short- and longer-term bond yields \u2014 has moved in a direction that may portend economic problems, but it is not sending out clear signals of distress, at least not yet.\n\nNonetheless, forecasters like Capital Economics already say there is a \u201cmodest risk\u201d of a recession in 2019. Capital Economics expects the stock market to be lower then than it is now.\n\nBut the consensus is that the economy will keep purring along. If it does, Mr. Paulsen says, a little stock market panic now may give the bull market the spur it needs for another strong run.", "title": "Why a Bigger Dose of Market Panic Could Help", "authors": ["Jeff Sommer"]}

{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "By the time she finds herself arguing before the Delaware legislature, though, both McBride the character and the book\u2019s narrative voice have gained enough confidence to passionately convince their audiences of her lifelong cause. The debate scene comes alive through the specificity of McBride\u2019s prose. She recalls how some Republican lawmakers at first cast trans people as restroom predators, before becoming \u201cmore muted\u201d and \u201calmost sheepish\u201d in their opposition after her testimony, unable to fully vilify trans people after interacting with one. As McBride sits in tears on the Senate floor, State Senator Karen Peterson is the only one to comfort her \u2014 for Peterson, who is lesbian, recognizes \u201cthe indignity of having to plead for your most basic rights,\u201d McBride writes. The scene\u2019s pathos underlines the absurdity of having to debate anyone\u2019s right to a life free from discrimination.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the same time, these extended chapters on trans advocacy, teeming with data and policy details, feel shallower than those that develop the star-crossed romance between McBride and the young transgender rights advocate Andrew Cray. From his first appearance in the book, at President Obama\u2019s White House L.G.B.T. reception in 2012, the narrative intermingles the excitement of new love with the anticipation of its loss. \u201cI think we\u2019d get along pretty swimmingly,\u201d Cray messages McBride on Facebook two months after that encounter, his significance in her life already promising to be as noteworthy as his charming use of an adverb.\n\nCray takes a central role in \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d only when a sore on his tongue turns out to be cancer, which later progresses to his lungs. As McBride cares for Cray, his illness seems to dismantle her walls of pragmatism and perfectionism. At one point she breaks down over a malfunctioning suction machine, falling to the floor in tears and shouting, \u201cI can\u2019t do this!\u201d At another, she decides to spend Christmas with her parents instead of Cray, as much as she knows it will hurt him. These flaws \u2014 these moments where she appears least noble \u2014 are evidence of this exemplary woman\u2019s humanity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCray himself also buoys these scenes with his particular blend of stubbornness and charm. He insists on remaining independent from his family through his illness, only to rely on McBride as his caregiver instead. And yet, as the 27-year-old man sits in the tub and asks, \u201cCan you wash my tush?\u201d in a playful acknowledgment of the infantilizing force of his disease, we understand his irreverence, and how McBride fell so deeply in love. This anxiety over death\u2019s cruel interruption of true love permeates her narrative of Cray\u2019s cancer, their wedding and his passing, which McBride narrates vividly and without the self-consciousness that is at times distancing elsewhere in the book.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMeanwhile, trans identity in McBride and Cray\u2019s love story never becomes abstracted from experience. McBride\u2019s identity enables her specific life circumstances, but it cannot be reduced, codified or turned into a statistic like the one that says 41 percent of trans men and women have attempted suicide (a number the book cites more than once). Even if McBride and Cray\u2019s were the only trans relationship ever in which one person ended up a widow because of the other\u2019s cancer, their immediate connection \u2014 the authenticity and specificity of their love \u2014 is what inspires the greatest compassion for the universal trans experience, in all its nuance and diversity. The book\u2019s strength lies in its portrayal of McBride and Cray as fully realized individuals beyond their transgender identities.\n\nAfter Cray\u2019s death, however, McBride\u2019s narrative pivots swiftly back to politics without leaving either her or her readers sufficient space to grieve. This is a young woman who has just lost the love of her life at 24. It doesn\u2019t seem quite enough for her to merely add his name, as tribute, to the list of her accomplishments to date, or to merely participate in policies that Cray helped develop. It feels as though the compromises that become routine in McBride\u2019s advocacy \u2014 from her willingness to plead with outright bigots for her basic dignity, to her position at the Human Rights Campaign, a mainstream L.G.B.T. organization that has been criticized by the trans community for prioritizing gay marriage over trans rights \u2014 equally compromise her ability to give the reader an accurate picture of her own grief, which could have imbued \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d with the enduring quality of other memoirs of loss. With a foreword by former Vice President Joe Biden that frames the book as an instructive tome for trans people, parents and the general public, the book is perhaps positioned less as a lasting literary contribution and more as a manual for tolerance that puts its writer in a good position to run for office.\n\nThe inconsistencies and contradictions in McBride\u2019s book reflect the difficulty of trying to explain the transgender experience to a predominantly cisgender public. Some trans readers (myself included) may find themselves growing impatient with the author\u2019s frequent quoting of dire statistics, or her Trans-101-style arguments for bathroom equality. Her case is too often predicated on the idea that the value of trans lives is even up for debate.\n\nI gravitate to the parts of McBride\u2019s memoir in which she relies instead on her sincere and singular identity \u2014 as a young widow who was raised as a boy surrounded by an environment of relative privilege despite inner turmoil \u2014 to continue her fight for justice. I want to believe that readers across the gender spectrum will be moved by the improbable commingling of two trans lives, and for the cruelty of having one of these lives taken away.\n\nAnd yet, I confess, I\u2019m not so sure. Perhaps a non-trans reader would appreciate McBride\u2019s appeals to sympathy, like her concluding anecdotes about trans kids she\u2019s encountered (when asked what she wants to be when she grows up, 12-year-old Stella declares, \u201cThe first trans president!\u201d). But these episodes feel reminiscent of the politician\u2019s well-worn strategy of using other people\u2019s \u2014 especially children\u2019s \u2014 stories to humanize contentious political and social issues, when McBride\u2019s own life is testament enough to the validity and intensity of these obstacles.\n\nIf \u201cTomorrow Will Be Different\u201d provides a vision for a future of trans equality, I hope it will be one in which the dignity of transgender individuals is not up to cisgender arbiters for approval. Such a future of true equality would breed not only full respect for the trans community, but also more deeply felt memoirs that are uncompromised by the burden of justification.", "title": "Why \u2018Tomorrow Will Be Different\u2019 for the Transgender Community", "authors": ["Meredith Talusan", "Sarah Mcbride"]}

It was overwhelmingly seen as a disaster for DeVos, who struggled to answer very basic questions. She couldn\u2019t say, for example, why schools in Michigan, her home state, have largely gotten worse since the widespread introduction of the school choice policies she lobbied for. When Stahl asked whether, as secretary, she\u2019d ever visited a failing school to find out what went wrong, DeVos said, \u201cI have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\u201d\n\nLike many things in Trump\u2019s administration, this performance was shocking but not surprising. Before becoming secretary of education, DeVos had never worked as an educator or a policymaker; she was a donor to education reform efforts favored by the right, such as school choice and vouchers. Her confirmation hearings last year were an embarrassment. She appeared to be unfamiliar with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, a federal civil rights law.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government panel that reviews transactions\u2019 national security implications, moved to stall the potential takeover of Qualcomm\n\nThe panel\u2019s intervention put Broadcom\u2019s bid in jeopardy.

The number of jobs added was the strongest in two years, but wage growth remained lackluster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere are the numbers:\n\n\u2022 313,000 jobs were added last month, the most since October 2015. Economists had anticipated a gain of about 200,000.\n\n\u2022 With revisions to previous months, the three-month average job growth was 242,000 a month.\n\n\u2022 The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent, the same as in January.\n\n\u2022 The average hourly wage grew by 0.1 percent. It grew by 0.3 percent in January. The year-over-year increase fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.\n\n\u2022 The labor force grew by 806,000, pushing the labor force participation rate back up to the 63 percent mark.\n\n% 10 5 0 4.1% \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 Unemployment rate % 10 5 0 4.1% \u201907 \u201908 \u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Unemployment Rate\n\nContext\n\nA leap in job gains in February clears the way for the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate when it meets this month.\n\nThe wage figures were disappointing. The jump in hourly earnings in January \u2014 which pushed the year-over-year figure to 2.9 percent, from 2.3 percent just three months earlier \u2014 was cited as a cause of a market sell-off. With February\u2019s puny growth of 0.1 percent, the year-over-year increase dropped to 2.6 percent.\n\n% +4 2 0 +2.6% \u201908 \u201910 \u201912 \u201914 \u201916 \u201918 Year-over-year wage growth % +4 2 0 +2.6% \u201908 \u201909 \u201910 \u201911 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917 \u201918 Year-over-year wage growth\n\nSome good old-fashioned Goldilocks for investors.\n\nInvestors could not have asked for much more from Friday\u2019s jobs report. The numbers for February show the United States economy was able to add a surprisingly large number of new jobs without creating the sort of surge in wages that can prompt investors to worry about inflation.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note, which might have sold off on inflation fears, barely budged when the report came out. Futures markets pointed to higher opens for stock markets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe economy created 313,000 jobs in February, the most since October 2015. Wages rose 2.6 percent from a year earlier, below the 2.9 percent rate for January that stoked inflation concerns.\n\nIn theory, as employers add large numbers of new employees, the competition to hire workers should drive wages much higher. Why is that not happening right now? It seems a large number of people who previously weren\u2019t looking for jobs are now entering the work force. That, in part, explains the 800,000 person increase in the labor force.\n\nBut investors will no doubt find something to fret about. Some may decide that the growth in employment is so strong that it won\u2019t be long before wage pressures build up. The amount of slack in the labor force is unknown, so investors shouldn\u2019t rely on it to dampen wage growth indefinitely, according to this view.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nWhen will wage growth pick up?\n\nIt\u2019s the unknown that torments investors every time the jobs report comes out.\n\nMaybe we can shed some light.\n\nAs Friday\u2019s jobs report showed, the economy is adding large a numbers of jobs without stoking the sort of surge in wages that makes investors worried about inflation. Investors favor these economic conditions because it reduces the chances that the Federal Reserve will have to raise interest rates more quickly than they expect.\n\nBut how long might wage growth remain moderate? Much depends on how much slack exists in the jobs market. The headline unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, suggests there is very little.\n\nBut the unemployment rate does not count the people who aren't in the workforce \u2013 and who may now enter it. No one knows for sure how many of these people are really looking for a job at any one time, or might do so in the near future. But if there are a lot of them, companies will not struggle to find workers \u2014 and wage growth might remain tame. Conversely, if the number of prospective workers on the sideline is small, wage pressures could soon build up.\n\nOne way to get an idea of the size of this group of people is to look at the employment rate, which measures people with jobs as a percentage of the population (over 16 years old and excluding prisoners.) At 60.4 percent in February, that rate is still well below the level it was at before the 2008 financial crisis. That would imply that there are still a lot of people who could enter the jobs market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut our colleague Ben Casselman, who covers economics, has devised an adjusted employment rate that readers might find interesting.\n\nHow did you adjust the measurement of the employment rate \u2013 and why did you make your tweaks?\n\nLet me start with the \u201cwhy?\u201d The employment rate is great in that it avoids all the issues that bedevil the unemployment rate in terms of deciding who should \u201ccount\u201d as unemployed. But the problem is that it\u2019s too broad. It includes a huge group of people who no one would expect to work, namely retirees. And that group is growing rapidly because baby boomers are aging. So if we want the employment rate to tell us anything meaningful about the state of the economy, we have to account for that big demographic trend in some way.\n\nOne easy way to do this is to look at the employment rate among so-called \u201cprime-age\u201d workers, those ages 25 to 54. That excludes both retirees and most college students, which means it filters out a lot of the demographic noise in the employment rate. The problem is, it filters out a lot of valuable information, too. Lots of 55-year-olds work! And indeed, 55-year-olds are much more likely to work now than they were a generation ago.\n\nMy calculation, which borrows from an approach used by economists (and occasional Upshot contributor) Ernie Tedeschi, adjusts for demographic shifts by controlling for age and sex. It essentially asks, \u201cWhat would the employment rate look like today if the U.S. population still had the same demographic profile as it did before the recession?\u201d\n\nWhat does your adjusted employment rate tell us about the jobs market right now?\n\nBy my calculation, the demographics-adjusted employment rate was at 62.8 percent in February, which is almost exactly where it stood in December 2007, which was the first month of the recession. But it\u2019s still significantly below where we were in 2000, the last time the unemployment rate got this low.\n\nCan we use your adjusted employment rate to get an idea of how much slack is left in the labor force?\n\nYes, but it doesn\u2019t give a definitive answer. What it tells us is that the employment rate has fully recovered from the recession. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that all the slack is gone.\n\nLet me expand on that slightly. Between the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the peak of the housing bubble in 2007, the age-adjusted employment rate fell by about a percentage point. There are two reads on that. One is that the job market just never got as good in the mid-2000s as it did in 1999 and 2000. The other interpretation is that there has been a fundamental shift in the economy, and for some set of reasons \u2014 technology, globalization, video games \u2014 the share of Americans who are willing or able to work has fallen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you buy that second story, then the fact that the age-adjusted employment rate is back to prerecession levels should tell you that we\u2019re basically at full-employment today. The slack is gone. This is as good as it gets. But I would argue the last couple years should lead to significant skepticism about this kind of structural-change thesis. The labor force has grown dramatically over the last few years. Job growth has continued unabated. Unemployment rates for marginalized groups such as black Americans have fallen sharply. And this has all happened in an environment where wage growth has been sluggish, which suggests that employers are able to attract workers without boosting pay, at least by much. All of that suggests that there are still people out there who are willing to work if opportunities become available. I don\u2019t know if we can get back to that 2000 employment level, but today\u2019s report suggests we can at least keep moving in that direction.\n\nPhoto\n\nEconomists and analysts react to the jobs report.\n\n\u2022 Joseph Song and Michelle Meyer, BofA Merrill Lynch: Today\u2019s \u201cGoldilocks\u201d report suggests the business cycle still has another leg to go: the labor supply is increasing to meet the gain aggregate demand, preventing price pressures from building too aggressively.\n\n\u2022 Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley: Straight lines don\u2019t exist in economics. Despite the move lower in the year-over-year pace of average hourly earnings (AHE), the underlying trend in wage growth continues to firm, in line with continued tightening in the labor market and rising productivity.\n\n\u2022 Joe Brusuelas, RSM US: \u201cThe job market continues to sizzle as the economy is in the early stages of absorbing a late cycle fiscal boost that will support a growth rate well above the long-term trend in 2018. The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate. This will not be lost among an F.O.M.C. that leans hawkish in 2018 and points toward an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. How strong is this labor market? The increase of 806,000 in the labor force and 785,000 in the household employment estimate are robust and statistically significant, which is a rare two-for in the monthly labor report. This labor market is on fire and wage gains are in train.\u201d\n\n\u2022 James Ingram, MB Capital: \u201cFebruary\u2019s fall in average wage rise data takes some of the pressure off. But the creation of more than 300,000 jobs in February suggests it will return in the months to come. Throw in a potential trade war between the US and the EU and the US economy could be headed for a perfect inflationary storm later this year. An interest rate hike in March from the US Fed must now be all but nailed on.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

The jury found that he had also secretly controlled a huge number of Retrophin shares.\n\nProsecutors had sought a sentence of at least 15 years; the defense had pushed for 12 to 18 months.\n\nHow much is Martin Shkreli\u2019s Wu-Tang album worth?\n\nBen Sisario of the NYT writes:\n\nWhen Martin Shkreli, the disgraced former pharmaceuticals executive, is sentenced for securities fraud in Brooklyn on Friday, the government will have its pick of a number of his assets to satisfy the $7.36 million judgmentagainst him. There is a brokerage account with $5 million in cash, shares in his company Vyera Pharmaceuticals, even a Picasso. And then there is an item that has been the subject of worldwide intrigue: the sole copy of the Wu-Tang Clan album \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Shaolin,\u201dpackaged in a custom silver-and-nickel case and accompanied by a 174-page leather-bound book. It may be the most famous album ever kept in the possession of just one person. But what is it worth?\n\nThe answer? It is complicated, though experts all doubt that the album could yield anywhere near the $2 million Mr. Shkreli apparently paid for the album at auction three years ago.\n\nThe tariffs already have carveouts\n\nPresident Trump authorized tariffs on imported steel and aluminum yesterday, defying allies and Republicans alike. But as Peter Eavis notes, the presence of exemptions for Canada and Mexico show more wiggle room than expected:\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has leeway to exempt certain steel and aluminum imports from the restrictions if he determines that the United States lacks the capacity to produce them. There is also a national security exemption, notable since national security concerns are the legal basis for the tariffs.\n\nAnd Neil Irwin of the Upshot reckons that while we\u2019re seeing a trade skirmish, it won\u2019t necessarily become a trade war.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "In an administration full of men who seem to spend much of their time leaking unflattering information about one another to the press and appearing on cable news programs, Ms. Hicks was a distinctive figure. She kept her head down and knew how to manage the volatile president \u2014 mostly, it seems, by saying yes to him. She observed Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for drama and did her best not to intrude on his one-man show, refusing to even speak to reporters for profiles about her. Instead, she was deferentially silent as Mr. Trump did the talking, and worked diligently in the background to make his life easier.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s actual daughter, Ivanka, has made this two-step between competent professional and dutiful daughter into something of an art form, enjoying the benefits of a West Wing job while insisting it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d to ask her questions about allegations of misconduct by her father \u2014 who also happens to be the man she works for. Ms. Hicks surely saw this narrow path to success under Mr. Trump and decided to walk it. The dutiful daughter strategy is one a man in her position could never have used. Mr. Trump, with his affinity for military men and mockery of male emotion would have seen such a subservient man as weak, but Ms. Hicks cannily leveraged the president\u2019s own misogyny to her advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most feminist of moves, but Ms. Hicks was also in a position that many young women can recognize: working for a sexist boss who likes the women in his life, romantic and professional, to be slim variations on a very particular feminine model. Many of us have been polite in the face of boorishness and adapted hyperfeminine mannerisms in the company of chauvinists we were professionally obliged to please, putting success ahead of self-respect.\n\nBut of course, most of us weren\u2019t working to elect and then sustain Donald Trump, a man whose attitude toward women and instability affects billions of people the world over, not just those working under him. Playing nice for such a president is a different calculation than, say, a dental hygienist, lawyer or Walmart cashier might make under a similarly sexist supervisor.\n\nBeing new to working in the political world, Ms. Hicks may not have made that decision at all. If you don\u2019t see politics as a vehicle for positive change but rather as an abstraction shape-shifted into a job, and if you view the presidency as about power rather than public service, of course working to get your boss elected and then working closely with him in the White House would feel like nothing more than an exciting career opportunity. Why wouldn\u2019t Ms. Hicks use every tool in her arsenal to remain in the good graces of her volatile boss, and climb up the ladder accordingly?", "title": "Opinion | Will Hope Hicks Find Her Voice?", "authors": []}

They may end up being softer than Thursday\u2019s headlines suggest, as globalists push back. And like President Bush\u2019s tariffs, President Trump\u2019s may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those, just as they\u2019ve mostly shrugged off possible changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nBut vulnerabilities exist right now that could magnify any negative impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nThe stock market is still highly valued after a searing rally that took it to an all-time high in January. The Federal Reserve expects to increase interest rates multiple times this year. Compare that with March 2002, when President Bush introduced his trade restrictions: The Fed was cutting interest rates, a policy stance that can help support the economy and the stock market; stocks were nowhere near their peak of two years earlier; and President Bush\u2019s administration was, overall, globalist in its outlook and didn\u2019t want to become isolated ahead of the Iraq war.\n\nImportantly, the United States economy is less dominant than it was 16 years ago. Last year, the United States accounted for an estimated 24 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product, using data from the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, the share was 32 percent. If other countries retaliate, and tariffs broaden, the United States\u2019 economy may be less resilient than some in the Trump administration may believe.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nHow business meetings cast a pall on Jared Kushner\n\nWe asked yesterday if his family\u2019s real estate business was his biggest liability. Our colleagues\u2019 latest story shows that might be the case.\n\nWhat happened\n\n\u2022 Josh Harris of Apollo Global Management, an adviser on infrastructure issues, met with Mr. Kushner several times last year. In November, Apollo lent $184 million to Kushner Companies, triple the size of the investment firm\u2019s average property loan.\n\n\u2022 Citigroup\u2019s C.E.O., Michael Corbat, met with Mr. Kushner in the spring, and shortly afterward the bank lent Kushner Companies $325 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner, his family business, Apollo and Citi all said that nothing improper had happened. But the meetings raise questions about how the Kushner Companies is weighing down the political fortunes of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Kushner has already had his interim security clearance downgraded amid a feud with the White House chief of staff, John Kelly.\n\nThe WSJ editorial board writes, \u201cMr. Kushner and Ivanka have to decide if they\u2019d serve themselves and the president better by walking away from their formal White House roles.\u201d\n\nThe politics flyaround\n\n\u2022 The White House is set to announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, according to unidentified sources. (Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest aides, plans to step down. (NYT)\n\n\u2022 Mr. Trump publicly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions as \u201cDISGRACEFUL\u201d for not ordering his own investigation into the handling of the Russia inquiry. (NYT)\n\nTrump says he will impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nFrom Ana Swanson of the NYT:\n\nPresident Trump said on Thursday that he will impose stiff and sweeping tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum as he moved to fulfill a key campaign promise to get tough on foreign competitors. Mr. Trump said he would formally sign the trade measures next week and promised they would be in effect \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d The trade measures would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It is unclear whether those would apply to all imports or be targeted toward specific countries, like China, which have been flooding the United States with cheap metals. The announcement capped a frenetic and chaotic morning inside the White House as Mr. Trump summoned more than a dozen executives from the steel and aluminum industry to the White House, raising expectations that he would announce his long-promised tariffs. However, the legal review of the trade measure was not yet complete and, as of Thursday morning, White House advisers were still discussing various scenarios for tariff levels and which countries could be included, according to people familiar with the deliberations.\n\nU.S. stock markets slipped around the time Mr. Trump made his comments about tariffs, with declines in the industrial sector outpacing the overall market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 industrial sector was down more than 2 percent, compared to the overall benchmark index which was down a bit less than 1 percent as of around 1:30 p.m. Automakers, large consumers of steel and aluminum, fell sharply. Another large consumer of those materials, aircraft maker Boeing also declined. As the country\u2019s largest exporter, Boeing would also likely be affected by rising global trade tensions if other nations responded to tariffs from the United States.\n\nThe comments also come on the same day as Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, said this about protectionism:\n\n\u201cThere are many approaches to dealing with the costs of globalization, but protectionism is a dead end. Trade restrictions address the symptoms and not the underlying problems, and they introduce other costs and distortions. While such measures might generate a temporary boost to growth from greater domestic production and consumption, these would likely be offset by a range of other costs. Over time, such measures would retard productivity growth and thereby shrink the economic pie.\u201d\n\nStephen Schwarzman had a good 2017.\n\nThe co-founder and chief executive of Blackstone raked in $786.5 million last year, his biggest take-home ever, according to Bloomberg.\n\nHis stake in New York-based Blackstone\u2014and the $661 million in dividends it yielded\u2014fueled much of the payout. The rest came from his cut of deal profits, salary and other compensation, according to the filing. In 2016, Schwarzman got $425 million.\n\nBy comparison\n\n\u2022 Apollo\u2019s Leon Black took home $191.3 million\n\n\u2022 Carlyle co-founders David Rubenstein, Bill Conway and Dan D\u2019Aniello divvied up a combined payout of $193 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 KKR\u2019s Henry Kravis and George Roberts received a combined $343 million.\n\nPhoto\n\nPowell: No signs that the economy is overheating.\n\nJerome Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, said before the Senate Banking Committee:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any strong evidence yet of a decisive move up in wages. We see wages by a couple of measures trending up a little bit, but most of them continuing to grow at two and a half percent. Nothing is suggesting to me that wage inflation is at a point of accelerating. I would expect that some continued strengthening in the labor market can take place without causing inflation.\u201d\n\nContext\n\nMr. Powell said the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday that the outlook for the United States economy had brightened in recent months. He added that the Fed expected to continue raising rates gradually and could even pick up the pace. The markets seemed to interpret the remarks as signaling the Fed would be more aggressive than expected in raising rates.\n\nBut there was more evidence Thursday morning that inflation may accelerate this year.\n\nHere are the numbers from the Commerce Department:\n\n\u2022 Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 0.4 percent.\n\n\u2022 That was the biggest increase since September.In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index rose 1.7 percent.\n\n\u2022 So-called core PCE, which excludes food and energy, the PCE advanced 0.3 percent in January \u2014 the largest gain since January 2017.\n\n\u2022 Year-over-year core PCE, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, rose at 1.5 percent in January.\n\n\u2022 The core PCE price index has undershot the U.S. central bank\u2019s 2 percent target since mid-2012.\n\nPhoto\n\nSpotify opens its doors to all potential investors\n\nJust as the company isn\u2019t holding a traditional I.P.O., it isn\u2019t holding the usual kind of marketing road show either.\n\nOn March 15, the music streaming giant will \u2014 what else? \u2014 live-stream a presentation for potential investors.

The markets were rattled in August when there were rumors that Mr. Cohn might resign. And futures markets on Tuesday evening pointed to a lower open.\n\nBut even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.\n\nFor two years, the markets have consistently shrugged off everything from Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union to the election of Mr. Trump to the rise of non-mainstream parties in Europe. Investors could look the other way because global growth was picking up, and Mr. Trump was introducing pro-business policies like tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nBut investors and populists are entwined in a way that is not obvious. Right now, economies are suffering from what could be called \u201cToxic Goldilocks Syndrome.\u201d The stimulus of central banks has delivered moderate economic growth and steady returns for investors that keep them happy. At the same time, though, the central bank\u2019s policies have struggled to solve deeper problems like income inequality and low labor market participation. As these persist, they provide fuel for populist candidates.\n\nWhat could change now?\n\nWith Mr. Cohn leaving, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies may end up causing real economic damage. That\u2019s a concern of investors, at least. But then much depends on how the Federal Reserve responds. If, say, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs dampened growth this year, the Fed might choose to raise interest rates once, rather than three times, in effect helping investors and the White House.\n\nBut there is a much brighter scenario. Despite the deeper economic problems and the tumult over trade, growth picks up to a level that causes a real bump in wages this year, and Mr. Trump decides to bask in that success, rather than aiming a wrecking ball at the international economic order.\n\nBut who\u2019s around now to make that argument?\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nWhy Cfius is worried about Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm\n\nCfius said that Broadcom\u2019s proposed deal to acquire rival chip maker Qualcomm could pose a national security risk and called for a full investigation into the hostile bid, according to a letter from a United States Treasury official.\n\nDuring the time between Qualcomm\u2019s unilateral filing and Treasury\u2019s agency filing, Cfius has been communicating with both parties to obtain additional information to inform its decision on the appropriate path forward in regards to this matter. It was during this time, and as a result of these communications and additional information, that Cfius has come to believe that Broadcom\u2019s successful hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm, including the related stock purchase, proxy contest for the election of six directors to Qualcomm\u2019s Board as proposed and selected by Broadcom, Proposed Agreement and Plan of Merger, and any potential merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, could pose a risk to the national security of the United States.\n\nThe letter goes on to say:\n\nCfius has identified potential national security concerns that warrant a full investigation of the proposed transaction. Articulation of the potential national security concerns, in significant part, is classified.\n\nThe move complicates an already contentious deal, increasing the likelihood that Broadcom will end its pursuit of Qualcomm. Such investigations are often death knells for corporate deals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCfius said that the potential risk was related to Broadcom\u2019s relationships with foreign entities.\n\nA spokesman for Broadcom told DealBook in a statement, \u201cwe are fully cooperating with Cfius.\u201d\n\nMichael\u2019s take\n\nThough Cfius stressed the importance of protecting national security, relatively little of the letter focused on explaining traditional matters of national security. Though the document mentioned Broadcom\u2019s \u201crelationships with third party foreign entities,\u201d it does not go into detail about those ties.\n\nThe letter does note that descriptions of national security concerns are largely classified. But it makes no mention of Qualcomm\u2019s publicly disclosed partnerships with Huawei, the Chinese rival long considered closely tied to Beijing, on the 5G standard, either.\n\nWhat Cfius appears capable of describing publicly is concern about how Broadcom might manage Qualcomm after a successful takeover. The government panel describes Broadcom\u2019s potential approach as akin to \u201cprivate equity,\u201d referring to the company\u2019s well-known penchant for cutting costs to help drive profits.\n\nTo the government, that could pose dangers for Qualcomm\u2019s edge in advancing 5G technology. The chip maker is considered, along with Huawei, to be one of the two leading developers of the superfast wireless standard, and any potential disruption to its business could mean ceding an important advantage to the Chinese, Cfius writes.\n\n\u201cWhile the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201d\n\nCfius\u2019s letter also notes that Qualcomm supplies the United States government with important products, and consults on cybersecurity matters relating to 5G and the internet of things. Any disruption of that work, the panel writes, \u201ccould have a detrimental impact on national security.\u201d\n\nAnother take from a friend of DealBook\n\nHere are tweets by Steven Davidoff Solomon, long known as our colleague the Deal Professor:\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nAluminum industry group opposes Trump tariffs\n\nPresident Trump said that he is thinking of putting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel to protect the domestic metal industries. But in a letter to the White House today, the Aluminum Association said that the move would be a bad idea.\n\nFrom the group\u2019s letter, signed by its C.E.O., Heidi Brock:\n\nWe fear that the proposed tariff may do more harm than good, hurting rather than helping the 97 percent of aluminum industry jobs in mid-and-downstream production processes.\n\nIn the letter, the association says that more narrowly targeted tariffs on Chinese production \u2014 which would be more akin to what previous administrations have done \u2014 and exemptions for trading partners like Canada and the E.U. would be better.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWorth noting: The association\u2019s website says that it represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPolicy flyaround\n\n\u2022 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tells lawmakers: \u201cWe are not looking to get into trade wars.\u201d (Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Harley-Davidson is bracing for a one-two punch: President Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum and threats of retaliation from Europe.

BlackBerry argues that Facebook and its Whatsapp and Instagram apps copied technology and features from BlackBerry Messenger, Reuters reports.\n\nBlackBerry said in a filing with a Los Angeles federal court.\n\n\u201cDefendants created mobile messaging applications that co-opt BlackBerry\u2019s innovations, using a number of the innovative security, user interface, and functionality enhancing features.\u201d\n\nFacebook Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal told Reuters:\n\n\u201cBlackBerry\u2019s suit sadly reflects the current state of its messaging business. Having abandoned its efforts to innovate, Blackberry is now looking to tax the innovation of others.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlackBerry is trying to persuade other companies to pay licensing royalties to use its trove of more than 40,000 global patents on technology including operating systems, networking infrastructure, acoustics, messaging, automotive subsystems, cybersecurity and wireless communications,\u201d Reuters reports.\n\nPhoto\n\nAirbnb has named the head of its Homes business.\n\nGreg Greeley, an executive at Amazon, is joining Airbnb as president of Homes.

Most recently, he led Amazon Prime. Before that, he oversaw the launch of businesses in India and Brazil for the e-commerce giant and managed its European consumer businesses.\n\nContext\n\nAirbnb has been reorganizing and building out its executive ranks. Last month, Belinda Johnson, the home-rental company\u2019s chief business affairs and legal officer, was named the chief operating officer, and Laurence Tosi, Airbnb\u2019s chief financial officer, left the company to focus on his investment fund.\n\nBroadcom shows Cfius flexing its muscle\n\nEvery expert that Michael and our colleagues spoke to yesterday acknowledged that the national security panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm was extraordinary. (One other time Cfius was involved in a contested situation, recalled by Reuters: BHP Billiton\u2019s bid for Rio Tinto in 2008.)\n\nIts move shows Washington\u2019s worries about the selling of U.S. companies to foreign counterparts \u2014 and its willingness to act. From Alan Rappeport, Cecilia Kang and Chad Bray of the NYT:\n\nWith the White House making the case for more government intervention, Cfius is expected to gain more authority. A bipartisan group of lawmakers wants to expand the panel\u2019s scope beyond mergers, giving it the power to review joint ventures and investments in start-ups.\n\nThe deal context: Qualcomm filed for a review of the proxy fight on Jan. 29, before voting on the board contest began. But as of yesterday, Broadcom looked on course to win at least four seats, with a decent chance of six. Big index funds like BlackRock and Vanguard hadn\u2019t voted yet.\n\nBonus explainer: Everything you\u2019d want to know about Cfius.\n\nIn other foreign deals: The Chicago Stock Exchange\u2019s proposed sale to Chinese investors is dead.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat BlackRock and other investors could do about guns\n\nSome institutional investors have talked about divesting their shares in gun makers like American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor. (And some, like the Carlyle Group\u2019s David Rubenstein, say they will never invest in the industry.)\n\nBut, Andrew asks, what if those giants became shareholder activists to change those businesses? From his latest column:\n\nBlackRock has enormous influence over both gun makers and retailers. It could pressure them to raise the minimum age for buying AR-15-style rifles to 25 years old, and impose strict screening and background checks that go far beyond what is required by law. BlackRock could even push gun makers to stop producing such weapons altogether.\n\nThe rub: Any decision has to be anchored by financial logic, since BlackRock and others have fiduciary duties to their own investors. But then gun makers are facing costs from boycotts by both consumers and businesses like REI.\n\nElsewhere in guns: A bipartisan bill would require federal officials to notify state law enforcement within 24 hours if someone fails a national background check. And the dating app Bumble has banned gun-related images from user profiles.\n\nPhoto\n\nCould Trump\u2019s tariffs be defanged?\n\nThough President Trump insisted that the tariffs on all imported aluminum and steel are coming, there are signs that he may soften their impact.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 He left open the possibility that Canada and Mexico could be exempt if they signed a new Nafta pact.\n\n\u2022 Gary Cohn is organizing a meeting with executives from U.S. companies that would be hurt by tariffs, according to Bloomberg.\n\nWho has criticized the tariffs: House Speaker Paul Ryan, Goldman Sachs economists and the consulting firm The Trade Partnership.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "There were other challenges. How does Burning Man\u2019s principle of radical participation translate to the \u201clook, don\u2019t touch\u201d propriety of museums? And will the festival learn to speak the institutional language of \u201coutreach and education\u201d?\n\nThose challenges were part of the show\u2019s appeal for both parties. Touching will be encouraged for most works, and outreach is precisely what Burning Man is after. In the process, both cultural institution and countercultural event may re-evaluate their relationships to the mainstream. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a really cool outcome if the lines get blurred,\u201d said Kim Cook, Burning Man\u2019s director of art and civic engagement. \u201cIf we\u2019re not so far out and the museum isn\u2019t so far in.\u201d\n\nMs. Atkinson, who recently attended her first Burning Man, contrasted that experience with the frenzied marketplace of Art Basel Miami, another annual fair of similar size and duration. In Miami, art is a product; an investment. At Burning Man, art is a manifestation of communal values, like inclusion and participation, that generate playful work emphasizing interaction and feeling over economics.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose qualities make Burning Man art \u201cless attractive in the conventional world of galleries,\u201d Mr. Harvey said. \u201cBut at the same time the great potency of this is that it\u2019s a social movement.\u201d That said, some of the works are acquired after the event by cities or businesses. And Burning Man is eager to help its artists make a living beyond the desert.\n\nThe exhibition includes sculptures, art cars, light installations (including one by Leo Villareal that is part of the Renwick\u2019s permanent collection), virtual reality experiences, jewelry and costume displays, an immersive temple (one of the show\u2019s three commissioned works), and a documented history of the event organized by the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno. The Renwick also teamed up with the Golden Triangle Business Improvement District to extend the exhibition into the neighborhood, where six installations \u2014 among them, a giant bear made of pennies and a bronze head of Maya Angelou \u2014 will inhabit parks and sidewalks.\n\nPhoto\n\nBurning Man has bohemian roots and can be seen as a descendant of Dada, Allan Kaprow\u2019s Happenings and the psychedelic Merry Pranksters. Yet the Renwick is the arm of the Smithsonian dedicated to American craft, and \u201cNo Spectators\u201d celebrates Burning Man as a hub of modern maker culture. The Arts and Crafts movement was born in response to the Industrial Revolution, and Ms. Atkinson suggests that Burning Man art responds to the digital and information revolutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEach time we take another one of these technological leaps, there needs to be a balancing humanist force that keeps us connected,\u201d she said. The link between Silicon Valley and Burning Man in both proximity and attendance is no accident, she pointed out.\n\nBut what happens when art shaped by utopian principles and intended as a civic gift to a temporary city is uprooted from its native white sands and replanted within white walls across the street from the White House, suddenly subject to the scrutiny of critics, curators and busy tourists?\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThis is the heart of the experiment now,\u201d Ms. Cook said. \u201cWhen you move into another context, how much cultural integrity can you maintain and insist upon?\u201d The experiment she refers to is the expansion of Burning Man. In recent years, the organization \u2014 which has dozens of full-time, year-round employees \u2014 has been planning its long-term legacy. In 2011, it shifted from a limited liability company to a nonprofit, consolidating previously independent entities, like the Black Rock Arts Foundation, under one roof.\n\nSince the Bureau of Land Management has capped attendance at the Burning Man event at about 70,000 people, the organization is exploring new ways to spread the gospel. Museums and municipalities are potential apostles. The goal is \u201ca global movement which is not purely event-based anymore,\u201d Ms. Cook said. \u201cIt\u2019s as much about engaged citizenship and quality of interaction as it is about having a function.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBurning Man and the Smithsonian have worked closely together to ensure that values are upheld while institutional needs are met. Admission to the Smithsonian, as always, is free. A licensing agreement lets Burning Man review signage and press materials and set guidelines for merchandising and sponsorship. Nothing with the Burning Man name or logo will be sold in the gift shop; no corporate sponsors are acknowledged near the artwork, though the Renwick\u2019s exhibition is supported by Intel and the Golden Triangle\u2019s by Lyft.\n\nThe Smithsonian is also enlisting local Burners, as the festivalgoers are known, as gallery volunteers to help interpret and enhance the experience. And a docent manual that Burning Man helped develop offers suggestions for promoting deeper encounters in the Burning Man spirit: \u201cThink about facilitating interactions rather than simply sharing information.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at several featured artists and collectives adapting their Burning Man art to the white-walled museum world. Ms. Bertotti noted that the work \u201ctakes on a different preciousness here.\u201d But then, adaptability is a Burning Man virtue.\n\nDavid Best\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first temple that the sculptor David Best contributed to Burning Man, in 2000, was not meant to be a memorial but turned into one when a young artist he worked with was killed in a motorcycle accident weeks before the event. The following year, he was asked to build a temple for Burning Man, which became a place to mourn losses and mark transitions. Burning Man has built a temple every year since, one of its annual traditions. It is ceremoniously burned to conclude the event. \u201cThe fire can heal and seal and protect something,\u201d Mr. Best said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis temples were an impetus for the Renwick\u2019s exhibition. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have done this show if I couldn\u2019t have David in it,\u201d Ms. Atkinson said. For \u201cNo Spectators,\u201d Mr. Best and his crew are transforming the second-floor Grand Salon into a sanctuary encased in ornately carved raw wood panels with a central chandelier that descends to meet an altar. \u201cI use beauty as a trap to catch the most pained person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has to be delicate and strong at the same time.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Best, 72, has made eight temples for Burning Man and several more beyond the desert, notably in 2015 in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. \u201cWhen I turned 60, I said I\u2019m only going to work with people. I stopped showing in galleries,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I stopped that game, that system of objects for sale, it freed me. I promised myself when I turned 70 I was only going to do priceless work.\u201d\n\nMichael Garlington and Natalia Bertotti", "title": "Will the Spirit of Burning Man Art Survive in Museums?", "authors": ["Brian Schaefer"]}

Mr. Walsh said he had been sure that \u201cGrief Is the Thing With Feathers\u201d would resonate with his friend because Mr. Murphy has two young sons of his own.\n\n\u201cI read it in one go, in the bath,\u201d Mr. Murphy recalled. \u201cIt absolutely floored me emotionally\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Walsh has not rewritten the work; the show uses only words from the text. But that still left the question of how to present Crow onstage. While the production will make heavy use of audiovisual projections, the real solution is as simple as it is theatrical: Mr. Murphy will play both characters, Dad and Crow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my understanding of what grief is \u2014 it does feel like your mind and body are possessed,\u201d Mr. Walsh said, before joking that Mr. Porter had been expecting a CGI creature and had instead gotten \u201cCillian in a bathrobe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not flying Crow in, it\u2019s not a Cirque du Soleil interpretation,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Yet the character will be a flamboyant, strutting performer, he said, rather than a somber representation of sorrow. He added that he had drawn on diverse sources of inspiration for the role, from Michael Keaton\u2019s character in Tim Burton\u2019s 1988 movie \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d to Dr. Evil in \u201cAustin Powers.\u201d\n\nWatching Mr. Murphy playing the part of Crow in rehearsals, Mr. Porter said he was delighted with the way the actor had physically captured the character.

I knew he\u2019d be good, but he\u2019s phenomenally good.\u201d\n\nSwitching constantly between the two parts is a challenge. But the father role, at least, feels closer to home. For that character, Mr. Murphy said, he \u201ctried very much to not do anything transformative \u2014 other than growing a mustache.\u201d\n\nThe production will also feature two child actors, whose presence onstage adds a further charge. \u201cI find it on the verge of tear-jerkingly uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Porter, himself a father of three, confessed.\n\nThat feeling is intensified by Mr. Walsh\u2019s choice to ground the production in a specific, domestic milieu: a fully realized London apartment, complete with bunk beds and period furnishings. The show begins in October 1987, when huge storms hit Britain, wreaking physical destruction outside the apartment that matches the emotional turbulence within.\n\nAlso in 1987, Mr. Porter\u2019s father died. How does it feel to have that event set so precisely, in an apartment that so deliberately recalls the one where he grew up? \u201cReally weird is the honest answer,\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotion in the room: We\u2019re all making this for our children, for our dead mums and dads. And being in this close recreation of my dad\u2019s flat \u2026 I find it really tremendously moving.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Walsh said he felt a heightened sense of responsibility in directing the work \u2014 to Mr. Porter, but also to his audience. \u201cIt\u2019s so emotional; you\u2019re heartbroken in so many parts.

Rich in symbolism, that book, about a multiracial crew that ventures into the interior of Guyana, is sometimes compared to Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201d It was part of a grouping of Mr. Harris\u2019s works that became known as the Guyana Quartet.\n\nMr. Harris wrote 26 novels in all. He is generally included among a group of Caribbean writers (Guyana is often considered a Caribbean country because of its demographics and history) who explored themes of identity, colonialism, myth and more in lyrical, far-ranging prose.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHarris, who is of mixed African, Scottish, Amerindian and possibly East Indian ancestries, and from a region that is a cultural confluence of four continents, is a believer in what he calls \u2018cross-culturality,\u2019 \u201d the literary critic Maya Jaggi wrote of him in 2006. Mr. Harris explained his idea of cross-culturality this way:\n\n\u201cIt means one faction of humanity discovers itself in another; not losing its culture, but deepening itself. One culture gains from another; both sides benefit from opening themselves to a new universe.\u201d\n\nHis novels were sometimes described as difficult, eschewing conventional plotting in favor of multiple narrators, intermingling viewpoints, jumps in time and a free-form prose that demanded concentration of the reader.\n\n\u201cI know that the view of science tends to be that we are all genetically coded,\u201d he told Bomb by way of explaining his approach, \u201cbut I would suggest interior lives that touch nature and make us into living sculptures.

In \u201cJonestown\u201d (1996) he addressed that horrific incident through a narrator named Francisco Bone, who slides out of reality and wanders across history and cultures as he explores the implications of the real-life event.\n\n\u201cThere is something mechanical,\u201d Kenan Malik wrote in a review in The Independent, \u201cabout the deliberate attempts to push the narrative to the edge of incomprehension \u2014 the story will be \u2018bewildering to the Western mind,\u2019 warns Bone \u2014 which diminishes Harris\u2019s ability to wring meaning from the clashes of times and cultures that he sets up.\u201d\n\nHis other books included \u201cResurrection at Sorrow Hill\u201d (1993), \u201cThe Dark Jester\u201d (2001) and \u201cThe Ghost of Memory\u201d (2006).

Bloomberg began the process of \u201cupzoning\u201d the area around Grand Central to encourage development of the kind of towers now found in London, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\nBut local community boards complained that new towers would overwhelm an already crowded district, while the owners of Grand Central, as well as landmarks like St. Patrick\u2019s, successfully sought the right to transfer air rights across a broader swath of Midtown.\n\nAir rights, also called transferable development rights, represent the difference between an existing building and the largest structure permitted under local zoning. Los Angeles and other cities also use air rights in their zoning code, but nowhere in the world are they used as extensively as in New York.\n\nGrand Central, for instance, has more than 1.3 million square feet of air rights, while St. Patrick\u2019s has about 1.2 million. The increasing use of air rights in development in recent years has produced a generation of super towers, like the residential towers along Billionaire\u2019s Row, a stretch of 57th Street known for a $100 million penthouse.\n\nTo build taller under the Midtown East zoning plan, developers have to buy air rights within the district. Anyone selling air rights for projects there have to pay a minimum of $61.49 a square foot, or 20 percent of the sale price of air rights, whichever is greater, to fund either transit or streetside improvements.\n\nReal estate executives complained that the requirement would hobble new construction. But no one expected Chase to suddenly move to tear down its 57-year-old headquarters, even though the bank was clearly looking for a new home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn order to build a tower that would accommodate most of its employees, who are currently spread across multiple buildings on the East Side, the bank eventually went to the owners of Grand Central, TF Cornerstone, a real estate company run by K. Thomas and Fred Elghanayan, and MSD Capital, an investment firm controlled by Michael Dell of Dell Technologies.\n\nThe value of the air rights they control has been hotly debated. Andrew Penson, an investor who has a small stake in the property, has argued in the past that the rights were worth $880 per square foot. But developers and the city said that number was too high for office development. The Real Estate Board of New York argued that air rights were worth between $200 and $325 per square foot.\n\nThe bank, however, has since worked out a deal to buy about 680,000 square feet, for more than $350 per square foot, according to real estate and banking executives. St. Patrick\u2019s is asking $385 a square foot for its air rights.\n\nMr. Dell was well known to Chase, which was the lead bank in his $67 billion acquisition of the tech giant EMC. Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, personally assured EMC that Dell would have the money for the deal.\n\nMr. Dell and his partners stand to make more than $100 million.

Powell played the role that Mr. Mattis plays now: the voice of caution about what happens when unpredictable wars start, and the unanticipated follows.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe anniversary of the beginning of the Iraq invasion was Wednesday. Many who were involved in that decision have since begun to acknowledge the flaws \u2014 not only the reliance on what turned out to be false intelligence, but false assumptions about how quickly peace and prosperity would come to Iraq.\n\nMr. Bolton continues to assert that it was the right decision and was among those who insisted, in the run-up to the war, that Saddam Hussein was on the brink of getting weapons of mass destruction. His initial instinct was to use force.\n\nIn North Korea\u2019s case, there is no debate: The country has conducted six nuclear tests, and has demonstrated that its missiles are within striking distance of American cities.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Music directors might spend less than a third of the year with an ensemble but are the center of its marketing campaigns. The San Francisco Symphony is struggling to choose just the right successor to Michael Tilson Thomas, who will retire in 2020, after 25 years; that orchestra\u2019s very existence without him feels, at the least, delicate.\n\nThe centrality afforded to conductors makes them appear indispensable. It inclines institutions to look past obvious problems and try their best to make their relationships with their maestros work, at most any financial or moral cost. (The critic Justin Davidson, writing on the Vulture website, has pointed out a slew of questions regarding the Met\u2019s involvement in Mr. Levine\u2019s case that are left unanswered by the company\u2019s curt statement firing him.) The way some conductors have abused their power \u2014 Charles Dutoit, like Mr. Levine, has recently been felled amid numerous accusations of sexual misconduct \u2014 is a function of being granted so much power in the first place.\n\nPhoto\n\nActivists in any number of fields have lately renewed their calls to topple the patriarchy, but classical music is one of the few remaining areas of human endeavor in which leaders are still encouraged to think of themselves as daddies. When Jaap van Zweden, the incoming music director of the New York Philharmonic, visited The New York Times recently to speak with writers and editors, he referred without apparent irony to his role as \u201cfather\u201d of that orchestra. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin\u2019s Twitter biography likewise describes him, abbreviating some of the ensembles he directs, as \u201cFather of Rotterdam Phil, Philadelphia Orchestra, Orchestre M\u00e9tropolitain Mtl\u201d \u2014 and \u201cFuture father of the Met.\u201d\n\nMr. van Zweden and Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin doubtlessly believe they\u2019re being sweet; they aren\u2019t not. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin told The Times a few weeks ago that he is \u201cconsciously breaking\u201d what he called \u201cthis culture of \u2018You can\u2019t say anything to the maestro.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTheir paternal self-conception leaves them well short of Mr. Levine\u2019s or Mr. Dutoit\u2019s trespasses; most fathers, of course, aren\u2019t abusers or even unfair leaders. But in these cases, the two modes \u2014 parent figure and accused abuser \u2014 are sides of the same coin: a male-centered, star-driven structure that saps coffers, repels gender equity and leaves ensembles at a loss when a charmed leader disappears, unexpectedly or not.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe end of this story may well be happier. As classical music and opera slowly, steadily drift from mainstream culture, ticket sales that were once driven purely by the names of beloved music directors have dried up; audiences want experiences, not artists they more likely than not haven\u2019t heard of. The record companies that spent millions on advertising plumping up the celebrity-conductor complex are shadows of their former selves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile orchestras and opera companies hold tight, for the time being, to the fading magic of the maestro, beloved of aging donors and subscribers, audiences as a whole believe the illusion less and less each year. This demystification will eventually result in a more diverse, more modest pool of leaders.\n\nThere are already examples worth following. The Cleveland Orchestra, perhaps the finest in America, has had its music director, Franz Welser-M\u00f6st, for nearly 20 years now. He\u2019s plainly guided its style and artistic choices, and yet it has stubbornly, inspiringly declined to be defined by him. This orchestra and conductor seem truly like colleagues.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been thinking a lot, over the past few months, about Alan Gilbert, Mr. van Zweden\u2019s predecessor at the New York Philharmonic, whose up-and-down eight-year tenure ended in June, earlier than he probably would have liked. It causes me some shame, now, to look back on those years; I think I resisted Mr. Gilbert\u2019s performances, his presence \u2014 genial, bookish and curious, and utterly without glamour \u2014 because they didn\u2019t meet my sense of what a conductor was supposed to be. He acted like the Philharmonic\u2019s peer, not its papa.\n\nHe was more of a model than I recognized. The Met shouldn\u2019t want a savior to follow Mr. Levine.

And much of the serious activity there runs through Shabaka Hutchings. The 33-year-old tenor saxophonist anchors a handful of his own bands and served as the musical director for \u201cWe Out Here,\u201d a Brownswood Recordings compilation with tracks from nine British groups, like a book of hours for the thriving young scene.\n\nIn January Mr. Hutchings announced that he had signed with Impulse!, an imprint of Universal, and that the label would be releasing music from his various ensembles. The first to arrive is \u201cYour Queen Is a Reptile,\u201d the third album by his quartet, Sons of Kemet, and it\u2019s an excellent place to start.\n\nThis band has a rare instrumentation \u2014 tenor saxophone, tuba, two drummers \u2014 and a relentless, jouncing sound anchored in rhythms of the Caribbean. His two other major projects are Shabaka and the Ancestors, a collaboration with young South African musicians that has a forbearing, serious mission, and the Comet Is Coming, an astro-futurist trio influenced by electronic dance music. Sons of Kemet\u2019s sound falls somewhere right between those two: It\u2019s acoustic music, but adamant and dance-driven.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new album\u2019s title takes a shot at the British monarchy, a system that, Mr. Hutchings says, reaffirms the notion that one\u2019s birthright is enough to define class and status. He wrote each of the album\u2019s nine tunes for an alternate matriarch from the African diaspora. Their titles all have the same construction: \u201cMy Queen Is Harriet Tubman;\u201d \u201cMy Queen Is Yaa Asantewaa,\u201d for an early-20th-century Ashanti ruler; \u201cMy Queen Is Ada Eastman,\u201d for Mr. Hutchings\u2019s Barbadian great-grandmother; and so on.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "King Cyrus, who is credited with allowing Jews to return to Jerusalem from exile in the Babylonian empire, represents the possibility that a nonbelieving leader and state could be used by God to reunite the chosen people and the promised land.\n\nThe prominence of the Cyrus trope has revived fears about religious influences on United States foreign policy that have swirled around Republican presidents for decades. Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush were both accused of allowing their policies toward Israel to be influenced by interpretations of the Book of Revelation that foresee a literal Battle of Armageddon.\n\nAnd encouraging presidents to take up the mantle of Cyrus is also something of an American tradition. The Chicago-based preacher William Eugene Blackstone \u2014 who described himself as God\u2019s \u201cerrand boy\u201d \u2014 visited the White House in 1891 to present President Benjamin Harrison with a petition. It called on him to use his influence to extract Palestine from the Ottoman Empire and promote a Jewish state. The petition was signed by 413 prominent citizens, including the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice, Melville Fuller; the future president William McKinley; and the tycoons J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller. Its cover letter explicitly compared the president to Cyrus, offering him a \u201cprivileged opportunity\u201d to serve as patron of the Jewish people. For this service, five years before the publication of Theodor Herzl\u2019s \u201cDer Judenstaat,\u201d Louis Brandeis reportedly described Blackstone as the real \u201cfather of Zionism.\u201d\n\nHarrison was not even the first president to be imagined as a potential successor to Cyrus. In the 1790s, the New Jersey minister David Austin suggested that the United States under John Adams might help assist the world\u2019s Jews in returning to Palestine. Austin went so far as to purchase ships and warehouses that could be used for this purpose.\n\nAustin\u2019s practical efforts for the cause were unusual. But a fellow resident of Elizabeth, N.J., Elias Boudinot, an aide to George Washington who served as president of the Continental Congress, director of the United States Mint and other important posts, wrote several books urging the new republic to act as patron to the Jews and assist in their return to the territory God promised to Abraham.

Following are excerpts from an interview with the artist, which have been edited and condensed.\n\nWhat was the Southern California art scene like in the \u201970s?\n\nIt was unbelievably macho. I went through tremendous struggles to be taken seriously as a woman artist. I really tried to fit in, both in my art-making and in my persona. After about a decade I got tired of it. I didn\u2019t realize what a radical change I was about to make when I went to Fresno, but I knew I was setting out to create two things: a feminist art practice, and a feminist art education so that young women wouldn\u2019t have to do what I had to do.\n\nImage Judy Chicago\u2019s \u201cButterfly Test Plate #2,\u201d 1973-1974. Credit 2018 Judy Chicago/Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York and Salon 94, New York; Photo: Donald Woodman\n\nWhat was the goal when you got to CalArts?\n\nThere was no women\u2019s art scene. The goal was to build one. And I knew there was a lot of hunger among women for images that related to our own experience. I taught women to step up. I trained them in what it meant to be professional artists, and to raise their consciousness, among other things. Once I gave these young women permission to make art out of their own experiences as women, it was like an explosion.\n\nHow would you describe yourself?\n\nA troublemaker. I\u2019ve never fit in. In my first decade, I didn\u2019t fit in because of my gender. Then, after I made this radical change in my art, I didn\u2019t fit in because of the kind of art I was making. Part of the problem is the art world can\u2019t fit me into one category. I\u2019ve done different subject matters and different techniques. I have tried to make art that\u2019s accessible to a broad audience, that doesn\u2019t need somebody to stand between me and the audience and explain it, and that\u2019s very out of step with the art world.\n\nWhat did people take away from Womanhouse?\n\nIn those days, women were the primary audience for feminist art. That has dramatically changed. Young men now come by themselves to see my work. There\u2019s a big shift generationally. Back then men came because their mothers, wives, girlfriends or sisters brought them. Many were uncomfortable because they didn\u2019t know how to relate.\n\nImage The cover of the exhibition catalog for the original Womanhouse exhibition with Ms. Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. The cover was designed by Sheila de Bretteville. Credit Through the Flower Archive\n\nOver the past 46 years what are the biggest changes?\n\nI\u2019d been told in the \u201960s that I couldn\u2019t be both a woman and an artist. I had to excise any hint of gender from my work in order to be taken seriously in the L.A. art scene. That has completely changed. Young women, artists of color, artists of the range of sexual orientation can now be themselves openly in their work. That\u2019s a fabulous change.\n\nWhat do you hope this new show accomplishes?\n\nI hope it kicks ass, shakes people up, and opens their eyes. That it gives them new experiences and helps them understand more about the range of women\u2019s experiences and their views.", "title": "Women, Art and the Houses They Built", "authors": []}

He was considering expanding his media and events businesses into Saudi Arabia and also was hunting for moneyed partners in acquisitions.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intersection of the tabloid publisher with the Saudis, enhanced by the White House visit, is a previously untold chapter in the long, symbiotic relationship between the president and Mr. Pecker, which was forged in the 1990s. At the time, Mr. Trump was celebrating a real estate comeback after his casino bankruptcies and was both the subject and the source of much gossip in New York.\n\nMr. Pecker, who had known Mr. Grine only for a few months, invited him to the dinner to thank him for advice he had provided about investing in the Middle East, according to someone who knew of the invitation.\n\nWord soon traveled back to Saudi Arabia about the dinner: It signaled Mr. Pecker\u2019s powerful status in Washington.\n\nTwo months later, he was in Saudi Arabia, meeting with Mr. Grine and the crown prince about business opportunities there, according to A.M.I.\n\nAnd by January, Mr. Pecker was confident enough about his growing rapport with Saudi investors that he sought their help bankrolling a possible acquisition of Time magazine, which he had long coveted, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. A.M.I. disputed that.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe people briefed on the interactions between A.M.I. and Saudi Arabia requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe outcome of Mr. Pecker\u2019s efforts to do business with the Saudis remains unclear. But he is still working to cultivate ties. This week, he and Mr. Grine both attended events in New York featuring Prince Mohammed, who is on a tour across the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAhead of that visit, A.M.I. published a 97-page glossy magazine that is essentially a promotional brochure for Saudi Arabia and the crown prince. It makes no mention of anything troubling, like the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen, human rights concerns or the crown prince\u2019s arrest last fall of many extended royals, including Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, an influential client of Mr. Grine\u2019s.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 which refers to Saudi Arabia throughout as \u201cthe Magic Kingdom\u201d \u2014 includes an interview with Mr. Grine, accompanied by a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, taken during his visit with Mr. Pecker. It talks up the relationship between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, noting that Mr. Trump \u201cendorsed the crown prince\u2019s high profile anticorruption\u201d crackdown.\n\nA.M.I. has said it produced the magazine to \u201ccapitalize\u201d on interest in the crown prince, who is next in line to the throne, and has been careful to say it received no input or guidance from Saudi officials. That carries important legal implications: Foreign direction or control of such a purely promotional publication may require disclosure to the Justice Department. The Saudi government did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe magazine \u2014 200,000 copies distributed in Walmart and other outlets, with a cover price of $13.99 and no advertising \u2014 provided a unique welcome mat for the prince, whose visit comes as the Trump administration is trying to establish tighter ties with the kingdom. Both countries are touting cross-border investment opportunities, including a pledge by the Saudi government to put $20 billion into a fund that will invest in American infrastructure projects. The kingdom is also nearing a deal to buy American-made missiles and other military equipment.\n\nMr. Grine, a 30-year-old French citizen, has helped broker deals between Saudi investors and companies in France, Senegal and the United States. He and Mr. Pecker were introduced last spring by Ari Emanuel, chief executive of Endeavor, the huge talent, entertainment and sports company based in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Grine and Mr. Pecker soon had a series of discussions about the investment landscape in Saudi Arabia, according to a person briefed on the talks. Mr. Pecker extended the White House dinner invitation shortly afterward.\n\nA.M.I. would not say who else was among the \u201cselect group of friends\u201d Mr. Pecker took to the White House at the president\u2019s invitation. During the evening, the Middle East and the recent French elections came up. In a statement, A.M.I. said, \u201cThe entire conversation was social, with the exception of a couple very brief mentions of current events.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pecker is best known for The Enquirer, but his media empire is wide-ranging.

Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, recently filed a lawsuit alleging that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer was secretly involved when A.M.I. tried to bury her story about an affair with Mr. Trump. A.M.I. bought the rights to her story during the presidential campaign for $150,000 but never published it. In the world of gossip media, such a maneuver is known as a \u201ccatch and kill\u201d operation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Michael D. Cohen and A.M.I. have denied the allegations. Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives say the affair never happened.\n\nDuring the campaign, The Enquirer also published scathing articles about Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, as well as perceived antagonists like the television host Megyn Kelly. In promoting Mr. Trump, The Enquirer endorsed a candidate for the first time in its history.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince he entered the White House, A.M.I. titles have run articles alleging a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine Mr. Trump.

His last significant public comment as Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer was to call on the Justice Department to shut down the Russia investigation \u2014 a position he attributed to Mr. Trump before backtracking and claiming it as his own.\n\nThe president\u2019s legal team appears to be falling apart just as his legal problems are mounting, both from the Russia investigation and, more recently, from women who say they\u2019ve had affairs with Mr. Trump and are seeking to be released from agreements to silence them. Before Mr. Dowd\u2019s departure, Mr. Trump had spoken to associates about firing Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer who has been advocating a cooperative approach toward Mr. Mueller. Meanwhile Mr. Trump has reached out to, and been rebuffed by, at least two legal heavyweights in the last few weeks: Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, and the conservative superstar Ted Olson.\n\nIn their stead the president has brought on Joseph diGenova, a lawyer who has argued on television that the Justice Department and the F.B.I. are framing Mr. Trump. Who else is there? Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and self-described liberal from Harvard who has taken on the unlikely role of Trump defender? Or Marc Kasowitz, who previously represented Mr. Trump before leaving because he, among other things, threatened a stranger over email?\n\nThe bigger problem for Mr. Trump is that there aren\u2019t many experienced lawyers who will want to take on a client like him \u2014 save, perhaps, Michael Cohen, a longtime loyalist and Trump lawyer who may be in serious legal trouble of his own, and Roy Cohn, who is dead. Mr. Cohn, a litigious thug who helped destroy the lives of many decent people before being disbarred for \u201cparticularly reprehensible\u201d ethical violations, took a young Mr. Trump under his wing and taught him how to use the law: as a concealed weapon, brandished primarily in the service of vengeance or survival. Mr. Trump was an avid student, as evidenced by the empty threats of litigation he aims regularly at reporters or the unconscionable nondisclosure agreements he wrests from his paramours and underlings.\n\nBeyond this, Mr. Trump has shown contempt for the rule of law and its operation in a democratic society. He attacks the institutions that embody it, from the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to the federal courts and their judges. His approach is not based on any philosophy of governance, but on scorn for or fear of anyone who would hold him to account. So it is fitting that the biggest threat to Mr. Trump is coming from the courts, and from Mr. Mueller, who in many ways represents Mr. Trump\u2019s polar opposite \u2014 a man who has devoted his life to respecting and enforcing the law. And it\u2019s concerning, to say the least, that Mr. Trump is eagerly throwing off the yoke of relatively sober legal counsel just as Mr. Mueller homes in on the president and his shady family business empire.", "title": "Opinion | Would You Want to Be Donald Trump\u2019s Lawyer?", "authors": []}

It\u2019s an interesting issue since the panel generally doesn\u2019t get involved until a potential transaction has been submitted to it for review, and obviously, there\u2019s nothing of the sort yet. Some officials pointed out that the panel has the jurisdiction to consider board takeovers as a form of foreign acquisition, though the article said that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin isn\u2019t sold yet on the argument.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider the second point. The WSJ reported that some Cfius members share Mr. Cornyn\u2019s concerns about a weakened or distracted Qualcomm falling behind Huawei of China in the 5G contest.\n\nBut that ignores Qualcomm\u2019s very public collaboration with Chinese tech companies on 5G. The American chip maker said in January that it has shared information on some of its hardware with Lenovo, Xiaomi and other Chinese companies.\n\nAnd last week, Qualcomm and Huawei announced that they have jointly conducted significant tests for a 5G standard. Here\u2019s what Serge Wilenegger, a Qualcomm Wireless executive, said in the news release:\n\n\u201cAs the industry works toward the goal of commercial launches of 5G NR products and networks in 2019, close collaboration among global mobile industry leaders is necessary to validate the technologies and continue to build and improve our capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe research analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein isn\u2019t convinced by Mr. Cornyn\u2019s point either, arguing in an investor note that Intel can also play a role in developing 5G tech and that, more importantly, Broadcom itself is very interested in the wireless standard.\n\nBroadcom has a reputation for being a cost-cutter, which Qualcomm has argued would likely stunt its ability to keep innovating. That question hasn\u2019t been settled. But the question of whether a deal would endanger the U.S.\u2019s role in the 5G race appears to go a bit too far.\n\nA related consideration: Cfius\u2019s ability to review Broadcom\u2019s moves depends on that chip maker being considered a foreign company. But shareholders of the manufacturer are scheduled to vote on moving its legal residence to the U.S. from Singapore on May 6. It\u2019s unclear whether the panel will act before then \u2014 or if it would ultimately have to decide that it has no jurisdiction after that change in address.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nThe silver linings in President Trump\u2019s tariff plans.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are unlikely to amount to effective policymaking. They target stanch allies and ignore far greater problems in the world trading system. But there may something to salvage from the wreckage.\n\nFirst, on the face of it, the president seems willing to risk a stock market plunge to pursue a policy that Wall Street opposes. Too often, the disfavor of investors is taken as evidence that a policy is terrible when it might be just inconvenient to powerful interests.\n\nSecond, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have kept an important debate over trade going. One hope for Mr. Trump\u2019s administration is that its skepticism toward free trade leads to policies that help workers whose jobs are vulnerable to free trade. The proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum are unlikely to provide longer-term assistance to workers in those industries. Still, the skepticism toward free trade may now be permanent and provide future administrations with greater leeway to address its drawbacks.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nMrs. May\u2019s reasonableness may not win over Europe.\n\nBritain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday described the highly preferential relationship her government is seeking to establish with the European Union after it leaves the bloc next year.\n\nAnd to win over skeptics, she attempted to make Britain\u2019s goals seem as reasonable as possible. Her requests for a unique relationship will no doubt get short shrift from those who say Britain cannot be allowed to enjoy the benefits of trading with Europe without accepting most of the obligations. Mrs. May\u2019s response is that both sides can benefit under a new arrangement. She said:\n\nWe both want good access to each other\u2019s markets; we want competition between us to be fair and open; and we want reliable, transparent means of verifying we are meeting our commitments and resolving disputes. But what is clear is that for us both to meet our objectives we need to look beyond the precedents, and find a new balance.\n\nAnd Mrs. May said Britain would not, as some fear, reduce regulation to win business from the European Union and still expect a high degree of access to the bloc\u2019s markets. She said:\n\nBut in practice we are unlikely to want to reduce our standards: not least because the British public would rightly punish any government that did so at the ballot box.\n\nThe big questions:\n\nWill the European Union be willing to set up a whole new regulatory infrastructure to oversee a stand-alone trading arrangement with Britain? Why would the bloc go to such lengths when it has the clout to insist that Britain abides by its rules?\n\nWhat would Britain do if the European Union says no to most of what\u2019s in Mrs. May\u2019s speech? It would almost certainly deepen tensions within the British government between those who want a deeply entwined trading relationship with Europe and those who favor a looser one. Mrs. May, who has spent weeks trying to build a consensus in her cabinet, may then find it even harder to present a coherent position to the European Union, giving it even less reason to want to compromise.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat will it take for Gary Cohn to leave?\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s national economic adviser has threatened to quit before, most notably in the wake of the controversy over the violence in Charlottesville, Va. But now that Mr. Cohn apparently has been outplayed in the battle over trade, will he finally decide to depart?\n\nThe former Goldman Sachs president had managed to hold off trade hard-liners like the policy adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross during previous debates on tariffs. But an exodus of like-minded White House officials diminished Mr. Cohn\u2019s standing \u2014 and let his rivals reassert their positions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey of the WaPo:\n\n\u201cGary got rolled and was entirely kept in the dark,\u201d a person close to the White House said of Trump\u2019s top economic adviser.\n\nOr as Mike Allen and Jonathan Swan of Axios put it:\n\nThe tariffs call was also a big middle finger to economic adviser Gary Cohn, who has fought for more than one year to kill tariffs that would provoke a trade war or higher prices for consumers, a de facto tax increase.\n\nOur colleagues Mark Landler and Maggie Haberman have reported that Mr. Cohn threatened to resign if the president followed through on the tariff threat. (That cost him standing with Mr. Trump, though he seemed to regain much of his political capital, particularly after the passage of the tax overhaul.)\n\nMr. Landler and Ms. Haberman point out that Mr. Cohn is still waiting to see if Mr. Trump actually rolls out the tariffs \u2014 a fair question, given how quickly his boss appears to switch policy positions.\n\nBut if the White House does impose tariffs on imported aluminum and steel, will Mr. Cohn finally pull the trigger?\n\nOn a related note, let\u2019s talk about the resuscitation of Mr. Ross\u2019s political fortunes:\n\n\u2022 Axios, on Jan. 21: \u201cPresident Donald Trump has put Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out to pasture,\u201d the publication reported, noting that Mr. Ross had been criticized for falling asleep in meetings.\n\n\u2022 Axios, today: \u201cWhite House staff, most of whom were in the dark about Trump\u2019s planned tariffs announcement, are referring to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the victor in the policy coup, as \u2018Chief Ross.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nThe world is girding for a potential trade war\n\nExpect today to be rough in the markets, after President Trump doubled down this morning on his threat to impose tariffs on international steel and aluminum. S. & P. 500 futures are down in premarket trading, after falling yesterday.\n\nThe current plan: A 25 percent tariff on steel and a 10 percent one on aluminum.\n\nThe winners: U.S. sellers of industrial metals, like AK Steel and U.S. Steel, whose stocks jumped yesterday; trade hard-liners like Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, Robert Lighthizer, the White House\u2019s top trade negotiator, and Peter Navarro, its trade policy guru.\n\nThe losers: Big metal consumers like Ford, G.M., Boeing and United Technologies; free-trade proponents like Gary Cohn, who has threatened to resign; many Republican lawmakers; Brazil; and Canada.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe world\u2019s response: China could retaliate with tariffs on some U.S. goods. The E.U. could, too. Japan and Korea are hoping that, as allies, they would be exempted \u2014 but they appear prepared to fight back.\n\nThe context: George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel in 2002. He lifted them a year later.\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs may be quite narrow in focus and exist for a relatively short period. Investors could learn to live with those. But the U.S. economy and stock markets have some vulnerabilities that could magnify the damage from a trade war.\n\nWhat could President Trump\u2019s planned tariffs mean for Nafta?\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s economists wrote that while the potential tariff\u2019s on imported steel and aluminum \u201ccould alleviate political pressure on the White House to pursue other trade restrictions in the near-term,\u201d it would increase \u201cthe probability of trade-restrictive outcomes to other pending issues.\u201d\n\nOn Nafta:\n\n\u201cWe believe the most likely outcome in the near-term is the announcement of a few small agreements on technical trade issues, but we continue to expect negotiations to stall on major issues like rules of origin and government procurement. There is a good chance that this could eventually lead the President to announce he intends to withdraw from NAFTA, but such an announcement does not appear likely in the near term, in our view.\u201d\n\nOn China\u2019s practices regarding intellectual property and technology transfer:\n\n\u201cWe expect that the Administration will ultimately announce restrictions on investment by Chinese companies in the US, and possibly broader trade restrictions, in response to its ongoing Section 301 investigation. The deadline for that decision is not until August, however, and it is not clear when an announcement in this area will be made.\u201d\n\nWilbur Ross: Potential prices increases will be \u2018no big deal.\u2019\n\nThe Commerce Secretary appeared on CNBC and downplayed the impact of President Trump\u2019s planned tariffs, using a can of Campbell Soup.\n\n\u201cIn a can of Campbell Soup, there are about 2.6 pennies worth of steel. So if that goes up by 25 percent, that\u2019s about six-tenths of one cent on the price on a can of Campbell Soup,\u201d Ross argued. \u201cI just bought this can today at a 7-Eleven ... and it priced at a $1.99. Who in the world is going to be too bothered?\u201d\n\nNot everyone agrees with that view:\n\nPhoto\n\nThe questions BlackRock is asking gun makers.\n\nBlackRock, the largest investor in the world, is doubling down on pushing gun makers to consider their responsibilities to the public. BlackRock said that in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shootings it has been speaking with public gun manufacturers and retailers.\n\n\u201cFor manufacturers and retailers of civilian firearms, we believe that responsible policies and practices are critical to their long-term prospects. Now more so than ever. That is why, over the past week, we have reached out to the major publicly traded civilian firearms manufacturers and retailers to engage in a discussion of their business practices. We have already had constructive discussions with some, and we are continuing to pursue our engagement with them all.\u201d\n\nBlackrock said it is asking companies to answer questions like:\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhat is your strategy and process for managing the reputational, financial and litigation risk associated with manufacturing civilian firearms?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow do you assess the financial, reputational and litigation risk of the various aspects of your product lines and how each of those products is distributed?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Andrew Ross Sorkin\n\nPhoto\n\nDid Kushner Companies seek money from Qatar\u2019s finance minister last year?\n\nAn article in The Intercept says that not only did the real estate firm \u2014 which Jared Kushner led until joining the White House \u2014 try to convince Qatar to invest in its embattled 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan, but that it spoke directly with the emirate\u2019s top money man.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe meeting between Charles Kushner, Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, and Ali Sharif Al Emadi of Qatar was last April, a month before Saudi Arabia and others set up a blockade of the emirate. Mr. Kushner supported the move, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not.\n\nMore from Clayton Swisher and Ryan Grim of The Intercept:\n\nThe 30-minute meeting, according to two sources in the financial industry who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the potential transaction, included aides to both parties, and was held at a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York. A follow-up meeting was held the next day in a glass-walled conference room at the Kushner property itself, though Al Emadi did not attend the second gathering in person.\n\nA Kushner Companies spokeswoman said that the company doesn\u2019t \u201cdo business with any sovereign funds.\u201d\n\nThe context: Mr. Kushner\u2019s family business has appeared to become more of a liability to his work in the White House. Remember that he held meetings with top financiers whose firms later lent money to Kushner Companies, which has aroused concerns. Or that several countries have reportedly discussed using his complicated financial ties as negotiating leverage over him.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nGrading Trump\u2019s management style\n\nMr. Trump has long thrived on chaos as an organizing principle. But how much disorder is too much?\n\nRemember that the White House has suffered from: very public infighting; off-the-cuff policy proposals by the president; a historically high 34 percent turnover rate; officials threatening to quit to win policy arguments; and an array of investigations into advisers (including Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka) and cabinet members.\n\nJim Stewart spoke with a number of experts for their takes on how the president has been running his White House. Here\u2019s a taster:\n\n\u2022 Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University, said of the White House\u2019s turnover rate, \u201cThis reflects badly on his leadership.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

What we can test numerically is how the academy compares with its peer organizations.\n\nThe two most notable screenplay awards outside the Oscars \u2014 as well as two of the best predictors of the screenplay categories \u2014 are handed out by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Writers Guild of America. By 1985, they had both switched over to the modern format \u2014 two screenplay categories, one for original and one for adapted \u2014 so we\u2019ll use data since then to compare all three organizations.\n\nThe result: all three are nearly tied: The Oscars and WGAs have both nominated about 1.5 percent more diverse screenwriters than the Baftas. The American academy can claim the lead on rewarding these storytellers: 19 Oscar winners since then have come from outside the group of non-Latino white men, compared with only 13 at the WGAs and nine at the Baftas.\n\nWinning, it turns out, is the one area in which the screenplay Oscars do not currently involve a demographic disparity. Since the Oscars shifted to original and adapted screenplay categories, white men and everyone else win 17 percent of their nominations on average.\n\nSo, while the data suggests a historical lack of opportunity for female and minority screenwriters to get invited to the Oscars, we can take heart in a couple findings: First, if a writer does get nominated, regardless of background, he or she has the same chance at winning as every other competitor. And second, the number of people who have the opportunity to tell their stories appears to be trending up.", "title": "Writing Their Way Into a Diverse Oscars", "authors": []}

Exakt Fijnmechanika, the company he founded soon after receiving his degree in precision engineering from the Instrumentmakers School in Leiden, produces precision components such as those used in ophthalmological surgery, the aerospace industry \u2014 and, these days, watchmaking.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeginning with a few Dutch clients in 1990, the company has earned an international reputation for producing superior elements for industries that require optimal accuracy and minute components.\n\nWhich was exactly what Mr. van der Gang wanted in his ideal watch. \u201cI needed a level of quality and workmanship that was higher than you find in the jewelry world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn the jewelry world, if it\u2019s beautiful, if it\u2019s shiny, it\u2019s good. But companies that work in the space industry demand more. So we used the techniques from our Fijnmechanika business to make a watch.\u201d\n\nThe first watch took two years to develop. Priced at 5,600 euros (now, $6,835), the limited edition of 250 sold out, mostly through word of mouth. The prototype, made of paper with a piece of standard plastic for a crystal, is still displayed at the company\u2019s showroom, where Mr. van der Gang presented it with the pride of a young father showing photos of his newborn.\n\nAnd indeed, its creation marked the birth of Van der Gang Watches, which shares offices with Exakt Fijnmechanika in a former agricultural school, built in the 1950s. Mr. van der Gang renovated and redesigned the space himself, from the glass-walled rooms, windowed corridors and spare, laboratory-like workshops to the all-white furnishings and red glass chandeliers.\n\nA small, wiry man with wild, wiry curls, Mr. van der Gang moves with a sprite-like enthusiasm and energy, though his conversation is measured, his voice gentle and calm. If the character of Van der Gang watches lies in their details, then the same is true of their creator.\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite his emphasis on technology, there are indications of another, sentimental side. His wife, a graphic artist, helps design each watch face. A eight-foot-high photograph of his daughter as a toddler (she is now 16) fills the wall opposite his work table. He gave the first watch he ever made to his father. And although he now keeps the first and last examples of every new model for the archives, the second one still goes to Dad.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat sentimentality also fuels his creative process. \u201cI have a passion for making something beautiful and the best,\u201d Mr. van der Gang said.\n\nOn the sporty, aviation-style Vlieger 20045WW-T, for instance, the sapphire crystal, cut flat to enhance shine, rises a tenth of an inch to stand, bezel-free, above the case. No other brands, he said, produce this free-standing, faceted edge or use such thick crystals \u2014 the sapphire and the faceting process are too costly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The compatibility of the two concerns also allows Mr. van der Gang to produce a relatively affordable high-end watch \u2014 models now are priced from \u20ac5,900 to \u20ac22,000 \u2014 while still meeting his exacting demands.\n\nTo ensure this standard of quality, the company purchases basic Swiss-made movements, then dismantles and rebuilds them to \u201cto create something that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d explained Roel van den Haak, co-owner of the Amsterdam Watch Company, an official Van der Gang dealer.\n\nVan der Gang creates all the complications, such as chronograph and second time-zone functions, in-house, along with all parts that connect the shaft and movement to the watch itself. Numerals are hand-placed, the cases hand-polished. A complication moon feature, one of Mr. van der Gang\u2019s favorites, shows the actual shape of phases of the moon. \u201cHe invents many of the different functions,\u201d Mr. van den Haak said. \u201cThis is part of what makes him unique.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. van der Gang\u2019s greatest pride, however, are the watch cases, which are carved rather than cast. For the steel Vlieger case, for instance, a block of steel weighing a little more than two pounds is cut down with high-voltage wires until it weighs a bit more than a half an ounce.\n\n\u201cBy milling and turning, we take material away, so you can sculpt it to any shape you want,\u201d Mr. van der Gang said. The same process is used for gold and ceramic cases, resulting in sharp, clean edges, and a modeled underside that fits comfortably against the wrist.\n\nAdditionally, transparent blue sapphire crystal casebacks \u201cshow that the inside is as beautiful as the outside,\u201d said Maaike Borstlap, the company\u2019s marketing director.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. van der Gang is building on his initial success, examining ways to expand his market beyond the Netherlands.\n\nNow, the watches are available only through two Dutch shops, on the company\u2019s websites and by phone order.\n\nStill, Mr. van der Gang has no intention of becoming a mass-market brand. The company employs eight people, two of them watchmakers, and produces 150 watches a year, each made to order. The process usually takes about four months, Mr. van der Gang said, though it can be expedited.\n\nMeantime, Mr. van der Gang is busy developing a perpetual calendar watch, a project he has been working on for several years.

There is no sure evidence that Mr. Wang can succeed, especially if Vice President Mike Pence does not emerge as his counterpart to manage tensions, Mr. Hass said.\n\n\u201cTrump really values being the person in the cockpit steering U.S.-China relations,\u201d Mr. Hass said. \u201cSo I think Wang Qishan\u2019s impact on the relationship remains an open question.\u201d\n\nWhile many National People\u2019s Congress delegates welcomed Mr. Wang\u2019s elevation, his election was also a sign of how Mr. Xi has recast political conventions so that he can consolidate power and surround himself with trusted supporters. For five years, from late 2012, Mr. Wang was in charge of the party\u2019s discipline commission, from which he pursued Mr. Xi\u2019s withering drive against corruption and political laxity.\n\nParty sources said last year that Mr. Xi had raised the idea of keeping Mr. Wang in the formal party leadership, which would have bent an unspoken rule that top officials step down if they have reached age 68 when the congress meets to appoint new leadership. Instead, Mr. Wang, now 69, left his party positions at that congress and largely disappeared from public view in the following months.\n\nBut it turned out that Mr. Xi still had plans for him. In January, Mr. Wang was named a delegate to the legislature, a sign that his career was not over.\n\n\u201cI think Wang will play an important role in determining whether Xi succeeds over the next five years and can smoothly make a transition to a third term,\u201d Mr. Wu, the analyst in Beijing, said. \u201cXi thinks there are many challenges still ahead, I believe, so Wang has been kept on as kind of a consultant.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi and Mr. Wang first met about five decades ago during the Cultural Revolution, when they were both sent from Beijing to work as \u201csent down youth\u201d in rural northwest China, a poor and dusty corner of the country. Mr. Wang lived on a commune about 50 miles from Mr. Xi, who has said Mr. Wang stopped by for a night and took away a book on economics.\n\nAfter China began to loosen controls on the economy from the late 1970s, Mr. Wang left his job as a historian in a state institute and became an expert on rural reforms, zipping around Beijing on a Japanese motorbike, then a rare sight in Beijing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Wang accumulated experience in economic policy, and from the 1990s he rose through a series of increasingly senior government jobs, defusing financial messes and getting to know financiers on Wall Street. In 2003 he was made mayor of Beijing to deal with SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a virus that spread after officials hid the epidemic.\n\nAs deputy premier for five years from 2008, Mr. Wang was a key negotiator in trade and investment talks with the United States. After the global financial crisis erupted, Mr. Wang also took charge of a group of officials assigned with designing China\u2019s response.\n\nBut Mr. Wang is no economic liberal.\n\n\u201cYou were my teacher,\u201d Mr. Wang told Mr. Paulson, the former Treasury secretary recalled in his memoir. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure we should be learning from you anymore.\u201d", "title": "Xi Starts New Term in China, With Trusted Deputy to Deal With Trump", "authors": ["Chris Buckley"]}

Statistics on how many college rape cases go to trial are elusive, but experts agree that the number is exceedingly low; the Department of Justice estimates that between 4 percent and 20 percent of female college students who are raped report the attack to law enforcement.\n\nBut unfolding as it did in the wake of the #MeToo movement and the fierce, unresolved debate over whether campus rape cases are best handled by universities or law enforcement, Mr. Khan\u2019s trial also took on political significance, with defense lawyers accusing Yale of making Mr. Khan a scapegoat for its own poor handling of previous sexual assault claims. Representatives from Families Advocating for Campus Equality, a group that has criticized university hearing processes as skewed in favor of accusers, attended the trial in support of Mr. Khan.\n\nIn an interview after the verdict, Norman Pattis, a lawyer for Mr. Khan, said he had tried to challenge \u201cthe outer limits of the #MeToo movement,\u201d which he called \u201ca form of mass hysteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cSex happens, especially on college campuses,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a two-week trial, the six-member jury deliberated for about three hours before returning a verdict. In an interview afterward, a juror, Diane Urbano, said the #MeToo movement had not figured in the panel\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt was not part of the case,\u201d she said. \u201cWe put it aside.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, they considered the evidence. \u201cThere was sufficient doubt on every charge,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo we came to the verdict we did.\u201d\n\nMaura Crossin, executive director of the Victim Rights Center of Connecticut, which, along with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, represented the complainant, declined to comment.

Mr. Khan, a native of Afghanistan, never finished college and has been living with family.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the start, the case had promised to be difficult to try. The encounter had unfolded on a raucous, alcohol-fueled evening, across several off-campus and on-campus settings. Text messages between the complainant and Mr. Khan were interspersed with emojis and specific references to Yale\u2019s campus culture, which defense lawyers promoted as proof of flirtation; the complainant said they meant nothing.\n\nOn the night of the alleged assault, the complainant said, she attended an off-campus party with her friends, where she had several drinks \u2014 the first time she had ever been drunk, she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She found herself instead with Mr. Khan, an acquaintance who had been pursuing her, who sat with her as she threw up several times and accompanied her back to her room afterward.\n\nMr. Pattis showed the jury security camera footage of the two walking back to her dorm, in which the complainant appeared to be leaning on Mr. Khan, her leg dragging slightly behind her.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you look like two lovers?\u201d Mr. Pattis asked the woman on the stand.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied.\n\nIn the middle of the night, the complainant said, she woke up to find Mr. Khan on top of her, and she tried to push him off. In the morning, she was naked, even though she said she remembered lying down fully clothed. She saw used condoms on the floor, and bruising on her legs.\n\nShe visited Yale\u2019s sexual harassment and assault resource center on Nov. 2, where an administrator called the police. Mr. Khan was suspended from Yale on Nov. 9, and officers arrested him on Nov. 12.\n\nMr. Khan, who testified in his own defense, offered a vastly different account of the night, one in which the complainant invited him to her room and took off her own clothes. Her apparent anger the next morning, he said, came as a shock.\n\n\u201cThis was a different demeanor,\u201d Mr. Khan said.\n\nMr. Pattis said there were glaring inconsistencies in the complainant\u2019s story, and that she remembered only the details that bolstered her allegations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat went on in the room that night made everyone uncomfortable, but it wasn\u2019t a crime,\u201d Mr. Pattis said after the verdict.\n\nThe prosecutor, Michael Pepper, said the gaps in the alleged victim\u2019s memory were proof that she had not made up the assault.\n\n\u201cIf she wanted to do that so bad, put a nail in the coffin, wouldn\u2019t she have given you a more coherent story?\u201d he asked the jury.\n\nThe complainant insisted the same.

Sabathia won the World Series in his first year as a Yankee, in 2009, when expectations were even higher than they are now. That is how Sabathia remembers it, citing the opening of the new Yankee Stadium and the contracts the Yankees had just showered on him, Mark Teixeira and A. J. Burnett. Stanton will be expected to adjust as smoothly as Sabathia did.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked, just leaving from the small market to the big market,\u201d Sabathia said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same, man.

It is hard to see Mr. Bolton acting as an honest broker. He is known to play a ruthless inside game as he maneuvers to win bureaucratic battles and freezes out people he thinks have crossed him. He has been such a lightning rod that he couldn\u2019t get confirmed as United Nations ambassador in 2005, so President George W. Bush gave him a recess appointment, and he stayed in the job about a year. It was considered unlikely that the Senate would confirm him as secretary of state, but the national security adviser job doesn\u2019t require confirmation.\n\nBringing on the fiery Mr. Bolton now, at a delicate moment with North Korea, is a terrible decision. While Mr. Trump has often threatened North Korea with military action, he accepted Mr. Kim\u2019s invitation to a summit meeting, brokered by South Korea\u2019s president, who is eager for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear crisis.\n\nMr. Bolton, by contrast, told Fox News earlier this month that talks would be worthless, and he has called South Korean leaders \u201cputty in North Korea\u2019s hands.\u201d On Feb. 28, he insisted in a Wall Street Journal op-ed article that \u201cit is perfectly legitimate for the United States to respond to the current \u2018necessity\u2019 posed by North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons by striking first.\u201d Last summer he wrote in The Journal, \u201cThe U.S. should obviously seek South Korea\u2019s agreement (and Japan\u2019s) before using force, but no foreign government, even a close ally, can veto an action to protect Americans from Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nOn Iran, Mr. Bolton and the president are in sync, with both arguing that the United States should withdraw from the nuclear agreement by a May deadline. In March 2015, he argued in a New York Times Op-Ed opinion article that only military action like Israel\u2019s 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein\u2019s Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor \u201ccan accomplish what is required.\u201d\n\nGoing to war in either of these cases would not only create unnecessary bloodshed; it would be disastrous for the United States and its allies, South Korea and Japan. The Iran deal has substantially halted the nuclear program and needs to be maintained. Negotiations between the United States and North Korea, given a new impetus by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, need to be tested.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s position on Russia, that NATO must have a strong response to the Kremlin-linked poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain, is somewhat better than Mr. Trump\u2019s. But his rejection of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and his endorsement of a book by the anti-Muslim activist Pam Geller are unacceptable positions for a top American official.\n\nMr. Bolton is certain to accelerate American alienation from its allies and the rest of the world.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "One of the perplexing questions of constitutional law is what to do about a sitting president who is suspected of having committed a crime. This much is clear: A sitting president should not be required to submit to a criminal trial, an undertaking that would be incompatible with the duties of the nation\u2019s chief executive.\n\nThat should not, however, preclude a grand jury from indicting a president when the facts and the law warrant, even if the trial itself has to be postponed until he or she is no longer in office.\n\nAn indictment in this context serves a critically important purpose: Without it, the usual five-year statute of limitations for most federal crimes would elapse, forever precluding a president from being held accountable for potentially serious crimes. Thus, a president should be indictable unless he agrees to waive any future defense that the statute of limitations expired during the president\u2019s term.\n\nThere is nothing in the constitutional text or judicial precedent that provides for a categorical bar to the indictment of a sitting president. The closest the Supreme Court has come to addressing the question was in Clinton v. Jones in 1997, in which the issue was whether a president could delay until the end of his term a civil suit by a private individual. I argued Clinton v. Jones for the United States, urging the court to hold that a civil trial would unduly impair a president\u2019s ability to carry out his duties. The court unanimously rejected that position.", "title": "Opinion | Yes, You Can Indict the President", "authors": []}

The Rijksmuseum trustees announced Rijksstudio, a program that involved photographing hundreds of thousands of artworks and putting the free images online.\n\nWith a vast collection now in the public domain, Ms. Hofman saw a chance to get playful. As the museum leadership organized competitions to encourage people to make products based on the Rijksmuseum\u2019s collection, she began stocking the works of contest winners. She also initiated a series of partnerships with local corporations so that they might use the images for new types of merchandise.\n\nToday, when visitors enter the shop, they\u2019ll find action figures by the German toy manufacturer Playmobil based on \u201cThe Milkmaid\u201d and on Rembrandt\u2019s \u201cThe Night Watch.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSilk frocks by the Dutch fashion brand LaDress, printed with museum imagery, are available by special order.\n\nThe shop even has syrups, marmalades and jellies made from ingredients depicted in classic artworks.

Instead of being the last place people go after a visit, it can be the first.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne retail experiment Ms. Drubay considers emblematic of this new trend is the annex shop of the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso-Paris in Paris. This shop is not in the museum itself, but occupies a four-room apartment across the street at 4 Rue de Thorigny.\n\nIt sells books about the artist and objects made in his style. The shop is a kind of Picasso-world, selling gifts and decorative items \u2014 the kinds of things he might have owned. There\u2019s a bin of hand-carved masks from West Africa, for example.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe shop itself is decorated to reflect the style of an actual Parisian flat in which Picasso once lived. In fact, the store\u2019s designers purchased chairs and decorations similar to those in photographs of the artist\u2019s home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed like a living room and it\u2019s just like going to a friend\u2019s place,\u201d Ms. Drubay said. \u201cYou have this intimate and cozy feeling and you have a feeling that you can imagine an object in your home. I remember beautiful vases and coffee cups.\u201d\n\nIn some places, museum shops are playing a new role by filling a space abandoned by commercial vendors. In New York City, where high rents have made dedicated gift and design stores somewhat of a rarity, the shop of the Museum of Modern Art on West 53rd Street is the go-to place for high-concept tableware, furniture, lighting, jewelry and clothing.\n\nEvery piece offered has been approved by the museum\u2019s curatorial staff, and some of what is sold is in the MoMA permanent collection.

Original pieces by Jim Dine, William Wegman and David Hockney can be purchased there. Last winter, when the museum staged a Hockney retrospective, the shop had vintage hand-signed prints by the artist for between $6,000 and $40,000 each.\n\nWhy would a collector spend that kind of money at the Met and not at a commercial art gallery?\n\n\u201cBecause they know they can trust us,\u201d said Michael Hladky, Special Collections buyer for the gallery. \u201cEverything we sell is vetted.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s at least one museum shop selling a line of merchandise that\u2019s not at all material.

It has sold out.\n\nChristine Teel, who manages the Walker Shop, said that the idea behind \u201cIntangibles\u201d originated with her predecessors. \u201cThe concept is extremely creative,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted to do something outside of the box.

{"date": "2018-03-12 00:00:00", "text": "The reasons Douglass offered in support of this conclusion reveal that unlike most libertarian thinkers, he did not accept the idea that human beings are free insofar as they are able to act without unjust interference of others. This is what philosophers like to call \u201cfreedom as noninterference,\u201d and it is at the foundation of most libertarian theories of justice. While Douglass certainly believed that it was important to protect individuals from unjust interference, he did not believe this was sufficient to make human beings free.\n\nIn the context of the post-Civil War United States, Douglass explained, negative liberty was not enough because of the significant differences in power between former slaves and their former masters. The \u201cold master class\u201d had not lost \u201cthe power of life and death\u201d over the human beings it used to claim as property, he said, because it \u201cretained the power to starve them to death.\u201d \u201cYou shall serve me,\u201d the former master was still able to say to the former slave, \u201cor starve.\u201d This was slavery by another name.\n\nIt should be clear by now that the alternative theory of liberty defended by Douglass, which philosophers often call \u201cfreedom as non-domination,\u201d poses serious problems for those wishing to defend the idea that he was a libertarian. What makes libertarians uncomfortable about \u201cfreedom as non-domination\u201d is that it opens the door to the idea that the state may have an important role to play in counteracting the power of economic elites, who left unchecked might use their power to dominate others.\n\nBut let\u2019s step down out of the clouds of theory to see the practical implications of Douglass\u2019s view. Recall that in his libertarian reading, Sandefur argues that Douglass \u201cnever joined in efforts by some leaders, including Charles Sumner, to confiscate plantation land and divide it among the former slaves.\u201d Douglass \u201cwas too well versed in the history and theory of freedom,\u201d Sandefur explains, \u201cnot to know that destabilizing property rights in such a way would in the long run harm the freedmen more.\u201d\n\nSandefur is right that in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, Douglass did not join with Sumner and the other Radical Republicans in their call for confiscation and redistribution. Perhaps Sandefur is also right that Douglass\u2019s \u201ctheory of freedom\u201d led him to reject this path in those years. What Sandefur does not tell us, though, is that Douglass changed his mind.\n\nIn the 1880 Emancipation Day speech, Douglass said the threat to liberty presented by economic inequality was \u201cseen and felt by Thaddeus Stevens, Charles Sumner, and leading stalwart Republicans, and had their counsels prevailed, the terrible evils from which we now suffer would have been averted.\u201d It is hard to imagine Douglass stating this more clearly. By 1880, he was looking back and saying, they were right, I was wrong. His \u201ctheory of freedom\u201d had evolved.\n\nIt is worth noting that Douglass himself considered his 1880 Emancipation Day speech to be among his most important. We know this because when it came time to choose two speeches to include as appendices for his 1881 autobiography, \u201cThe Life and Times of Frederick Douglass,\u201d he chose it and his famous \u201cFreedmen\u2019s Memorial Speech\u201d about Abraham Lincoln. This speech mattered a lot to Douglass and it ought to matter to those of us who want to tell the truth about his legacy.", "title": "Opinion | You Can\u2019t Put Frederick Douglass in Chains", "authors": []}

Extreme value, both monetary and emotional, is placed on certain individual dogs, while an entire underclass of dogs are treated as objects, as means to an end, as cogs in the wheels of human commerce and moneymaking.\n\nThe exploitation of the canine underclass is perhaps the most insidious problem with cloning. But there are other things to worry about. Two of the nation\u2019s most prominent animal advocacy organizations, the Humane Society of the United States and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, have come out against cloning pets. They have profound concerns about the welfare of the animals involved in cloning research, but they also point out that millions of dogs are languishing in shelters, waiting for a home and often facing early death by euthanasia. We collectively, as a pet-obsessed culture, are responsible for their situation. And yet we can feel O.K. about spending tens of thousands of dollars and tremendous energy and resources to produce cloned puppies?

None of this is true.\n\nCloning is symptomatic of deeper problems in how our culture thinks about pet dogs. It reinforces the status of dogs as things to buy and collect, and as sentimental tokens and emotional support objects. Dogs are valued for our feelings toward them, rather than for who they are as individuals.\n\nIn 2016, a cloning company sought to partner with an animal hospice and palliative care organization on whose board I serve. We declined. Veterinary practices providing end-of-life care are an an obvious market for pet cloning services, since these veterinarians serve clients who are staring into the abyss of loss.

I learned to do them myself just this year. Once you get it, it\u2019s not that hard, but you have to devote one several-hour block to figuring it out. It\u2019s really about relaxing while you do it, and you have to learn to cut them to fit your eyes. I measure them from the center of my pupil to the end of my eye, and I cut off the bigger end. I curl my lashes; I put on a light coat of mascara and a little eye pencil as close as I can to my lashes and then smudge it a bit. Then I lay the lashes on by looking directly into a magnifier mirror.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Also, you want to blow on the glue for, like, two seconds before you set it on the skin at the top of your lashes. I use only Duo lash glue in black. And make sure your pointer finger and thumb are really dry so that when you squeeze the lashes down onto the lid and then roll your finger off, it doesn\u2019t pull the lashes with it.\n\nFragrance\n\nWhen I put on some fragrance, I like Chanel No. 5 or Kai. There\u2019s also this perfume Dange-Rose by Blumarine that\u2019s great.\n\nHair\n\nI cut my own hair. The first time was when I was with a French hairdresser years and years ago, and I had long hair. He said pull all your hair up and then just cut off the ends and you\u2019ll have all the layers you want. Every once in a while, when I get a haircut from someone else, hairdressers will complain, \u201cWho did this haircut?\u201d But the truth is no one ever likes someone else\u2019s cut.\n\nMy color is done by Kacey Welch. I love her because she\u2019s really good and really fast, and she\u2019s cool.\n\nMy hair road bag is always changing. I use Davines Nourishing Shampoo and Replumping Conditioner from its Naturaltech line. Right now, I like KMS Hairplay Playable Texture. It\u2019s weightless. And I always carry a brushable hair spray \u2014 the Sebastian one at the moment. There\u2019s also a dry shampoo by Klorane, and I have Bullfrog Molding Paste.\n\nOther Services\n\nI love to get massages when I can find the time, but I have three kids. We just remodeled our house, though, and the boys and I all got steam in our showers. It\u2019s really great.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDiet and Fitness\n\nI don\u2019t eat processed food. I don\u2019t drink caffeine, and very rarely will have a soda or alcohol. But I eat meat and dark chocolate. I sugar my tea if I feel like it. I have celiac disease, so I don\u2019t eat gluten. Otherwise, I just eat like a person \u2014 whatever I\u2019m hungry for.\n\nI do Pilates \u2014 I have a machine in my house. Or I go to a gym and circuit train depending on what mood I\u2019m in. Or I might put on music and dance my brains out. I\u2019m not the person who will get on a treadmill and stare at a wall.\n\nAlso, for me, it\u2019s more about real inner beauty. It\u2019s important to have a philosophy or way of life or faith that keeps you balanced. For me, that has been Buddhism. It\u2019s something that brings you back to center, and is really the key to serenity and beauty \u2014 an internal sense of form and elegance.", "title": "You Won\u2019t Look Like Sharon Stone at 59", "authors": ["Bee Shapiro", "Skin Deep"]}

Infowars\u2019 Washington bureau chief, Jerome Corsi, said on Twitter that his YouTube channel had been terminated without notice or explanation.\n\nNews outlets including The Outline and Breitbart have pointed to more than a dozen other right-wing or right-leaning accounts that have been disciplined, claiming they have either received strikes or been banned outright in the past several weeks.\n\nThey include the violent neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen (banned for hate speech) and the YouTube star Carl Benjamin, known by his username Sargon of Akkad, who criticizes feminism and identity politics. Mr. Benjamin posted a screenshot on Facebook on Thursday that said he had been locked out of his Google account because \u201cit looked like it was being used in a way that violated Google\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nYouTube said it was not aware of any prominent accounts that had falsely reported strikes, though it did say that Mr. Benjamin had violated its policy on copyright infringement.\n\nYouTube denied that the deletions and other actions were ideologically driven. It said accounts that had been disciplined or banned were only the most prominent, and vocal, of many across the ideological spectrum who had seen their videos taken down for violating the site\u2019s rules.\n\nBut critics said YouTube was reacting haphazardly in an attempt to purge actors who have garnered it negative attention. They questioned whether the site was prepared to substantively address the problem of the conspiracy theories that flourish on its platform.\n\nAnd some of the right-wing YouTube stars and conspiracists who were affected saw the disciplinary action as a result of what they say is left-wing ideology flourishing inside Google, of which YouTube is a subsidiary. Mr. Benjamin told Breitbart that the company was \u201criddled with a far-left ideological orthodoxy that has taken hold to a radical degree.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that its \u201creviewers remove content according to our policies, not according to politics or ideology, and we use quality control measures to ensure they are applying our policies without bias.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

A spokeswoman said that applying the company\u2019s standards to any given video required training, and that new moderators were bound to make some mistakes. It said that some of the strikes that had been handed out since the Parkland shooting had been mistaken, though it did not specify which.\n\nJonathan Albright, the research director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism and an expert on how misinformation thrives on social media, said YouTube has long been inconsistent in its enforcement of its guidelines.\n\n\u201cIf these accounts are getting deleted at the last minute because people are angry and news organizations are digging into this, should these accounts have existed in the first place?\u201d he asked.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNegative news media attention results in more users flagging videos of right-wing conspiracy theorists, leading to a feedback loop in which channels promoting those views are disciplined. The effect is that its disciplinary process is reactive, and relies on users to flag content they find troublesome.\n\nA YouTube spokeswoman said the company planned to release a transparency report in the spring that it says will show the full range of videos that have been taken down.\n\nZack Exley, a left-wing populist who runs the YouTube channel Left Right Forward, said that the bans of high-profile right-wing accounts may do more harm than good by building up the reputations of extremists among their bases.\n\n\u201cThe extreme right loves being censored,\u201d he said. \u201cThey become heroes and raise tons of money every time YouTube removes or demonetizes their videos.\u201d\n\nYouTube does not police misinformation, which, on its own, does not violate the site\u2019s guidelines. But the company says it is confident that, with its steep increase in moderators and progress in machine learning, it will be capable of enforcing its rules effectively, which will help stem the tide of objectionable videos.\n\nMr. Albright said that hiring many more people would help. But he said that those people would have to be trained to address difficult situations, applying the platform\u2019s rules to nuanced videos in which the right decision was not always clear.\n\n\u201cIt would take a group of people specifically trained in this kind of situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of scale.

But for Wikipedia, it was part of a familiar pattern.\n\nA cross between a piece of infrastructure, a public commons and an online community, Wikipedia has been a boon to some of the largest companies in the world since it started nearly two decades ago. Whatever benefit Google hopes to get from using the online encyclopedia to fact-check YouTube videos is likely to pale in comparison with the value it receives from including Wikipedia entries in its search results.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Furthermore, virtually every voice assistant, including Amazon\u2019s Echo and Apple\u2019s Siri, uses the site to give customers a wide range of answers to their questions.\n\nWikipedia has also proved invaluable to tech companies as they develop artificial intelligence and translation services \u2014 as a multilanguage corpus for researchers, it is unparalleled (and, of course, free).\n\n\u201cThe degree to which the Wikipedia data has informed computer science is pretty astonishing,\u201d said Brent Hecht, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who has studied Wikipedia\u2019s relationships with tech companies and online communities. \u201cWikipedia definitely creates massively more value for these companies than they put in.\u201d\n\nWith the YouTube announcement, Wikipedia finds itself in a predicament similar to that of a small town after it has been chosen as the site of a new Walmart: Some municipalities have said that the retail giant creates undue stress on local police forces, straining them to the breaking point with endless calls to deal with petty crimes at the super stores.\n\nWikipedia\u2019s lopsided relationships can also amplify pre-existing internal problems. Its contributors skew white and male, for example, leading to predictable outcomes \u2014 just 17 percent of the subjects of biographies on the site are women. Wikipedia is taking steps to address the issue, but the next generation of consumer tech is being built on top of it \u2014 and its gaps and biases \u2014 in the meantime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHaving come of age in the era of desktop and laptop computers, Wikipedia is also struggling to bring itself into the smartphone era (not to mention whatever comes next).\n\n\u201cIf we have interfaces like Alexa, for example, they\u2019re using infrastructure and content generated by editors, but they\u2019re not really encouraging readers to contribute in any way,\u201d said Dariusz Jemielniak, who published a book-length ethnographic study of Wikipedia and now sits on the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s board. \u201cThey might not even realize it\u2019s coming from Wikipedia,\u201d he added. \u201cIt would be nice if people who take also give a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe main problem with YouTube\u2019s presumptuous announcement, Mr. Jemielniak suggested, is that Wikipedia is not necessarily geared toward breaking news \u2014 and conspiracy theories tend to move at lightning speed during times of crisis.\n\nRecently, for instance, YouTube was rife with conspiracy videos about the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., and it is unclear what even a thorough and well-sourced Wikipedia article could have done to dissuade an audience intent on believing that students at the school were paid \u201ccrisis actors\u201d carrying out orders.\n\nMore to the point, Mr. Jemielniak said, if Google wanted help from Wikipedia, it could have asked.\n\nMs. Maher agreed. At the very least, she said, it would be nice to have \u201ca primary point of contact\u201d at Google and companies like it \u2014 \u201csomeone who is invested in thinking of us an entity rather than just a resource.\u201d\n\nAs it stands, no such person has that role \u2014 though YouTube has reached out to the foundation since the announcement, and the two organizations are regularly in touch in less formal ways. (Google declined to comment for this article. Ms. Maher said of their interaction this week, \u201cIt was good for a start.\u201d)\n\nThen there\u2019s the issue of money. As important as Wikipedia may be to some of the richest companies in the world, it is, in financial terms, comparatively minuscule, with a yearly budget of less than $100 million \u2014 a rounding error for big tech. (It should be noted that Google has made one-off contributions to Wikipedia in the past and includes the Wikimedia Foundation in a program through which it matches employee donations, which netted the foundation around $1 million last year.)\n\nFor now, Wikipedians \u2014 among the most central and least visible participants in this conversation \u2014 seem not overly perturbed.\n\n\u201cLooks like we have more work to do,\u201d wrote one, after the YouTube announcement. \u201cI doubt that much will change anytime soon.\u201d", "title": "YouTube May Add to the Burdens of Humble Wikipedia", "authors": ["John Herrman"]}

But we now have the first inklings of confirmation, thanks in part to a former Google engineer named Guillaume Chaslot.\n\nMr. Chaslot worked on the recommender algorithm while at YouTube. He grew alarmed at the tactics used to increase the time people spent on the site. Google fired him in 2013, citing his job performance. He maintains the real reason was that he pushed too hard for changes in how the company handles such issues.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal conducted an investigation of YouTube content with the help of Mr. Chaslot. It found that YouTube often \u201cfed far-right or far-left videos to users who watched relatively mainstream news sources,\u201d and that such extremist tendencies were evident with a wide variety of material. If you searched for information on the flu vaccine, you were recommended anti-vaccination conspiracy videos.\n\nIt is also possible that YouTube\u2019s recommender algorithm has a bias toward inflammatory content. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Mr. Chaslot created a program to keep track of YouTube\u2019s most recommended videos as well as its patterns of recommendations. He discovered that whether you started with a pro-Clinton or pro-Trump video on YouTube, you were many times more likely to end up with a pro-Trump video recommended.\n\nCombine this finding with other research showing that during the 2016 campaign, fake news, which tends toward the outrageous, included much more pro-Trump than pro-Clinton content, and YouTube\u2019s tendency toward the incendiary seems evident.\n\nYouTube has recently come under fire for recommending videos promoting the conspiracy theory that the outspoken survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., are \u201ccrisis actors\u201d masquerading as victims. Jonathan Albright, a researcher at Columbia, recently \u201cseeded\u201d a YouTube account with a search for \u201ccrisis actor\u201d and found that following the \u201cup next\u201d recommendations led to a network of some 9,000 videos promoting that and related conspiracy theories, including the claim that the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., was a hoax.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is the computational exploitation of a natural human desire: to look \u201cbehind the curtain,\u201d to dig deeper into something that engages us. As we click and click, we are carried along by the exciting sensation of uncovering more secrets and deeper truths. YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.\n\nHuman beings have many natural tendencies that need to be vigilantly monitored in the context of modern life. For example, our craving for fat, salt and sugar, which served us well when food was scarce, can lead us astray in an environment in which fat, salt and sugar are all too plentiful and heavily marketed to us. So too our natural curiosity about the unknown can lead us astray on a website that leads us too much in the direction of lies, hoaxes and misinformation.", "title": "Opinion | YouTube, the Great Radicalizer", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Like Fidge kicking the rabbit, lighting the lamp is Aru\u2019s mortal error, but this time the punishment involves real consequences in our realm: the rise of the Sleeper, who will bring about an end to time unless Aru can stop him.\n\nChokshi seems in her own race against time, given how much she sets to accomplish in this, the first of a planned quartet. \u201cAru Shah\u201d is also the first title of the new imprint Rick Riordan Presents, spearheaded by the author of the hugely popular Percy Jackson series. After Riordan made Greek and Norse mythology accessible to young readers, his new venture broadens its horizons to underrepresented folklore. Starting with Hindu mythology \u2014 filled with ambiguities, abstractions and contradictions \u2014 is as nervy a move as Aru lighting the lamp.\n\nBut just as her heroine learns to wield a bow and arrow, Chokshi has her own weapons: a skill for crackling prose (\u201cA sharp sound cut the air, as if someone had dropped a handful of sewing needles\u201d), and a main character who, despite her lies, is both endearingly funny and self-aware (\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why superheroes wore capes. \u2026 They weren\u2019t actually capes at all, but safety blankets. \u2026 Because honestly? Saving the world was scary\u201d).\n\nMost of all, Chokshi is wise enough to let Aru experience Hinduism, not explain it. A Karma and Sins office leads to a pool of reincarnation; Lord Hanuman pops in like Jiminy Cricket to send Aru on her way; a tourism poster for Lanka (the demon kingdom in \u201cThe Ramayana\u201d) winkingly promises \u201cmoments of gore\u201d; allusions to Indian dance, dress, deities and traditions sit alongside references to Voldemort and Spiderman. Readers learn Sanskrit numbers, and why karma might best be explained by Justin Timberlake. With Aru at the helm, this roller coaster through Hindu culture never feels forced or pedantic, but instead like a new kind of myth \u2014 where a hero takes a hammer to the world to shine a light through its cracks.\n\nImage\n\nIn Diane Magras\u2019s THE MAD WOLF\u2019S DAUGHTER (Kathy Dawson Books, 277 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), 12-year-old Drest, who lives in medieval Scotland, shouldn\u2019t be on her quest either. When her father and brothers are captured by knights, her father\u2019s parting orders are clear: Save yourself and hide. But Drest is a ferocious heroine, and after finding a wounded knight left behind by the enemy, she conjures a plan to travel to Faintree Castle and exchange the knight for her family before they\u2019re hanged.\n\nUnlike Fidge or Aru, Drest comes with little self-doubt. She knows her enemy, she knows good from evil, and she knows what she\u2019s fighting for. In fact, she knows her family so well she imagines her brothers\u2019 and father\u2019s voices in her head (\u201cDrest, lass, you must do something\u201d).\n\nAt first, it makes the novel slightly staid, since Drest is so capable: What could possibly get in her way? Even Drest\u2019s disobedience feels like the prelude to her proving that fathers shouldn\u2019t underestimate their daughters. A tale well trod. But see Magras\u2019s magic trick: Drest\u2019s self-belief isn\u2019t her strength but her weakness. Her father pre-empted this quest for a reason. He knew she was blind to the truth about her family, her enemy and the reason for their capture. Together, Drest and the reader are pulled into trap after trap, until it\u2019s clear we\u2019re in the hands of a master storyteller.\n\n\u201cThe Mad Wolf\u2019s Daughter\u201d feels like an instant classic. Its warning resonates: There will always be those who start the fires and the heroes who put them out.

As a condition, he said his deputy must be appointed, ensuring that his party, SMER, would maintain its control over key government institutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said to President Andrej Kiska as he handed him his letter of resignation.\n\nThe president accepted it and authorized Peter Pellegrini, a longtime ally of Mr. Fico\u2019s, to create a new government.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI want to be an active leader of a political party,\u201d Mr. Fico said later. \u201cThe only aim of this decision is to protect this country from chaos and ensure its stability.\u201d\n\nMikul\u00e1\u0161 Dzurinda, the prime minister of Slovakia from 1998 to 2006 and now the president of the Wilfried Martens Center for European Studies, said that the transparency of Mr. Fico\u2019s move was unlikely to appease the demonstrators.\n\n\u201cThis is just a maneuver,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Pellegrini is not only his very close collaborator, but is perceived as his puppet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why in these days, in these minutes, why frustration among the freedom fighters, among people believing in shared values, this is why frustration prevails,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did not know how long people would continue to take to the streets, but he was optimistic that \u201cthe people will demonstrate that we are not stupid.\u201d\n\nMartina Cimermanova, 25, a freelance photographer living in Bratislava, first decided to join the protests after seeing how politicians responded to the outcry over the killings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey were so arrogant,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the last straw.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, she was incensed after watching \u201cFico basically laughing in our face.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite his resignation, she fears he will still call the shots. But like others calling for change, she is not blind to the dangers new elections could pose.\n\nFor all the democratic fervor of recent days, Slovakia has not been immune to the appeals of extremist politicians. In the last election, a far-right party with links to neo-Nazis won the most votes in its history.\n\n\u201cLook at what happened in Romania,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople took to the streets; they got early elections, and the same old politicians just came back.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One man stood with an 8-month-old baby strapped to his chest. On the baby\u2019s back was a sign: \u201cNine out of 10 babies recommend not to be afraid and not to steal.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOnstage, singers, actors and activists all delivered messages calling for resilience and determination, kindness and decency. \u201cThey need to fear us,\u201d was a common theme.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhereas the crowd a week ago called for the end of the Fico government, it now called for the downfall of his entire political party.\n\nThe protest organizers say they are concerned about Slovakia\u2019s democratic institutions, and for them that means seeing high-level politicians held to account.\n\nJan Budaj, 66, one of the lead organizers of the Velvet Revolution, applauded the demonstrators\u2019 efforts, but said that a lack of political alliances might make it difficult to force a lasting change.\n\nSitting in a cafe overlooking the square, joined by other comrades in arms from the fight against Communism, he said this moment was different but no less important.\n\nThat was a revolution, but this is an evolution, he said. Change at that time came from the top, with leaders like Vaclav Havel. This time, it was coming from the ground up.\n\nHe saw it as not only important for Slovakia, but also for the region \u2014 a rejection of the illiberal drift of this country\u2019s neighbors.\n\nOn Friday, as thousands of people gathered, he watched with pride.\n\n\u201cSlovakia is seeing the real birth of a political nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you are seeing on the street is a nation coming closer to the West, not pulling away.\u201d\n\nThe illusions he once may have had about Western democracy \u2014 an idealized version when viewed from behind the Iron Curtain \u2014 may have been lost long ago.\n\nBut these are the moments that truly define a nation.\n\n\u201cDemocracy does not mean you will never have corrupt politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is what you do when you discover the mayor is stealing the people\u2019s cash.\u201d", "title": "Young Slovaks Buck a Trend, Protesting to Save Their Democracy", "authors": ["Marc Santora"]}

Though the killings remain unsolved, the police said they were most likely related to Mr. Kuciak\u2019s investigation of ties between top Slovakia politicians and Italy\u2019s \u2019Ndrangheta organized crime group.\n\nThe demonstrations rapidly swelled into mass protests against the corruption and arrogance of the government, which many younger Slovaks see as betraying the struggles their parents waged against Soviet-imposed Communist rule.

Paper, $16.95.\n\nBeing young in New York \u2014 the romance of discovering oneself in a city whose capacity for mythologizing has been thoroughly mythologized \u2014 is an old story. But it\u2019s still a renewable one, as Hermione Hoby proves with her smart, stylish debut novel, \u201cNeon in Daylight.\u201d\n\nHoby finds a way into the formula \u2014 and changes it up \u2014 with Kate, a 25-year-old Englishwoman, whose orientation is not so much one of energetic striving but engaged drift. She\u2019s come to New York in the summer of 2012, cat-sitting in a third-floor walk-up for a family friend who\u2019s off on a post-divorce \u201cThailand et cetera\u201d trip. She has few responsibilities and only a loosening commitment to what she left in London: a law-student boyfriend, the pursuit of her Ph.D., and some idea of herself that no longer holds. She might like to be a person who is \u201cup for it\u201d and \u201cdown for it,\u201d instead of one who is \u201ctroubled, for instance, over how those two semantically opposed phrases could have come to mean, in essence, the exact same thing.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times\n\nAs cerebral as she is, Kate is alive to influence and sensation, and her experience of the city is not logical but dreamlike and immersive, which Hoby depicts in image-filled language that\u2019s arresting without being overwrought. There\u2019s a kinetic New York magic that Hoby taps into \u2014 whatever that mysterious force is that allows the Brooklyn rooftops, Manhattan galleries, downtown art parties and other privileged spaces of this novel somehow to be the clich\u00e9s they are and yet resist banality. It\u2019s the same magic that makes it plausible for Kate to meet \u2014 separately, randomly \u2014 Bill and Inez, born and bred New Yorkers who also happen to be father and daughter. Kate is taken with their charisma, becomes involved with each of them in different ways, and a triangle, of which none of them are initially aware, forms.\n\nBill, a well-known, dissipated writer of exactly one novel, published in his 20s and made into a hit movie, is a man who once \u201cfelt himself to be an ongoing roar.\u201d He hasn\u2019t quite accepted that he no longer is, but he\u2019s not a little proud to see his 19-year-old daughter take up that mantle. Inez, stunning and still in full possession of an adolescent bravado, works in a coffee shop, deals Adderall and answers Craigslist ads for what\u2019s euphemistically called \u201cmiscellaneous romance.\u201d They could be stock characters, but Hoby breathes life and nuance into them, in part by making them self-aware enough to know they are, to an extent, types, involved in some subtle, ongoing performance where they risk becoming parodies.", "title": "Young and Adrift in New York City", "authors": []}

Last year, a study in Germany found that kitchen sponges were a hotbed for germs. More than 350 different species of bacteria were found in 14 dirty kitchen sponges taken from private households.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the same density of bacteria you can find in human stool samples,\u201d Markus Egert, a microbiologist at Furtwangen University in Germany, said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cThere are probably no other places on earth with such high bacterial densities.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that cleaning the sponges could make the bacteria worse because the strongest pathogenic bacteria tended to survive and fester, even if it microwaved.\n\nAnother item that harbors a lot of bacteria is one that we tend to keep the closest: the cellphone. While research has varied on the number of germs found on the average cellphone, Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona, found in 2012 that the average cellphone carried 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats.\n\nProfessor Gerba said, however, that there were far dirtier places in a home than the toilet seat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the cleanest things you\u2019ll run across in terms of micro-organisms,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cUsually, there are about 200 times more faecal bacteria on the average cutting board than on a toilet seat.\u201d\n\nRecently, a microbiology student\u2019s photo on Facebook of the colonies of fungi and bacteria that grew in a petri dish she had opened inside a Dyson hand dryer drew alarm when the image spread online.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "The idea has been around for a bit. Jaron Lanier, the tech philosopher and virtual-reality pioneer who now works for Microsoft Research, proposed it in his 2013 book, \u201cWho Owns the Future?,\u201d as a needed corrective to an online economy mostly financed by advertisers\u2019 covert manipulation of users\u2019 consumer choices.\n\nIt is being picked up in \u201cRadical Markets,\u201d a book due out shortly from Eric A. Posner of the University of Chicago Law School and E. Glen Weyl, principal researcher at Microsoft. And it is playing into European efforts to collect tax revenue from American internet giants.\n\nIn a report obtained last month by Politico, the European Commission proposes to impose a tax on the revenue of digital companies based on their users\u2019 location, on the grounds that \u201ca significant part of the value of a business is created where the users are based and data is collected and processed.\u201d\n\nUsers\u2019 data is a valuable commodity. Facebook offers advertisers precisely targeted audiences based on user profiles. YouTube, too, uses users\u2019 preferences to tailor its feed. Still, this pales in comparison with how valuable data is about to become, as the footprint of artificial intelligence extends across the economy.\n\nData is the crucial ingredient of the A.I. revolution. Training systems to perform even relatively straightforward tasks like voice translation, voice transcription or image recognition requires vast amounts of data \u2014 like tagged photos, to identify their content, or recordings with transcriptions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAmong leading A.I. teams, many can likely replicate others\u2019 software in, at most, one to two years,\u201d notes the technologist Andrew Ng. \u201cBut it is exceedingly difficult to get access to someone else\u2019s data. Thus data, rather than software, is the defensible barrier for many businesses.\u201d\n\nWe may think we get a fair deal, offering our data as the price of sharing puppy pictures. By other metrics, we are being victimized: In the largest technology companies, the share of income going to labor is only about 5 to 15 percent, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl write. That\u2019s way below Walmart\u2019s 80 percent. Consumer data amounts to work they get free.\n\n\u201cIf these A.I.-driven companies represent the future of broader parts of the economy,\u201d they argue, \u201cwithout something basic changing in their business model, we may be headed for a world where labor\u2019s share falls dramatically from its current roughly 70 percent to something closer to 20 to 30 percent.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAs Mr. Lanier, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl point out, it is ironic that humans are providing free data to train the artificial-intelligence systems to replace workers across the economy. Commentators from both left and right fret over how ordinary people will put food on the table once robots take all the jobs. Perhaps a universal basic income, funded by taxes, is the answer?\n\nHow about paying people for the data they produced to train the robots? If A.I. accounted for 10 percent of the economy and the big-data companies paid two-thirds of their income for data \u2014 the same as labor\u2019s share of income across the economy \u2014 the share of income going to \u201cworkers\u201d would rise drastically. By Mr. Weyl and Mr. Posner\u2019s reckoning, the median household of four would gain $20,000 a year.\n\nA critical consideration is that if people were paid for their data, its quality and value would increase. Facebook could directly ask users to tag the puppy pictures to train the machines. It could ask translators to upload their translations. Facebook and Google could demand quality information if the value of the transaction were more transparent. Unwilling to enter in a direct quid pro quo with their users, the data titans must make do with whatever their users submit.\n\nThe transition would not be painless. We would need to figure out systems to put value on data. Your puppy pictures might turn out to be worthless, but that college translation from Serbo-Croatian could be valuable. Barred from free data, YouTube and Facebook might charge a user fee for their service \u2014 like Netflix. Alternatively, they might make their money from training A.I. systems and pay some royalty stream to the many people whose data helped train them.\n\nBut whatever the cost, the transformation seems worthwhile. Notably, it could help resolve one of the most relevant questions coming into focus in this new technological age: Who will control the data?\n\nToday, the dominant data harvesters in the business are Google and Facebook, with Amazon, Apple and Microsoft some way behind. Their dominance cannot really be challenged: Could you think of a rival search engine? Could another social network replace the one all your friends are on? This dominance might matter less if companies had to pay for their users\u2019 data.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle and Facebook and Amazon would not be able to extend the network effects that cemented their place at the top of the technology ecosystem to the world of A.I. Everybody wants to be on Facebook because everybody\u2019s friends are on Facebook. But this dominance could be eroded if rivals made direct offers of money for data.\n\nCompanies with different business models might join the fray. \u201cThis is an opportunity for other companies to enter and say look, we will pay you for this data,\u201d Mr. Posner said. \u201cAll this is so new that ordinary people haven\u2019t figured out how manipulated they are by these companies.\u201d\n\nThe big question, of course, is how we get there from here. My guess is that it would be na\u00efve to expect Google and Facebook to start paying for user data of their own accord, even if that improved the quality of the information. Could policymakers step in, somewhat the way the European Commission did, demanding that technology companies compute the value of consumer data?\n\nIn any event, there is probably a better deal out there, in your future, than giving Facebook free puppy pictures.", "title": "Your Data Is Crucial to a Robotic Age.

But experts are split over the question of whether internet addiction is a legitimate stand-alone disorder.\n\nA Common Sense spokeswoman, Corbie Kiernan, told me, \u201cWe use the term \u2018addiction\u2019 colloquially, not diagnostically,\u201d in response to parents\u2019 concerns. Of course, only a rank apologist would deny that there is cause for concern about the role mobile devices are playing in children\u2019s and young people\u2019s lives. Media habits are shifting fast: The amount of time children 8 years old and younger spend on phones or tablets has increased tenfold in just five years, according to a 2017 study by Common Sense. The organization also found that 42 percent of children under 8 already have their own mobile device. That number was less than 1 percent in 2011.\n\nWhile those of us who grew up before smartphones can agree that these changes are jarring, the extent of the harm done to kids by more screens than we could ever have imagined is not at all clear. The real \u201ctruth about tech\u201d is that there just isn\u2019t enough research on this yet. For example, when I asked Victor C. Strasburger of the American Academy of Pediatrics how the organization arrived at its \u201cno screens before age 2\u201d recommendation, he said that later studies supported the guidance but admitted that at the time it was put into effect, \u201cthere was no evidence. None. We made it up.\u201d (The group has since changed its stance, maintaining that it\u2019s best to keep the youngest children away from screens, but making an exception for live video chat.)\n\nAn open letter in January from Apple shareholders calling for parental controls and more research into the effects of heavy use of mobile devices on youth was also based on fairly flimsy evidence. For example, the letter cited the work of a psychologist who analyzed large surveys to find that heavy electronic device use among teenagers is correlated with reports of loneliness, depression, anxiety and the increased presence of suicide risk factors. But this connection does not prove which way the causal arrow points. Perhaps teenagers who are under emotional duress gravitate toward their phones. Maybe they have parents with troubles of their own who are less capable of supervising them.\n\nThe science here is nothing like the kind that fueled the Truth campaign against cigarettes. For that reason alone, those working to make tech safer for kids can\u2019t emulate that campaign.", "title": "Opinion | Your Kid\u2019s Phone Is Not Like a Cigarette", "authors": []}

But the most exciting offerings come later in the season: Ms. Mearns in \u201cDances of Isadora,\u201d a suite of solos by the modern dance pioneer Isadora Duncan (staged by Lori Belilove), and the Trisha Brown Dance Company in Ms. Brown\u2019s propulsive 1983 masterpiece, \u201cSet and Reset.\u201d SIOBHAN BURKE\n\nPhoto\n\nClassical: Kennedy Center Festival\n\nMarch 5 to 19; www.kennedy-center.org.\n\nUnder the direction of Deborah Rutter, the traditionalist Kennedy Center in Washington has inched into the 21st century: In recent seasons, it has engaged compelling artists like Q-Tip and Jason Moran to oversee programming across genres. The latest initiative is the new festival Direct Current, a celebration of contemporary culture that ranges from the performance artist Taylor Mac (March 6) to the hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces (March 17).\n\nThe festival\u2019s most promising contemporary classical offerings include music by John Cage and Viet Cuong, played by the ensemble So Percussion (March 9); a survey of Philip Glass\u2019s complete \u00e9tudes by a team of pianists including Mr. Moran and Mr. Glass (March 9); Julia Wolfe\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cAnthracite Fields\u201d (March 13); and the environmentalist documentary \u201cThe Colorado,\u201d featuring live music from Roomful of Teeth (March 18). The biggest ticket, though, may be the National Symphony Orchestra performing John Adams\u2019s potent oratorio \u201cThe Gospel According to the Other Mary\u201d under Gianandrea Noseda, himself in the midst of a promising first season as the orchestra\u2019s music director (March 8 and 10).

A long track record of boldface names and significant plays is what makes it worth the trip. Lucas Hnath, a Tony Award nominee last spring for \u201cA Doll\u2019s House, Part 2,\u201d brought \u201cThe Christians\u201d there for its world premiere a few seasons back. Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (\u201cAn Octoroon\u201d) was there with \u201cAppropriate\u201d in 2013, a year before that play appeared Off Broadway. This year\u2019s festival, the 42nd, will be the last as artistic director for Les Waters, who is leaving Actors Theater this summer.\n\nHis directorial swan song will be Mark Schultz\u2019s \u201cEvocation to Visible Appearance,\u201d part of a program of six world premieres, including Leah Nanako Winkler\u2019s \u201cGod Said This\u201d; Deborah Stein\u2019s \u201cMarginal Loss\u201d; Mara Nelson-Greenberg\u2018s \u201cDo You Feel Anger?\u201d; Susan Soon He Stanton\u2019s \u201cwe, the invisibles\u201d; and \u201cYou Across From Me,\u201d a play with four authors (Jaclyn Backhaus, Dipika Guha, Brian Otan\u0303o and Jason Gray Platt) which, fittingly enough, explores coming to the table together.

But I had no idea how common this problem was.\n\nThrough my interviews, I heard stories of patients who had been transferred to nursing facilities without their advance directives and returned to the hospital intubated when that was explicitly not what they wanted. Others told me about patients of theirs who\u2019d grown ill on vacation only to end up in a hospital they\u2019d never been to, with an entirely different electronic medical record, where no one was able to access any prior documentation. Others described situations in which last minute \u201csaves\u201d through extreme diligence or chance, such as the one I experienced, had led to a good outcome.\n\nThere are few existing regulations here, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service are relatively silent on advance care planning. In contrast to the rules around allergies, which mandate that all patients have an active med allergy list, electronic records simply need to have the capacity to show whether or not a patient has an advance directive, somewhere. They don\u2019t even need to make the directive retrievable.\n\nIn the absence of nationwide standards, there\u2019s significant variability among hospitals and among electronic records. Some have worked to make end-of-life documentation more easily accessible. At my hospital, for example, clicking on an \u201cAdvance Care Planning\u201d tab will bring you to a record of all advance care planning notes, health care proxy forms, scanned directives and code status orders. This is a start, but it wasn\u2019t enough for that elderly man in the emergency room. Habits are hard to break, and without a clear set of incentives, training and ongoing education, doctors (myself included) continue to record information about end-of-life conversations in progress notes, where they are not readily available, particularly when they are urgently needed.\n\nRecently, a handful of start-ups have stepped in, trying to offer a solution to the fact that different electronic records can\u2019t communicate with each other. There\u2019s software and clever patient apps that work outside the electronic record, promising to build a repository of directives, proxy forms, even conversations. Just imagine, your E.D. doctor is fumbling to find your information in your chart, but you have an advance directive that was safely uploaded onto your smartphone. This most likely could have helped my patient that day \u2014 if he had a smartphone and was able to show it to his doctors, or if his hospital had committed to buying the necessary software.\n\nWhat could really make a meaningful difference, I heard time and time again, is standards for sharing, or \u201cinteroperability\u201d across all electronic records that would benefit every patient, everywhere. At least, all related advance care planning documentation should be in one place in the medical record and accessible with one simple click of the mouse. Beyond that, maybe all health systems could require identification of a health care proxy for all patients, so we would know who should make decisions if the patient can\u2019t. Maybe patients should be able to access their health records through a patient-facing interface, send in their own directives, or even update related notes. Ideally, the electronic record isn\u2019t just a clunky online version of a paper chart but actually a tool to help us do our jobs better.\n\nYet as it is, we\u2019re playing catch-up. Which is how my patient ended up in the hospital that night, with a team of well-meaning doctors readying to do something to him that he never would have wanted, and a resident racing down to the emergency room because he\u2019d happened upon a note.", "title": "You\u2019ve Detailed Your Last Wishes, but Doctors May Not See Them", "authors": []}

In 2009, Aramco held a competition to design a campus in Riyadh \u2014 a state-of-the-industry architectural icon that would embody the research center\u2019s mission and double as a showcase where conferences by OPEC and others could be held while BBC cameras rolled.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe winner was the Iraq-born Zaha Hadid, the sole female architect invited into the competition and an outspoken progressive defining an image for a country that the king was cautiously changing. Her design for the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, unveiled to the public in the fall, was geometrically ingenious, inspired by soap bubbles and honeycombs found in nature.\n\nBut its public opening during the country\u2019s annual Saudi Design Week in October proved to be posthumous for King Abdullah as well as for Hadid.

It begins: \u201cI want a dyke for president,\u201d and continues:\n\nI want someone with no\n\nhealth insurance and I want someone who grew\n\nup in a place where the earth is so saturated\n\nwith toxic waste that they didn\u2019t have a\n\nchoice about getting leukemia.

Basically, \u201cI Want a President\u201d was a form of participatory public art, completed by being passed from hand-to-hand. Then in 2016 it went big time. In the run-up to the election it was posted billboard-size on the High Line, not far from the Whitney, and became a social media hit.\n\nMs. Leonard\u2019s art often has a collaborative dimension. In a 1993 project with the filmmaker Cheryl Dunye, the sharing was direct. Ms. Dunye was working on a film called \u201cWatermelon Woman,\u201d partly about the life of a black lesbian Hollywood actress named Fae Richards, whose career had been thwarted by racism. Ms. Leonard created what amounted to an elaborate archival storyboard for the film, photo-documenting the actress\u2019s life.\n\nIn fact, Fae Richards is an invented character. And, although her \u201clife\u201d is more than plausible, Ms. Leonard\u2019s documentation of it, on display at the Whitney, is entirely staged. As a pictorial narrative \u2014 a film made from stills \u2014 the piece is a tour de force. It reveals this artist to be not only a gifted storyteller, but a virtuoso of photographic technology.\n\nSome of that technology became obsolete even as Ms. Leonard was using it. And the idea of obsolescence \u2014 of the present slipping irretrievably into the past \u2014 haunts her recent work. A series of pictures called \u201cThe Analogue Portfolio,\u201d dated 1998-2009 \u2014 and made with a now-discontinued dye-transfer process \u2014 records the facades of small storefront shops on the Lower East Side, and in countries she\u2019s visited: Cuba, Mexico, Uganda. Many of the New York shops she shot a decade and more ago are now gone, wiped out by high rents and globalization. Chances are their equivalents elsewhere are too.\n\nIf Ms. Leonard has strong ideas or feelings about this, they aren\u2019t spelled out in individual pictures. Her art isn\u2019t expressive that way: the opposite, really. It sometimes suggests the point-and-shoot blankness of tourist photography.

In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.\n\nThat contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.\n\nKevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:\n\nWhen a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company\u2019s chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation. When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, released a statement that said \u201cwe fell short.\u201d And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. \u201cI messed up,\u201d he said. \u201cI owe everyone an explanation.\u201d\n\nSo why did it take so long for Mr. Zuckerberg to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s former speechwriter, told the NYT: \u201cMy guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: There was something missing from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s response \u2013 a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data. As Mr. Zuckerberg noted, Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn\u2019t disclosed at the time. Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network. An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing. Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr. Zuckerberg to do just that.\n\nPhoto\n\nTakeaways from Powell\u2019s first Fed meeting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point.

For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.\n\nIf Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.\n\nA study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch.\n\nBut for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:\n\n\u201cUber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that \u2018winning\u2019 is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.\u201d\n\nCalculating the fallout from the Uber self-driving car death.\n\nThe pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s first major test as Uber\u2019s C.E.O., leaving him with a difficult choice: keep spending on a technology that Uber considers essential to its future, or dial back to reduce risks ahead of an I.P.O.?\n\nInvestigators are also looking into whether the victim\u2019s actions \u2014 suddenly stepping onto a darkened street \u2014 could limit Uber\u2019s liability.\n\nToyota has paused its self-driving tests; Ford and G.M. have yet to do so.

This year, the best graduates are not necessarily looking at Facebook.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Zuckerberg did not appear at the Tuesday staff meeting hosted by the company lawyer, Mr. Grewal, his absence made headlines.\n\nWhen he spoke to workers on Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg focused on concrete measures that Facebook was taking following the Cambridge Analytica reports, two employees said. Staff members asked questions about how Mr. Zuckerberg planned to regain user trust, especially in light of the #DeleteFacebook campaign from users, the two employees said.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg said the social network was investigating apps like the third-party quiz app that had obtained access to \u201clarge amounts of information\u201d from the social network, which had then been used by Cambridge Analytica.

This has to be recognized as part of their business model and not just a one-off problem.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a timeline of Facebook\u2019s dealings with Cambridge Analytica. He traced the information-sharing issue to 2007, when Facebook decided to become an open platform \u2014 enabling people to use Facebook to log into other apps and share detailed personal information about themselves and their friends.\n\nIn 2013, Mr. Kogan, the Cambridge researcher, created a personality quiz app that about 300,000 people installed, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Because Facebook was an open platform, Mr. Kogan was able to collect data on tens of millions of friends of those users who had installed the personality quiz app.\n\nA year later, Mr. Zuckerberg said, Facebook changed its policy to limit how much data third-party apps could access. \u201cThese actions would prevent any app like Kogan\u2019s from being able to access so much data today,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBy 2015, Mr. Kogan had shared his data and findings with Cambridge Analytica, which later used the material to single out American voters. Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had banned Mr. Kogan\u2019s app and demanded that the researcher and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that the data had been deleted. He did not address in his post why Facebook had not already disclosed those activities to its users whose data had been harvested by Mr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s an issue where someone\u2019s data gets passed to someone who the rules of the system shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to, that\u2019s rightfully a big issue and deserves to be a big uproar,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in the interview.", "title": "Zuckerberg, Facing Facebook\u2019s Worst Crisis Yet, Pledges Better Privacy", "authors": []}

We are doing his work for him.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it is in dealing with Mr. Putin that the new team is likely to run headlong into Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to ever say a critical word about the Russian president. As C.I.A. chief, Mr. Pompeo has embraced the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, though he changes the subject quickly when asked about it.\n\nMr. Bolton, by contrast, has ranked among Mr. Putin\u2019s harshest critics. Last July, days after Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin for the first time at a summit meeting in Germany, Mr. Bolton wrote that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was \u201ca casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump did not view it that way.\n\nHe emerged from the meeting in Germany repeating Mr. Putin\u2019s observation that the Russians were too skilled at cyberoperations to be caught if involved. Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on winning a Russian election widely viewed as a sham, making no mention of the recent nerve-agent attack that Britain concluded, with American agreement, was a covert action by Moscow.\n\nIf it was, it was being planned out as Mr. Pompeo was acting as the host to the directors of the three major Russian intelligence services in Washington earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe unknown factor in the new mix is Gina Haspel, the career intelligence officer who has been nominated to be the first woman to run the C.I.A. Since she has spent much of her career undercover \u2014 details of which the agency is just beginning to release, in an effort to lobby for her confirmation \u2014 her foreign policy views are largely unknown.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut her record in the terrorist detentions and interrogations following 9/11 is well documented. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was tortured as a prisoner of war, this past week pointedly asked in a letter to Ms. Haspel, \u201cDo you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?\u201d\n\nAt a moment when Mr. Trump has sided with the economic nationalists in his administration and ordered the imposition of tariffs on China to counter its restrictions on American companies and the forced transfer of American intellectual property, Mr. Bolton has gone one further.\n\nHe has questioned whether the United States should abandon the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that has been the underpinning of relations since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Bolton wrote that confronting China \u201cmay involve modifying or even jettisoning the ambiguous \u2018One China\u2019 mantra, along with even more far-reaching initiatives to counter Beijing\u2019s rapidly accelerating political and military aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how that squares with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign argument that the United States should pull its forces back from Asia unless South Korea and Japan pay more of the cost of keeping them there.\n\nBut the most immediate decision facing the new team will be the benefits and costs of exiting the Iran deal. Mr. Trump cited his differences with Rex W. Tillerson on Iran in firing the secretary of state.\n\nMr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been among the harshest critics of the nuclear accord, but they have not said how they would manage the international backlash if Mr. Trump decides, by a May 12 legislative deadline, to resume the sanctions that the United States suspended when the deal was reached.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf Washington breaches the deal, Iran may declare it is now free to resume producing nuclear fuel in unlimited quantities \u2014 limits it agreed to, for 15 years, in return for economic normalization. If so, that could put the United States and Israel back where they were in the years before the accord was reached: threatening military action to destroy Iran\u2019s facilities, even at the risk of another Middle East war. That was the path Mr. Bolton advocated.\n\nIn August, when Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis wrote a joint op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal describing the merits of building economic pressure on North Korea in a policy of \u201cstrategic accountability,\u201d Mr. Bolton said he was \u201cappalled.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime is not a neutral factor here,\u201d he said on Fox News, where he was a contributor. \u201cMore negotiation with North Korea? I think they\u2019d say \u2018bring it on.\u2019 More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.\u201d He will now be preparing Mr. Trump for that negotiation.", "title": "\u2018America First\u2019 Bears a New Threat: Military Force", "authors": ["David E.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Last season, Alfred (a.k.a. \u201cPaper Boi\u201d) stumbled toward rap relevancy while cousin Earn shrugged his way into a music manager role. They both fell haphazardly into modest fame \u2014 by way of notoriety \u2014 and it seemed possible that they\u2019d return to show off a little bit this time around. Instead, we find them stuck on the same sofas, cruising the same struggling streets and hamstrung by the same old obstacles (rap sheets and general inertia).\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s changed is Earn\u2019s kick-the-can approach to lodging has resulted in yet another bout of homelessness. He\u2019s been booted from his storage unit squat and can\u2019t even find refuge at his cousin\u2019s condo. As for Al and Darius, the roommates have bad blood brewing and no one will speak on it.\n\nDarius is the show\u2019s lone reliable source of levity, so when things aren\u2019t buzzing harmoniously on his weirdo astral plane, morale is low overall. He keeps the episode\u2019s eerie tone going when he pivoted from discussing the everyday horrors of area crime sprees to sharing the urban legend of \u201cFlorida Man.\u201d Earn laughs off Darius\u2019s accounts of the white boogeyman, a goof on the meme inspired by the state\u2019s penchant for insane headlines. But the director Hiro Murai gives the tale a dark folkloric edge that raises goose bumps.\n\nAll this bad mojo was leading up to the big showdown between Earn and his uncle Willy. Al, who\u2019s stuck at home on house arrest, tasked Earn with peacekeeping duties when he got word that Willy was holding a woman against her will. Played by comedian Katt Williams (who\u2019s no stranger to legal drama), Willy\u2019s the bitter, combative relative most of us have and would just as soon avoid. He\u2019s a robe-sporting, chain smoking, venom-spewing cautionary tale for Earn. Willy\u2019s outworn his use to those around him, but he\u2019s still living off Al\u2019s handouts, in a house that Al\u2019s paying for.\n\nDarius was right when he pulled up to the house and sensed that the vibes there were \u201cjust so intense.\u201d A dispute over $50 led to a low-key hostage situation. Oh, and while Willy\u2019s girlfriend is locked up in one room, there\u2019s a live alligator inexplicably locked in another. (Neighborhood kids call Willy \u201cAlligator Man,\u201d dropping the episode title.)\n\nWith the police waiting at the door and tensions running high, Earn and Willy get into a heated discussion.\n\n\u201cYou scared,\u201d Willy reasons. \u201cYou gotta stay on [Al\u2019s] good side now, \u2019cause he\u2019s Mr. Money Bags. I remember Uncle Jarvis used to manage Damon when he was in that group. Now, they don\u2019t even talk no more, \u2019cause you find out family is business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNo, Earn spits back, what he\u2019s actually scared of is turning into Willy, a guy who wasted his shot and is now just a know-it-all screw-up who just lets life happen to him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSo far, most signs point to this being Earn\u2019s destiny. He\u2019s been floating through life, wincing and sighing as his housing prospects dwindle, his criminal record racks up points and his past Ivy League laurels fade into irrelevance. He seems to feel he\u2019s above it all, even as he\u2019s drowning in it.\n\nWilly\u2019s final word of advice was simple and on point: \u201cIf you don\u2019t wanna end up like me, get rid of that chip-on-your-shoulder \u2026 It\u2019s not worth the time.\u201d\n\nWith nothing left to say, Earn agrees to hide his uncle\u2019s contraband golden gun from the cops and figured his de-escalating work there was done. But instead of Willy\u2019s expected surrender to the cops, we get that signature left-field element we\u2019d been waiting for in the form of the aforementioned reptile.\n\nTo paraphrase legendary local lyricist Big Boi, \u201cwhile the gator\u2019s creeping, crawling, oh so wicked\u201d out the front door, the cops are too distracted to notice Willy making a hasty backdoor escape in his robe and houseshoes. Though he\u2019s clearly doomed, it\u2019s hard not to wish him well. Because if there\u2019s hope for him, there may be hope for Earn, too.\n\nThe writers returned from their protracted break offering up more questions than answers. It\u2019s not clear how much time has transpired since we last left the core trio. No one knows why Darius and Al have beef at the top of the episode. Who are Uncle Jarvis and Damon, and what did Willy do to Earn\u2019s mom that\u2019s left him carrying a grudge? Will the teens in the opening robbery be relevant down the road?\n\nBut while you may leave the episode feeling fuzzy about back stories and unsure of whether certain characters will pop up again, you do at least have a clearer understanding of just why Earn\u2019s wary parents don\u2019t let him cross their threshold. It\u2019s because they\u2019ve already seen the blueprint for what he\u2019s becoming. You also see that Darius and Al share that kind of tight-knit bond that allows friends to be unspeakably angry one day, then seamlessly in sync the next. These new layers offer clues as to how these three will progress (or regress, as the case may be) going forward.\n\nA Few More Vibes\n\n\u2022 Darius is back in his chicken-printed apron again. But this time, his sour mood has affected his cooking: He\u2019s left plating unappetizing sliders. \u201dBe careful. It\u2019s very, very cold.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Earn, in an attempt to help Alfred and Darius squash their mysterious beef, sincerely tells them he loves them both. He\u2019s then roasted mercilessly because, apparently in their world, there\u2019s no funnier punch line than a man showing vulnerability and expressing his feelings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Earn to Darius: \u201cWhat flavor is a Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheeto?\u201d Darius shrugs: \u201cHot.\u201d Earn samples another: \u201cI am tasting \u2018hot.\u2019\u201d Though hilarious in its inanity, this little exchange is juxtaposed with the sights and sounds of a crime scene just across the street.\n\n\u2022 Uncle Willy, despite being accused of kidnapping a woman, insists that Earn and Darius take off their shoes before entering his house.\n\n\u2022 \u201cLooks like an Azealia Banks Snapchat,\u201d Darius says, upon looking in on Willy\u2019s alligator to find it surrounded by chicken carcasses. (It\u2019s a rather obscure reference to the rapper-singer\u2019s 2016 video confession about her witchcraft ways.)\n\n\u2022 The lyrics to Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u201cWhen Seasons Change\u201d \u2014 which played the episode into the closing credits \u2014 read like an outline of everything we just watched (\u201cTime makes you suffer when seasons change/Can\u2019t call no names when you got your own self to blame\u201d).", "title": "\u2018Atlanta\u2019 Season 2 Premiere: It\u2019s Robbin\u2019 Season", "authors": ["Leigh-Ann Jackson"]}

There\u2019s the visual of a young rapper energetically performing on top of a boardroom table as executives stoically appraise him. There\u2019s the audio guy prompting Al to be \u201cmore cool\u201d and to act \u201clike you\u2019re at a party\u201d (code for \u201csound more black\u201d) as he\u2019s recording promo spots. Then there\u2019s the scene in which Earn\u2019s just mills about the office, munching Cheerios, until he realizes every other person is wordlessly watching him. Once they know he\u2019s onto them, they quickly spark back into motion.\n\nThis speaks to a feeling known all too well by those who\u2019ve experienced \u201cthe only one in the room\u201d syndrome. For those who haven\u2019t: Being the lone minority in, say, a work environment or classroom can create an unsettling sense that people are silently observing your every move, no matter how mundane. Here the episode writer Stephen Glover brings that nagging notion to life.\n\nThe visit ends when Al storms out of an excruciating Tiny Desk Concert-style performance, after most employees can\u2019t be bothered to leave their cubicles to watch him rap \u201cPaper Boi.\u201d It\u2019s his second loss in less than 24 hours, and there are more to come.\n\nBack on the illegal grind, Al tries his luck with a second plug only to have the star-struck dealer post a stealthy, potentially incriminating photo of him onto Instagram. The third is a seemingly cool hippie bro who soothes Al\u2019s nerves with a potent smoke-out session and promises of discounted pricing. Alas, everything goes left when he loops Al into a group text with his \u201cgangster\u201d girlfriend, who turns out to be one of the millions of vanilla twentysomethings hunched over a guitar, trying to go viral with an acoustic rap cover. One video clip of her chirping his eponymous single is all it takes for Al to defenestrate his cellphone and burn that bridge, too.\n\nAfter his terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad trapping day, Al retreats to his living room comfort zone. Nearly everyone he had encountered were fans \u2014 from music biz types to dealers to fellow musicians \u2014 but each compliment seemed to grate his nerves raw. Networking isn\u2019t really his jam and he\u2019s not one for schmoozing, social climbing or, interpersonal communications with anyone outside his inner-circle. So why, exactly, is such an introvert courting fame? (And is Paper Boi reflecting all or just a fraction of Donald Glover\u2019s own reported mercurial moods and ambivalence about celebrity?)\n\nIf Al\u2019s considering changing careers, now might be the time, because his manager is a liability. That dog-breeding scheme Darius concocted in Season 1 proved to be surprisingly lucrative, making Earn $4,000 richer. It\u2019s a windfall that would certainly make his daughter\u2019s mom, Van, happy and might offer a solution to his persistent lodging problem.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Off they traipse to the mall, where Earn\u2019s real-world responsibilities are doomed to take a back seat.\n\nThe plan has failure written all over it, of course. (It may have been viable had a visionary like Darius pitched it.) How hard did you facepalm when Earn slumped back into the apartment bearing empty pockets and only a fraction of his mall haul?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe quickly descends into the doldrums with Al, smoking weed and watching TV. But their respite is interrupted by an incredibly catchy Yoo-Hoo ad starring Clark County, the rapper who, by contrast, made all the right impressions during his overlapping visit to the Fresh offices. On the TV screen, he\u2019s filled with the kind of animated swagger that disgusted Al and left Earn awe-struck. Here again, was the kind of career-spiking opportunity that Paper Boi would\u2019ve turned down flat. He never would\u2019ve received such an offer though, because his manager isn\u2019t even savvy enough to level up from burning demos onto blank CDs.\n\nWhile those two remained in their respective ruts, Tracy made plans to move up in the world. He had a job interview and was filled with gumption, despite his ex-convict status. First things first: He had to make sure his hair was perfect.\n\nTracy\u2019s wave cap expertise is where the episode gets its name, \u201cSportin\u2019 Waves.\u201d Watching these guys sit around sharing laughs and potshots about a hair care phenomenon that\u2019s pretty unique to black men \u2014 without expounding on its nuances for the benefit of a wider audience \u2014 felt like witnessing a secret handshake.\n\nAssured that his grooming was on point, all Tracy needs is the right pair of shoes to make his interview look complete. At the mall, he doesn\u2019t even bother using his own gift card scam (which should\u2019ve been a warning to Earn), preferring to employ a brazen five-finger discount. (\u201cThey got a no-chase policy; they can\u2019t stop me.\u201d) Armed with Earn\u2019s crib notes on how to talk to \u201cwhite folks\u201d \u2014 basically, \u201cdon\u2019t call them \u2018white folks\u2019\u201d \u2014 he was ready to put his best foot, and coif, forward.\n\nThe comically exaggerated finished product was equal parts Moe Howard and early-career Brian McKnight, glistening like a unicorn mane as Tracy expertly code-switches his way through the interview. (Earn would\u2019ve been proud.) Ultimately, though, being the \u201cKing of Waves\u201d \u2014 nay, the \u201cPrince of Tides\u201d \u2014 is not enough to land him the job.\n\nWas he actually the victim of racism, as he alleges on his way out? Was he stigmatized by his record? Maybe he just lacked the appropriate qualifications (none of us ever learned what the job was, anyway). Whatever held Tracy back, it certainly wasn\u2019t those \u201cmiraculous waves.\u201d They were baked to perfection.\n\nA Few More Vibes\n\n\u2022 That pet dragon that mesmerized Al at the hippie\u2019s place is the second prominent reptile this season, for those keeping score.\n\n\u2022 Anyone else notice the TV when Earn returned from the mall?

No, the couple\u2019s idea of the glamorous life is catching a movie (VIP seats, whatever that means), then seeing where else the night takes them. Not too different from any other parents with a toddler.\n\nWhile the previous episode centered around Al\u2019s failures, this week it\u2019s Earn\u2019s turn, as he learns the hard way that a guy who looks like him can\u2019t just go around spending hundred dollar bills all willy-nilly. \u201cIt\u2019s legal U.S. tender!\u201d he keeps insisting. But it\u2019s not the green people are seeing, it\u2019s the brown. After declining to break such a large bill, a white movie theater employee is even suspicious of his debit card. And when Earn tries to plead his case to a nearby white theatergoer (who\u2019s able to successfully pay with a $100 bill), all he gets is a silent, menacing flash of the man\u2019s holstered pistol.\n\nTheir luck is no better at the hookah lounge Van picked out. The black African bar owner, having apparently accepted the worst stereotypes of black Americans \u2014 one half of a commonly acknowledged two-sided culture clash \u2014 calls the cops on them, accusing Earn of using counterfeit money.\n\nInstead of the trademark \u201cAtlanta\u201d satire, we get a face-value portrayal of everyday racism at its most insidious, tedious, exhausting and altogether unsurprising. In both places, Earn is scrutinized, held suspect and shunned just for being who he is and going where he wants to go. Without the show\u2019s usual subtle allusions and abstract allegories, these scenes drag.

He doesn\u2019t drink or smoke, but he\u2019s clearly high off bottled-up hostility, which he directs at his hapless sound engineer. Talk turns to his successful Yoo-Hoo ad and his spot on the latest \u201cFast & Furious\u201d soundtrack (the very same movie Earn tried to see at the theater). The secret to Clark\u2019s success is his manager, Luke. For the second time this season, he\u2019s been pitched as a possible Earn replacement for Paper Boi. Could the third time be the charm?\n\n\u2022 In the studio, Al and Darius get their first glimpse at the \u201cTub dubs,\u201d excitedly examining a stack of newly-minted Harriet Tubman $20 bills (not yet a reality offscreen).

He was stuck stunned and staring most of the day. Meanwhile, have you ever seen Van smile as much as when she was playing those party games and working that room? She was so at-ease and confident, cocky even.\n\nThat is, until Earn\u2019s visible discomfort curbed her enthusiasm. He declined to dress up in lederhosen, wasn\u2019t picking up on any of the right social cues and refused to wear a mask like many of the other men. He quickly capitulated on that last one when a handsy reveler mistook his actual face for blackface. Subsequently, he spent the rest of the night donning a Jason-esque hockey mask. If you\u2019re stranded in a horrific situation, you may as well look the part.\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like she wants me to be lame,\u201d Earn says to Dave, the boyfriend of Christina, Van\u2019s friend and the only other biracial woman at the event. That Dave\u2019s goofily going along with the event \u2014 and doing so in full traditional garb \u2014 yet doesn\u2019t feel personally slighted by Earn\u2019s comment tells you a lot about his overeagerness. (That he keeps peppering his speech with words like \u201cdawg\u201d and \u201cthe whip\u201d says still more.) All the same, he delivers a real nugget of wisdom: \u201cThat\u2019s what girls do when they like you. They just want to twist their life up with yours, that way it\u2019s harder to disconnect.\u201d\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to find common ground in such unfamiliar territory, Earn lures Van away from the dance floor for a quiet game of Ping-Pong. \u201cIt\u2019s the only white game I know,\u201d he pleads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s where things start veering off course. She easily defeats him, but does so in front of an (eerie) audience, bruising his ego. Earn doesn\u2019t typically display much of an ego in the first place and her earlier comment about his lack of confidence in the bedroom likely did him no favors.\n\nAnd then the sniping starts. Though he knows she\u2019s in her element, he dismisses the festival as stupid. She points out that she acquiesces to his plans all the time, simply to spend time with him. Take last week\u2019s strip club outing as one example and Alfred\u2019s concerts as another.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s paying your bills,\u201d he snarls.\n\n\u201cYou can be real mean,\u201d she says, and then walks away. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s said those words to him. But it may be the last.\n\nShe tries to salvage her night by returning to the festivities, but finds no more comfort in her friend Christina. As it turns out, they\u2019re actually more like frenemies \u2014 not unlike Jayde from last season\u2019s all-Van episode, \u201cValue.\u201d Once again, Van is face to face with a woman from her past who\u2019s chosen a different life path, a choice that\u2019s driven an unspoken wedge between them. During an introduction to a pair of Christina\u2019s white friends, Van is referred to as both \u201cLotte\u2019s mom\u201d and \u201cEarn\u2019s girl,\u201d but never as an individual in her own right. It rubs her the wrong way, and she wants to get to the bottom of it privately.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Her favorite festival has lost its luster and Van\u2019s left wandering the streets of Helen, on a tandem phone-searching and soul-searching mission.\n\nA flirty German-speaking bartender who had been sending vibes her way earlier sidles up during the phone hunt. Instead of hitting on her (Earn is walking a few steps behind them, after all), he helps her gain some perspective. \u201cYou should start a relationship with yourself,\u201d he advises.\n\nIt\u2019s good advice: Since losing her job, Van has been floating through life the way Earn does, and we\u2019ve all seen how that\u2019s worked out for him. One of them has to be the adult for their kid\u2019s sake, if nothing else.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe breaks from the pack to relieve herself in a dark alley, where she\u2019s terrified by the sound of a clinking bottle and heavy breathing. A tall figure wearing a monstrous mask is lurking behind her. (They laid the horror tropes on thick this episode.) She decks him, finds her phone nearby and finds the courage to finally speak her truth to Earn.\n\n\u201cI want to be in a relationship where I\u2019m valued as a human being and not as an accessory,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThis arrangement works for me,\u201d Earn replies. Right then and there, you\u2019d think a newly emboldened Van would turn on her heels and leave. Instead, she lets a Ping-Pong rematch decide their fate. Her terms: \u201cIf I win, then you don\u2019t have to see me unless it\u2019s about Lotte or money.\u201d\n\nMuch like everything else in his life, Earn doesn\u2019t put up much of a fight. If he\u2019d shown the same gusto he did in initiating last week\u2019s race against Michael Vick, Van may have seen some proof that his heart was really in their relationship. As it was, he begrudgingly picked up the paddle, she won the best out of five games and finally accepted the truth she\u2019d been avoiding all this time.\n\nThere\u2019s a moment during that final game where Van\u2019s lips curl into a determined smirk. It seems less about scoring a point and more about starting down the road to self-satisfaction. She looks ready to disconnect.\n\nMore Weird Swag\n\n\u2022 \u201cAre black women considered brunettes?\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like a \u201chigh question\u201d at all, Van. Answers, please.\n\n\u2022 The biergarten crowd enthusiastically chants Earn\u2019s name when he apparently wins that perplexing party game. Was their excitement sincere? The game seemed so simple, yet they seemed unbelievably impressed by his performance. Had he actually won? Or were they just making a fool of him? This was yet another scene paying homage to \u201cGet Out.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The wallpaper on Van\u2019s lock screen is an image of Eartha Kitt. What\u2019s the connection? Well, for one thing, Kitt\u2019s breakout acting role was as a character named Helen \u2026 as in Helen of Troy, and the episode\u2019s title.\n\n\u2022 Is anyone going to explain the bespectacled old man in the track jacket who very noticeably kept popping up in the background throughout the day?

His girl\u2019s making angry demands on the other end and he\u2019s quick to jump in his pickup truck to go placate her. Absurdly enough, he\u2019s successful at luring Al along on this \u201cquick\u201d detour. How could Al refuse? He has only 5 percent of a haircut, and the barber-client code stipulates that he can\u2019t just jump into another chair and let someone else finish the job.

In case there was any doubt, in fact, the song \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d by the New York proto-punk band the Dictators accompanies Taylor\u2019s arrival at Axe Cap\u2019s new Manhattan headquarters for Taylor\u2019s first meeting with the company\u2019s analysts. It\u2019s just one of several astute music cues \u2014 I counted Garrett T.

The lack of pre-existing context makes you feel as if these characters were creating their own rock-star personas out of whole cloth.\n\nBut there\u2019s a reason that \u201cBillions\u201d is the show about Wall Street whizzes that even socialists can love. The most striking \u2014 and damning \u2014 aspect of all the power plays is the ideology behind them: There isn\u2019t one.\n\nNeither Axelrod nor Chuck shows the slightest sign of believing in some higher calling or deeper purpose \u2014 not a believable one at this point, anyway (Chuck can certainly muster an impassioned speech about truth and justice when it\u2019s convenient). You might expect this from the hedge fundamentalists: Their cause is capitalism, which they see not as a political arrangement but as a force of nature they can master like wizards. But when Rhoades brings up the concept of serving justice, it\u2019s a joke \u2014 deliberate, winking misdirection from the real reason he handed the Axelrod case to his own one-time nemesis, Oliver Dake. When Chuck and his colleague Kate Sacher (Condola Rashad) conspire to revive the financial cases that the business-friendly new administration has warned them not to pursue, they seem to do so more from pique and pride than from a zeal to right wrongs.\n\nThe political scene \u201cBillions\u201d portrays is equally amoral. The New York kingmaker Black Jack Foley (portrayed by the glamorously graying actor David Strathairn) has no agenda other than to secretly be in charge of whoever is publicly in charge of the state. This mentality tracks upward to the federal level as well. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some wolf in you,\u201d Attorney General Jeffcoat says to Chuck during their meeting, \u201cwhich is why you\u2019re not gettin\u2019 fired.\u201d Neither common ground nor principled bipartisanship has anything to do with it: Jeffcoat simply wants someone he knows he can count on to bring down big game when called upon to do so.\n\nRarely has Red Sanders\u2019s maxim \u201cWinning isn\u2019t everything; it\u2019s the only thing\u201d sounded quite so appropriate.\n\nNot even family, the last refuge of a prestige-TV scoundrel, is sacred. Bobby is in the middle of a divorce, and Chuck stabbed his father (Jeffrey DeMunn) in the back just to take down Axe, a favor the old man is eager to return. And while Chuck and Wendy\u2019s marriage appears to be on the mend, they\u2019re still keeping toxic secrets. During their bondage session, she flogs him while regaling him with details of an ostensibly imaginary liaison with another man at Chuck\u2019s request. But she never admits that such a liaison actually happened, and he never tells her that his father\u2019s private investigator uncovered the truth about it for him.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for an indictment of our age in here, look for it in what\u2019s absent \u2014 ethics, morality, any sense that there\u2019s a better way to run things. Chuck, Bobby, Taylor, Black Jack, Jeffcoat and the rest of the two warring tribes live these hard-charging, high-flying lives simply because they can.

A benign academic term had been borrowed and converted into a \u201cproblem,\u201d a ready-made salvo against lax immigration policies. It didn\u2019t seem to matter that these lax policies didn\u2019t quite exist. In theory, Daub was referencing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the quota system of years past and prioritized family members as new immigrants. But the rush to sponsor family members had created a huge queue for that immigration category, which had, and still has, a yearly cap. A Government Accountability Office report from 1988 found that it was native-born citizens who filed 64 percent of sponsorship requests, and that those sponsoring family members typically waited about 12 years for their arrival. Once \u201cchain migration\u201d became wedded to United States immigration anxieties, though, these kinds of nuances were quickly lost. Chain migration became a scheme, a cheat \u2014 a way to take advantage.\n\nFor the next 30 years the two branches of \u201cchain migration\u201d would coexist: Demographers and urbanists still used the term to describe any network of support, and polemicists still maintained a conspiracy to circumvent border controls. Representative Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican and the author of those mid-\u201980s bills, wrote in a 1995 Wall Street Journal op-ed that he still aimed \u201cto end the problem of \u2018chain migration\u2019 \u2014 where one immigrant can bring in 30, 40, 50 or 70 people who are in-laws.\u201d The president echoed this language when he claimed that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in last October\u2019s Manhattan truck attack, brought over \u201c22 to 24\u201d people. But Saipov, as a green-card holder, could only sponsor a spouse or unmarried children under 21, and did neither. On the Senate floor, Jeff Sessions of Alabama opposed the Dream Act\u2019s provisions for people brought to the United States as children: \u201cFirst they receive conditional status, then legal permanent-resident status and finally citizenship. After they are naturalized, they can then, through the chain migration process, apply to bring in their relatives.\u201d The Congressional Record doesn\u2019t indicate whether Democrats booed this statement, but even if they had, they would have been a decade late.\n\nWhen Senators Durbin and Murphy object to talk of \u201cchain migration,\u201d they are taking a stance against the implicit prejudice behind it \u2014 the way that the term, like \u201canchor baby\u201d and \u201cgreen-card marriage,\u201d dehumanizes immigrants and misrepresents the difficulty of immigrating. Likewise, when the president and attorney general use the term, they\u2019re pushing against the na\u00efvet\u00e9 that shades some blanket defenses of all immigration. But neither group furthers the immigration debate or acknowledges the actual history of chain migration.\n\nThe chain is just a pattern of movement; the immigration system is the patchwork of policies and institutions that shape that movement. Deciding how this system should work is the point of politics. We could discuss the ways that immigrants bolster key American industries, whether surplus labor stagnates wages, how ICE flouts legal arrest procedures, how to prevent terrorism, the ways that Muslims in America are unjustly and ineptly surveilled, how much securing borders would improve public safety or how expensive walls can be. We know that immigration connects these concerns. And yet we\u2019ve never been willing to address them all that honestly. \u201cChain migration\u201d is part of the tradition of cunning partisan one-upsmanship and brokering we\u2019ve had instead. It has produced many a good line. What seems more useful would be good policy.", "title": "\u2018Chain Migration\u2019 Used to Be a Benign Term. Not Anymore.", "authors": []}

A singer-songwriter and actor who published a debut novel, \u201cThe Reminders,\u201d last year, he understood the emotional nuances of songwriting and performing on stage. He also felt he could relate to the play\u2019s protagonist \u2014 an isolated teenager who suffers from anxiety \u2014 and saw the potential to capture his voice in a first-person narrative.\n\n\u201cI really connected with Evan\u2019s tortured interior life,\u201d he said.\n\nPlenty of books have been turned into captivating theater: Alison Bechdel\u2019s \u201cFun Home,\u201d Mark Haddon\u2019s \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\u201d Hilary Mantel\u2019s \u201cWolf Hall,\u201d Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and Roald Dahl\u2019s \u201cMatilda,\u201d to name a few. But it\u2019s rare for an original Broadway musical to be reverse adapted into fiction. How do you translate the emotional highs of live musical theater \u2014 where so much drama is communicated through the songs and performance \u2014 into prose?\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDear Evan Hansen\u201d may be better suited to novelization than most musicals. The play centers on a lonely, anxious teenager, Evan Hansen, whose therapist urges him to write encouraging notes to himself every day. When one of his notes falls into the hands of a classmate who commits suicide, Evan pretends that he and the boy were close friends. Much of the story\u2019s drama is internal, as Evan struggles under the weight of his secret \u2014 a feature that lends itself to fiction.\n\nThere\u2019s likely to be a large and eager audience for the novel. The play won six Tony Awards last year, and has grossed nearly $100 million.\n\nThe show\u2019s creators began thinking about an Evan Hansen novel last year, when they noticed that the story had developed a fan base beyond people who had seen it on Broadway. When the cast recording was released in February 2017, it debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and won the Grammy Award for best musical theater album. People published fan fiction about the characters online. Some fans said the story and the music had helped them cope with their own anxiety.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This time, he brings his own bottle of wine to a dinner at the home of Layla\u2019s teetotaling white imam, Chuck (Michael Weaver), and picks a fight about Islam. \u201cI have a problem with Muslims,\u201d he announces, listing grievances like Sharia law and honor killings. When his harrowing experiences during the Iranian Revolution come up and Chuck suggests that he understands Farid\u2019s pain because he\u2019s studied that period, Farid snaps: \u201cYou studied it. I lived it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m still disappointed that we\u2019ve learned practically nothing about the Shokranis beyond their religion. And the hints that Layla is growing uncomfortably close with the imam because of her husband\u2019s long-festering anger toward Islam aren\u2019t subtle. But we are getting some real insight into the role this conflict plays in their marriage. Although the dialogue in these scenes leaves much to be desired (I groaned when Layla told Farid, \u201cYou dishonored me\u201d), the revelation that she believes his embrace of reason over faith has made him spiritually bankrupt is intriguing.

Duc is still begging for his dad\u2019s approval, proclaiming his celibacy and courting potential clients with all the disingenuous bravado of an infomercial pitchman. The scene in which a woman at the pool warns him, \u201cPride goeth before a fall,\u201d belongs in the on-the-nose hall of fame. Meanwhile, in keeping with the episode\u2019s theme, Ashley and Malcolm\u2019s marriage is put under the microscope. They spend the hour bickering over whose fault it is that none of the children they invited to their 4-year-old\u2019s birthday party are coming. What doesn\u2019t make much sense is that they\u2019re not concerned about why all of Hailey\u2019s friends \u2014 and their parents \u2014 want nothing to do with them.\n\nThis puzzling subplot is mostly an excuse to get all of the Bayer-Boatwrights in the same place, a park where the family celebrated birthdays when Greg and Audrey\u2019s kids were little. It\u2019s an idyllic afternoon, all bubbles and sunlight blissfully coexisting with Malcolm\u2019s drone. Since the premiere, we\u2019ve seen character after character weigh in on whether technology is enhancing or destroying modern life. Four episodes in, the answer seems to be, \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lot more complicated than that.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us, finally, to Ramon. He and Henry were just too perfect to last, weren\u2019t they? So, after an alarming conversation in which he ignores Ramon\u2019s questions about his past and a subsequent, seemingly out-of-nowhere spat about technology, the inevitable happens: Henry disappears. I knew it was coming the moment they reconciled and Henry said, \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re left wondering not only what happened, but who \u2014 or, seeing as there are supernatural forces at work here, what \u2014 Henry even is. His speech about \u201ctechno-geeks\u201d is beyond weird: \u201cWe\u2019re all savages,\u201d he opines. \u201cAnd this is just a way to avoid scary, messy real life.\u201d Last week he was the ultimate chill, go-with-the-flow guy. Now, he\u2019s suddenly the embodiment of primal fear.\n\nLife away from his techno-geek sanctum doesn\u2019t go so well for Ramon at Hailey\u2019s party. During a game of hide-and-seek, always a harbinger of horrors, he finds an abandoned building. Inside, he starts hallucinating. This time, it\u2019s apparently his own biological mother whom he sees, in a kitchen. She calls him \u201cmijo\u201d (a Spanish contraction for \u201cson\u201d). There\u2019s a soldier. She tears at her face, just as Farid\u2019s mom did in Ramon\u2019s dream. And he runs screaming out of the building.\n\nWhatever 11:11 is supposed to mean, the phenomena presumably associated with it are starting to resemble what Freud called \u201cthe return of the repressed.\u201d If Ramon and Farid are connected by anything besides that dream, there\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019s repressed childhood trauma. And come to think of it, \u201cFarid\u201d and his Anglicized nickname, \u201cFred,\u201d both sound a bit like \u201cFreud.\u201d In a show so concerned with philosophy and mental illness, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a coincidence.", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 4: A Binary Organism", "authors": ["Judy Berman", "Here"]}

Not only is he sure that his hallucinations have a meaning beyond mental illness, but he has fallen in love with Henry extraordinarily quickly. So it\u2019s a relief to see them reunited after two days in which Henry didn\u2019t so much as call. He tells Ramon that he left in the middle of the night because his friend relapsed. I find that pretty hard to swallow, especially after Kristen and Navid spot him climbing into a homeless man\u2019s tent and speculate on whether he\u2019s sleeping with the disheveled man inside. (I can\u2019t tell you how much I wish I could unhear Navid\u2019s awful portmanteau, \u201choboning.\u201d)\n\nBut I\u2019m certain something weirder is happening. It seems important that Henry \u2014 who hates to talk about his past \u2014 grew up in Waco, Tex., and that he insists there\u2019s nothing left for him there. If, as we learn this week, he\u2019s almost 30, then he would have been around 5 years old when government forces lay siege to a Branch Davidian compound outside the city, which ended with the deaths of nearly 80 people. Could his parents have been cult members? Now that\u2019s commitment!\n\nFor the Shokranis, conversations about commitment always come back to Islam. This week, Farid confides in Layla that Ramon\u2019s visions are disturbing him \u2014 not least because his birthday is Nov. 11 and because he really did once see his mother with four gashes in her cheek. She asks if he\u2019s off his unnamed medication and says she\u2019s afraid of his becoming \u201cerratic\u201d and \u201cdisappearing\u201d around Navid; surely we\u2019ll hear more about that tendency in later episodes. But the conversation ends with their bickering about her decision to fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and his taunting her with his conspicuous snacking.\n\nNavid\u2019s fasting sparks a more serious conversation about religion, as Kristen scarfs down tacos and he abstains. When she confesses that she doesn\u2019t really have any spiritual beliefs, he points out how depressing it is to believe only in what you can see in front of you when there\u2019s so much pain in the physical world. \u201cWhat\u2019s in front of us is awful,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has to be something better.\u201d At the same time, they\u2019re getting closer and closer to discussing Navid\u2019s sexuality. As she inflicts on him her feminist justification of watching gay porn, he informs her that the boy who humiliated her last week actually likes guys. You have to wonder: How does he know?\n\nKristen and Navid\u2019s talk mirrors another exchange about religion, between Ashley and Jamila (Kelly Jenrette), the mother of Haley\u2019s new, black preschool classmate. Ashley catches shade for not being part of a church congregation, as well as for working in the ostensibly vapid fashion industry, for not carrying lotion for her daughter\u2019s dry skin and for not knowing that her hometown was founded as a \u201cwhite utopia.\u201d Over dinner at Jamila\u2019s place, Malcolm mentions that Ashley\u2019s parents are white, and Jamila says, \u201cThat makes sense.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 5: Commitment Issues", "authors": []}

The butterfly effect has since become a central tenet of chaos theory.\n\nIt has also made its way into pop culture, surfacing every once in a while as the title of a hip-hop single or an Ashton Kutcher time-travel movie. As twisted by the entertainment industry for its own sentimental purposes, the butterfly effect dictates that any small action, usually on the part of an unwitting human, can change the course of a seemingly unrelated person\u2019s life. Now, it looks as if \u201cHere and Now\u201d is determined to give us an unusually literal take on that idea.\n\nFarid has started having dreams like Ramon\u2019s. This week\u2019s episode, \u201cFight, Death,\u201d begins with the psychiatrist in a kitchen with a woman in a head scarf, who seems to be the mother who called Ramon her son in his latest vision. There\u2019s a little boy eating bow-tie pastries. Then, Farid is sharing a joint with grown-up Ramon, who utters a sentence in Spanish he can\u2019t understand. Later, we learn that it translates to, \u201cAlways you ate all the butterflies.\u201d Farid suddenly recalls his mother calling the pastries \u201cbutterflies.\u201d There are also the butterflies in Ramon\u2019s game. It even turns out that Ramon drew butterflies and a woman with four bloody streaks down her face as child.\n\nWhat will it all add up to? Plot predictions have never been my strong suit, and maybe I\u2019m underestimating this show\u2019s capacity for subtlety, but I\u2019m worried we\u2019re going to find out in the season finale that Ramon is Farid\u2019s son or that they\u2019re somehow the same person existing in two different bodies. Perhaps these seemingly supernatural occurrences are the effects of some metaphorical butterfly flapping its wings decades ago. Even if \u201cHere and Now\u201d pleasantly surprises me with an explanation for the characters\u2019 bond that isn\u2019t quite that clunky, it\u2019s bound to delve deeper into this politically and spiritually loaded variation on butterfly-effect mysticism.", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 6: The Butterfly Effect", "authors": []}

In the session that opens this week\u2019s episode, \u201cWake,\u201d Ramon announces that he is quitting work on his video game, \u201cRealms,\u201d and his doctor beseeches him to continue. \u201cI want you to think of your game \u2014 specifically, the artistry of your game \u2014 as a part of your healing process,\u201d Farid says. But he has a hidden motive: He has discovered uncanny parallels between the world Ramon is creating and his own traumatic childhood in Iran. When Farid works himself into a numerological frenzy, connecting the address of his building, the number of his office suite and the nine groups of 11 butterflies in the game to 11:11, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s at least as far gone as Ramon is.\n\nAs a low-level arithmophobic, I won\u2019t pretend to have followed Farid\u2019s every mathematical leap. But even I have caught on to a simpler numerical pattern in the first season of \u201cHere and Now\u201d: Every three episodes, toward the end of the hour, Ramon has a vision. In the premiere, it was the candles. Episode 4 closed with the sequence in the abandoned building, where he saw his birth mother. So, in Episode 7, when the sight of someone wearing a surgical mask at the game expo seems to bring on Ramon\u2019s screaming, trembling, possibly career-killing hallucination of a horde of masked, dust-covered people shuffling toward him like zombies, it fits the pattern.\n\nThe scene is somewhat novel, in that it\u2019s the first of Ramon\u2019s visions (or dreams) that isn\u2019t tied in any obvious way to his birth family, Farid\u2019s past or 11:11. There\u2019s something post-apocalyptic about the apparitions he sees, which also bring to mind the folkloric spirits known as \u201chaints\u201d that Jamila\u2019s family discusses over dinner. Even so, watching Ramon get scared out of his wits by a hallucination every time things seem to be going well for him is starting to get old.\n\nSeven episodes in, he\u2019s not the only character whose story line is becoming redundant. I know that I complain about Ashley and Duc every week, but every week it gets more frustrating to watch the show keep hammering home the same points about them. In \u201cWake,\u201d Ashley questions her marriage to a white man, meets Jamila\u2019s mom and continues to stew about her own adoptive mother\u2019s accidental, televised defense of white supremacy \u2014 all plot points that push her another few inches in the direction of some inevitable revelation about her racial identity.", "title": "\u2018Here and Now\u2019 Season 1, Episode 7: Harsh Realms", "authors": []}

The second is that the president is nervous about his base and feels compelled to manufacture a drama in order to keep them in line. Hence the second-most interesting line in the Times\u2019s article: \u201cAmy Kremer, a Tea Party activist who helped found Women for Trump, tweeted, \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGail: I really am prepared to believe he didn\u2019t know the wall wasn\u2019t in the bill. He probably didn\u2019t even ask. When his top people are sitting in the Oval Office, the conversation goes something like this:\n\nAIDE: I have some good news: The whole spending package is almost done.\n\nPRESIDENT: Did you hear what Oprah said about me?\n\nBret: Hehe.\n\nGail: The two things a Republican president is supposed to do are cut taxes and try to cut domestic spending. Which generally doesn\u2019t work, but you expect there\u2019d be an effort at least.\n\nBret: The operative phrase on right-wing blogs is always something like: \u201cThe swamp wins again. Trump surrenders.\u201d This is also known as \u201ccompromise.\u201d Republicans got a $61 billion increase in military spending, the biggest annual increase in 15 years. Democrats got some of their own priorities funded. This is more or less how things are going to work when you don\u2019t have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The correct conservative response ought to be to nod, shrug and get on with life.\n\nBut it won\u2019t work that way, because right-wing ideologues have convinced themselves that they own Washington and that any policy victory that is less than 100 percent complete is a sellout to the nefarious forces of liberalism and globalism. Wouldn\u2019t it be something if Trump had gone out there and said, \u201cThis administration is prepared to take two-thirds of the loaf and that\u2019s how politics in a democracy ought to be\u201d? He can\u2019t because he is unwilling and unable to move beyond the furies of his base.\n\nGail: Now that is the kind of sensible, real-world answer I\u2019ve come to expect from you. Personally, I\u2019d love to have a fight about the defense budget, and the whole idea that we\u2019re supposed to be the world\u2019s sole policeman. A country capable of putting Donald Trump in the White House should not be trusted with that kind of responsibility, and I\u2019m tired of paying for it.\n\nBut that\u2019s a rant \u2014 please ignore. The other White House weirdness has been the ever-shifting cast of characters. I guess there\u2019s no reason for us to worry about the way his lawyers have been racing through the revolving doors, but we\u2019re only one Fox broadcast away from Judge Jeanine as attorney general.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "Employers are now bearing the brunt of the Trump administration\u2019s wrath against California and illegal immigration more broadly; ICE\u2019s chief, Thomas D. Homan, has vowed more workplace enforcement and warned that the state had better \u201chold on tight.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, those companies now have to follow the state\u2019s Immigrant Worker Protection Act, which took effect Jan. 1. The law prohibits companies from cooperating with ICE without a subpoena, and from letting ICE agents into nonpublic areas.\n\nIt also requires them to post notices alerting workers that ICE will be reviewing records \u2014 a tip-off to those who may not be legally allowed to work. Any company found violating the law faces fines of $2,000 to $10,000.\n\nSeveral workplaces visited by ICE have lost workers, or customers, since it began targeting businesses in late January, and before the audits were even completed. Agriculture, a state economic powerhouse, has been especially hard hit.\n\nCalifornia farms are heavily dependent on immigrants to fill their physically demanding and often low-paid jobs, and it is no secret that many of those immigrants are in the country illegally.\n\nEmployers contend that they have no way of knowing when a worker submits a fake Social Security number on their I-9 forms, the federal document on which employees attest they are citizens or otherwise legal. Supporters of tougher immigration enforcement say that employers are just winking at the issue.\n\nA common way for the government to root out illegal labor is to audit companies\u2019 I-9 records. By federal law, ICE sends companies a letter before beginning an audit, and by the new state law, companies must pass that news on to their employees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Bee Sweet Citrus, a large grower and shipper of oranges, lemons and grapefruit in Fowler, in Central California, plastered on the wall an advisory about ICE\u2019s inspection plans, the company lost some packers, sorters and administrators, one employee said.\n\n\u201cI resigned out of fear,\u201d said the worker, Ana, who asked that her surname be withheld because she is undocumented. She said she hung on until Feb. 16, close to the deadline for the company to submit paperwork to ICE, so she could make another month\u2019s rent. (The company said it was complying with state and federal laws regarding the ICE audit, but declined to comment further.)\n\nFaith in the Valley, an advocacy group based in Fresno, said it had received a spate of calls from workers rattled after seeing the notices about audits. Manuel Cunha, the president of Nisei Farmers League, a growers\u2019 organization, said, \u201cI have never seen workers quit like this before.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the moment a pair of agents, donning flak jackets emblazoned with \u201cICE,\u201d set foot there to serve her an I-9 audit notice, her patrons dispersed. \u201cEverybody knows ICE was here,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso in a bind are law enforcement agencies prohibited by another new state law from cooperating with ICE unless the federal agency has a warrant or the case involves a major crime.\n\nEven before the law, many of the state\u2019s largest agencies, like the Los Angeles and San Francisco Police Departments, limited their work with ICE. But agencies in more conservative areas have had to change their practices.\n\nThe California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association was one of the most vocal opponents of the law. \u201cWhat used to happen is that I would hand someone off while they were in custody, ICE would escort them out and they would be gone,\u201d said Sheriff Donny Youngblood of Kern County, who was president of the association last year. \u201cNow we have to turn them loose.\u201d\n\nLast year, before the law took effect, the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department turned over about 370 undocumented immigrants from county custody to federal authorities, said Sheriff Sandra Hutchens.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow those people are going back into the community,\u201d Sheriff Hutchens said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any horrible incident that has occurred yet, but when that happens, the community is going to say to me, \u2018Why were they released?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration argues that the state laws shield dangerous criminals from federal law enforcement at the expense of public safety. In his speech on Wednesday announcing his lawsuit, Mr. Sessions cited the case of a 34-year-old undocumented immigrant arrested in Ventura County on a charge of sexual abuse of a minor. The man, Jose Vaca, left jail and has disappeared, the Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s Office said, because the new state law forbids jails to turn inmates over to ICE until they have appeared before a judge. Mr. Vaca posted bail and was released before his first court appearance, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\n\nThe state\u2019s Democratic leaders have argued that their new law regarding law enforcement cooperation with ICE keeps communities safe by maintaining trust between the police and immigrant residents. After President Trump took office, the police departments in Los Angeles and other American cities said domestic violence reports from the Hispanic community dropped, which they feared was because victims who were undocumented were afraid of coming forward.\n\nThe law on employer cooperation helps immigrant workers learn their rights and seek legal help if necessary, its supporters say. \u201cThe law works first and foremost to protect Californians\u2019 privacy at the workplace,\u201d said Sarah Lovenheim, a spokeswoman for Xavier Becerra, the Democratic state attorney general. She said she could not divulge whether the office had received any complaints about companies violating the law.\n\nMr. Poindexter, the walnut processor, said he considered himself fortunate that the audit came after the harvest. But his plant operates year-round, and he is eager for ICE to finish its work so he can replace the lost workers before the fall harvest. \u201cThere is no point in hiring people with this cloud hanging over us,\u201d he said.\n\nSome business owners even wondered if California\u2019s attempts to protect undocumented immigrants were having the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the state is helping employers or workers; they are making it worse,\u201d said Karen Musson, who owns Gar Tootelian, a fertilizer retailer that serves 1,500 growers in Fresno County. \u201cWe are attracting ICE agents because California drew a line in the sand.\u201d", "title": "\u2018I Am a Pawn\u2019: Trump\u2019s Immigration Fight With California Squeezes Those Caught in the Middle", "authors": ["Miriam Jordan", "Jennifer Medina"]}

And the forger has now come forward, not only to acknowledge and apologize for his sin, but also to bask a bit in how artful his deception has been.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the apotheosis of my own making,\u201d the forger, Harold Gordon, said in a recent interview. Mr. Gordon sold the piece to Mr. Katz, and in the process fooled many experts in the antiques world.\n\n\u201cI lied,\u201d said Mr. Gordon, 69. \u201cI cheated. I stole.\u201d\n\nFake antiques are far from rare, but few match the sort of ambitions and artistry as that created by Mr. Gordon, experts said. Robert Cheney, director of the Willard House & Clock Museum in North Grafton, Mass., likened this caper to that of the \u201cgreat Brewster chair,\u201d created in 1969 by a former police officer who passed it off as a rare, 350-year-old piece. It ended up in the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOccasionally, museums display fakes intentionally. One of the most popular recent exhibitions at the Winterthur in Delaware was devoted to forgeries, according to Linda Eaton, co-curator of the display. It opened, appropriately, last April Fools\u2019 Day.\n\nMr. Gordon said he had no grand plan for trickery when he set out around 2010 to create his phony memorial in the workshop of his home in Templeton, about an hour outside Boston. A self-taught woodworker, he labored off and on for months as he turned a plain-looking, if old, secretary into a detailed piece rich with the patina of history.\n\nMr. Gordon, a stickler for details, said he tried to imagine how a simple, rural country craftsman in the mid-19th century would have approached such a project. \u201cWhat standards of excellence did they have?\u201d he asked himself.\n\nAmong his additions: a clock crowned by an eagle and the words \u201cThe Union Preserved\u201d near the base.\n\nBut to make it work, he said he knew it would need a story. So Mr. Gordon, a student of history, imagined the piece as an heirloom of the Binghams, a real family with Civil War ancestors.\n\nPhoto\n\nJohn Bingham and his brother Wells, both from East Haddam, were privates in the 16th Connecticut Infantry, who, as teenagers, saw their first action on Sept. 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam.\n\nJohn, 17, was killed there; Wells, 16, survived.\n\nMr. Gordon said he decided to describe his handiwork as a gift that had been presented on July 4, 1876, by Civil War veterans to Wells in honor of John, and then handed down to Wells\u2019 son, Edgar. He had appraised the estate of a Bingham family member, giving him insight into their ancestry.\n\nHe taped a typewritten note inside the secretary that he had dated Sept. 22, 1972. It, too, was forged, embellished with aged, yellowed tape, artful tears and typing errors. He signed it by mimicking what he imagined to be the shaky hand of an elderly Edgar M. Bingham.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

He had found a piece of period fabric, which he presented as a remnant of a flag carried by the 16th during the battle.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI was never at a point where I was doing it to show off, to show how great I was,\u201d Mr. Gordon said. \u201cIt simply became a creative process.\u201d\n\nAt first, Mr. Gordon said, he left the secretary in his living room where he occasionally entertained offers from visitors who wanted to buy it. He always declined. But then he ran into some money problems, he said, and decided to unload it to Mr. Katz in an act of desperation.\n\nThe Wadsworth, which has not disclosed what it paid for the secretary, displayed it as a powerful artifact, beautiful in its creation and meaningful in its significance to the history of Connecticut. But in late 2016, it received an anonymous tip that the piece was fake, investigated and late last year quietly removed it from public view.\n\nClayton Pennington, editor of Maine Antique Digest, was also tipped off to the problem with the secretary. He soon found a photograph that had been taken in the Gordon living room of an unadorned secretary that looked suspiciously like an image he had found online of the fully realized Bingham memorial secretary in the same spot.\n\nBut when he first spoke with the museum, a curator told him, he said, that the institution was still studying the issue of authenticity. He also called Mr. Katz and told him about his finding. Mr. Katz said he then confronted Mr. Gordon, who confessed and apologized.\n\n\u201cIt has been a humbling and difficult experience,\u201d Mr. Katz said last week, \u201cbut at least I was able to play a key role in helping to expose this masterpiece of deception.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn late February, Mr. Pennington published a lengthy report that declared the secretary a forgery. After the article appeared, the Wadsworth issued a statement, promising to \u201creview our accession process and make every effort to ensure that art we acquire is what it purports to be.\u201d\n\nMr. Katz, a dealer in American folk art since 1985, gave the museum a full refund. He said he was not ready to decide yet whether he would try to recover any losses from Mr. Gordon.\n\nMr. Gordon, an antiques dealer since the 1970s, said he figures he\u2019s a \u201cpariah\u201d in the business now because of the forgery. \u201cIt has ruined my life,\u201d he said, but he said no legal action has been taken against him.\n\nStill he exhibits a creator\u2019s pride toward the craftsmanship he displayed. \u201cThat thing,\u201d he said, \u201cshould be in a museum.\u201d\n\nOne Bingham descendant said he found the hoax amusing, even if Mr. Gordon had falsified a portion of his family\u2019s history.\n\nMichael Cone, a 64-year-old retired physician from Maryland, who has an interest in the Civil War, said he has ancestors on both sides, including the Bingham brothers. Mr. Cone, who was born in Louisiana, said he was not bothered that the brothers\u2019 history had been misappropriated.\n\n\u201cThey deserved it,\u201d he said, jokingly, \u201csince they were my Yankee cousins.\u201d", "title": "\u2018I Cheated,\u2019 Says Woodworker Who Fooled the Antiques Experts", "authors": ["John Banks"]}

{"date": "2018-03-10 00:00:00", "text": "But the money didn\u2019t always assure the safety of Lafarge\u2019s workers or its operations. Between 2012 and the end of 2014, at least a dozen workers were kidnapped, according to testimony and witness statements of former employees, company documents and the internal review. Employees faced gun-toting militants when they went to work. And the factory \u2014 one of the biggest foreign investments in Syria \u2014 was captured anyway. It has been shuttered ever since.\n\nA panel of French judges appointed by the Paris High Court, which oversees criminal investigations, is now looking into whether Lafarge put workers at risk and violated international sanctions by paying the Islamic State and other armed groups to keep operating as war bore down. Six former top Lafarge officials, including two former chief executives, are being formally investigated under charges of financing terrorism.\n\nThe judges, who decide whether cases go to trial, are also examining a lawsuit by Sherpa, a French anti-corruption organization that pursues humanitarian abuses by corporations, on behalf of former employees alleging Lafarge was complicit in war crimes. The employees, in the lawsuit, claim that the company ignored the dangers they faced, and pressured them to keep working.\n\n\u201cLafarge acted as if it was above the law,\u201d said Marie-Laure Guislain, the head of litigation at Sherpa. \u201cBut it played a role in an armed conflict, as well as in the violation of human rights, and must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Sherpa lawsuit helped prompt the French investigation, as did reports on Lafarge\u2019s activities by the French newspaper Le Monde.\n\nAll of the former Lafarge executives have denied the charges against them, which could be dropped if judges find the evidence insufficient. If prosecuted, the executives could face penalties of up to 10 years in jail and fines of 225,000 euros. Authorities will also determine whether the company itself can be held liable. The activity occurred before Lafarge merged with the Swiss cement giant Holcim in 2015.\n\nThe former chief executive Eric Olsen resigned last year after the internal inquiry, although Lafarge concluded that he was not responsible for, or aware of, the activity. In the United States, the company, now called LafargeHolcim after the merger, dropped plans to supply building materials for President Trump\u2019s proposed wall on the border with Mexico amid criticism in France over the Syria affair.\n\nLafargeHolcim, in a statement to The Times, insisted that the No. 1 priority of Lafarge executives was to guarantee employee safety, and pinned the decisions on local managers who \u201cwrongly believed\u201d they were acting in the interests of the company and its employees. The company acknowledged \u201cunacceptable errors committed in Syria,\u201d and said that it \u201cdeeply regrets what happened.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt also said that while the use of an intermediary was a \u201cserious concern,\u201d its internal review \u201ccould not establish with certainty the ultimate recipients of the funds.\u201d\n\nLafargeHolcim\u2019s chief executive, Jan Jenisch, said the company is cooperating with French authorities. \u201cI am the most interested person that truth comes out and we can close this chapter, which we are very sorry about,\u201d he said during a presentation of the company\u2019s results last week.\n\nIn its statement, LafargeHolcim added it had put in place extensive reviews and controls \u201cto ensure that LafargeHolcim today is a different company with further enhanced compliance.\u201d\n\nMr. Mohamad and the other workers, all of whom survived, are now trying to rebuild their lives. Many had to flee Syria, becoming refugees in Turkey and Europe. While some managed to get jobs, others struggled afterward.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a while, Dr. Adham Basho, the Lafarge employee who warned Mr. Mohamad, lived with his wife, children and 18 other families in a Turkish refugee facility after leaving Syria. He has found only odd jobs to support his family. Hisham Haji Osman, an information technology specialist, made it to Germany and is still trying to land permanent work. Mr. Mohamad is living as a refugee in Turkey, unable to return home while war persists.\n\n\u2018We Kept Going\u2019\n\nWhen Lafarge bought a dilapidated factory in northern Syria in 2007, one of the biggest advantages was a local partner with ties to President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government.\n\nThe partner, Firas Tlass, an influential tycoon, could navigate back channels in a country with murky rules and bureaucracy. He arranged an operating license and other permits for Lafarge.\n\nFounded in 1833 as a family business in France, Lafarge had a history of landing big and complicated projects. In the mid-19th century, it won a contract to build the Suez Canal in Egypt. During World War II, it helped furnish cement for the construction of a massive coastal wall of bunkers for the Nazis, known as the Atlantic Wall, that stretched from Scandinavia to the Spanish border.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Syria, Lafarge saw a new opening to the Middle East. After a three-year renovation of the \u20ac680 million plant, Lafarge Cement Syria opened in October 2010, employing hundreds of people and generating thousands of related jobs. Trucks and vans crisscrossed the desert, transporting employees, delivering Lafarge cement and bringing in fuel and raw materials from nearby quarries.\n\nAs operations ramped up, a wave of revolutionary fervor from the Arab Spring movement swept the region. Anti-government protests spread to Syria, and were brutally suppressed in March 2011 by government security forces. Soldiers from Syria\u2019s army defected and, along with civilians who took up arms, formed rebel groups to battle the government, some of them loosely organized as the Free Syrian Army. The government responded by attacking rebel-held areas, in an increasingly complex and bloody conflict that continues to batter the country.\n\nWhile the fighting took root in the south, the security around the Lafarge plant in the north slowly began to deteriorate. Free Syrian Army groups moved into the area, long controlled by Mr. Assad\u2019s government, along with the militia of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD. By the end of 2011, the United Nations declared Syria in a state of civil war, and the European Union placed an embargo on arms and oil purchases in Syria.\n\nAfter that, Total, the French oil giant, halted its Syrian operations. Other French multinationals followed, including Bel Group, the maker of Babybel cheese, and Air Liquide, France\u2019s largest gas company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot Lafarge. Bruno Lafont, who was the Lafarge chief executive at the time, saw no reason to leave. Company security advisers assured bosses at headquarters in Paris that the plant was not in a combat zone and remained safe. \u201cSo we kept going,\u201d Mr. Lafont told investigators, according to the court documents. \u201cLafarge has never run away.\u201d\n\nBy summer 2012, the situation in Syria had grown increasingly uncertain, and Lafarge decided to move hundreds of foreign employees out of the country for their safety. Senior managers, including Bruno Pescheux, the chief executive of Lafarge Cement Syria at the time, relocated to Cairo to oversee operations remotely.\n\nThe Syrian employees kept working. Their job was to keep the cement flowing \u2014 and to make the factory appear occupied as a way of discouraging militants from raiding it.\n\nLafarge said it wanted to keep providing jobs for locals who eagerly wanted to work. The company relocated employees to Manbij, a town near the plant, and provided lodging for others inside the factory compound so they could keep working as road travel grew more risky, according to testimony by former executives and employees. When the civil war ended, \u201cwe\u2019d at least have an operation that could furnish cement for the reconstruction of Syria,\u201d Mr. Pescheux told French investigators.\n\nPhoto\n\nWorkers felt fortunate to be employed by a major French multinational that offered good salaries to support their families in a region with few opportunities. Yet as the situation grew starker, Lafarge\u2019s local managers, the employees said in interviews, witness accounts and testimony, turned up the pressure, threatening to dismiss or cut the pay of those who balked at the worsening safety environment.\n\n\u201cBefore the war, the management practices were very good,\u201d said Jarir Yahyaalmullaali, a former warehouse keeper. But later, he added, \u201cthey would force you to go to work and threaten to dismiss you even if there were problems and the roads were dangerous.\u201d\n\nAfter their foreign colleagues were evacuated, the Syrian employees discussed forming a union or striking to protest deteriorating work conditions. They were especially upset about being ferried in Lafarge-contracted vans through checkpoints held by a rotating cast of armed militants, the employees said in interviews, testimony and accounts submitted to the court.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They gave him instructions to act as an intermediary with local groups to ensure safe passage around the factory, Mr. Pescheux told investigators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe partner, Mr. Tlass, according to the law firm\u2019s review, steered large sums to the Free Syrian Army, which occupied Manbij, where Lafarge had relocated employees. More money flowed to the Kurds, who had worked with the Free Syrian Army and promised military-style protection for the factory, which they considered to be in their territory.\n\nThe payoffs didn\u2019t guarantee safety. In autumn, the Kurds kidnapped nine Lafarge employees and transferred them to local militias. Lafarge\u2019s local managers reported the kidnappings to Paris and spent around \u20ac200,000 to secure their release, according to the internal inquiry and testimony of former executives.\n\nThe troubles worsened in 2013, when the Qaeda affiliate in Syria, the Nusra Front, and other Islamic groups seized Raqqa, a strategic city about 90 kilometers south of the factory. In the ensuing months, a schism within Al Qaeda split the Nusra Front from the Islamic State group, which took control of Raqqa.

His 12 sons, by contrast, fill the height of each six-and-a-half-foot canvas; they pose frontally, in profile or from behind, and they wear a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob\u2019s foretelling of their destinies in the Book of Genesis. (One theory about Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s fashion fixation: His father was a haberdasher.)\n\nReuben, the eldest son, echoes Jacob by wearing a lofty turban, while Simeon has on a savage animal pelt, and Levi, his back to us, sports an embroidered robe and eye-popping boots studded with pearls. In these paintings and the others, Zurbar\u00e1n places the figures against landscapes whose horizon is slung low, so that the brothers appear to tower over the earth.\n\nJudah, son No. 4 and the ancestor of Kings David and Solomon, faces front in a fur-trimmed gown, toting a scepter and standing beside a kindly lion.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Here are the crucial things I think Sheryl Sandberg did. First, she made women question not just what\u2019s wrong with the corporate structure, but ask themselves, \u201cHow are you holding yourself back?\u201d Because structural change in the work environment is critical \u2014 but nothing makes a difference if you\u2019re holding yourself back. Many people said, \u201cOh, she was telling women to blame themselves,\u201d but that\u2019s not it at all. (And the onus isn\u2019t only on women; she talks about men leaning in, too.)\n\nWhat\u2019s powerful about Sheryl\u2019s writing is that she\u2019s honest. It\u2019s easy to dump on her because of her privilege. But she is self-effacing and self-questioning; she was always asking herself, whenever there was a problem, \u201cWhat\u2019s my role in this?\u201d And that\u2019s what she gave us, too: She put language to some workplace issues we all know exist but don\u2019t always know how to talk about. The idea of \u201cleaning in\u201d is extremely useful. For example, when we\u2019re feeling excluded at work, when someone isn\u2019t including us in a discussion or a project, we\u2019re all so uncomfortable. That\u2019s when we want to lean back and just ignore it. And that\u2019s exactly the time to lean in.\n\nSheryl makes it very clear how we all grow through discomfort. Think about this as a parent. When I had fights with my one of my daughters when she was younger, my thoughts would drift toward sending her to boarding school. If we both went into our rooms and shut the door, nothing happened. It\u2019s when I leaned into the conflict and forced more discussion, painful as it was, that\u2019s when things got resolved.\n\nAnd you know where she was really right, even if this part of the movement got her a lot of flak? Choosing your partner, insisting on that person being supportive and participating in the home 50 percent of the time. She was so deliberate about this part of her life. And lots of people took her to task for this, because we aren\u2019t comfortable thinking so strategically about love and romance. The truth is, when a marriage is bad, work is a great refuge. I have to admit, I put my husband at the center of everything, and it was a very bad marriage, and my career took off when I got divorced.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. What satisfies me at my age \u2014 some board representation, some women in the C suite or on the management team \u2014 does not feel like enough to my millennial daughters. We were talking about this recently, and they were like, \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Representation should be at least 50 percent, they say. And they\u2019re not wrong.\n\nLola Bates-Campbell, 30\n\nAssociate creative director at Frog Design (and a daughter of Sunny Bates)\n\nFive years ago, when \u201cLean In\u201d just came out, I was a very junior person at Frog Design. I never read the book. But I remember vividly when it came out, because it catalyzed a series of initiatives at the company to look at women in positions of leadership and compensation. The company\u2019s C.O.O. and president were women. I remember the first meeting we had \u2014 I was so junior that I wasn\u2019t sitting at the table, but sort of on a chair in the corner \u2014 and the conclusion was that because there were women in the C suite, the company didn\u2019t have any systemic issues, even though there were very few women in middle management. Essentially the message to us, that I thought was the \u201cLean In\u201d message, was: You have to do more. And people left that meeting kind of crestfallen. So, it\u2019s all up to us to pull ourselves up by the bootstraps? O.K., then! But it felt out of touch.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of it. Over the next three years, the company continued to look at the issue, brought in an outside consultant that allowed us to address gender and diversity issues \u2014 and ultimately there was real change. Five years later, I\u2019m one of those women in middle management now, and one of the reasons is the \u201cLean In\u201d movement. Even for those who didn\u2019t read it and make it a part of their lives in a conscious way, it had an effect.", "title": "\u2018Lean In\u2019: Five Years Later", "authors": []}

Readers debated it on social media and in the comments section of the piece. Below is a sample of some representative viewpoints, edited lightly for clarity. For more, read the essay and comments here.\n\nRetired Justice Stevens confirms the need for conservative voices on the Supreme Court. He would change the second most important amendment based solely on his emotional lack of logic, not on history. The Second Amendment was created to guarantee the eternal freedom of the citizenry from an overreaching federal government. The same argument applies today, as history proves that one of the first steps for authoritarian governments is to remove firearms from their future serfs. Then comes free speech and religion. The founding fathers were much more wise than Stevens. \u2014 Jon Galt, Tex.\n\nFrankly, in the wake of District of Columbia v. Heller, I don\u2019t see how any meaningful gun control could be enacted without a repeal of the Second Amendment. Heller elevated the right to own a gun to such a high level, it is right up there with freedom of speech and the right to due process. Even the most mild, seemingly sensible gun control measures can now be challenged on constitutional grounds, with a high probability of success. Heller created such an impregnable shield around the Second Amendment that tearing it out root and branch seems like the only way. \u2014 Dennis Fritz\n\nRight-wing talking points aside, the Second Amendment was never written to guarantee the eternal freedom of the citizenry from an overreaching federal government.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nIt is one of the maddening paradoxes of New York City\u2019s recent political history that Mayor Bill de Blasio came to power with a righteous rage to ban horse-carriages in Central Park (a prohibition he ultimately failed to enact), but he has shown no fury \u2014 or any real sign of displeasure \u2014 over a much more dangerous and environmentally damaging means of vehicular tourism, sightseeing by helicopter.\n\nThe risks of the practice were clarified again on Sunday, when a chartered helicopter crashed into the East River, killing all five passengers onboard. To facilitate in-flight photography, the helicopter doors were removed, and the four men and one woman on board were strapped so tightly into their seats that they were given knives to extricate themselves in the event of an accident. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration finally put a stop to open-door helicopter flights. That they had been allowing passengers access to sharp objects in aircraft flying around the perimeter of major cities, when mothers of toddlers are still removing their Uggs at the airport, remains its own enduring mystery.\n\nIt has been decades now since advocates for a quieter and less polluted city have railed against the helicopter industry, which came into tragic disfavor most dramatically in 1977, when a rotor blade broke off a helicopter that had been ferrying people to Kennedy Airport from the roof of the Pan Am building in Manhattan, killing five people, one of them a woman walking down Madison Avenue. After a crash in the East River in 2011, various politicians and members of City Council called for a ban on tourist helicopters, pointing out that since 1983 there had been 28 crashes in New York with at least 19 fatalities. The ban never materialized. Instead, two years ago, the city moved to reduce the number of tourist helicopter flights around Manhattan by half \u2014 to 30,000 per year.\n\nThat\u2019s more than 80 flights every day \u2014 an astonishingly high number given that the mayor has mythologized himself as a national leader in climate change. Earlier this year, he announced that city pension funds would divest from companies profiting from the fossil-fuel business and that the city would sue five oil companies for reparations, essentially, connected to the damage fossil-fuels have inflicted on the city\u2019s ecosystem. It is as if a class-action suit were filed against Shake Shack for causing obesity while the plaintiffs were quietly deep frying slices of apple pie every morning at home for breakfast. The Airbus AS350, one of the most popular tourist helicopters \u2014 it was the model involved in Sunday\u2019s crash \u2014 produces 43 times the amount of carbon dioxide emissions per hour than the average car.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor several years now, the city has justified helicopter tourism as a vital means of revenue. Its Economic Development Corporation, which manages the downtown heliport from which tourist helicopters take off and land, has said that the economic impact to the city amounts to $50 million a year. But that figure comes directly from the Helicopter Tourism and Jobs Council, a lobbying group made up of five helicopter-tour providers. And it is a figure that takes into account the hotel and restaurant expenses that tourists accrue while they are in the city, as if to suggest that they were coming to New York solely for the purpose of flying around Manhattan in a helicopter for 15 minutes, rather than, say, to see \u201cHamilton\u2019\u2019 for the third time. Advocates of a tourist helicopter ban have long taken issue with the figure. As Adrian Benepe, the city\u2019s former parks commissioner put it to me, \u201cIt\u2019s just completely insane.\u201d\n\nThe city has also argued that the tourist-helicopter industry in New York supports more than 260 jobs, as if that were an impressive figure, outweighing the obvious downsides, in a strong economy with a local unemployment rate of just over 4 percent. The city has said that it will not make any decisions about the future of tourist helicopters until an investigation of Sunday\u2019s crash is complete. But in a more impressive show of judgment, Senator Chuck Schumer and various local congressional representatives called for a suspension of these flights at least until the causes of the accident could be understood.", "title": "\u2018Open-Door\u2019 Helicopters Are No Longer Flying Over New York City.

The tightening of Mr. Xi\u2019s power is considered so delicate that censors have squashed online commentary of almost any kind.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were not carried on Chinese television, online or in the state-run newspapers. When CNN, which is restricted in the venues it can broadcast in China, reported Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Sunday, censors turned television screens blank.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhat Trump said should give Xi a modest boost,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a China expert at Claremont McKenna College in California.\n\nOrdinary Chinese who support Mr. Xi are likely to latch on to Mr. Trump\u2019s validation, even though Mr. Trump is viewed by many Western observers as an embattled president, said Shen Dingli, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University.\n\n\u201cChinese people who really support this change will say: \u2018Look, we are great. The superpower has endorsed our way,\u2019\u201d Mr. Shen said.\n\nPhoto\n\nA nearly two-week long meeting of the national legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, which opens in Beijing on Monday, is scheduled to formalize the changes to the Constitution and abolish the two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday to highlight the main events at the Congress, the spokesman for the legislature, Zhang Yesui, played down Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to scrap the two-term rule for the presidency.\n\nAsked by a Western reporter whether the amendment scrapping two term limits meant Mr. Xi would be leader for life, Mr. Zhang ducked the question.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Neither post has a term limit.\n\nThe new arrangement \u201cwill help to strengthen and improve the national leadership system,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\n\nThe failure of Western leaders to speak out against Mr. Xi\u2019s plans for limitless power was in step with a growing acceptance among democracies of one-man rule in many countries, said Fran\u00e7ois Godement, director of the Asia and China program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCriticism has been confined to human rights \u2018excesses,\u2019\u201d and even those were limited, Mr. Godement said. \u201cThe mode of government is no longer addressed.\u201d\n\nDuring a visit in January, President Emmanuel Macron of France warned China that it should not create \u201cvassal states\u201d and should not act as a hegemonic power as it expanded its influence across Asia and Europe with its infrastructure program, the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMr. Macron was careful to limit his comments to \u201ceconomic rules of the road\u201d and not trespass into the question of governance inside China, Mr. Godement said.\n\nIn Japan, whose adversarial relations with China are growing slightly warmer, the government has so far not commented.\n\nIn Australia, where a national debate is roiling over China\u2019s meddling in the country\u2019s domestic affairs, the government has also stayed quiet.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was fearful of economic consequences that would rattle its vital trade relationship with China if it spoke out, China experts said.\n\n\u201cAustralia is silent because America, the self-styled leader of the \u2018free world\u2019 after World War II, has abdicated that role under Trump,\u201d said Feng Zhang, a fellow at the Department of International Relations at the Australian National University. \u201cAustralia\u2019s accusation of Chinese interference in its domestic affairs has elicited a chilly response from Beijing. It doesn\u2019t want to make a bad situation worse.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, political observers lamented Mr. Trump\u2019s latest off-the-cuff remark.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the strange habit of being completely transparent about his deepest desires, despite his long track record of false or misleading statements,\u201d said Yascha Mounk, the author of \u201cThe People Vs. Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger and How to Save It,\u201d and a political scientist. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t take his joke as a declaration of intent, but we should absolutely take it as evidence that he deeply admires dictators like Xi Jinping and would be tempted to emulate some of their repressive policies if he could.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, Mr. Trump may have inadvertently hearkened to the emperors who ruled China until 1912.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201c\u2018President for life,\u2019 is of course, very much in the imperial tradition and this may give the notion a certain historical resonance in China,\u201d said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society in New York. \u201cIn the U.S., however, the idea is an utter anathema to everything the Founding Fathers believed and the carefully crafted Constitution they bequeathed us, which was explicitly designed to limit just such a drift towards monarchy or autocracy.\u201d", "title": "\u2018President for Life\u2019?

They focused on big places with small human footprints, available prey and buffer zones where animals may traverse safely. Their analysis revealed 130 potential sites suitable for rewilding and an additional 150 spots with little human activity to consider preserving. Their results, published Wednesday in Royal Society Open Science, suggest that with proper attention and care to ensure these carnivores\u2019 survival, rewilding programs could restore lost ecosystems worldwide.\n\nBut it won\u2019t be as simple as finding a dot on a map.\n\nTheir paper mentions just two specific reintroduction sites where rewilding would likely work out as planned. They suggest it could be possible to put gray wolves in Olympic National Park in Washington and sending endangered red wolves, which once roamed the southeast, into Everglades National Park. These places have space for reproduction and development, prey and humans who may tolerate them.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nBut for many other locations, especially in developing countries, people still hunt some animals for bushmeat or body parts used in traditional medicine. Fences limit range. Humans compete for prey or kill carnivores that threaten their lives, agriculture or livestock. Not all corridors are safe. These places may better serve as guideposts, directing researchers to spots for further investigations into what\u2019s really happening on the ground.\n\nThe biggest hurdle will be finding humans willing to live alongside and support efforts to keep big carnivores around, said Thomas Newsome, an ecologist studying human-predator interactions at the University of Sydney who was not involved in this study. That would mean supporting efforts to stop the activities that killed many large carnivores in the first place. And even for gray wolves, that hasn\u2019t been easy: Some people don\u2019t want them, and others still hunt wolves outside park boundaries in Yellowstone and in Alaska.\n\nPerhaps the solution is rethinking what it means to be humans in a natural world, said Layla AbdelRahim, an anthropologist who has studied human understanding of wilderness. We must recognize our role as partners with the environment, rather than dominators, to maintain functioning ecosystems, she said.\n\nRewilding will be a significant trend in preserving ecosystems where all species matter, said Dr. Ripple. \u201cHumans are just figuring out what the interconnectedness in nature is all about.\u201d", "title": "\u2018Rewilding\u2019 Missing Carnivores May Help Restore Some Landscapes", "authors": ["Joanna Klein"]}

Residents had been urged to stay indoors for hours while the area was cleared.\n\nAnd yet, there and elsewhere around Austin, people seemed to keep their eyes trained downward \u2014 looking for suspicious bags and backpacks, packages and strands of wire across sidewalks.

They did say that the first three devices were made from commercially available materials and required a level of skill on the part of the bombmaker to avoid an accidental explosion while handling the devices.\n\n\u201cWe have a high degree of confidence that the same individual built all these devices,\u201d said Fred Milanowski, special agent in charge of the Houston office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which has made the Austin case its top national priority.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said they have had no contact with anyone tied to the bombings, despite taking the unusual step on Sunday of publicly asking the suspect or suspects to contact the authorities so they could learn more about the message behind the attacks, hours before the latest explosion.\n\nPhoto\n\nAsked whether the latest bombing was the suspect\u2019s response to that plea, Chief Manley added, \u201cWe won\u2019t know that until we have an opportunity to talk to the suspect or the suspects, whether or not that was a motive behind this.\u201d On Monday, law enforcement officials continued to ask for the suspect to contact them.\n\nAt least one expert on serial bombers and mass murderers cautioned that the suspect may have no motive beyond causing chaos.\n\n\u201cI call them vanity bombers,\u201d said Michael Rustigan, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at San Jose State University and an expert on the Unabomber case, in which a former mathematics professor dispatched a string of bombs that killed three people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for attention. He\u2019s looking for fame. The bomber might not have a message. The bomber might not be ideological. His motive might be simply to make Austin cringe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat is known about the construction of the bombs so far appears to be providing few concrete clues, though analysts said the police are most likely analyzing remnants of the devices for fingerprints, DNA or other clues \u2014 in addition to scrutinizing any surveillance camera footage.\n\nImprovised explosive devices such as those involved in the attacks can vary widely in size, lethality, the type of construction materials used, and means of initiation. The basics of how to make simple I.E.D.s have been in print for decades, with \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook\u201d by William Powell being one of the first to make that information publicly available in 1971.\n\nIn recent years, similar books have been joined online with advanced bomb-making schematics and recipes for homemade explosives developed and refined by insurgents all over the world \u2014 though the bombs described by the police in Austin are not necessarily very advanced or powerful, especially when compared with the devices faced by American troops in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nThe four neighborhoods where the explosions have occurred are varied economic and demographic slices of Austin. The first three bomb scenes were in largely working- and middle-class sections of northeast and east Austin, with sizable black, Hispanic and Asian populations. Hammocks and baby swings hang from tree branches on front lawns near Haverford Drive, the site of the first bombing on March 2. The explosion on Sunday took place in a gated and sprawling planned community that is largely white. It is a hilly and wooded area near a patchwork of busy highways and parkways, a favorite among hikers, joggers and walkers.\n\nRichard Herrington, 75, a retired pharmacist who lives about a half-mile from the blast site in Travis Country, said he and his family had gone hiking Sunday afternoon near the street where the explosive went off later that evening.\n\n\u201cMy oldest granddaughter, age 7, said, \u2018Grandpa, I want to walk on the street where there\u2019s the most shade,\u2019\u201d Mr. Herrington recalled. \u201cWe could have very easily walked down that street because there is shade. We could have been on that street and maybe the tripwire was there already, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAt about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, Mr. Herrington said, he and his wife were watching an N.C.A.A. basketball game. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the military and you hear a mortar round go off, it has a thump,\u201d said Mr. Herrington, who served in the Army. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I knew it was a bomb, because it was a distinctive thump like that.

{"date": "2018-03-18 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cBehind closed doors, we call it testilying,\u201d a New York City police officer, Pedro Serrano, said in a recent interview, echoing a word that officers coined at least 25 years ago. \u201cYou take the truth and stretch it out a little bit.\u201d\n\nAn investigation by The New York Times has found that on more than 25 occasions since January 2015, judges or prosecutors determined that a key aspect of a New York City police officer\u2019s testimony was probably untrue. The Times identified these cases \u2014 many of which are sealed \u2014 through interviews with lawyers, police officers and current and former judges.\n\n[ALSO READ: He Excelled as a Detective, Until Prosecutors Stopped Believing Him]\n\nIn these cases, officers have lied about the whereabouts of guns, putting them in suspects\u2019 hands or waistbands when they were actually hidden out of sight. They have barged into apartments and conducted searches, only to testify otherwise later. Under oath, they have given firsthand accounts of crimes or arrests that they did not in fact witness. They have falsely claimed to have watched drug deals happen, only to later recant or be shown to have lied.\n\nNo detail, seemingly, is too minor to embellish. \u201cClenched fists\u201d is how one Brooklyn officer described the hands of a man he claimed had angrily approached him and started screaming and yelling \u2014 an encounter that prosecutors later determined never occurred. Another officer, during a Bronx trial, accused a driver of recklessly crossing the double-yellow line \u2014 on a stretch of road that had no double-yellow line.\n\nIn many instances, the motive for lying was readily apparent: to skirt constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches and stops. In other cases, the falsehoods appear aimed at convicting people \u2014 who may or may not have committed a crime \u2014 with trumped-up evidence.\n\nIn still others, the motive is not easy to discern. In October 2016, for example, a plainclothes Brooklyn officer gave a grand jury a first-person account of a gun arrest. Putting herself in the center of the action, the officer, Dornezia Agard, testified that as she approached a man to confront him for littering, he suddenly crouched behind a van, pulled from his waistband a dark object \u2014 later identified as a gun \u2014 and threw it on the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cP.O. Agard testified that she heard a hard metal object hit the ground,\u201d according to a letter the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office wrote summarizing her testimony.\n\nBut prosecutors lost faith in her account in July 2017, after learning from other officers that she was not among the first officers on the scene. Officer Agard had arrived later as backup, according to the letter, which noted that the gun charges against the man were later dismissed. The prosecutors did not address why Officer Agard claimed to be a witness, or why the other officers present seem to have allowed her to process the arrest.\n\nPolice lying raises the likelihood that the innocent end up in jail \u2014 and that as juries and judges come to regard the police as less credible, or as cases are dismissed when the lies are discovered, the guilty will go free. Police falsehoods also impede judges\u2019 efforts to enforce constitutional limits on police searches and seizures.\n\n\u201cWe have 36,000 officers with law enforcement power, and there are a small handful of these cases every year,\u201d said J. Peter Donald, a spokesman for the Police Department, the nation\u2019s largest municipal force. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any of these cases any less troubling. Our goal is always, always zero. One is too many, but we have taken significant steps to combat this issue.\u201d\n\nShrouded, but Persistent\n\nThe 25 cases identified by The Times are almost certainly only a fraction of those in which officers have come under suspicion for lying in the past three years. That\u2019s because a vast majority of cases end in plea deals before an officer is ever required to take the witness stand in open court, meaning the possibility that an officer lied is seldom aired in public. And in the rare cases when an officer does testify in court \u2014 and a judge finds the testimony suspicious, leading to the dismissal of the case \u2014 the proceedings are often sealed afterward.\n\nStill, the cases identified by The Times reveal an entrenched perjury problem several decades in the making that shows little sign of fading.\n\nSo far in 2018, a Queens detective has been convicted of lying in a drug case and a Brooklyn detective has been arrested amid accusations that he fabricated the results of a photo lineup. These cases returned the phenomenon of police lying to the public eye, leaving police officials to defend the integrity of honest officers.\n\nKevin Richardson, the Police Department\u2019s top internal prosecutor, said he believed so-called testilying was nearing its end. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem that\u2019s very much largely on its way out,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s tempting to think about police lying as a bygone of past eras: a form of misconduct that ran unchecked as soaring street violence left the police overwhelmed during the 1980s and early 1990s and that re-emerged as police embraced stop-and-frisk tactics and covered up constitutional violations with lies.\n\nBut false testimony by the police persists even as crime has drastically receded across the city and as the Police Department has renounced the excesses of the stop-and-frisk years.\n\nSome policing experts anticipate that the ubiquity of cameras \u2014 whether on cellphones, affixed to buildings or worn by officers \u2014 will greatly reduce police lying. For the moment, however, video seems more capable of exposing lies than vanquishing them.\n\nMemory and Manipulation\n\nIn two recent cases, The Times found, officers appear to have given false accounts about witness identifications. These cases are particularly troubling because erroneous identifications by witnesses have been a leading cause of wrongful convictions.\n\nAfter a 2016 mugging near a Brooklyn subway station, the police arrested a group of four people, one of whom was found to be in possession of the victim\u2019s wallet. In preparing the case, prosecutors sought to pin down a few basic facts. Had the police brought the victim, who was punched and had his wallet taken, to positively identify the four suspects after they were taken into custody? If so, what had the victim said?\n\nGetting a straight answer from the arresting officer, Chedanan Naurang, proved nearly impossible. It had been Officer Naurang\u2019s quick thinking that had made the arrest possible: Having lost the suspects at one subway station, he followed a hunch and drove one stop down the line, where he caught up with the four men after they got off the train.\n\nBut certain details Officer Naurang gave prosecutors kept shifting over the next year, according to a February 2017 letter that prosecutors wrote in which they summarized his fluid story.\n\nOfficer Naurang said at one point that the identification had occurred inside a police station when the victim passed by the holding cells, saw the men and confirmed their involvement in the crime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[ALSO READ: Two NYPD Officers Are Charged With Lying About Suspect]\n\nA few weeks later, he backtracked. No, the victim had actually never gotten to see the suspects at the police station, Officer Naurang explained. Instead, the victim had gotten a chance to view them on the street, shortly after their arrest. That\u2019s when the victim got out of the police vehicle in which he had been waiting, Officer Naurang said, and pointed to one of the four men, identifying him as an attacker.\n\nThis version of events, however, was at odds with the recollection of the police officer who had driven the victim to the scene of the arrest. That officer, Christopher McDonald, told prosecutors that the victim had remained in the back seat while viewing the four suspects. And Officer McDonald said that the victim couldn\u2019t say whether they were his assailants. He thought he recognized their clothing, but wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nBecause of Officer Naurang\u2019s changing story, prosecutors dropped the case against the men as part of a deal in which all four pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a second mugging they were accused of the same night.", "title": "\u2018Testilying\u2019 by Police: A Stubborn Problem", "authors": ["Joseph Goldstein"]}
{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "A different kind of inescapable evil gets an airing when Kreizler visits Cyrus in the hospital, who is recovering from a head wound inflicted by the killer. The doctor finds Cyrus\u2019s niece, Joanna Crawford (Brittany Marie Batchelder), tending to him. A reporter for The Philadelphia Tribune, she attended college courtesy of Kreizler, who paid for her schooling as a gift to Cyrus and his family. To Crawford, however, both this gift and his continued \u201cfriendship\u201d with her uncle, who entered Laszlo\u2019s service after committing a justifiable homicide, are signs of condescension and control, not generosity. Kreizler, she believes, is simply keeping Cyrus downtrodden with his courtesies and progressive ideas \u2014 \u201cmore effective than using shackles and a whip.\u201d\n\nEchoing criticisms leveled today at \u201cperformative wokeness,\u201d Joanna\u2019s assertions about Laszlo\u2019s character hit him as hard as any he\u2019s heard so far. He spends the rest of the episode attempting to make it up to not only Cyrus but also to his other servants, Stevie and Mary.\n\nIn Mary\u2019s case, his suggestion that perhaps it\u2019s time she strike out on her own is greeted with explosive indignation. So he invites her to dinner instead. When he finally reaches out to take her hand, initiating what becomes a passionate kiss, a clever bit of camerawork begins with Mary offscreen and follows Laszlo\u2019s his hand as it traverses the space between them until she is finally in the frame \u2014 a visual representation of the effort required to bridge the emotional gap.\n\nYet another speech on the evils that plague the city isn\u2019t delivered by a knowing scoundrel like Byrnes or Kelly, nor by a sharp sociopolitical analyst like Joanna. It\u2019s delivered by a man so rich and powerful that he can bend society and politics to his will and no one thinks of him as a scoundrel at all. Using Connor as muscle and employing Byrnes (and Bishop Potter) as backup, J.P. Morgan has Moore and Kreizler abducted and brought to his mansion. At first, Morgan indulges his cohorts\u2019 demands that the investigation be dropped because of the high social standing of their suspect.\n\nBut Kreizler\u2019s insistence that Willem Van Bergen isn\u2019t the killer enables Morgan to put aside upper-class solidarity and address his real concerns. New York, he says, is on the verge of becoming history\u2019s greatest economic powerhouse. But for that to happen, he says, \u201cWe need a compliant work force.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A harsh truth, but a truth nonetheless.\u201d In other words, dead children are usually just unfortunate; when their corpses clog the flow of capital, it\u2019s a crisis.\n\nWisely, Kreizler refuses Morgan\u2019s offer of financial support for the investigation, knowing Morgan would want something in return. (\u201cWhat could a man like J.P. Morgan want from you?\u201d John asks incredulously. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Laszlo replies, \u201cbut I\u2019m most unwilling to find out.\u201d)\n\nAnd the investigation continues despite these obstacles. Changes in the killer\u2019s methods of mutilation remind Commissioner Roosevelt, who is present when the team examines the corpse, of massacres he witnessed during his time in the Dakotas. (The future president befriended Seth Bullock, the real-life basis for the \u201cDeadwood\u201d lawman, during his time out West. I smell a crossover!)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a surprisingly low level of colonialist racism for their time, the team figures out that the killer is not actually a Native American, whose mutilations of enemy corpses are informed by a very specific spiritual logic. The killer is likely a white man who witnessed such mutilations, probably as a child, and who applies his own twisted meanings to them as he recreates them. After a harrowing visit to a mental institution, Sara Howard identifies a new suspect: a soldier, previously interned in the United States government\u2019s secret hospital for soldiers suffering from what today we would call post-traumatic stress, and other mental disorders. Thus the breadth of any potential conspiracy widens even further.\n\nOn a final note, the progress of Sara and John\u2019s romance has become nearly as compelling to track as the murder investigation because of the character insights it uncovers along the way. In fact, the couple\u2019s most intimate scene in this week\u2019s episode isn\u2019t actually romantic at all, although it does end with Miss Howard leaning against Mr. Moore in a heartfelt embrace.\n\nWhen Sara presents her breakthrough in the child-killer case to John, the vehemence of her refusal to reveal her findings to Kreizler directly is unmistakable. John knows something must have happened between them, and asks what it was with an edge of alarm in his voice.\n\n\u201cHe was right about one thing,\u201d Sara explains. \u201cGiven certain circumstances, we\u2019re all capable of violence.\u201d The actor Dakota Fanning excels at radiating shock, pain, and betrayal from behind Sara\u2019s practiced composure, and the script follows suit: She never says outright that Laszlo struck her, but she powerfully conveys the moral gravity of Kreizler\u2019s blow nonetheless.\n\n\u201cThe Alienist\u201d has often been so focused on its central murders that its other acts of violence feel like afterthoughts \u2014 most notably the sexual assault against John arranged by Captain Connor and Paul Kelly, which at least gets alluded to by Kelly during their carriage ride, but which doesn\u2019t seem to have affected John at all. It\u2019s good to see the show treat this assault \u2014 a man\u2019s hitting a woman, essentially for mouthing off to him \u2014 with due seriousness.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 7: A Devil\u2019s Bargain", "authors": ["Sean T.

We knew her \u2026 not so well, actually.\n\nWritten by John Sayles and directed by David Petrarca, this week\u2019s episode ups the ante for its main characters considerably, in a fashion grimly familiar to fans of genre fiction: It killed off the male lead\u2019s love interest. The episode begins with Dr. Laszlo Kreizler and his mute maid Mary Palmer mooning over each other like puppy-lovesick teenagers; it ends with her twisted corpse on the floor of Kreizler\u2019s home.\n\nWhen the former Captain Connor and his minions break into the doctor\u2019s house, presumably to finish the job after a botched assassination attempt, Mary inexplicably grabs a knife and charges after the intruder. (Kreizler isn\u2019t even there, so it\u2019s not clear what she\u2019s trying to protect except the sanctity of his bedroom.) A scuffle ensues, Connor gets stabbed in the shoulder, and Mary falls from the second-floor balcony, crashing into the chandelier on her way down before breaking her neck upon the bottom stair.\n\nIt\u2019s a sorry fate for the character, who despite an expressive wordless performance by Q\u2019orianka Kilcher never truly found her voice. (No, \u201cfalling in love with a guy\u201d is not a personality trait. And don\u2019t even get me started on the character Cyrus, who seems to exist solely to get jumped, despite being played by Robert Wisdom, who carried an entire season of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d one of the greatest shows of all time.)\n\nCompare Mary\u2019s fate with John Moore\u2019s. That toffish illustrator has survived multiple run-ins with Connor, from tense staredowns and terse conversations all the way up to getting drugged and sexually assaulted at the ex-cop\u2019s behest. Last week\u2019s episode ended, rather pointlessly it turns out, with a cliffhanger in which Connor waylaid and coldcocked Moore in a skid-row alleyway.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 8: Home to Roost", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nSeason 1, Episode 9: \u2018Requiem\u2019\n\nEver feel like you get more done when the boss isn\u2019t around? From this, a workplace truth that for many seems self-evident (unless you\u2019re the boss, naturally), \u201cThe Alienist\u201d concocts another week of investigative breakthroughs. By the end of this episode, Dr. Laszlo Kreizler\u2019s motley crew of pro-am criminologists is closer than ever to capturing its quarry, the relentless child-killer whose stylized murders have been baffling and revealing in equal measure. But there\u2019s one major difference in their pursuit this time around: Dr. Kreizler is not a participant.\n\nThe progress made by Sara Howard, John Moore, and the Isaacson brothers in the absence of their mercurial mentor is a surprise only in terms of the centrality Kreizler was given by the story before now. Considering all we\u2019ve learned about his methods and mien this season, it\u2019s more of a shock that they got anything done before. Now, with Laszlo housebound by grief, there are no angry, object-throwing outbursts to contend with, no dredging up of painful memories of drowning brothers and faithless fianc\u00e9es and suicidal fathers, no slaps to the face when someone like Sara has the temerity to suggest that healing oneself should be any physician\u2019s first order of business (or any alienist\u2019s). It\u2019s hard to believe, given the unmistakable evaporation of all that interpersonal drama, but it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Kreizler came across like the most reasonable genius in the genre, let alone the room.\n\nTo be fair, the doctor\u2019s erstwhile acolytes are working with tools he provided. As Laszlo might have done, they puzzle over the symbolic significance of the killer\u2019s pseudonym and study the Christian calendar for significant clues. But without the skills they bring to the table themselves, they never would have been able to track down the killer\u2019s apartment and confirm his identity.\n\nHe does, indeed, appear to be Japheth Dury, the abused preacher\u2019s son turned predatory census-taker and part-time leg-breaker for a local bookie. He is also, as we began to understand last week, operating under the name \u201cJohn Beecham,\u201d the surname stolen from a man who raped Japheth before he retaliated by cutting his throat and throwing him off a cliff. To ferret this out required John\u2019s rapport with street kids and his knack for sketch artistry; Sara\u2019s attention to detail and her research skills among the vast census records; and the Isaacsons\u2019 badge-flashing, lock-picking, witness-interrogating police work.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt all leads to the grimmest discovery of the season, coupled with its goriest onscreen moments. While John\u2019s young friend Joseph listens in horror, Beecham butchers one of his friends in the public baths, dragging his bloody corpse down the hall and off to whatever urban aerie will become this latest victim\u2019s chosen resting place. At the same time, in the killer\u2019s bedroom, Sara opens a heart-shaped box and discovers an actual human heart, while Marcus Isaacson uncovers a jar filled with human eyeballs \u2014 many more, it\u2019s clear, than the known victims could have provided.", "title": "\u2018The Alienist\u2019 Season 1, Episode 9: The Doctor Is Out", "authors": ["Sean T.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s in those final steps of the hunt for the killer that the problems really begin. Kreizler bamboozles Roosevelt and his men so that Kreizler and Moore, already under close watch by Byrnes, could sneak away to the child-killer\u2019s new lair unnoticed. How do they know that this lair is in the Croton Reservoir? How does Sara, whom Kreizler also dupes (reasons unclear), figure out that same thing in turn, arriving at the reservoir just in time to save their lives? There\u2019s some hand-waving about interpreting the killer\u2019s map of the water and sewer systems, a change in his modus operandi, and his apparent obsession with John the Baptist. But that\u2019s all wild guess work, and New York was a really big city \u2014 on an island, no less \u2014 even during the Gilded Age. Water, water everywhere, yet they know exactly where to go.\n\nThe episode ratchets up the tension by including Byrnes and Connor as factors in the final showdown, from a poorly explained scene in which Byrnes monitors our men at the opera house to Connor\u2019s almost comically dogged pursuit of the alienist\u2019s team. But while their acute interest in the case made sense while one of their high-society patrons was under suspicion, it made considerably less sense once that patron was killed by Connor. His involvement in the murder of Laszlo\u2019s beloved Mary seems to be an open secret as well, although this, too, is poorly explained. Now Connor goes to all this trouble just because the police object to the doctor\u2019s newfangled methodology? It simply doesn\u2019t hold up as a motive.\n\nPut it all together, and it feels rushed and forced, as if the filmmakers looked at the clock, realized they were running out of time and did a speed run through the final hour of what until now had been a very meticulous, patient detective story.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnd even here, 10 episodes deep into the show\u2019s 10-episode run, those filmmakers are gilding the cruelty lily. We\u2019ve spent weeks looking at the mutilated corpses of Japheth Dury\u2019s child victims. Did we really need to watch a puddle of urine collect on the floor beneath body of his terrified kidnapping victim, or watch the killer bash a cat in a bag to death against the wall (good luck getting those sound effects out of your head), to understand he means business? Were these awful moments required to demonstrate his desire to inflict suffering on weaker creatures, human or animal, when we\u2019ve seen the box of animal bones and the jar of eyes to prove the point already?\n\nTo be clear, I am not taking some sort of principled stand against graphic, disturbing violence. On the contrary! As a longtime horror fan, I believe gore and brutality can be used to articulate the agony and terror we feel but do not have the words to express. Moreover, I applaud any show that makes an effort to make murder \u2014 whether by serial killers or soldiers \u2014 unpleasant rather than thrilling. Trauma should not be easy to digest.\n\nBut on that count, \u201cThe Alienist\u201d attempts to have its cake and eat it too. Rather predictably (if you\u2019ve seen the end of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d Season 1, which Fukunaga directed), the hunt for Japheth Dury devolves into a cat-and-mouse game through the labyrinthine, dimly lit halls of the reservoir. Bullets fly. Characters get knocked out over and over, but never killed (John\u2019s miraculous recoveries continue, this time after having his head repeatedly slammed against a brick wall). The villain lowers himself from the ceiling to waylay his pursuers like a bizarro Batman \u2014 fitting, given the genuinely bizarre visual effects that distort his face like a member of the Dark Knight\u2019s rogues gallery. And thanks in part to all those unconscious-but-not-dead characters, there are more buzzer-beating rescues and reversals on hand here than in the whole of March Madness.\n\nAt any rate, Kreizler and company get their man, or men. Captain Connor, surely the most diligent henchman a corrupt system of authority could ever ask for, trails Laszlo and John all the way to the chamber where they\u2019re confronting Japheth, mortally wounding the killer before being shot to death in turn by Sara, another last-second arrival. Connor dies quickly; Japheth dies quietly, though not before hauling himself up to the top of the reservoir in one last incomprehensible ritualistic gesture.\n\nI\u2019ll give the climax this: Kreizler\u2019s soul-deep sorrow as he realizes the man will not live to offer any insights into why he did what he did is more than moving \u2014 it\u2019s a summary of everything the man stands for. He didn\u2019t just want to stop Japheth Dury. He wanted to stop the creation of more Japheth Durys, and that quest just took a devastating blow.\n\nOf the show\u2019s three leads, Daniel Br\u00fchl was always given the most demanding and complicated material. His character, genial and insightful one minute, robotic and cruel the next, never really cohered, and neither did the performance. (It is always possible that the role could be resurrected for an adaptation of the sequel novel, \u201cThe Angel of Darkness,\u201d but there are no known plans for now.) But the sight of Kreizler strolling in his trademark hat, or smiling politely as he interacts with others in his soft, accented voice, is endearing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClosing the show with a scene in which Laszlo visits his elderly, uncommunicative father in a sanitarium and discusses the abuse he suffered at the old man\u2019s hand was a bold and fitting choice. The hunt for the murderer may have disappointed, but the hunt for the truth, about his own mind and the minds of others, will continue.

The montage is a greatest-hits collection of Elizabeth personas: the frumpy glasses-and-perm working woman, the longhaired seductress, the action-figure operative in her baseball cap. The primary message, driven home throughout the episode, is that Elizabeth is exhausted, and resentful of Philip\u2019s new freedom.

To impress him, Andrew asks his friend Jeff to impersonate the naval officer he used to be and to present Andrew with a gift of Ferragamo shoes \u2014 as a sign, Andrew says, that he is loved. (Jeff agrees, grudgingly, to present the gift but not to dress up.) The stunt backfires: Jeff and David take an immediate interest in each other, but not so much in Andrew. And we know from a previous episode that they will end up getting together, which Andrew discovers before killing them both.\n\nAndrew\u2019s pathologies are apparent to anyone who bothers to look. Norman\u2019s protective friend Gallo spots Andrew snorting drugs and confronts him. \u201cYou think Norman\u2019s the lucky one, don\u2019t you?\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re wrong: You\u2019re the lucky one.\u201d Andrew is only able to parade himself around like an equal because Norman, who has built an immensely successful company from scratch, is generous enough to want Andrew to feel that way.\n\nWhen Andrew insists that he is Norman\u2019s equal and then tries to storm off, Gallo delivers the bons mots that will prove to be an unfortunate understatement: \u201cWhat a volatile mix you are: too lazy to work and too proud to be kept.\u201d\n\nThat mismatch between Andrew\u2019s laziness and ambition comes to the forefront when he presents Norman with an ultimatum: He demands a higher living allowance; first-class flights; a Mercedes-Benz XL600; and a place in Norman\u2019s will, as his sole heir. Norman refuses. He has performed some \u201cdue diligence,\u201d he says, and has learned that Andrew is not Andrew DeSilva, Ph.D., the estranged son of New York millionaires, but Andrew Cunanan, college dropout, who was recently working at a Thrifty drugstore for $6.16 an hour and living in a cramped condo with his mother, MaryAnn.\n\nIt is an extraordinary scene. Confronted with the truth, Andrew remains in denial. When it becomes clear Norman won\u2019t relent, Andrew grabs a patio chair and smashes a glass tabletop with it \u2014 a mere hint at the serious violence to come.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ever in denial, Andrew persuades David to fly to Los Angeles, where Andrew has reserved a room at a five-star hotel and buys David an expensive suit. Andrew can\u2019t stop lying \u2014 asked what he does for a living, he suggests that he is financing a major movie \u2014 and the dinner culminates in excruciating fashion with Andrew declaring, \u201cDavid Madson, you are the only one I have ever really truly loved.\u201d\n\nDavid, the industrious son of a Wisconsin hardware-store owner, gives Andrew what amounts to a final chance, asking simply for the truth. Andrew still can\u2019t stop his prevarications. He says his father was a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch who later returned to the Philippines \u201cto run vast pineapple plantations\u201d; that his mother oversaw a literary publishing house until she retired; and that his parents adored him so much that they lavished little Andrew with the master bedroom, a credit card and an occasional lobster when the school lunch wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nAndrew seems unaware that high-achieving people from modest backgrounds tend not to be impressed by tales of pampered childhoods.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the remainder of the episode, we learn more about Andrew\u2019s drugs and dreams. (Maureen Orth\u2019s book \u201cVulgar Favors,\u201d upon which the series is based, says that Andrew was a drug dealer, not just a drug user.)\n\nIn one bizarre scene, Andrew dreams that he has walked into a Versace boutique and is being measured for a suit by the designer himself. His self-indulgent lament:\n\nWhat could be more generous than spending everything on other people and being left with nothing? What could be more generous than finding soul mates for other people and then ending up alone? People have taken from me, and taken from me, and taken and taken from me. Now I\u2019m spent. And they say this man has nothing left to give. And a man with nothing to give is a nothing man.\n\nThe fantasy Versace replies, more than a tad sardonically, \u201cThat is very poetic, sir.\u201d Andrew tells him: \u201cThis world has wasted me. It has wasted me while it has turned you, Mr. Versace, into a star.\u201d\n\nAndrew adds: \u201cWe\u2019re the same. The only difference is you got lucky.\u201d\n\nConsumed by self-pity, delusion and addiction, Andrew hits bottom. He returns to Norman\u2019s mansion, desperate for money; Norman threatens to call the police. Finally Andrew goes home \u2014 to his mother\u2019s dingy apartment.\n\nMary Ann seems, if such a thing is possible, even more deluded than her son. She believes he has been traveling with Versace to Tokyo, Sydney, Moscow and Milan. She gives him a bath.\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t know much of her story yet, she appears simple-minded and emotionally fragile, and her hold on Andrew nonexistent. Telling her that the next stop in his glamorous life is Minneapolis, Andrew drives off to begin his murderous spree.

Later, back at his mother\u2019s apartment, Andrew reacts violently after discovering that she has bought a tub of Safeway ice cream rather than his preferred brand, H\u00e4agen-Dazs. His spite toward anything everyday \u2014 what in last week\u2019s episode he derided as \u201cordinary\u201d \u2014 is visceral and explosive. He slams the tub onto the kitchen floor, making a mess.\n\nWhen his mother asks why it matters, Andrew tells her about Reuben Mattus, the brand\u2019s founder, who made up its Danish-sounding name. It\u2019s a brief but sad moment, one that reveals how consumer abundance, or the illusion of it, has made Andrew so petulant, childish and self-indulgent that he despises his own mother.\n\nIn the gay world, we soon learn, Andrew is more Safeway than H\u00e4agen-Dazs.\n\nAt a gay bar with his handsome friend Jeff, a Navy veteran, Andrew laments that he isn\u2019t approached more by men; Jeff urges him to take the initiative, but Andrew fears rejection in the same way he fears getting his hands dirty. For him, it\u2019s existential. \u201cBeing told no is like being told I don\u2019t exist,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve disappeared or something.\u201d\n\nPeople get rejected every day, and we may never truly understand why most move on with their lives while Andrew moved on to become a killer.

Andrew ends up becoming the kept man of Lincoln Aston, a friend of Norman\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s on Lincoln\u2019s dime \u2014 purportedly to look into art acquisitions \u2014 that Andrew travels to San Francisco and buys a fateful drink for a handsome young man sitting alone at the bar.

Andrew turned 11 that summer. Modesto leads his youngest child \u2014 whom an older brother calls \u201cPrince Andrew\u201d \u2014 on a tour of the new house. He is given the master bedroom. It is clear that his parents have marked him as special, and not just in the way youngest children are often doted on.\n\nAs Andrew interviews for the Bishop\u2019s School, an elite private academy, Modesto interviews at Merrill Lynch. Modesto\u2019s charm is on full display. \u201cGentlemen, I\u2019m aware that you have a long line of eager Ivy League-educated young men queuing up to be brokers at Merrill Lynch, but ask yourself, how many of them started from nothing?\u201d he asks. When asked to discuss business, not his biography, he protests: \u201cMy life is a tale told in dollars,\u201d he tells them, which started in a small village in the Philippines and wound up in an $80,000 home.\n\n\u201cNow is that biography or business?\u201d he asks. \u201cBecause I will tell your investors that\u2019s what I plan to do with their money. I will cross oceans with it. I will take it to new lands. I\u2019m talking about growth they can\u2019t imagine.\u201d The monologue is notable because it is so much like the fantastic tales that Andrew will later tell to the many gay men he will try to impress.

Modesto spoils Andrew to the point of buying a car for him, even though he is too young for a license. Even more troubling, Modesto is physically abusive to his wife, Mary Ann, whom he holds in contempt for her \u201cweak mind.\u201d And his obsession with Andrew is clearly unhealthy. In one particularly disturbing scene at bed time, there\u2019s an intimation of possible sexual abuse. The scene goes dark, and we\u2019re left to wonder.

Ronnie recognizes Versace\u2019s significance. \u201cWe all imagined what it would be like to be so rich and so powerful that it doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019re gay,\u201d he says during a police interrogation.\n\nBut he is also angered that the authorities were slow to alert the gay community and to solicit its help in the manhunt \u2014 until, as Ronnie notes, one of the victims was famous. \u201cYou\u2019re so used to us lurking in the shadows and, you know, most of us, we oblige,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople like me, we just drift away. We get sick? Nobody cares.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Andrew was vain,\u201d he continues, as a flicker of something almost like pride, or at least defiance, lights his eyes. \u201cHe wanted you to know about his pain, he wanted you to hear, he wanted you to know about being born a lie. Andrew is not hiding. He\u2019s trying to be seen.\u201d\n\nMaybe. But at that moment Cunanan is, in fact, hiding out on a house boat. If he had a message to communicate about his pain, he did not share it.\n\nThe series is loosely based on Maureen Orth\u2019s gossipy book \u201cVulgar Favours,\u201d but the dramatizations and embellishments are so extreme that the series appears more a flight of wishful fantasy than an act of journalistic reconstruction. Also extreme is the director Daniel Minahan\u2019s insistence on making this finale a retrospective of horrors.\n\nUntil now, the series was told in reverse chronological order. But the finale circles back to where it started, and it is bursting at the seams with tangential characters, visual cues and over-the-top emotions that leave a jumble of impressions instead of delivering a clear punch.\n\nWe pay a visit to Marilyn Miglin, a self-made cosmetics magnate who sells her wares on television and whose husband, Lee, a Chicago property developer, was the third of Cunanan\u2019s five victims. She happens to be in Tampa, Fla., while the manhunt following Versace\u2019s murder occurs.

We knew from Episode 4 that the father and son were both pretty decent people.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe most strange and haunting moment of this finale comes when Cunanan, desperate and reduced to eating dog food, dials his father, Modesto, a disgraced former stockbroker who fled to his native Philippines after some shady financial deals. Andrew is sobbing, a man of 27 reduced to helplessness. \u201cDad, I\u2019m in trouble,\u201d he pleas. \u201cI need help. I need you to come get me.\u201d Modesto promises Andrew that he\u2019ll drop everything and race to Miami to rescue him. \u201cI will find you and I will hug you and I will hold you in my arms,\u201d he says.\n\nOf course he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s a hustler.\n\nThe next morning, it\u2019s clear to Andrew that Modesto isn\u2019t coming. In fact, he hasn\u2019t even tried to leave the Philippines. \u201cMy son is not and has never been a homosexual,\u201d he tells television reporters as his son watches from Florida. He adds: \u201cHe was a perfect boy, the most special child I ever saw. The idea that he could be a killer makes me angry.\u201d\n\nModesto tells the reporters that Andrew called him a night ago. Asked what they discussed, he replies: \u201cThe movie rights to his life story. I\u2019m acting as the broker, calling Hollywood from here in Manila. Andrew was very particular about the title.\u201d\n\nThe movie, he says, will be called \u201cA Name to Be Remembered.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s disturbing and nauseating, of course. But we already knew from Episode 8 that Modesto was a pretty despicable guy.\n\nThen there\u2019s a jarring shift to Milan, where Versace is honored with a ceremony akin to a state funeral. We are reminded \u2014 as we learned in Episode 2 \u2014 that his sister and de facto heir, Donatella, and his partner, Antonio D\u2019Amico, have a frosty relationship. Antonio wants to move to one of Gianni\u2019s properties, on Lake Como; Donatella says it\u2019s up to the company\u2019s board to decide. (Later, we are shown, Antonio is driven to such despair that he attempts suicide.)\n\nWatching the live broadcast of the funeral, Cunanan kneels before the television and makes a sign of the cross: a shockingly sacrilegious moment, but hardly of great emotional power since Cunanan\u2019s Catholicism hasn\u2019t really been a theme at all. A scene with Cunanan\u2019s friend Lizzie, whom we have barely heard from, is similarly lacking, as she begs him on television to turn himself in. Lizzie \u2014 a straight, older friend who asked Andrew to be the godfather to her children \u2014 has intrigued me throughout the series, but the underinvestment in her character makes her plea seem wooden.\n\nThe one time when Cunanan\u2019s eyes suggest remorse comes when he sees his fragile mother being hounded by reporters outside her California home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOtherwise, Cunanan\u2019s victims flicker on the screen like Macbeth\u2019s ghosts, and finally he is visited by one \u2014 himself, as a child of around 11. And then we have the final flashback, the \u201cRosebud\u201d moment: a scene in which we return to the San Francisco opera house where, it is imagined, Versace and Cunanan met during a 1990 production of \u201cCapriccio\u201d that Versace designed.\n\nCunanan, at that point 21, tries to kiss Versace, but the designer turns away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t find you attractive,\u201d Versace says. \u201cI invited you here because you are a very interesting young man. I want you to be inspired by this, to be nourished by tonight. If we kissed, you may doubt it.\u201d\n\nVersace, in this telling, had some useful advice for Cunanan: Success isn\u2019t about convincing people that you\u2019re special. Success is about hard work. It is sad that Cunanan didn\u2019t learn this from his deadbeat father, but it takes us nowhere in explaining the bloodthirst that followed.\n\nHomophobia, mixed-race identity, sexual abuse, the lust for fame, the worship of celebrity \u2014 each of these themes has been brought forward and then discarded.\n\nLike many a true-crime drama, this second season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d was more interested in the journey than the destination. I get it. But in the end, like Cunanan himself, the show was a beautiful, glittery, violent, extravagant mess.", "title": "\u2018The Assassination of Gianni Versace\u2019 Finale Recap: A Perfect Boy", "authors": ["Sewell Chan", "American Crime Story"]}
{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "One of the reasons we take the story backward is because we want to make the victims the heart of the piece, and they\u2019re amazing people. Andrew was targeting people who had things that he did not, whether that be love, financial success, or moral success. I feel very privileged to have read about Versace. I think he\u2019s underwritten about, underexplored, a remarkable figure.\n\nThe same with Donatella [Donatella Versace, Gianni\u2019s sister and business partner]. They were an incredible couple. Lee Miglin is an extraordinary figure. The greatness that he achieves is from tenacity: As the youngest kid of seven or eight, he arrived in Chicago knowing no one, and he worked his way up. He was the American dream. David [David Madson, a Minneapolis-based architect] was this incredible young man, full of love and looking for love. And Jeff [Jeff Trail, a gay former naval officer] struggling with Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell \u2026 I felt very lucky to tell their stories. I found them very moving and very celebratory.\n\nPhoto\n\nAndrew, on the other hand, who is the central character \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s true that when you get to their deaths, Andrew is this despicable figure. But if you go further back, it\u2019s hard not to find things about young Andrew that are impressive. He was out to people when he was \u2014 how old was he, 17? He was this Oscar Wilde-like wit who would, when confronted by homophobic bullies in school, look at them and bounce it straight back at them. I mean, I could never have done that in school. I just didn\u2019t have it. There was bravery in that. And he was a good friend to many people. He would pay for things. He would be there when they needed him.\n\nThere\u2019s that loss of potential. You feel that on the victims\u2019 side \u2014 these people were ripped from the world and they were achieving so much \u2014 and you feel it also with Andrew. Why couldn\u2019t he have converted his intellect and his consideration for other people into something great? What happened there?\n\nYou don\u2019t want to reduce an actual human being to an avatar of impersonal forces at work in the world, but Andrew is in one sense the weaponization of all the obstacles that have been placed in all those people\u2019s way by homophobia. Even at Versace\u2019s funeral, the priest performing the ceremony refuses to take his partner\u2019s hand in comfort.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYeah. All of that is real. We\u2019ve got the footage of the priest pulling his hand away from Antonio. That\u2019s not an inference \u2014 we can see it. That priest knew he was on camera, knew he was in front of thousands of people, knew he was at the funeral for this man, and still couldn\u2019t control his hatred. He still felt no need to control it. Versace was so successful he managed to overcome that, which was what was so extraordinary about him. But the whole point of Andrew\u2019s personality was that he wanted to impress people, and he\u2019s born into one of the most marginalized groups in society. That paradox \u2014 How can you impress someone when they find you disgusting intrinsically before you even open your mouth? \u2014 that\u2019s the conundrum of Andrew.\n\nI think it\u2019s tricky. The most homophobic person in this story is Andrew, by far. When he becomes this killer, he becomes a horrific homophobic bully. It\u2019s like he\u2019s soaked up everything and unleashes it on Lee and Versace. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to shame you. You\u2019ve achieved success and I\u2019m going to rip it down, both through physical destruction, but also through the act of scrutiny and having the world look down upon you.\u201d\n\nEven when he was younger and acting as a welcoming figure in the gay community, he was pushing his racial identity as an Asian American to the side. That\u2019s a stark contrast.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou know, he kind of did both. He wanted to change his name from Cunanan to DeSilva so he could say he\u2019s Portuguese rather than from the Philippines. Then he was saying he was Israeli. So yeah, he would push the racial thing to one side. But the sexual thing is interesting, if you look at the way his life tracks. He can\u2019t deal with anyone who might be critical. If he met someone who was homophobic and he wanted to be friends, he would say that he was straight, or that he had a wife and a daughter. He would play the audience. Eventually he went into an audience of these older men that he didn\u2019t have to play to, because he was instantly impressive. He was younger and witty and clever and appreciated. Once he lost that audience, he hit rock bottom.\n\nThere\u2019s this moment we never managed to get into the show which I\u2019ve always thought captured something about Andrew. He was at a party when his descent was really accelerating, and no one was paying attention to him; in fact, someone had already reprimanded him for being really annoying. He just went over to this table and set fire to a napkin. He needed people to run over and notice him.\n\nTo get to the core of a person as protean as Andrew, I suppose you have to identify the desire that makes him shape-shift in the first place.\n\nOn his own, he was very sad and very alone. There were often moments when he said that. If you caught him when he wasn\u2019t high and he wasn\u2019t pretending, he said: \u201cI\u2019m alone and I\u2019m depressed. I haven\u2019t achieved anything and I\u2019m miserable.\u201d He wasn\u2019t stupid. He could see himself in those moments.\n\nBut he could, for example, pretend to be a millionaire while going to a restaurant and pay $500 for a meal. Even if he only had $500 left, for those three hours, everyone at that table would think he was wealthy and successful. Those restaurants became a kind of theater where he could pretend to be a person that he wasn\u2019t. He lived for those moments.

The book, ignored in Lispector\u2019s time, stands out, Moser says, \u201cin a strange and difficult body of work, as perhaps her strangest and most difficult book.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLispector was always puzzled by this reputation for difficulty. \u201cWhen I write for children, I am understood, but when I write for adults I become difficult?\u201d she once protested. It\u2019s true that her books can be best understood as a kind of cracked \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d \u2014 with their gnomic wordplay, obsession with naming and inexplicable punishments. (Of course, the white rabbit in Lispector is \u201ca wounded hare losing blood and running until weakly reaching the end of blood.\u201d)\n\nBut \u201cThe Chandelier\u201d is uniquely demanding \u2014 it\u2019s baggy, claggy and contentedly glacial. We get interior monologues and barometric readings of the drifting moods of a young, unhappy woman named Virginia. Paragraph breaks are few; chapter breaks are nonexistent. Plot? On Page 4, a man\u2019s hat floating down a river snags on a rock. On Page 34, a leaf comes loose from a tall tree, hovers in the air \u201cfor enormous minutes\u201d and falls to the ground.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLispector might be describing the desultory structure of the book itself when she writes of a character: \u201cThe drinks were preventing her from letting the events connect to one another by visible paths but made them follow one another in soft, oblivious, tepidly doomed jumps.\u201d\n\nDid I mention that this novel is charming? Punishing, yes, and maniacally overwritten, but a vulnerable and moving performance \u2014 with a heart-stopping payoff.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s a literary prejudice I share, but in \u201cThe Chandelier\u201d I sense something else: not a shorter, better book lurking, but Lispector\u2019s entire body of work, in miniature, biding its time. So many of the themes, philosophical inquiries and character types that appear here will return, honed as Lispector refines her style and hardens them into the diamond-like perfection of her final books, which are narrated in jagged aphorisms \u2014 \u201canti-literature\u201d she called them.\n\nIf the pages of \u201cThe Chandelier\u201d are so thickly lacquered with description, streams of adjectives and looping repetition, it\u2019s because Lispector is flexing, coming into her power. She\u2019s playing, she\u2019s practicing. These pages are full of finger exercises, arpeggios of thought and perception.\n\nWe see the stirring of her lifelong interest in piercing the veil of language to access existence itself. She tries to evoke this by slowing down the prose in \u201cThe Chandelier,\u201d by making the reader feel its weight. In later books, she was unafraid of posing the point directly: \u201cWhat am I doing in writing you? Trying to photograph perfume,\u201d she wrote in \u201c\u00c1gua Viva.\u201d\n\nHer books stay peaceably indifferent to any imperatives of story \u2014 \u201cThe Passion According to G.H.,\u201d regarded by some as her masterpiece, features a housewife staring into a closet for 200 pages. But with her later restraint, it was her sentences that began to have plots. With their topsy-turvy structure, they contain the drama and the surprise.\n\nA few famous examples. From \u201cThe Passion According to G.H.\u201d: \u201cI finally got up from the breakfast table, that woman.\u201d From the opening of her short story \u201cTemptation\u201d: \u201cShe was sobbing. And as if the two o\u2019clock glare weren\u2019t enough, she had red hair.\u201d From the story \u201cLove\u201d: \u201cNext to her was a lady in blue, with a face.\u201d\n\nIn each, the strangeness come from a splitting \u2014 of women experiencing themselves as subject and object. This fracturing is everywhere in Lispector, and explored intensely in \u201cThe Chandelier.\u201d Virginia, in fact, is practicing looking at everything in this particular way: \u201cShe\u2019d see things separated from the places where they lay, loose in space as in an apparition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Chandelier\u201d might best be understood as a bridge in Lispector\u2019s work. But even so, it conveys a special charge, an undeniable quantity of genius \u2014 similar to what Virginia felt as she filled her hands with water, that she was \u201ccarrying in the palm of her hand a little bit of river.\u201d", "title": "\u2018The Chandelier\u2019 Offers an Early Glimpse of Clarice Lispector\u2019s Power", "authors": ["Parul Sehgal", "Books Of The Times"]}

For a current comparison, we can look at two of the better series around, \u201cThe Good Fight\u201d and \u201cThe Chi\u201d \u2014 one a high-gloss courtroom dramedy and the other a surprisingly traditional kitchen-sink neighborhood drama.

But it hedged its narrative bets: The first season balanced Diane\u2019s challenges fitting in at her new firm with a story line about a Madoff-like financial scandal that didn\u2019t have a racial dimension (and in which the principal characters were mostly white).\n\nAs Season 2 opens (it begins streaming Sunday on CBS All Access), that\u2019s still the approach \u2014 two continuing story lines (outside of the legal cases of the week) that share Diane and several other characters, but are essentially separate, in their own bubbles.

The ceremony was expected to acknowledge the appalling sexual harassment scandals that have engulfed Hollywood in recent months \u2014 and then go back to gazing lovingly at the history of moviemaking to mark Oscar\u2019s 90th birthday.\n\nOther conflicting pressures included poking fun at last year\u2019s envelope mix-up, which found \u201cLa La Land\u201d mistakenly named best picture instead of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d while taking the recognition of cinematic achievements like sound mixing and film editing supremely seriously.\n\nThe tonal tug-of-war between frothy self-celebration and serious discussion of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements made for some awkward red carpet moments. ABC veered from a raucous interview with Taraji P. Henson, who was asked about her recent action film \u201cProud Mary,\u201d to Mira Sorvino and Ms. Judd, both of whom came forward last year with allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Weinstein.\n\n\u201cI want people to know that this movement isn\u2019t stopping,\u201d Ms. Sorvino said about Time\u2019s Up, an initiative started by Hollywood women and focused on fighting systemic sexual harassment across industries. Ms. Judd, who was scheduled to present an award during the ceremony, said she was grateful that women who speak out about mistreatment are no longer being \u201cdisbelieved, minimized, shamed.\u201d\n\nA minute later, the red carpet hosts were back to squealing over the gowns chosen by stars like Whoopi Goldberg and Jennifer Garner.\n\nAn uneventful red carpet.\n\nSeveral women deeply involved with Time\u2019s Up, including Ava DuVernay and Shonda Rhimes, explained why there were no overt displays from the group on the red carpet.\n\n\u201cWe are not an awards show protest group,\u201d Ms. DuVernay said at a meeting with a small group of reporters last week. \u201cWe made a conscious choice not to do that again.\u201d\n\nViewers wondered if a celebrity would turn the questions around on Ryan Seacrest, the host of E!\u2019s red carpet coverage. He has been accused of sexual harassment, claims he and his network, backed by a third-party investigation, have vigorously denied. But no such confrontation was broadcast \u2014 though Ms. Henson did fix him with a pointed stare that was widely interpreted as such \u2014 and he did not address the accusations. His interviews with celebrities stuck to the typical fare of fashion and film, though according to US Weekly, none of the best actress nominees stopped to speak with him.

(While Roald Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole in 1911, Byrd\u2019s stated purpose, 17 years later, was to be the first to haul a plane there to fly over the pole.) The only problem is that Billy has zero experience with anything but his father\u2019s budding upholstery business in Brooklyn. Seeing his future in damask brocade and mohair, he wants nothing to do with it. Zilch. Meanwhile, his Polish grandmother has gazed into her actual crystal ball and seen Billy cavorting with Admiral Byrd.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe backdrop for Billy\u2019s bildungsroman is that moment when America, too, is finding itself amid great social upheaval: Consumer culture, mass entertainment and the Industrial Age are all on the rise, while Jazz Age journalism (in some ways not so different from our modern iteration of infotainment) is hungry for new heroes. Stowing away, then, becomes a means to celebrity as well, and is a bit of a cottage industry unto itself. And so Billy leaps into the Hudson River in a night move to get on board one of the three ships headed south. All goes well until Billy finds two other stowaways squirreled in the same front berth. Their eventual squabbling draws the attention of crew members who unceremoniously remove all three. Only when the press gets wind of it does Byrd himself, always looking for publicity and funding, seem to realize there might be a payoff in this stowaway game. Still, Billy\u2019s father eventually arrives to drag his son home.\n\nHere Shapiro\u2019s story, which is a bit slow to take hold, might have dead-ended, if not for Billy\u2019s determination. After trying to board the second ship, and getting caught again, Billy hitchhikes to Norfolk, Va., the next port of call, in time to wave in the party from the dock. Shapiro tells us the ship\u2019s cook is \u201ctickled by the city kid\u2019s pluck,\u201d and puts him to work in the kitchen. Byrd approves the move, and with a New York Times reporter on board to chronicle every hiccup of the expedition, including the doings of the Polish-American stowaway, they\u2019re off to see the penguins.\n\nThe tale that follows doesn\u2019t raise Billy above what he is, a bit player who in the end isn\u2019t chosen to winter with Byrd on the frozen continent, but he\u2019s not without his moments of heroism, and besides, to the consuming public at home, substance here matters less than the quixotic journey. For this brief moment, Shapiro\u2019s Billy is our Bachelor, our YouTube star.

Gabriel happens upon what the skeptical would deem incredible strokes of luck, first locating antibiotics next to a suicide victim\u2019s corpse and then that person\u2019s car keys. In one commendably tense set piece, Gabriel sharp-shoots a zombie off Dr. Carson with his eyes closed \u2014 a miracle, by anyone\u2019s definition. These are textbook examples of darkness in service of a greater good, and in Gabriel\u2019s estimation, they are irrefutable evidence of God\u2019s enduring love. He\u2019s too pious to gloat about being right, but when their fortunes take a turn for the better, the priest smiles and tells the doctor, \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d\n\nBut just as it looks as if they\u2019re out the woods, everything goes wrong and upends Gabriel\u2019s interpretation. Negan\u2019s troopers capture both men and return them to the stronghold from which they made their daring escape, the futility of it all compelling Carson to take his own life. Watching the only person with whom he had a genuine emotional connection die proves to be the last straw for Gabriel, who returns to Negan\u2019s compound a shell of himself. Whenever characters dare to open themselves up to another person on the show, they\u2019re punished not by their confidante, but by crueler forces in the universe itself. The writers wield irony like it\u2019s a dagger.\n\nHope is in awfully short supply on multiple fronts this week. Gabriel\u2019s fears that he has been abandoned by God form poetic echoes with a handful of scenes portending grim things to come. After having piked Gavin through the neck at the close of last week\u2019s episode, Henry seems worrisomely unfazed about what he has done, causing concern about the boy\u2019s empathy in Carol and Morgan. Having received a vicious dressing-down from Negan, the closet turncoat Eugene straightens out and returns to his Savior ways, coolly issuing insulting orders to those scuttling beneath him at their makeshift bullet factory.\n\nThe episode ends by mocking the very notion of hope in such bleak times, as Negan gives what would be a rousing and inspirational speech if it weren\u2019t for the content of his words. He strides before his army like General Patton, readying them to take back the day, but he\u2019s ranting about poisoning his enemies by dipping his signature bat in the zombies\u2019 toxic blood.\n\nElsewhere, gestures of humanity suggest that decency has not been completely extinguished from the world. After some pathetic begging from a contrite (and yet, no less detestable) Gregory, Maggie finds a bit of pity left in herself and allows him and his fellow captives a bit of food and time outside their pen. Dwight and Tara tromp through the woods, their conflicting affiliations keeping a distance between them. Even so, Dwight is being sincere when he tells Tara that he is sorry her lover Denise had to die the way she did. Such little passages of empathy are what have made the series worth getting invested in, though they\u2019re a bit too few and far between this season.", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead,\u2019 Season 8, Episode 11 Recap: Test of Faith", "authors": []}

She suggests her actions are a testament to Carl\u2019s memory, but when Rick has to physically drag her away before a herd of zombies can fully encircle them, it becomes clear that she\u2019s making the gesture for her own sake. It\u2019s an old writerly device \u2014 having a character obsess over some meaningless task only to arrive at the cold realization that nothing will bring back the dearly departed. In this instance, it\u2019s executed with less grace than usual.\n\nThat scene is not nearly as calamitous, however, as the inexplicable one in the landfill just before the opening titles. On paper, there shouldn\u2019t be anything odd about this story beat: Michonne and Rick hear trouble nearby and take cover amid the trash, simple as that. But because of some catastrophic misjudgment in postproduction, the final two minutes of the scene have been cut in a way that invokes the surreal incoherence that makes \u201cThe Room\u201d such a hoot. That\u2019s not a good thing.\n\nPerhaps the title cards were intended to quarantine the conflict between Jadis and Simon. Having been thoroughly dressed down by Negan, Simon scrapes up a bit of his masculinity by belittling Jadis and her Scavengers, going so far as to shoot her followers one by one, right in front of her. The show\u2019s callous streak returns stronger than ever in this massacre, which culminates in a hail of bullets that the audience doesn\u2019t see.\n\nAfter Simon shoots the first few Scavengers who look at him funny, we hear him open fire \u2014 but the scene has already moved on. That last volley lasts all of two seconds and plays out offscreen, with only the rat-a-tat sound effect making viewers aware of the widespread carnage. Depicting (or, rather, not depicting) violence in such detached terms certainly falls in line with Savior brutality, but it also makes for alienating television.\n\nNegan and his crew may be sadists, but he isn\u2019t totally unaffected by Carl\u2019s death. He spends the first half of this episode reading the Riot Act to Simon in a transparent attempt to reassert his fading authority. (While ostensibly this season\u2019s primary villain, Negan has spent most of his screen time sidelined.) When Rick radios him in the final minutes of the episode, however, Negan expresses true remorse \u2014 the quality Simon cruelly punished Jadis for not possessing a few scenes earlier. Intentional softness is a rare quantity in this post-apocalyptic war zone, and Negan reveals a kinder and more genuine side of himself as he speaks about the future he had planned for Carl. The happy, gardening Negan we glimpsed in last week\u2019s flash-forward shows himself, however fleetingly.", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Season 8, Episode 10 Recap: Talking Trash", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-18 00:00:00", "text": "The bat is returned to her rightful owner by the conclusion of the episode, but not before something else comes to pass that has never happened on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d: Negan offers Rick leniency. Just when it looked as if the Saviors had long passed the point of reconciliation with the Hilltopper coalition, Negan offers to let Rick live freely as part of his clan. Negan being a scoundrel, he makes it clear that Rick would have a life of custodial work, but walking his staunch stance back from the death penalty is a significant shift. That change may have been spurred by his separation from Lucille, but it still signals that both Rick and Negan are capable of seeing a light at the end of this tunnel. (The warm, soft-focus light of the paradisiacal flash-forwards, perhaps?)\n\nWhether he\u2019s ready or not, Negan is headed for more upheaval on his home front. The tension between him and Simon will soon snap, as each man comes to the individual realization that they\u2019ve reached an impasse. During their altercation, an errant word from Rick alerts Negan to that fact that Simon laid waste to the Scavengers, in direct defiance of the orders Negan had issued him. Elsewhere, Simon tentatively makes his case for mutiny to Dwight, easing his potential co-conspirator into antipathy against Negan. (The agreeably sketchy Steven Ogg makes a meal out of the lines: \u201cLet\u2019s get candid. Let\u2019s get weird.\u201d)\n\nNot that it takes much easing: Dwight is all too eager to take Negan down a peg. Things don\u2019t look so positive for Negan at the conclusion of this week\u2019s episode, as Jadis holds him at gunpoint in a car with an unknown destination. But when he makes his inevitable return, there will be hell to pay.\n\nEveryone wants the same thing \u2014 an end to the hardship \u2014 but the warring factions are unbudging in their positions on how best to achieve that. Still, as time marches onward, as the list of lost lives continues to lengthen, as everyone grows more fatigued and hungry and fed up, reconciliation becomes a little more appealing. In a moment of desperation, Negan immediately compromised and offered Rick his life. It\u2019s only a matter of time until the natural downward course brings the other characters to that breaking point, where the only objective is to establish a cease-fire.\n\nFor now, however, violence can be a sufficient answer to any nagging problems. Jadis has never been one to talk out her problems, and when she comes to blows with Negan, the chances seem slim that both parties will emerge alive. The lingering question is just how bad life has to get before the territorial attitudes and grudges are dwarfed by some darker alternative. As Negan reminds Rick, Carl is barely cold in the ground. In a rare moment of actorly subtlety, Andrew Lincoln flashes a stunned, wounded look, as if wondering what could possibly be worth all this loss.", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Season 8, Episode 12: Barbed Affection", "authors": []}

He\u2019s still stunned by his son\u2019s sacrifice, unable to speak about Carl when Siddiq approaches him with a patient ear. It\u2019s been so long since the show treated a character\u2019s death with such gravity, that seeing Rick still hurting four episodes later is a welcome reprieve from the usual depravity-of-the-week showcase. The circumstances surrounding Carl and Henry\u2019s respective demises may differ, but speaking generally, the same thing happened to both of them. They are ancillary losses, caught up in the brutal riptide of combat.\n\nThis episode couldn\u2019t have ended anywhere but a graveyard, and sure enough, Carol and Rick gaze out over rows and rows of makeshift headstones in this week\u2019s final moments. Alongside them stands Maggie, who can do nothing but lament \u201cthe cost,\u201d a universal umbrella term for everything precious they\u2019ve lost. (Shades of Tony Soprano grumbling, \u201cHow could this happen?\u201d to an absent God as he sits by his comatose nephew.) Maggie wrestles with self-doubt even as she continues to lust for vengeance against Negan, afraid that staying the course may imperil more innocent lives and wondering how many more they can lose while still considering this war worth fighting.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not slowing down any time soon. Having last been seen riding shotgun with a very angry Jadis, Negan is out of sight in this episode, and hardly out of mind. Simon\u2019s ill-advised power grab among the Saviors has been built entirely around the shaky notion that everything he wants also happens to be what Negan would have wanted. Simon is a persuasive enough public speaker that this manipulation works, for the most part \u2014 though maybe it\u2019s just that commanding handlebar mustache \u2014 but that will fall apart in undoubtedly violent fashion once Negan returns.\n\nSimon cannot be entirely unaware of this, judging by the haste with which he accelerates the Savior counteroffensive. He knows enough to wield the power while he has it, and he won\u2019t let go of it without leaving a few claw marks. The show\u2019s \u201call out war\u201d arc can\u2019t last forever, and discord among the Saviors could be the resolution Rick\u2019s coalition (and the writing staff) have been looking for.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it ends,\u201d muses Carol in the episode\u2019s most telling moment. Her words can expand to cover the entire show, from the war raging around them to the endless cycle of Pyrrhic victories and crushing defeats that has given the show\u2019s entire run an orderly shape. This episode makes the heartening suggestion that she might not be correct. Whether it\u2019s enemy infighting or a surge of energy on the home front, something has to end all the bloodshed soon. Scanning their private cemetery as if it were a D.I.Y. Arlington, they realize that it has to.

I didn\u2019t get access to real comic books until around the time Milestone, a comic publishing imprint that showcased African-American superheroes, came out.

I remember thinking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d It was kind of like a reflection of what someone else thinks that an African-American person is, which is different from actually having more of an authentic representation.

Bannon, the president\u2019s onetime chief strategist.\n\nRecently, people close to Mr. Trump say that he has begun to feel more confident that he understands the job of president.

I was at one recently that served a single piece of crostini that, when we tried to cut it, cracked into bits and flew off the plate. At another place, we were two people, and they served three croquettes. So we each had one, then tried to split the third, only to have it fall apart and ooze all its cheese filling onto the plate. How hard would it have been to serve four croquettes? ELIZABETH, NEW YORK\n\nA distinction should be made between a communal meal, where small plates are drawn from large platters, and are shared \u201cfamily style,\u201d and the format where a dish you order specifically is passed around randomly to all.

Meanwhile, George \u2014 Getty\u2019s oldest son by his first wife and the heir apparent to Getty Oil \u2014 seems to be having a psychotic break from what we later learn is a cocktail of booze, amphetamines and \u201cvarious barbiturates,\u201d and he locks himself in a small garage. Women peer in, pounding at the windows, begging George to let them in.\n\nGeorge, crazed, sets his sights on the fork and, after a brief pause, thrusts it into his stomach. There\u2019s an audible puncture. The women, previously screaming, fall silent in horror. They watched the whole thing.\n\nIf this were a run-of-the-mill family, a run-of-the-mill father would be devastated. But Getty appears not to be. We meet him the next morning at his manor outside London (a practical location for doing business all around the world), where his hired security specialist, James Fletcher (Brendan Fraser), informs Getty that his son\u2019s death was self-inflicted: And if the barbecue fork hadn\u2019t killed him, he adds, the drugs surely would have.\n\nGetty, standing by a spit bowl held by his butler, toothpaste flying from his mouth, barks back, \u201cI will not have suicide!\u201d He shows no sadness over losing a son, but he is irate at the possibility of bringing shame to the family name. In this telling (which FX notes is \u201cinspired by actual events\u201d), Getty is not what you would call a happy man.\n\nBut it would be too easy to call him a bad one. One of the most promising aspects of this series is the attempt one assumes it will make to understand the psychology of this outwardly unfeeling billionaire. Why would the man once called the wealthiest private citizen in the world show no visible sadness at the death of a son? Or refuse to pay a ransom he can easily afford? Why would he install a pay phone at his mansion just to stop guests from freeloading long-distance calls?\n\nOn the day of George\u2019s funeral, he delivers a Shakespearean monologue that starts to gets at the heart of it. One of his mistresses walks into a room where Getty sits alone, lamenting his \u201cfeckless progeny.\u201d (The writing here by Simon Beaufoy gets particularly rich.)

He paid Getty $100 each month to live and buy oil leases for cheap: If oil sprung, Getty profited 30 percent and his dad got the rest. Not a deal exactly. But by age 23, Getty had made his first million. And when his dad died, he inherited only a fraction of his father\u2019s fortune \u2014 his father was said to disapprove of Getty\u2019s lifestyle and failed marriages (ultimately, there were five, harem not included).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow a father himself, J. Paul Getty disapproves of his own sons, but for slightly different reasons: He was given comparatively little from his father, but he succeeded; Getty\u2019s sons were given opportunities but failed. What seems to matter most is that both his father and his sons disrespected Getty the tycoon. None have given him the appreciation that likely would have validated \u2014 and maybe softened \u2014 Getty the man.\n\nAnd so, with his surviving sons mentally axed from the future of the business, Getty needs a business heir to save the family name. Enter the young John Paul Getty III, direct from Rome, in bell bottoms, a T-shirt and long, disheveled curls on the day of George\u2019s funeral. Getty is turned off by the sight of Paul, but then he catches wind of Paul\u2019s knowledge of art history; art collecting is Getty\u2019s great tax-deductible weakness. The clouds part. Getty sees an answer to the family failings.\n\nOne quick helicopter ride to a deepwater oil rig later, and Getty is explaining the mechanics of the family business to his grandson as ocean spray wets their faces. Paul, who has really showed up to ask for money, sees a problem: The system is a closed loop of investments. \u201cThere\u2019s no drawing from the trust?\u201d he asks Getty. \u201cUgh, God, I can always tell when one of my brood wants money,\u201d Getty says. He\u2019s seen this before.\n\nGetty asks how much Paul needs. Paul says $6,000. Getty wants to know if any of the trouble came from drugs; Paul denies it. \u201cWomen?\u201d Paul nods. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a great Getty weakness.\u201d It\u2019s a bonding moment, and one of the funnier in the episode. Getty\u2019s momentary doubt has been restored through their shared interest in sex.\n\nIn the end, though, Getty is a businessman, and he proposes a deal. He will give Paul his $6,000, and the grandson will work an oil rig for six months. \u201cCash up front?\u201d Paul asks, his sights set solely on getting out of England to sort out some unknown trouble he and his girlfriend are in back in Rome. \u201cNever,\u201d says his grandfather, \u201cbut I\u2019ll write you a check.\u201d Soon he has announced to the family at dinner that Paul \u2014 and not Paul\u2019s father \u2014 is being groomed to take over the business.\n\nThis is as close as Paul will get to being in his grandfather\u2019s good graces. Paul\u2019s father, in a rage at being skipped over, shows Getty a magazine spread that Paul appears in, nude, partying and making sport of the family name. This turns out to be a trespass Getty cannot abide \u2014 another Getty damaging his legacy. His brief hopes for the future have been dashed.\n\nWith that, Getty buys Paul a plane ticket back to Rome, sans check, just before he welcomes his mistress into his study for some pharmacologically enhanced sex. Perhaps it\u2019s the closest thing to feeling love that he can get.\n\nSpare Change:\n\n\u2022 \u201cTrust\u201d puts a notable twist on the actual kidnapping. In the final moments of this episode we see the Italian gangsters approach Paul, and they hand him a sack. Paul places it over his own head, playing into the theory that he faked the whole thing to extract money from his grandfather. Next week, we\u2019ll see in whom Getty places his trust.\n\n\u2022 The use of \u201cMoney\u201d in the opening scene is a little hokey, but the song came out the same year as the kidnapping \u2014 it\u2019s not a stretch to believe that the real Pink Floyd might have played a Getty pool party. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who in the live band was supposed to be making the money-changing sound effects that open the song.

They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump\u2019s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be a very short distance between the president\u2019s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,\u201d Mr. Bash said. \u201cI think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.\u201d\n\nSome experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.\n\nHe said the former officials\u2019 willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cI would imagine from Bob Mueller\u2019s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,\u201d Mr. German said. \u201cThe credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.\u201d", "title": "\u2018You Will Not Destroy America\u2019: A Trump Battle Is No Longer One-Sided", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Ortega, 55, is charged with first-degree murder and second-degree murder, and her trial, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is expected to last several weeks. Ms. Ortega, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, faces life in prison if convicted; if acquitted on an insanity defense, she could be committed to a psychiatric facility.\n\nIn opening statements on Thursday, prosecutors said that Ms. Ortega resented Ms. Krim and that the children were killed as a calculated act of spite against her.\n\nOn Thursday, in her first day of testimony, Ms. Krim recounted how she had discovered the horrific scene in the family\u2019s apartment on West 75th Street after learning that Lulu had never made it to dance class. She found her children stacked in a bathtub with their eyes open and blood all over their bodies, then watched in horror with her 3-year-old daughter, Nessie, as Ms. Ortega plunged a knife into her own neck.\n\nOn Friday, Thomas Brown, a security guard who was working in the Krims\u2019 apartment building, said that Ms. Ortega had never spoken to him before the day she killed the children.\n\nThat day, as he was preparing for his shift to end at 4 p.m., she approached his desk in the lobby and asked in broken English whether Ms. Krim was home. He told her that he had just seen Ms. Krim leave with Nessie. Ms. Ortega then went to the elevator with Lulu and Leo in tow, and he never saw them again.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Glenn Looby, who had replaced Mr. Thomas, was in the lobby when she called from a landing outside the family\u2019s apartment, asking if he had seen her children. When he said he had not, she went back up to the apartment. A few minutes later, he said, she came out screaming about her children being murdered and he called 9-1-1.\n\nOver the two and a half years that Ms. Ortega worked for the family, Ms. Krim said on Friday, there were other times when she thought Ms. Ortega was acting oddly. She had considered firing the nanny, but ultimately decided against it.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing to fire her over,\u201d she said. \u201cShe was on time every day. She was interacting with the kids. She was doing most of her job.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the cross-examination had concluded, Stuart Silberg, an assistant district attorney, asked Ms. Krim if she thought she had missed any warning signs. Ms. Krim asked for a break.\n\nShe returned, and finished her testimony describing how Ms. Ortega had reacted to a pregnancy that ended in miscarriage. When Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg objected to Ms. Krim\u2019s testimony about the miscarriage, Ms. Krim shouted, \u201cLet me finish telling my story!\u201d Ms. Ortega, she said, had been jubilant when told the Krims were expecting a fourth child. But when she was told of the miscarriage months later, she showed no sympathy.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d Ms. Krim said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give me a hug. She gave me no emotion at all. She actually looked mad at me.\u201d\n\nAs Ms. Krim spoke, Ms. Ortega, sitting a few feet away, looked down at her lap and shook her head.\n\nSoon, Ms. Krim told Mr. Silberg that she had enough. As she left the witness stand, escorted by court officers, she raged at Ms. Ortega.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re evil!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re evil! And you like this. You\u2019re getting pleasure.\u201d\n\nJustice Gregory Carro reminded jurors that the mother\u2019s outburst was not evidence.", "title": "\u2018You\u2019re Evil!\u2019: Mother Rages at Nanny During Murder Trial", "authors": ["Ashley Southall"]}
