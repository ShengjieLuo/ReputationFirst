We need all the guidance we can get.\u201d\n\nThe dispute over branding gives a glimpse of how much has changed since ad hoc committees of volunteers put together the marches in the weeks after President Trump\u2019s election.\n\nThe marches grew out of a Facebook post by a woman in Hawaii who floated the idea, attracting widespread interest. A core group of organizers in New York City planned the march on Washington, while hundreds of other women organized similar marches in their own communities.\n\nThe organizers of the march in Washington made a point of picking leaders from communities who have historically been ignored by mainstream feminist groups. Of the four national co-chairwomen of the Washington march, three were minorities. But the group\u2019s leadership had very little geographic diversity. Nearly all of the board members of Women\u2019s March Inc. are from New York City.\n\nAfter the march, Women\u2019s March Inc. used its powerful platform to advance social justice causes, urging marchers to hold conversations about racial injustice, protest the deportation of undocumented immigrants, attend vigils for Syria and participate in a national strike called A Day Without Women. Women\u2019s March Inc. activists said they saw social justice protests as crucial to forming effective and diverse coalitions.\n\nYet many of their protests failed to catch on in red states.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing is great, but it\u2019s difficult to tap into here,\u201d said Kelly Smith, a librarian from Berea, Ky., who organized buses from Kentucky to Washington for the march last year.

This suggests that these online recovery courses often give students an easy passing grade without teaching them very much.\n\nConsider a study conducted in the Chicago high schools. Students who had failed algebra were randomly assigned either to online or to face-to-face recovery courses. The results were clear: Students in the online algebra courses learned much less than those who worked with a teacher in a classroom.\n\nOnline courses have many real benefits, of course. They can help high achievers in need of more advanced coursework than their districts provide through other means. This is especially true in small, rural districts that offer few specialized, traditional courses for students working ahead of their grades.\n\nA study in Maine and Vermont examined the effect of online courses on eighth graders with strong math skills in schools that didn\u2019t offer face-to-face algebra classes. Students were randomly assigned either to online algebra or to the less challenging, standard math offered in traditional classes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The online algebra students did substantially better than their counterparts in standard classrooms. They were also twice as likely to complete advanced math later in high school.\n\nIn colleges, especially in nonselective and for-profit schools, online education has expanded rapidly, too, with similar effects. These schools disproportionately enroll low-income students who are often the first in their families to attend college. Such students tend to drop out of college at very high rates. Students with weak preparation don\u2019t fare well in online college classes, as recent research by professors at Harvard and Stanford shows.\n\nThese scholars examined the performance of hundreds of thousands of students at DeVry University, a large for-profit college with sites across the country. DeVry offers online and face-to-face versions of all its courses, using the same textbooks, assessments, assignments and lecture materials in each format. Even though the courses are seemingly identical, the students who enroll online do substantially worse.\n\nThe effects are lasting, with online students more likely to drop out of college altogether. Hardest hit are those who entered the online class with low grades. Work by researchers in many other colleges concurs with the DeVry findings: The weakest students are hurt most by the online format.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor those with strong academic skills, by contrast, online learning can open up amazing opportunities.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a set of free, online courses in the economics of developing countries. Students who perform well in these classes can apply for a face-to-face master\u2019s program in economics at M.I.T. In fact, the online courses are the sole route into this special degree program. With online credit, students need to spend only one semester in Cambridge to graduate.\n\nThe M.I.T. approach reverses the high school model in which students who fail in a face-to-face class are shifted into a more challenging online format. In M.I.T.\u2019s program, students must first demonstrate that they can tough it out in an online class. Only then are they admitted to a rigorous, face-to-face master\u2019s program.\n\nOnline education is still in its youth. Many approaches are possible, and some may ultimately benefit students with deep and diverse needs. As of now, however, the evidence is clear.

In the meantime I\u2019ll leave you to read about it (and other topics) and mull it over at your leisure. But anyone who has further thoughts on the subject, please let me know. And have a good weekend.\n\nYour Style Questions, Answered\n\nEvery week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader\u2019s fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter. Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: I am ALWAYS cold and so hate wearing dresses. That said, if I must wear a dress for a special occasion, how to cover my legs? Nude hosiery feels too dated. Black hose with a black dress feels a bit too (way too) grandmotherly. Although I am a woman of grandmotherly age. \u2014 Sherron, Pennsylvania\n\nA: I am also always cold, so I know what you mean. And though I am not of grandmotherly age, I am of mother-of-teenagers age. So I have a few thoughts.\n\nThe resurgence of long skirts is key here, especially if you opt for one in velvet, wool, knit or tweed, which looks elegant but feels as though you are wearing a blanket on your legs. Modcloth has a nice royal-blue velvet style, Elizabeth & James has a ribbed knit and Lauren Ralph Lauren has a cashmere Fair Isle knit that looks both chic and comfy. Personally, this is my favorite solution, especially with ankle boots, which also keep your feet warm. Then there\u2019s the tuxedo, an always-appropriate solution to the I-don\u2019t-want-to-wear-a-dress-to-a-party problem. Think: what would Charlotte Rampling wear? Or opt for a derivation of the same idea, and pair sparkly pants, either beaded or in metallic brocade (try Tory Burch or H&M), with a simple cashmere sweater.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat said, I also think you are selling black tights short, though I agree about the nudes. A thick, matte tight with black shoes and a black dress doesn\u2019t necessarily make you look grandmotherly, at least if the shoes are spiky enough. And by spiky, I don\u2019t mean high; I just mean non-nurselike. Check out Anna Wintour, who often wears dark tights with dresses when the temperatures drop. And who, by the way, recently became a grandmother too. \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "title": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"]}

Questions are edited and condensed.\n\nQ: My son is in college in Maine, and the temperature is frequently below zero. It seems like every woman is swathed in an ankle-length black puffer coat from November to March, so why do men have so few choices in outerwear that is knee length or longer? Have you come across any knee-length down coats for men? \u2014 Amy, Pelham, N.Y.\n\nA: It\u2019s true: Though dress coats hit at the knee and great coats (especially those that are military-inspired in heavy wool) can be even longer, in general men got the short end of the stick in the coat-length sweepstakes. It\u2019s pretty clear this is one of those sexist fashion things \u2014 a long coat is somehow seen as not manly, unless maybe you live in Russia and it is fur. Because real men\u2026have weatherproof legs? Or something.\n\nGiven that all sorts of gender rules are loosening up when it comes to clothing these days, however, a warmer time may be on the horizon. In the meantime, however, I asked Matthew Schneier, our deputy fashion critic (currently in Milan at the shows) for his advice. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cWhere men\u2019s outerwear is concerned, even the hardiest coats seem to come only to somewhere above the knee. To test the theory, I looked around at a range of brands known for their tough winter-wear (the North Face, Canada Goose, Moncler, Duvetica, Stone Island) and struck out at every one. Even L.L. Bean (which knows something about Maine winters, being headquartered there!) didn\u2019t offer much that dropped below the waist. I suspect it\u2019s that floor-length outerwear is pretty unwieldy, especially where there\u2019s snow and slush on the ground, and many men (at the expense of their body temperatures) chafe at the idea of something long enough to be mistaken for women\u2019s wear.\n\nMy solution, for what it\u2019s worth, is to pile on the underlayers. Thermal-wear has come a long way since the days of heavy waffle weaves in one color (though I love those, too). I swear by Uniqlo\u2019s Heattech line, which I wear, tops and bottoms, basically all winter. They\u2019re thinner, softer and warmer than their predecessors, cheaper by far than a new coat, and they disappear under clothes. Friends report that there was a run on them at the New York Uniqlo stores last week when the weather was wretched here. I wouldn\u2019t know; I order mine, as can you, online.\u201d \u2014 VANESSA FRIEDMAN", "title": "Open Thread: This Week in Style News", "authors": []}

The day-to-day management of personalities and factions was a struggle \u2014 \u201ca war, almost,\u201d he has said \u2014 and, when he was given the opportunity to become artist in residence at American Ballet Theater in New York, he left, seemingly without regret.\n\n\u201cAt first it was so weird to be back,\u201d Mr. Ratmansky said on a rainy November afternoon, as he rushed through the Bolshoi\u2019s labyrinthine corridors, \u201cbut since then, I\u2019ve just been with the dancers, working.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the studio with Mr. Ratmansky, the dancers appeared eager to try a different approach to their characters and to master his tricky, fast-moving phrases. \u201cHe is a maximalist!\u201d Makhar Vaziev, the Bolshoi\u2019s current director, said. \u201cFor one movement, he can give 10 recommendations.\u201d Mr. Ratmansky pushed the dancers to be swifter, more detailed, more physical.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait for the music, just go\u201d Mr. Ratmansky instructed Ekaterina Krysanova, a highly dramatic ballerina who, along with the limpid Vladislav Lantratov, danced on opening night. (They will also play the leads in the live broadcast.) Mr. Ratmansky wanted them to be almost ahead of the music, to give an impression of spontaneity and freshness.\n\nDespite his demands, he was soft-spoken, even formal, an approach that had not served him well when he was director, the critic Ms. Gouchmazova recalled. Back then, \u201che was so tactful in rehearsals that everybody decided he wasn\u2019t strong enough to be at the top.\u201d But now, as a visiting choreographer, the calm, focused atmosphere seems to suit everyone just fine. The company is a different place than it was 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cAll these people, either I hired them, or they were in the corps when I was director,\u201d Mr. Ratmansky said. \u201cI gave them their first roles, and we worked together many times. So now there is no resistance, nothing negative.\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite his history with the Bolshoi, Mr. Ratmanksy had been away for seven years. It was Mr. Vaziev, hired two years after the acid attack, who brought Mr. Ratmansky back into the fold, commissioning him to stage his \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d for the company. The two have a long history \u2014 in the late 1990s, when Mr. Vaziev was the director of the Mariinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, he was one of the first to commission a large work from Mr. Ratmansky.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Vaziev has made no secret of his desire to freshen up the repertory. Some in Russia see this new \u201cRomeo\u201d as the first salvo in a larger strategy of phasing out Mr. Grigorovich\u2019s ballets.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget in which time period he worked in this theater,\u201d Mr. Vaziev said of Mr. Grigorovich. \u201cIt was difficult, the political ideology was very dominant. As to his work as a choreographer, some I like very much, some less, which is normal. He did what he could.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Ratmansky, he may be on the cusp of a comeback at the Bolshoi, where some of his older ballets, like \u201cThe Bright Stream,\u201d are still popular. \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d was well received in November, with the leading Moscow critic, Tatyana Kuznetsova, describing the production in the daily Kommersant as \u201cstrikingly musical and sensitive to psychological details.\u201d\n\nThe Bolshoi is, after all, the place that put him on the international map as a choreographer. \u201cI would dream to do something with him every year,\u201d Mr. Vaziev said (and not for the first time). For now, he and Mr. Ratmansky are in talks about a possible premiere for the fall of 2019.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "We\u2019ve been here before, and with similar destructive effect. In 1987, four years after it was determined that H.I.V. could be spread only through sexual or blood-to-blood exposure, there were still doctors and dentists who refused to see H.I.V./AIDS patients out of lingering and irrational fears about its contagion. Even among those unlucky few who experienced needlestick injuries when treating H.I.V.-positive patients, fewer than 1 out of 300 contracted the virus (the number is even lower now).\n\nUnlike in epidemics of the past, we have a commanding medical understanding of the nature of today\u2019s culprit. In contrast to tuberculosis, cancer and AIDS \u2014 in which, as Susan Sontag described in \u201cIllness as Metaphor\u201d (1978) and \u201cAIDS and Its Metaphors\u201d (1989), the medical mystery of these entities contributed to public fears about contracting them \u2014 there should be no need to demythologize the opioid epidemic since we created these powerful synthetic opioids ourselves. And yet, paradoxically, the opioid crisis has perhaps unveiled a diametrical societal inclination: to actively mythologize a well-understood entity, metamorphosing it into a frightful and enigmatic one, bestowing contagion where none exists.\n\nFentanyl and carfentanil are synthetic opioids. They are many times stronger than morphine and have a well-established safety record in medical and veterinary use. When abused they can kill. These substances are dangerous in high quantities when injected or ingested by mouth or vigorous sniffing. But clinical toxicity (let alone a little high) from fleetingly touching even the purest powder forms of these compounds is simply impossible. After all, as our colleague Andrew Stolbach of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine has noted, if users could get their fix by touching fentanyl, they wouldn\u2019t bother injecting it.\n\nWhile bogeymanism may effectively serve to discourage some people from abusing these substances in the first place, it would be horrible if it were to dissuade emergency medical workers, medical professionals and civilians from performing noble and lifesaving acts, such as delivering lifesaving doses of naloxone. The tragedy is that it\u2019s already occurring. In some parts of the country, emergency medical workers aren\u2019t being permitted to carry naloxone. Recent fentanyl overdose scenes have crossed an invisible line into absurdity, in some instances resembling chemical war zones, Hazmat suits and all, where gloves and maybe a mouth cover would have sufficed. Policies like the one enacted by courthouses here will only reinforce what appears to be an inclination by at least some local authorities toward alarmist pageantry.\n\nThere are some encouraging signs that reason may yet prevail. Last summer, the two top expert bodies in the nation \u2014 the American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology \u2014 published a position statement debunking the tales that were reported in the press, noting in particular that none of the reported cases have appeared to resemble the constellation of symptoms we see and treat daily in cases of known opioid overdose. We are also heartened to see that local expert groups and even the White House have weighed in on the side of science in attempts to reassure emergency medical workers that they may continue to provide safe and desperately needed care.", "title": "Opinion | Opioid Hysteria Comes to Massachusetts Courts", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "In the imagination of some Democrats, Ms. Winfrey might offer an easy way out of those problems. She inspires crucial groups for the party \u2014 women and African-Americans \u2014 and alienates few. She has cast herself in American culture as an avatar of optimism, not defined in ideological terms. Having made a career out of preaching the values of empowerment and inclusion, she represents in some ways a natural counterpoint to Mr. Trump\u2019s proud pugilism. Senior Democrats in Washington said on Monday they had received no signal from Ms. Winfrey that she hoped to seek the White House.\n\nDavid Axelrod, the former chief strategist for Barack Obama, said Ms. Winfrey was a figure of unique political potential, with \u201ca boundless capacity for empathy and a preternatural ability to communicate powerfully and authentically \u2014 as we saw at the Golden Globes.\u201d\n\nMr. Axelrod questioned, however, whether Ms. Winfrey would be the right fit for 2020: \u201cWould she want to submit herself to the unforgiving, relentless and sometimes absurd process of running for president?\u201d he wondered, adding: \u201cWill there be hunger in 2020 for someone with some experience in government, after Trump?\u201d\n\nSome Democrats expressed skepticism and even frustration about the swirl of fascination with Ms. Winfrey, arguing that the party was jumping the gun with fevered speculation about 2020. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a young liberal in the chamber, wrote tersely on Twitter: \u201cHey. Let\u2019s focus on winning in 2018. Thanks.\u201d\n\nRebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party\u2019s progressive wing, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to rush toward a magnetic personality rather than hashing out a compelling agenda for the midterm elections and beyond.\n\n\u201cBeating Trump isn\u2019t just about finding the right candidate \u2014 we have to show what we stand for,\u201d Ms. Katz said. \u201cOther than \u2018we all get a car,\u2019 what will an Oprah presidency look like?\u201d she added, referring to when Ms. Winfrey famously gave a car to every audience member at her show.\n\nMs. Winfrey\u2019s sudden prominence in the nation\u2019s political imagination speaks, in some respects, to the merging of politics and entertainment in the American mind. She has occupied a singular role in the television industry, parlaying roles as a local news anchor and a talk-show host in Chicago into a media empire that includes her own cable network and a fortune estimated at close to $3 billion. Gallup polling regularly finds Ms. Winfrey among the country\u2019s most admired women, alongside Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, suggested \u2014 with a dose of skepticism \u2014 that Ms. Winfrey was the kind of political outsider Democrats might embrace.\n\nAlluding to Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of experience, Ms. Pelosi tartly told a small group of reporters that Ms. Winfrey had other qualities going for her: \u201cOprah has read books. She knows how to identify talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going into a place where they are devaluing experience in terms of substance and legislative acumen and stuff like that,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cyou might as well have somebody who knows what they don\u2019t know and would get the best possible people there.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Winfrey\u2019s cable channel, OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc., initially struggled to gain traction and last year earned an average of 462,000 prime time viewers daily. In December, Discovery said it would take majority control of OWN, purchasing 24.5 percent of the channel for $70 million from Ms. Winfrey\u2019s company, Harpo.\n\nMs. Winfrey\u2019s most potent appeal, industry analysts say, is among somewhat older consumers \u2014 or perhaps, voters \u2014 with women over 55 as her strongest cohort. She is especially popular among African-American women and white suburban women, two groups Democrats will rely on in the 2018 and 2020 elections.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the White House had responded to the threat of Oprah in 2020. \u201cWe welcome the challenge,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a spokesman for the president, \u201cwhether it be Oprah Winfrey or anybody else.\u201d\n\nBut Ms. Winfrey has approached politics cautiously over the years, engaging highly selectively. In 2007, she intervened for Mr. Obama, holding rallies for him and hailing him as \u201cthe one.\u201d And in 2013, she hosted a fund-raising event for Cory Booker, in his first bid for Senate in New Jersey.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Ms. Winfrey endorsed Mrs. Clinton but never ventured onto the campaign trail. Though Ms. Winfrey and her staff discussed a possible appearance with the Clinton campaign, none was ever scheduled. Ms. Winfrey\u2019s aides cited her focus on righting her television network as the reason for her difficult schedule.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMinyon Moore, a Clinton adviser who communicated with the Winfrey team, said the campaign had been \u201cdelighted\u201d to have Ms. Winfrey\u2019s endorsement. Should Ms. Winfrey seek to assemble a campaign team for 2020, Ms. Moore said, \u201cI suspect she would have her pick.\u201d\n\nLess certain is whether Ms. Winfrey could navigate the ideological pitfalls of a presidential campaign and give voice not just to broad themes, but actual policy prescriptions. While Ms. Winfrey has aligned herself generally with Democrats like Mr. Obama, her views on a range of issues from financial regulation to drone warfare are opaque. She drew criticism from the left last year after saying in an interview that she felt hopeful and believed Mr. Trump had been \u201chumbled\u201d after meeting with Mr. Obama during the presidential transition.\n\nAlixandria Lapp, a strategist helping lead Democrats\u2019 effort to retake the House, said the profile of a media mogul outsider would be an uncomfortable match for the party.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely that Democrats will ever nominate our own version of Donald Trump \u2014 a celebrity with no government experience \u2014 because our party tends to respect government and governing experience,\u201d Ms. Lapp said.\n\nMs. Winfrey has recently taken on political topics as a special correspondent for CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d including a segment on the country\u2019s political divisions and another on the use of solitary confinement in prisons.\n\nBut even to close friends and admirers, the prospect of an Oprah 2020 race appeared far-fetched or impossible as recently as last year. After Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, when the traditional barriers to entry into presidential politics appeared to melt away, Ms. Winfrey\u2019s associates dismissed the idea.\n\nA reporter who last March contacted Ms. Winfrey\u2019s best friend, Gayle King of CBS News, got an emphatic reaction to the 2020 question.\n\n\u201cNOT A CHANCE!!!!!\u201d Ms. King replied at the time, adding: \u201cIn caps for a reason.\u201d", "title": "Oprah 2020?

The words of motivational speakers, religious leaders and authors including Deepak Chopra and Elizabeth Gilbert were excerpted. Mr. Simmons was featured in passages describing the impact meditation has had on his life, as well as musing on the soul, abundance and wealth; future editions of the book, available in stores starting in February, will not contain those segments, Marlena Bittner, a spokeswoman for the publisher, Flatiron Books, said.\n\nThe publisher made the announcement in response to an inquiry from The New York Times. Ms. Bittner said the decision to remove the pages was made jointly by Ms. Winfrey and the publisher, but declined to say when they made that choice. Ms. Winfrey has lately been a vocal advocate of the #MeToo movement, making a fiery speech promoting Time\u2019s Up, the Hollywood initiative to combat sexual harassment and discrimination, at the Golden Globes in early January.

The Idea Makes Democrats Giddy and Skeptical\u201d (front page, Jan. 9):\n\nThe conversation around what for some is the tantalizing prospect of an Oprah Winfrey presidential run in 2020 conforms to a familiar pattern in presidential politics.\n\nOften we elect presidents who are very different from their immediate predecessors by their politics and temperament. Examples are Barack Obama after George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter after Richard Nixon/Gerald Ford.\n\nIt would be hard to imagine two more dissimilar candidates in 2020 than Ms. Winfrey and Donald Trump. It would not be surprising if the country turns to someone like Ms. Winfrey next time. She certainly would impart the kind of values and compassion a majority of Americans are now missing.\n\nBut in an effort to achieve radical change and notwithstanding the wide and refreshing appeal Ms. Winfrey or someone like her may have, we should not lose sight of the broad qualifications a president must bring to the office. We must get it right next time.", "title": "Opinion | Oprah, Celebrity and the Presidency", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Indeed, the magical thinking fueling the idea of Oprah in 2020 is a worrisome sign about the state of the Democratic Party. That Ms. Winfrey could probably beat those considered likely front-runners \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand \u2014 is testament to how demoralized and devoid of fresh political talent the post-Obama party has become.\n\nIn a way, the conversation on the left (and the anti-Trump right) around Ms. Winfrey is more troubling than the emotional immaturity and anti-intellectualism pulsing out of the red states that elected Mr. Trump. Those voters have long defined themselves in opposition to the intellectual seriousness Democrats purport to personify.\n\nIf liberals no longer pride themselves on being the adults in the room, the bulwark against the whims of the mob, our national descent into chaos will be complete. The Oprah bandwagon betrays the extent to which social causes and identities \u2014 and the tribal feelings they inspire \u2014 have come to eclipse anything resembling philosophical worldviews. American politics has become just another team sport, and if suiting up a heavy hitter like Ms. Winfrey is what it takes to get the championship ring, so be it.\n\nThe idea that the presidency should become just another prize for celebrities \u2014 even the ones with whose politics we imagine we agree \u2014 is dangerous in the extreme. If the first year of the Trump administration has made anything clear, it\u2019s that experience, knowledge, education and political wisdom matter tremendously. Governing is something else entirely from campaigning. And perhaps, most important, celebrities do not make excellent heads of state. The presidency is not a reality show, or for that matter, a talk show.\n\nTo her credit, last year Ms. Winfrey told CBS, \u201cThere will be no running for office of any kind for me.\u201d But when the conservative columnist and Trump critic John Podhoretz published an essay in The New York Post in September headlined \u201cDemocrats\u2019 Best Hope for 2020: Oprah,\u201d she retweeted it.\n\n\u201cIf any figure in the United States bears watching over the next couple of years as our political culture continues the radical transformation that led to the election of Donald Trump, it\u2019s Oprah,\u201d Mr. Podhoretz wrote. \u201cI believe she\u2019s uniquely positioned, should she wish to commit herself, to seek the Democratic nomination for president and challenge Trump in 2020.\u201d\n\nLet us hope, for the sake of our nation, that she does not want it.", "title": "Opinion | Oprah, Don\u2019t Do It", "authors": []}

She is a preacher, a spiritual guru, a religious teacher, an apostle and a prophetess. Indeed, to the extent that there is a specifically American religion, a faith tradition all our own, Oprah has made herself its pope.\n\nIn other columns I have suggested that American culture is divided between three broad approaches to religious questions: one traditional, one spiritual and one secular. The traditional approach takes various forms (Catholic and Protestant, Muslim and Orthodox Jewish) but its instincts are creedal, confessional, dogmatic; it believes in a specific revelation, a specific authority and a specific holy book, and seeks to conform itself to teachings handed down from the religious past. The secular approach is post-religious, scientistic, convinced that the laboratory and the microscope will ultimately account for everything that matters, while hopefully justifying a liberal society\u2019s still-somewhat-Christian moral commitments along the way.\n\nBut in between secularism and traditionalism lies the most American approach to matters of faith: a religious individualism that blurs the line between the God out there and the God Within, a gnostic spirituality that constantly promises access to a secret and personalized wisdom, a gospel of health and wealth that insists that the true spiritual adept will find both happiness and money, a do-it-yourself form of faith that encourages syncretism and relativism and the pursuit of \u201cyour truth\u201d (to borrow one of Oprah\u2019s Golden Globes phrases) in defiance of the dogmatic and the skeptical alike.\n\nBecause this kind of faith is not particularly political, because it\u2019s too individualistic and personalized (and comfortable with the post-Me Decade American status quo) to be partisan and programmatic, it doesn\u2019t always get the attention it deserves from a press accustomed to analyzing everything in terms of the clash of left and right.\n\nNot that it doesn\u2019t have partisan tilts and colorations. Some of its manifestations are more common in conservative America \u2014 where they usually have an evangelical and commercial gloss, as with Joel Osteen and his epigones. (This red-state style of spirituality was recently co-opted, with some success, by the prosperity preacher known as Donald Trump.) Others are more common in liberal communities \u2014 where they emphasize Eastern wisdom and Lost Christianities and the New Age and Esalen-style mystical humanism. Where the spiritual worldview blurs into secularism, it\u2019s usually claiming scientific bona fides; where it blurs into traditional religion it\u2019s usually talking about Jesus. And Oprah herself, with her Obama-endorsing, #MeToo politics and her tendency to mix spirituality with pseudoscience, is clearly somewhat on the blue-state side of that divide \u2026", "title": "Opinion | Oprah: Prophet, Priestess \u2026 Queen?", "authors": []}

Your recent tip on managing iOS apps without the old capability in the new iTunes update did not address seeing apps beyond pages available on a device (I have hundreds more not visible) and organizing them on a computer, as was so easy before iTunes 12.7. Help!\n\nA. By confining apps management to the iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, Apple has made the process more challenging for those who preferred to organize their collections in the desktop iTunes program \u2014 but there are a few tricks that may help make more of your apps visible and easier to move around. For example, sorting your apps into folders on your home screen (a feature that was introduced for the iPhone in 2010) allows you to keep at least 12 tiny app icons in the same amount of space as a single standard icon.\n\nDepending on the screen size of your hardware and the version of the iOS software you are using, you can have anywhere from 2,160 to 49,140 apps displayed on your device\u2019s home screens. Whether or not your phone or tablet has the storage capacity for a potential 49,140 apps is another matter, but the icon visibility is possible based on the number of home screens, space for folders and number of apps that can be stored in those folders.\n\nTo group apps into folders (like \u201cGames\u201d or \u201cPhoto Editors\u201d), lightly press and hold your finger on an app icon until all the apps on the screen begin to jiggle. Drag the app on top of another app you want in the same folder; while the apps are wiggling in \u201cedit\u201d mode, you can also drag them around into a new order on the screen or tap the \u201cx\u201d in the corner to delete the app from the device.", "title": "Organizing Apps Directly in iOS", "authors": []}

Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d is about racism and cultural appropriation, the film\u2019s get-out-the-vote team says, but also (in this #MeToo moment) about the abuse of power. \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d which won the top prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, sees itself as the most topical: It features a woman demanding attention be placed on a sexual predator; red state anger; and commentary about racist policing.

Given the state of our country right now, we urgently need to encourage those fresh ideas and fresh voices.\u201d\n\nMr. Peele\u2019s film, which cost Blumhouse Productions $4.5 million to make and collected $255 million worldwide nearly a year ago, is one of the few horror movies ever nominated for Hollywood\u2019s highest honor.\n\nThe nominations meant the end of the road for hopefuls like \u201cDetroit,\u201d \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d \u201cDownsizing,\u201d \u201cWind River\u201d and \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d all of which campaigned for votes and were completely shut out.

It was Ms. Streep\u2019s 21st nomination.\n\nGary Oldman\u2019s performance as Winston Churchill in \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d landed him a best actor nod. He was joined in the category by the newcomers Daniel Kaluuya and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet (\u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d), Daniel Day-Lewis (\u201cPhantom Thread\u201d) and the nine-time nominee Denzel Washington (\u201cRoman J.

Representatives for Mr. Franco have referred reporters to his statements on late-night shows.\n\nMany academy voters have long insisted that art should be separated from the artist \u2014 that the Oscars should be about assessing the caliber of work and that concerns about offscreen behavior should be cleaved away. Just last year, voters overlooked Casey Affleck\u2019s past settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment to name him best actor.\n\nBut that stance has been harder to maintain as women have come forward in recent months to accuse men like Harvey Weinstein, Brett Ratner and James Toback of sexual misconduct. Many of these men \u2014 Mr. Weinstein, most notably \u2014 used the Oscars as a shield. The academy kicked him out in October.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile a hot awards prospect earlier in the season, \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d about families living in a grim motel, received only one nomination, for Willem Dafoe as a supporting actor.

But even after two years of the initiative, the academy remains 72 percent male and 87 percent white.\n\nActors of color who received nominations on Tuesday included Mr. Kaluuya, Mr. Washington, Mary J. Blige (\u201cMudbound\u201d) and Octavia Spencer (\u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d). Both Ms. Blige and Ms. Spencer were nominated as best supporting actress, joined by the first-time honorees Allison Janney (\u201cI, Tonya\u201d), Lesley Manville (\u201cPhantom Thread\u201d) and Ms. Metcalf.\n\nFor the first time in its 90-year history, a woman was nominated for best cinematographer: Rachel Morrison, who was honored for her work on \u201cMudbound,\u201d Dee Rees\u2019s film about black and white farmers in rural Mississippi in the 1940s. No black woman has ever won a writing award at the Oscars, but Ms. Rees, nominated with Virgil Williams for their adapted screenplay, could change that.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe streaming insurgency.\n\nThe academy\u2019s old guard has resisted a push by Netflix to join the best picture club, arguing that, since Netflix only gives its films token releases in theaters, its offerings should be better considered by Emmy voters. Netflix has doggedly campaigned for Oscars, though, and last year won the documentary short prize for \u201cThe White Helmets.\u201d\n\nThis year, Netflix was hoping for its first best picture nomination for \u201cMudbound.\u201d That didn\u2019t happen, but the film ultimately received attention in four categories, including original song. Netflix, with a total of eight nominations, also has two documentaries vying for the Oscar: \u201cIcarus,\u201d about Russian doping in sports, and \u201cStrong Island,\u201d about the 1992 murder of a young black man.\n\nFor its part, Amazon had aggressively pushed \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d nominated for best original screenplay, as a best picture contender, despite the academy\u2019s aversion to comedies. But Amazon is already ahead of Netflix in its campaign to be taken seriously by the film establishment. Amazon, which has allowed its films to play extensively in theaters before appearing online, won three Oscars last year.

In his final turn as Wolverine, Hugh Jackman plays the washed-up hero of a mutant race on the verge of extinction, logging enough hours as a limo driver to care for the ailing Charles Xavier in exile, but otherwise doing little to aid humanity.

News that women would be wearing only black gowns to the Globes and eschewing talk of fashion and brands to highlight gender disparities only whet the media\u2019s appetite. (That said, the Bagger heard ample mention of labels on the red carpet, as she was sandwiched alongside a correspondent from InStyle.) The same novel excitement will probably extend to the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Jan. 21, when, thanks to a plan hatched by two women overseeing the show, the host (Kristen Bell), along with the awards presenters, will all be \u2014 with possibly a few exceptions \u2014 women.\n\nThe Oscars, have a hard act to follow, and not just because they\u2019re a way more snoozy event that doesn\u2019t allow attendees to drink at their seats. The academy and the show\u2019s broadcaster, ABC, have a financial interest in high ratings, and a sense of decorum adds a leaden note to the show. The academy has more than 8,000 members and multiple branches, so even when many people agree on a cause, like fighting #OscarsSoWhite, there can still be all-white acting nominees two years in a row.\n\nWho ends up attending or being invited to the Oscars will also play a big role. The narrative of this year\u2019s Globes was set less by the show\u2019s organizers and host, Seth Meyers \u2014 though he deserves kudos for artfully threading a very tricky needle \u2014 than by the women who attended and were heavily involved in Time\u2019s Up, including America Ferrera, Eva Longoria, Kerry Washington and Reese Witherspoon. Because the Oscars award movies, there will be far fewer television actresses on hand.\n\nAlthough there may be organizing among actresses once the Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 23, potential nominees like Meryl Streep (for \u201cThe Post\u201d) and Michelle Williams (\u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d), who each brought feminist activists as their plus-ones to the Globes, have a heftier load to carry. And will best actress front-runners like Frances McDormand (\u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d), Saoirse Ronan (\u201cLady Bird\u201d) and Sally Hawkins (\u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d) publicly endorse Time\u2019s Up as heartily? Ms. McDormand delivered a ferocious acceptance speech after winning the Globe for best actress, saying she was delighted \u201cto be part of the tectonic shift\u201d in Hollywood\u2019s power structure, but also that she keeps her politics private.\n\nAnd the Oscars are not happening until March 4, a long way off. Lest we forget, the tone of the 2017 awards seasons was also set at the Globes, when Meryl Streep delivered her \u201chooks in my heart\u201d speech calling out Donald J. Trump a week and a half before his inauguration. The 2017 Screen Actors Guild Awards rode a similar wage of outrage. Held nine days after Mr. Trump became president, and two days after his administration hastily instituted its chaotic Muslim travel ban, the SAGs were suffused with a sense of urgency as actors, one by one, announced their opposition.", "title": "Oscars So Awkward?

For the more than 9,000 users of WeCroak, most in their 20s and 30s, he said, there is no time like the moment to get a grip on life by embracing mortality.\n\nHovering near the top of the App Store\u2019s paid health and fitness chart, the app, which I first read about in The Atlantic, is an exhortation to mindfulness. \u201cMeditation urges you to focus on your breath,\u201d Mr. Bergwall said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with remembering that you\u2019re mortal. You forget, so you need something strong, someone telling you straight out, being blunt about it.\u201d\n\nThat very bluntness is a provocation. Death until recently was often a conversational taboo, dark fodder for goth sites, maybe, but otherwise invoked discreetly, if at all, in spirit-soothing euphemisms.\n\nPhoto\n\nNow it\u2019s trending.\n\nThe app, on iOS and Android, could not be simpler. Ad-free, it is there strictly to remind you that the end is near, its message accompanied by alternately somber and uplifting homilies: \u201cThe grave has no sunny corners\u201d or, more motivating, \u201cBegin again the story of your life.\u201d The words come from a variety of sources, including work by Emily Dickinson, Pablo Neruda, Henry David Thoreau, Charles Bukowksi, Pablo Neruda, Lao Tzu and Margaret Atwood.\n\nIt is but the latest in a flurry of pop culture death fare that is finding a receptive audience: \u201cCoco,\u201d Pixar\u2019s animated feature about a boy exploring the land of the dead, and \u201cThe Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning,\u201d a quirky housekeeping primer encouraging the reader to tidy up while there\u2019s still time, have struck a chord with audiences. The book \u201cDeath, a Graveside Companion,\u201d by Joanna Ebenstein, dense with death-related imagery, may not be sweeping the marketplace, but it sends a strong signal just the same.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA decade ago, Ms. Ebenstein started a blog about death and bereavement called Morbid Anatomy. Sensing that the subject, long hushed, might put off her readers \u2014 and her employers at Scholastic magazine, where she worked at the time \u2014 she was reluctant to sign her posts, using only her initials.\n\n\u201cNow people are responding,\u201d said Ms. Ebenstein, who is also the founder of the Morbid Anatomy Museum in Brooklyn (now defunct). \u201cThey think the discussion is cool, part of a cultural movement to explore the shadow side.\u201d This is especially true, she noted, among young people trying to connect with their spiritual selves.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn older generation may well be resistant to the outing of death. Boomers especially are attached to the notion that they are their own entrepreneurs, running their bodies like corporations. \u201cTheir idea is to give death the slip, \u201c said Tracy Morgan, a psychoanalyst in New York. \u201cThings may be spinning out of control, but it\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m eating well, I\u2019m exercising, I\u2019m so damned virtuous, I can do things to my face, I can control my fertility.

Dick novel but actually living it.\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Benedetto asked his students to download the app, he got little resistance. Some were just curious, while others found it useful to assimilate the concept of finality into their thinking. \u201cFew of these students seemed aware that people are dying around them,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of them don\u2019t even know we\u2019re at war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor users like me, WeCroak alerts have become routine enough to ignore, at worst a gnat-like irritant.\n\n\u201cI wanted it to scare me more, to jolt me into sort of tripping the light fantastic,\u201d Ms. Morgan said. \u201cThat\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Mr. Thomas, who wrote code for the app, finds himself fielding requests for bleaker, grittier messages. \u201cSo far, the quotes are rather tame and contemplative,\u201d one user complained. \u201cI thought they\u2019d be more hard-hitting.\u201d\n\nYet confronting even a sweet-talking reaper can foster a kind of self-mastery. Karen Rosenberg, 50, a corporate recruiter in Miami, finds WeCroak\u2019s daily alerts liberating. \u201cI think, \u2018Oh my gosh, I can wash dishes with a smile. I can talk on the phone,\u2019 knowing all the while that this life is not a dress rehearsal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helps me enjoy the moment.\u201d\n\nSimon Arizpe, a 27-year-old artist in Brooklyn who makes pop-up books, had his first brush with death in a fire that raced through his office. \u201cBeing so close to mortality in such a surprising way was a rude awakening,\u201d he said, one that was reinforced in a positive way by the app. \u201cIt helped me suddenly realize that, oh, nothing is precious. In a way, that\u2019s kind of relaxing.\u201d\n\nWhen he downloaded the app, Mr. Arizpe got blowback from his friends. \u201cSome of them were kind of disgusted,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey asked, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d\n\nChallenged, he dug in his heels. \u201cWith so many stimuli coming at you, it\u2019s nice to have something in your pocket that slows you down, lets you look at the big picture,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, what could be more alluring than to break a taboo.\u201d", "title": "Outing Death", "authors": ["Ruth La Ferla"]}

His protagonist, Sergio, a 38-year-old Havana native, is neither for nor against the revolution.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "My brief experience thinking of myself as transgender was jarring and confusing. I\u2019d flinch if a girl referred to me as she or her; women often weaponized these pronouns against me when they viewed me as a threat or wanted to make fun of me. But I\u2019d also cringe when boys referred to me as he or him, because those words felt too sharp, as if they were being used to remind me of my place; and when they came from boys I desired, I felt completely undesirable. I didn\u2019t assert my truth in language, because I didn\u2019t know how.\n\nThe older that I got, the less I felt represented in the transgender narrative. It simply did not fit. Some days I felt comfortable being a gay boy. Some days I felt at home as a beautiful girl. There were also times where I felt like neither, or both. When I got to college I started to experiment with androgyny. I cropped my long, bouncy, black weave into a blond and crimson Mohawk. I started to wear my clothes a bit looser so that people couldn\u2019t identify my gender.\n\nIf I\u2019d had access to the right language, it\u2019s possible that I might have felt empowered by this change. Instead, people on campus began referring to me as \u201cit\u201d or \u201che-she.\u201d Eventually I folded into myself. I cut my hair off, wore drastically less makeup and took to wearing all black clothing, because I was constantly mourning the identities I might have had, that the world had slowly killed. I became increasingly depressed and even attempted to end my life.\n\nIn the years since, inclusion in language has blossomed. Now we not only have glorious and complex examples of what it means to be transgender, we also have words for people like me who simply don\u2019t feel at home as male or female, or being referred to as he or she. Now we have words like gender neutral, gender deviant, gender nonconforming and non-binary making and taking up space. Now we have pronouns like \u201cthey/them\u201d and \u201czi/zer,\u201d among many others.\n\nSadly, it feels as though I missed the bus. I am completely at home now with my male identification. I don\u2019t know whether this was a natural progression or if I was beaten into submission by the world. However I got here, I feel comfortable with my \u201che\u201d and \u201chim,\u201d but I know that I lost a lot in my retreat. At times I still fear that I\u2019m not being my most authentic self.\n\nLanguage is meant to be inclusive, but most important, it is meant to expand, to be updated and challenged by the times. However, language can also repress: It\u2019s not a coincidence that the people who are most often allowed to deem the world too sensitive and politically correct are the ones who wield power and privilege over others. For black people, this means white people; for gay people, this means straight people; and for trans and gender-nonconforming persons, this means the world.", "title": "Opinion | P.C.

Long before children reach the age of BB guns and pellet guns, many are drawn to toy guns, which do not pose these same safety concerns about eye injuries, but bring up questions about behavior and aggression.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI remember the efforts of my first son to foil the no-guns rule when he was a toddler in a day care center in Cambridge, Mass. His teachers kept a sharp eye out for any child biting away parts of a sandwich to create a gun shape or constructing possible armaments out of Tinker Toys or Legos. But my son \u2014 the child of a predictably liberal pediatrician \u2014 claimed he was building a bird feeder, then pointed it at a classmate and said, \u201cBang, I killed you with my bird feeder.\u201d\n\nBrad Bushman, a professor of communication and psychology at the Ohio State University in Columbus, said the experimental evidence about toy guns shows that \u201cThe mere sight of a gun makes you more aggressive.\u201d This is known as the \u201cweapons effect.\u201d It\u2019s not just that more aggressive children tend to play with guns; in studies where children were randomized to play with a gun or with some nonaggressive toy, he said, playing with the gun led to more aggressive behavior.\n\nIn his study published last year, children from 8 to 12 years old were randomized to see PG movies either with or without guns in them (the movies were otherwise identical). Then the children were observed in a room that contained a cabinet with an unloaded gun in a closed drawer. The children who had watched the version of the movie with guns, Dr. Bushman said, held the gun for an average of 53 seconds, compared to 11 seconds for the children who had watched the no-gun version. And they pulled the trigger on average three times, compared to no times. \u201cOne kid put the gun against his friend\u2019s head and pulled the trigger,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother pointed it out the window at passers-by on the street.\u201d\n\nHe cited a statistic that less than 60 percent of gun owners secure their guns. \u201cLock up the guns and keep the ammunition separate,\u201d he said. \u201cDo so in an opaque container, not a glass cabinet \u2014 just seeing a gun increases aggression.\u201d\n\nAnd not surprisingly, he would not recommend toy guns of any kind, but would advocate using the topic as an occasion for discussion: \u201cI think parents need to talk to their kids about why they don\u2019t want them to play with guns,\u201d he said.\n\nWhatever you decide \u2014 or whatever you think you have decided, whatever your child ends up doing, younger or older, keep those eyes safe. Even if you ban toy guns when your child is young, he may still come up against paintball guns and pellet guns; insist on protective eyewear, and keep those eyes safe.\n\nParenthood is full of challenges \u2014 you often have to find ways to say, don\u2019t do such and such, but if you do, keep yourself safe \u2014 those of you with middle school and high school age children know this, you\u2019ve had those conversations about alcohol and drugs and sex \u2014 or if you haven\u2019t, you should.\n\nSo here\u2019s one more kind of safety to consider: Children using nonpowder guns need to wear protective eyewear.

But President Trump\u2019s bombast and the precipitous way the decision seems to have been made have led to doubts that Mr. Trump has a serious plan for managing the ramifications of this move.\n\nAlmost every military flight into Afghanistan goes through Pakistani airspace. Most supplies travel along Pakistani roads and rails. Pakistan could shut down American access at any moment, and some Pakistani officials are threatening to do just that. Pakistan could also ally more closely with China, which is already investing in major new infrastructure projects and expanding its international leadership at America\u2019s expense, and be more hard-line in its rivalry with India. Indeed, China could once again be the beneficiary of a Trump decision estranging the United States from longtime partners.\n\nThe president is good at venting grievances, as he demonstrated in his New Year\u2019s Day tweet on the situation: \u201cThe United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.

First served at a dinner at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in 1975, the soup was named for the French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, who had just awarded Mr. Bocuse the French Legion of Honor.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bocuse, a tireless self-promoter, was a constant presence in the news media and on television. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to beat the drum in life,\u201d he told People magazine in 1976. \u201cGod is already famous, but that doesn\u2019t stop the preacher from ringing the church bells every morning.\u201d\n\nHe parlayed celebrity into a restaurant empire that extended beyond France to embrace the United States and Japan, and in so doing he became a role model for the chef-entrepreneurs of the present day, like Jacques P\u00e9pin.\n\n\u201cCertainly he did more than any other chef in the world that I can think of to bring the chefs in the dining room and to make the profession respectable and to make us who we are now,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9pin said in 2011, when Mr. Bocuse was named \u201cchef of the century\u201d by the Culinary Institute of America. \u201cNow the chefs are stars and it\u2019s because of Paul Bocuse. We are indebted to him for them.\u201d\n\nPaul Bocuse was born on Feb. 11, 1926, in Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019Or, where his forebears had been cooking and serving food for seven generations. At the age of 8, he made his first serious dish, veal kidneys with pur\u00e9ed potatoes, and as a teenager he began an apprenticeship at a local restaurant. The training was interrupted by World War II, however, when he was assigned to a Vichy government youth camp and put to work in its canteen and slaughterhouse. In 1944, he joined the 1st Free French Division and was wounded in combat in Alsace. He received the Croix de Guerre.\n\nAfter the war, he resumed his apprenticeship at the restaurant, La M\u00e8re Brazier in Le Col de la Lu\u00e8re, outside Lyon. Like its twin in Lyon, it was owned by the legendary Eug\u00e9nie Brazier and had achieved three Michelin stars by serving impeccable renditions of regional classics.\n\nAfter a brief stint at the three-star Lucas Carton in Paris, where he worked alongside the brothers Pierre and Jean Troisgros, Mr. Bocuse spent eight years under Point at La Pyramide in Vienne, near Lyon.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBack then a lot of restaurants were doing the same kind of old-fashioned Escoffier-style cooking, with lots of sauces hiding the ingredients, and the same dishes night after night,\u201d Mr. Bocuse told The New York Times in 2007. \u201cPoint was a perfectionist who gave value and credibility to the finest ingredients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Bocuse returned to the family restaurant, the Auberge du Pont de Collonges, which earned its first Michelin star two years later. Despite the paper tablecloths and stainless-steel cutlery, a second star was awarded in 1960.\n\nIn 1966, a year after the restaurant earned its third star, Mr. Bocuse bought back the old family restaurant that his grandfather, in straitened circumstances, had sold in 1921 along with the rights to the Bocuse name. He renamed the building, which once belonged to an order of monks, the Abbaye de Collonges and converted it into a banquet hall. He also hoisted a four-foot neon \u201cPaul Bocuse\u201d sign atop his restaurant.\n\nThe groundswell for nouvelle cuisine transformed Mr. Bocuse into the international face of French cooking. He appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine in 1972. In 1975, resplendent in chef whites and toque, he looked out from the cover of Newsweek under the banner headline \u201cFood: The New Wave.\u201d An apprenticeship at his restaurant became a rite of passage for ambitious chefs, including Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud.\n\nIn time, as a backlash against nouvelle cuisine developed, Mr. Bocuse put some distance between himself and the movement. He referred snidely to \u201cmini-portions on maxi-plates\u201d and at one point dismissed the movement as \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not true that Paul Bocuse invented Nouvelle Cuisine,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal in 2011. \u201cThere were a few dishes that were developed lighter, but that is normal in cooking. The term Nouvelle Cuisine as it came to be known was nothing to do with what was on the plate, but what was on the bill.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNouvelle cuisine lost momentum, but Mr. Bocuse did not. In the early 1980s, the Walt Disney Company invited him to create restaurants for the French pavilion at Epcot Center (now Walt Disney World) in Orlando, Fla. With Gaston Len\u00f4tre and Roger Verg\u00e9, he developed Les Chefs de France restaurant, which is now operated by his son, J\u00e9r\u00f4me, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. It serves 2,000 meals a day and generates about $30 million a year.\n\nWhen the organizers of Eurexpo, a culinary trade fair in Lyon, approached Mr. Bocuse for ideas on how to promote the event, he proposed a cooking contest in which chefs would prepare two elaborate dishes, one fish and one meat, before a live audience and then submit them to a panel of expert judges for scoring. The Bocuse d\u2019Or, held every two years, made its debut in 1987 and is now regarded as the culinary equivalent of the Olympics, attracting teams from all over the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to his restaurant in Collonges-au-Mont-d\u2019Or, Mr. Bocuse operated brasseries in France, Switzerland and Japan, and a culinary school at \u00c9cully, near Lyon.\n\nHis cookbooks include \u201cPaul Bocuse\u2019s French Cooking (1977), \u201cPaul Bocuse in Your Kitchen: An Introduction to Classic French Cooking\u201d (1982), \u201cBocuse \u00e0 la Carte\u201d (1989) and \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Complete Recipes\u201d (2011).\n\nFor many years, Mr. Bocuse resisted writing the story of his life, but he eventually worked with Eve-Marie Zizza-Lalu to produce an as-told-to memoir, \u201cPaul Bocuse: The Sacred Fire,\u201d published in 2005. Even in France, eyebrows lifted a little when Mr. Bocuse revealed that for more than 30 years, he had enjoyed the company of not only his wife, Raymonde, the mother of his daughter, Fran\u00e7oise Bernachon, but also of two mistresses, one of them the mother of J\u00e9r\u00f4me. His wife survives him, as do his two children.\n\n\u201cIt would not be everyone\u2019s idea of married life, but everyone gets on,\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph of London at the time. \u201cThey are all happy, with me and each other, and if I add up the time we have spent together as couples, it comes to 145 years.\u201d\n\nDespite his international status, Mr. Bocuse remained a chef deeply rooted in his native soil. He loved the traditional dishes of Lyon. He slept in the same bedroom where he had been born.\n\n\u201cWhen the time comes, I too will end up in the oven,\u201d he told L\u2019Express in 2005, musing over the multiple meanings of his memoir\u2019s title. \u201cI want my ashes to be scattered in the Sa\u00f4ne, which flows right past my house.

As evidence that Mr. Mueller is biased, critics have pointed to Democratic donations by members of his team and anti-Trump text messages sent by an F.B.I. agent whom Mr. Mueller removed from the investigation.\n\nThe accusations in the charges against Mr. Manafort date back years, well before he began working for Mr. Trump. His lawyers argue that Mr. Mueller should be allowed to investigate only matters that directly arise from the Russia investigation. That theory echoes comments made by Mr. Trump, who has said that Mr. Mueller cannot investigate his family\u2019s finances.\n\nMr. Mueller served as F.B.I. director under the younger Mr. Bush and Barack Obama.

She is one of the authors of a 2013 study, published in the Journal of Urology, that randomly assigned 81 women with pelvic floor tenderness and painful bladder syndrome to either 10 sessions of pelvic floor physical therapy involving targeted internal and external muscle manipulation or 10 sessions of full body massage.\n\nWomen who received the targeted pelvic floor therapy were more likely to respond to therapy, with 59 percent experiencing improvement in symptoms compared with 26 percent in the full body massage group, though both groups saw easing of pain and urinary problems.

The Trump administration said the delay was unrelated to the rising anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Pence called Mr. Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital \u201ca historic decision,\u201d but insisted that the United States takes \u201cno position on boundaries and final status\u201d issues.

But as the state\u2019s map is now drawn, Republicans control 13 of the state\u2019s 18 House seats. Outside experts say that a nonpartisan district map could move as many as three of those seats over to the Democratic column.\n\nThe Pennsylvania ruling could also add some momentum to a clear movement in lower federal courts toward reining in the most severe partisan gerrymanders. Three-judge federal panels have already invalidated the district maps for the Wisconsin State Assembly and North Carolina\u2019s congressional map, saying they are unconstitutionally tilted toward one party \u2014 in both cases, the Republicans. Each panel\u2019s ruling broke new ground.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has stayed those decisions while it considers the Wisconsin case, and one from Maryland challenging a congressional map drawn by Democrats that eliminated a longtime Republican district.\n\nSo unless the Supreme Court intervenes in the Pennsylvania case as well, the state may be the only one where a new court-ordered map will take effect in time for the midterm elections. Primaries for the state\u2019s congressional representatives are scheduled for May 15.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court split along party lines in striking down the state\u2019s House map, with the court\u2019s five Democrats in the majority and its two Republican judges in dissent. The majority did not lay out its reasons on Monday, saying they will be explained in a later written opinion.\n\nThe original complaint, filed in June, relied heavily on an argument that the map violated the state Constitution\u2019s freedom-of-speech guarantees, which are broader than those in the federal Constitution.\n\nGerrymander opponents have argued in both state and federal lawsuits that partisan redistricting violates the First Amendment by punishing one party\u2019s voters for speaking with their votes in opposition to the other party. Among the evidence presented by the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the suit, originally brought by the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, was that as many as five seats held by Republicans would have been won by Democrats if \u201cneutral\u201d maps had been used, meaning maps that did not contort districts and divide communities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If new boundaries are not approved by Feb. 15, the court said, it would decide on a map itself, relying in part on suggestions from parties to the lawsuit.\n\nThe state court appeared to be less divided on the central issue of the case than the 5-2 party-line split might suggest. Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor, a Republican, acknowledged in his dissent that recent federal court rulings \u201craise substantial concerns as to the constitutional viability of Pennsylvania\u2019s current congressional districts,\u201d but he argued that the court should have awaited the federal Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Wisconsin gerrymander case, expected this spring, before making its own ruling.\n\n\u201cMy position at this juncture is only that I would not presently upset those districts,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA second dissent, by Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy, endorsed Justice Saylor\u2019s views, and added a warning that involving the State Supreme Court in redrawing the map could raise federal constitutional questions.\n\nRepublicans in the State Senate said they would ask the State Supreme Court to stay its order for new maps, and made it clear that they would try to take the matter to a federal court. But legal experts said their chances appeared slim at best, because federal courts generally have no authority to review state court decisions that exclusively involve state law. The State Supreme Court took pains to say that the state Constitution was the \u201csole basis\u201d for its ruling requiring a new map.\n\nThe most likely argument for federal review, election scholars said, is that the court order violated the federal Constitution\u2019s elections clause, which delegates authority over elections to state legislatures. The Supreme Court entertained a similar argument in Bush v. Gore, the case that determined the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. But the court later narrowly rejected the idea that state legislatures have sole authority over elections in a 2015 decision that, fittingly, dealt with redistricting in Arizona.\n\n\u201cThis case was designed from the get-go to get to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and no further,\u201d said Justin Levitt, an election-law scholar and associate dean at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \u201cThere are one or two exceedingly long-shot ways that Republicans might attempt to get this in front of the Supreme Court.

Representative Tim Murphy resigned his seat after he reportedly asked a woman who he had an extramarital relationship with to seek an abortion. A special election to replace him is scheduled for March 13, and the State Supreme Court order said it would be held under the existing House map.\n\nOver the weekend, Representative Patrick Meehan was removed from the House Ethics Committee after The New York Times reported that he had settled a sex harassment complaint brought by a former aide.

Terry Madonna, director of the Franklin & Marshall College poll and a longtime analyst of Pennsylvania politics.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the proposed policy.\n\nGary Samore, who was a top nuclear adviser to President Barack Obama, said much of the draft strategy \u201crepeats the essential elements of Obama declaratory policy word for word\u201d \u2014 including its declaration that the United States would \u201conly consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest difference lies in new wording about what constitutes \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d\n\nIn the Trump administration\u2019s draft, those \u201ccircumstances could include significant non-nuclear strategic attacks.\u201d It said that could include \u201cattacks on the U.S., allied, or partner civilian population or infrastructure, and attacks on U.S. or allied nuclear forces, their command and control, or warning and attack assessment capabilities.\u201d\n\nThe draft does not explicitly say that a crippling cyberattack against the United States would be among the extreme circumstances. But experts called a cyberattack one of the most efficient ways to paralyze systems like the power grid, cellphone networks and the backbone of the internet without using nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, we struggled with how to establish deterrence for terrorism because terrorists don\u2019t have populations or territory to hold at risk. Cyber poses a similar quandary,\u201d said Kori Schake, a senior National Security Council and State Department official during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, who is now the deputy director general of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.\n\n\u201cSo if cyber can cause physical malfunction of major infrastructure resulting in deaths,\u201d Ms. Schake said, the Pentagon has now found a way \u201cto establish a deterrent dynamic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe draft review also cites \u201cparticular concern\u201d about \u201cexpanding threats in space and cyberspace\u201d to the command-and-control systems of the American nuclear arsenal that the review identifies as a \u201clegacy of the Cold War.\u201d It was the latest warning in a growing chorus that the nuclear response networks could themselves be disabled or fed false data in a cyberattack.\n\nSo far, all of the United States\u2019 leading adversaries \u2014 including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran \u2014 have stopped well short of the kind of cyberattacks that could prompt a larger, and more violent response.\n\nThe Russians have placed malware called \u201cBlack Energy\u201d in American utility systems, but never tried to cause a major blackout. They have sent cable-cutting submarines along the path of undersea fiber optic lines that connect the continents, but not cut them. North Korea has attacked companies like Sony, and used cyberweapons to cause chaos in the British health care system, but never directly taken on the United States.\n\nStill, the document recognizes that American, Russian and Chinese strategies have all been updated in recent years to reflect the reality that any conflict would begin with a lightning strike on space and communications systems.

Some experts warn that such smaller weapons can blur the distinction between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons, and, as a result, be more tempting to use.\n\nAnd it states outright that Russia is testing its first autonomous nuclear torpedo, one that American officials believe would be guided largely by artificial intelligence to strike the United States even if communications with Moscow were terminated. It was Washington\u2019s first public acknowledgment of such an undersea weapon, a prototype of which was first envisioned in the 1960s by Andrei Sakharov, the physicist who later ranked among the Soviet Union\u2019s most famous dissidents.\n\nThe torpedo\u2019s development was detected by the Obama administration and has been widely discussed in defense circles, but never publicly referred to by the Pentagon as a significant future threat.\n\nMr. Trump has rarely publicly criticized President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for Russia\u2019s aggressions around the world. But the Pentagon document describes Moscow\u2019s actions as so destabilizing that the United States may be forced to reverse Mr. Obama\u2019s commitment to reduce the role and size of the American nuclear arsenal.\n\nRussia is adopting \u201cmilitary strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success,\u201d Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote in an introduction to the report. \u201cThese developments, coupled with Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow\u2019s unabashed return to Great Power competition.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn most cases, the Trump administration plan would simply move forward nuclear weapons that Mr. Obama had endorsed, such as a new generation of nuclear cruise missiles \u2014 low-flying weapons with stubby wings that, when dropped from a bomber, hug the ground to avoid enemy radars and air defenses.\n\nBut the strategy envisions other new nuclear weapons. The draft policy calls for \u201cthe rapid development\u201d of a cruise missile to be fired from submarines. Mr. Obama had retired that class. It also calls for the development of a low-yield warhead for ballistic missiles fired from submarines.\n\nIt is relatively easy for presidents to change the country\u2019s declaratory policy on the use of nuclear arms and quite difficult for them to reshape its nuclear arsenal, which takes not only vast sums of money but many years and sometimes decades of planning and implementation.\n\nThe price tag for a 30-year makeover of the United States\u2019 nuclear arsenal was put last year at $1.2 trillion. Analysts said the expanded Trump administration plan would push the bill much higher, noting that firm estimates will have to wait until the proposed federal budget for the 2019 fiscal year is made public.\n\n\u201cAlmost everything about this radical new policy will blur the line between nuclear and conventional,\u201d said Andrew C. Weber, an assistant defense secretary during the Obama administration who directed an interagency panel that oversaw the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\nIf adopted, he added, the new policy \u201cwill make nuclear war a lot more likely.\u201d\n\nOne of the document\u2019s edgiest conclusions involves the existence of a deadly new class of Russian nuclear torpedo \u2014 a cigar-shaped underwater missile meant to be fired from a submarine.\n\nTorpedoes tipped with nuclear arms were common during the Cold War, with the Soviet Union pioneering the weapons and developing them most vigorously. One Soviet model had a range of miles and a large warhead.\n\nMr. Sakharov, a famous Russian dissident in the 1970s and 1980s, envisioned a giant torpedo able to travel several hundred miles and incur heavy casualties with a warhead thousands of times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. Though his vision was rejected at the time, the new review discloses that Moscow has resurrected a weapon along the same lines.\n\nThe document calls it \u201ca new intercontinental, nuclear-armed undersea autonomous torpedo.\u201d In a diagram labeled \u201cNew Nuclear Delivery Vehicles over the Past Decade,\u201d it identifies the torpedo by its code name, Status-6.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNews stories have reported the possible existence of such a weapon since at least 2015, but the document\u2019s reference appears to be the first time the federal government has confirmed its existence.

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "The design by Lauren Ver Hage, who gets billing on the cover, also helps make the book appealing by making important ideas and intriguing thoughts jump out. For example, this sentence gets its own page: \u201cThe scariest thing about buying a home, in a lot of ways, is that it requires you do a not-insignificant amount of math.\u201d\n\nWidespread Appeal\n\nSo many finance books are relentlessly masculine in tone and focus that it\u2019s worth mentioning that this one skews female: Most of the experts quoted are women, and many references, to television shows like \u201cSex and the City,\u201d appear to be oriented toward women, too. But her advice is universal.\n\nFor example, she suggests saving a combined 20 percent of your income for both short and long-term goals. And, she notes, \u201cSaving, living below your means, and diversifying your income often make the difference between being stuck in a job you can\u2019t stand and having the freedom to move on to something better.\u201d These ideas apply to just about everyone.\n\nFind Your Fund Explore Fund Results \u00bb See how the largest, leading and lagging funds compare. Search by Category \u00bb Find funds by their type, performance, risk or expenses. For more fund information, search morningstar.com.\n\nSo why does she not get a higher grade? For two interrelated reasons that boil down to this: She seems to advocate putting too much money into investments that are too conservative for younger investors.\n\nThe good news is Ms. Fagan is terrific about emphasizing the need to save. Early on, she creates \u201cA Bank Account Pyramid,\u201d explaining where to put the money and when, and she also makes saving money a significant part of a five-point plan that she describes as \u201cThe Total Idiot\u2019s Guide to Investing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut if you look at both, it is easy to see the two problems.\n\nA Few Flaws\n\nThe pyramid starts out with a strong base: Have a basic savings account to house your emergency fund.\n\nBut it gets shakier from there. In the next layer up, she calls for putting money in certificates of deposit, which are \u201cgood for things like saving to buy a house in the next few years and other medium-term savings.\u201d\n\nCertainly, you don\u2019t want your down payment to disappear in a market crash the day before the money is due. But having all your money tied up in low-yielding C.D.s for more than three years before you buy a home will make it hard for your money to grow. As I write this, a three-year C.D. yields about just 2.2 percent and a five-year one isn\u2019t much better, 2.6 percent. (Three to five years would seem to fit within Ms. Fagan\u2019s definition of medium-term savings.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSo her argument about where to put money for medium-term objectives is debatable \u2014 my position would be to hold some stock, shifting the money to more conservative investments as your goal draws nigh. For example, have 100 percent of the money in equities when the goal is five years out; 60 percent in equities and 40 percent in short-term bond funds and C.D.s if you will need the money in 36 months, and only move all the money into short-term C.D.s a year before you have to write the check.\n\nMs. Fagan goes on to say that after putting cash into an emergency fund and buying C.D.s for short and intermediate goals, the rest of your savings should be in \u201clonger term investments.\u201d Like what? She doesn\u2019t say. A 30-year bond would qualify, but it\u2019s an awfully conservative place for a millennial investor saving for the long-term.\n\nThe same flaw exists in her investment guide. Her first two points are great. Again, it starts with the emergency fund, followed by working hard to pay off nondeductible debt. That is sound advice. But after that, things get squishy.\n\nHer third point about opening a retirement account is fine as far as it goes, but where do you put that money? Ms. Fagan doesn\u2019t tell us.\n\nAnd her last point is confusing. After taking the first three steps, she writes, \u201cExplore other low-risk options such as mutual funds and index funds.\u201d Now on the surface that\u2019s just wrong. Mutual funds and index funds that invest in equities, and bonds for that matter, have risk. As the prospectus of each always points out, you can lose money.\n\nGiving Ms. Fagan the benefit of the doubt, I think she was trying to say that index funds and other mutual funds carry less risk to your portfolio than investing in individual stocks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, there are fixed- income mutual funds that offer low yields. Simply saying invest in mutual funds is not helpful.\n\nBut to be fair, Ms. Fagan did not set out to write the definitive investment book, and she emphasizes throughout that if you are confused, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to pay professionals\u201d to help you with things \u201cyou don\u2019t know how to do and will put off until it\u2019s too late.\u201d These quibbles aside, for the most part her advice and conclusions are solid.\n\n\u201cWe live in a world that encourages us to spend wastefully, accumulate more than we need, and put off things like retirement saving until \u2026 we are basically retired,\u201d she says. \u201d\n\nAnything that can help improve matters is a good thing.", "title": "Personal Finance for Those Who Don\u2019t Have a Clue", "authors": ["Paul B.

Megan Fairchild and a fellow dancer, Megan Johnson, reached out to The New York Times on their own to say he has always behaved professionally with them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt in danger in his presence,\u201d said Ms. Fairchild, who has been with the company for 16 years. \u201cHe\u2019s the person I go to when I\u2019m having trouble in the company or in life.\u201d\n\nCity Ballet is not the only challenging company in which to pursue a career. Many in the dance world have expressed hope over the last several weeks that these revelations will prompt overdue changes to a culture in which bullying, body-shaming and sexual favors have long been part of the business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt can feel particularly risky \u2014 both emotionally and career wise \u2014 to be a whistle-blower within our field,\u201d Wendy Whelan, a 30-year star dancer with the company who retired in 2014, said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t encouraged to use our voice to expose the dark side of what is also truly a magical industry for the sake of hurting our father-figure teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe tradition of balletic patriarchy has held a closet full of skeletons,\u201d she added. \u201cIn recent light of things, many artists and dancers are seeing that society is no longer accepting these kind of behaviors as normal, so why do we?\u201d\n\nSeveral former ballet dancers said in the recent interviews that Mr. Martins was known for having intimate relationships with dancers, some of whom seemed to receive better roles. The relationships were complicated by a power dynamic, they said, in which Mr. Martins was widely viewed as a near deity, particularly to young dancers who might go to any length \u2014 from starving themselves to having sex with him \u2014 to earn his praise and attention.\n\nCity Ballet leaders, before the announcement, said the lawyer heading their investigation, Barbara Hoey, was engaged \u201cin a good-faith effort to investigate recent allegations against Peter Martins\u201d; that the company \u201cprohibits retaliation\u201d against participants; and that it encourages \u201canyone with relevant information to come forward.\u201d\n\nBeyond its legendary founder, George Balanchine, there is no one who has done more to shape the company than Peter Martins. His history with City Ballet dates to 1967, when he was invited to dance the title role in Balanchine\u2019s \u201cApollo\u201d at the Edinburgh Festival. He became a principal dancer in 1970, widely acclaimed for his expert partnering and masculine grace.\n\nAfter the death of Balanchine in 1983, Mr. Martins took over leadership of the company with Jerome Robbins; in 1989, he became the sole ballet master in chief. Mr. Martins has also served as the artistic director and chairman of the school\u2019s faculty.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Mr. Martins has had his share of supporters and detractors. Some credit him for balancing the company\u2019s loyalty to Balanchine with the commissioning of new choreography, particularly the opportunities he provided to promising young choreographers like Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon and Justin Peck.\n\nMr. Peck is considered a candidate to succeed Mr. Martins, as is Ms. Whelan and the French choreographer Benjamin Millepied.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome critics have questioned Mr. Martins\u2019s views of women based on his choreography. In reviewing \u201cT-al-a Gaisma,\u201d in 2005 \u2014 which featured Miranda Weese, Jock Soto and Mr. Martins\u2019s wife, Darci Kistler \u2014 Joan Acocella in The New Yorker alluded to \u201cwhat seems to be his mixed feelings about women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeese is made into a succubus, Kistler into a pleading pest, hanging on to Soto, getting her hair tangled up in his hands,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSoto finally fights his way free, lowering these harridans onto the floor, where they lie supine, immobilized.\u201d\n\nMr. Martins has been subject to public scrutiny for his conduct in the past.

The WSJ reports, citing its unnamed sources, that the firm bought about $15 million in Bitcoin and that its stake is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.\n\nSo much for Jack Ma\u2019s charm offensive.\n\nUnited States officials have effectively killed Ant Financial\u2019s $1.2 billion bid to buy MoneyGram.\n\nAnt Financial, the electronic payments company controlled by Mr. Ma, became the latest Chinese firm to have its acquisition of an American company fall apart because it was unable to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius.\n\nThe deal failed despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese internet. Shortly after President Trump won the 2016 election, Mr. Ma famously stood with the president-elect in Trump Tower in New York City and pledged that his e-commerce empire would help create one million American jobs.\n\nThe attempted purchase of MoneyGram was seen as a test of the Trump administration\u2019s political and regulatory approach to China, and the deal\u2019s failure could spell trouble for other Chinese companies considering major acquisitions.\n\nThe strong flow of Chinese money into the United States has prompted growing worries. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced legislation calling for greater scrutiny of Chinese investments in the United States. They are pushing for a significant expansion of Cfius, a multiagency panel that reviews foreign deals for potential threats to national security.\n\nOf the deal, Richard Beales of Breakingviews writes:\n\n\u201cIt would have been seen as something of a watershed for a successful upstart from the People\u2019s Republic to get its hands on a piece of Uncle Sam\u2019s payments infrastructure. \u201cFor Trump and China critics in his administration, that may have been the wrong message, especially when a similar deal in the other direction would surely come up against Beijing\u2019s tight restrictions on foreign ownership in China\u2019s financial system. Rather than opening the door \u2013 arguably the old American way of showing how things ought to be done \u2013 CFIUS this time kept it closed. If it\u2019s a rebuke, it\u2019s one that\u2019s conveniently unlikely to provoke great resentment.\u201d\n\nMoneyGram\u2019s shares are down 6.8 percent after the close.\n\nTech\u2019s 2017 rally spilled over into the New Year\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 percent Tuesday to close above 7,000 for the first time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe gain was driven by Netflix, Facebook, Google-parent Alphabet and Apple, which jumped between 18 percent and 4.8 percent.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally follows a 28 percent gain for the Nasdaq last year. That beat the 25 percent gain for the Dow Jones industrial average and the 19 percent rise for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index.\n\nSo how stretched are valuations for the Nasdaq? As of Friday, the index was trading at 27.55 times the last 12 months of earnings, well above the S.&P. 500\u2032s level of 18.27 times earnings, according to the WSJ\u2019s Ben Eisen. But the Nasdaq\u2019s current price-to-earnings ratio remains well below 72.2, which it hit in March 2000.\n\nExtra Credit: Yes, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.com drove the Nasdaq\u2019s run to 7,000.

An unpredictable America is no longer committed to advancing a rules-based, liberal world order. China is growing increasingly assertive under President Xi Jinping, while Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is flexing his muscles around the Gulf. The risk of a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula is all too real. Business is grappling with self-inflicted scandals and activist attacks, and a backlash is building against Big Tech\u2019s overweening power.\u201d\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here are a few of Breakingviews\u2019 predictions for 2018:\n\nIn investing\n\n\u2022 \u201cFor the first time in years, rich-world bond issuance will outstrip buying by the Fed and friends,\u201d and \u201cbond vigilantes will rise from the dead.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cPassive funds will, despite their name, dethrone a chief executive.\u201d\n\nIn tech\n\n\u2022 \u201cIn tech, investors can consider a tasty new dish: SLAW, for Spotify, Lyft, Airbnb and WeWork, four prospective candidates for public life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s position as a privacy-sensitive hardware specialist will give it some shelter from mounting anger at Silicon Valley\u2019s power and lack of accountability.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nPhoto\n\nDreaming of an Amazon-Target deal.\n\nWe\u2019re just two days into 2018, and we already have a huge M.&A. prediction, courtesy of the analyst Gene Munster.\n\nFrom his note yesterday:\n\nGetting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy. Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count.\n\nIt\u2019s a big, if logical, assumption given the ever-expanding empire that Amazon has been assembling \u2014 one that has put more and more industry incumbents on their back heels.\n\nTarget shares were up nearly 4 percent as of this afternoon.\n\nCould Amazon afford Target?\n\nShort answer: Yes.\n\nLong answer: Yes, but it\u2019d be pretty expensive. Target\u2019s market capitalization as of Tuesday morning was nearly $37 billion. Amazon had about $24.3 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, meaning that the company would have to borrow a hefty amount.\n\nAssuming a 20 percent takeover premium, Target would be almost $40 billion.\n\nAmazon could pay in stock as well as cash, but it hasn\u2019t struck a big deal using stock since its takeover of Zappos in 2009. And stock remains an expensive form of currency, though that hasn\u2019t stopped the likes of Disney from stock deals.\n\n(Mr. Munster asserts that a deal is affordable because the cost of a Target acquisition is just 8 percent of Amazon\u2019s market cap. Obviously, I think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe big caveat (other than price)\n\nObviously, it\u2019s antitrust. Mr. Munster notes that a combined Amazon-Target would only have about a 13 percent share of the overall American retail market, compared to Walmart\u2019s 23 percent.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to determine at the moment what the Trump administration\u2019s yardstick for market concentration is:\n\n\u2022 AT&T and Time Warner say that their proposed deal is a vertical deal that falls within the bounds of acceptable deals. The Justice Department has sued to block that.\n\n\u2022 Disney and Fox have announced a deal that would inevitably lead to lots of layoffs. President Trump has praised that transaction as potentially \u201cgreat for jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs for antitrust, the Trump administration won\u2019t do any favors for Jeff Bezos, but the market share numbers suggest the deal will be approved,\u201d Mr. Munster writes. That\u2019s a potentially big assumption.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nAre Amazon and Salesforce moving away from Oracle?\n\nKevin McLaughlin of The Information reports that the two companies \u201care actively working to replace Oracle software running on critical business systems with open-source database software alternatives, and have made significant progress toward getting off Oracle entirely,\u201d citing people familiar with the matter.\n\n\u201cA mass exodus from the Oracle database isn\u2019t likely anytime soon. Yet losing Amazon and Salesforce as customers could pose major problems for Oracle, as it could provide a road map for other large companies that also are looking to cut costs by jettisoning Oracle database software in favor of open-source database alternatives.\u201d\n\nOracle\u2019s shares are down nearly 2 percent.

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "The groups scout for military veterans, Sandersistas and others. But we found that what they generally do not scout for is competence at governing. In fact, many shy away from experience in government, on the theory that careerists are impure and inauthentic. As a representative of Justice Democrats, a group organized by former Sanders supporters, told us, \u201cWe don\u2019t want career politicians, period.\u201d\n\nAlthough winning public office will never be easy, the proliferation of candidate pipelines is already making it easier for aspirants to run \u2014 and for groups to grow their own politicians. As a political consultant told us: \u201cAccess has been both demystified and democratized. People who used to think there\u2019s no use running, because they would never win or it\u2019s too big an unknown, are much less cowed by those factors.\u201d Another consultant made the point more piquantly: \u201cIt\u2019s become like a clown car. Everyone thinks they\u2019re qualified and everyone jumps in.\u201d\n\nWhen we surveyed political consultants, they told us, by wide margins, that candidates in primary races are becoming more ideological and more inexperienced. Other research finds signs of a downward spiral. Extreme candidates heighten polarization in politics and paralysis in Congress, discouraging moderates and pragmatists (who reflect the preferences of most Americans) from entering politics.\n\nProgressive activists we spoke with said they seek not just to influence policy but also to broaden the very concept of political viability. Though the goal is laudable, inexperience can compound the chaos that is already giving government a bad name. Even a handful of political renegades can have a crippling effect on a legislative body, which is one reason Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was desperate to keep Roy Moore of Alabama out of the Senate.\n\nTo be effective at their jobs, politicians need know-how, connections and I.O.U.s, which take years to accumulate. President Trump lacked all of those assets, so it is no surprise he has had trouble governing. In Congress and state legislatures, frustrated leaders find themselves saddled with anyone and everyone who prevails in low-turnout primaries, no matter how nutty or disruptive.\n\nIf governing ability and candidate quality matter, and if special interests and purist ideologues are not to become the leading suppliers of our politicians, it is essential that parties and professionals maintain a prominent role in recruiting and screening candidates \u2014 alongside, not instead of, voters. By virtue of their insider status, they have a long-term interest in having parties govern responsibly.\n\nAlas, reformers have been pushing to marginalize professionals still further. In the Democratic Party, so-called superdelegates \u2014 elected officials and party leaders empowered to vote as they wish at the presidential convention \u2014 will not and almost certainly cannot reject a popular victor, but they do encourage candidates to seek the advice and support of people they will be working with if elected. Reducing their role, as progressives have successfully campaigned to do through the Unity Reform Commission (created by the Democratic National Committee to examine the party\u2019s nominating process), may appeal to the public\u2019s populist instincts, but it is shortsighted for those who care about effective government.", "title": "Opinion | Politics Shouldn\u2019t Be Like Open Mic Night", "authors": []}

A Quinnipiac University poll released last week found that two-thirds of Americans viewed the economy as excellent or good, up 3 percentage points from December. A Gallup poll published last week found that approval for the law had risen to 33 percent in January from 29 percent in December, an increase that was not statistically significant.\n\nSupporters of the tax law dismissed its poor poll numbers in the fall, saying Americans would like it more once they began to see its benefits in their take-home pay. \u201cThe results are going to be what sells this bill,\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, told reporters in mid-December.\n\nMany Americans won\u2019t start to see more money in their paychecks until February, because the Internal Revenue Service issued new tax withholding guidance only last week. But a series of high-profile announcements, from companies such as Walmart and Wells Fargo, have cited the tax bill in decisions to raise wages or give employees one-time bonuses.\n\nMany analysts, however, say the pay increases were more a result of the strong labor market than the tax law. A Morgan Stanley survey of Wall Street analysts released on Tuesday found that only 22 percent expected the companies they follow to direct at least some of their tax savings to employee compensation. By contrast, 83 percent of analysts said companies would increase share buybacks, dividends or merger activity. (Analysts could select multiple responses.)\n\nStill, the law, which cut taxes for businesses and individuals while eliminating many deductions and credits, isn\u2019t particularly popular. Forty-nine percent of Americans in the Times survey said they disapproved of it, and far more people said they were strongly opposed to it than strongly in favor. And deep political divisions are evident: 86 percent of Republicans approve of the law, but just 13 percent of Democrats do.\n\nMost Americans still don\u2019t think they will see their taxes go down under the new law. According to the survey, 41 percent of Americans expect a tax cut this year, up from 33 percent in December.

Mr. Angry, a powerful pianist, tends toward soul-influenced, sparkling forms of contemporary jazz; Mr. Wolf hews more closely to a straight-ahead style. Together for three nights at the Blue Note, they will convene a rotating cast of all-star collaborators. The band will be different every evening; some of the big names on deck include the trumpeter Sean Jones, the saxophonists Tia Fuller and James Carter, and the drummer Marcus Gilmore.\n\n212-475-8592, bluenote.net\n\nAL FOSTER QUARTET at Smoke (Jan. 19-21; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Foster, a drummer, spent a long tenure accompanying Miles Davis in the 1970s and \u201980s, playing on fusion albums such as \u201cPangaea\u201d and \u201cWe Want Miles.\u201d Since then he has been more affiliated with postbop, typically lending his pert and propulsive flair to acoustic jazz combos (with some notable exceptions). Here he celebrates his 75th birthday with a three-night run featuring Dayna Stephens on tenor saxophone, Adam Birnbaum on piano and Doug Weiss on bass.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nJAMIE SAFT at the Owl (Jan. 25, 8 p.m.). Mr. Saft, a pianist, has played psychedelic Brazilian dub with his New Zion Trio and dark, foreboding ballads with Iggy Pop (on last year\u2019s \u201cLoneliness Road\u201d). Here he celebrates the release of something a little gentler and more straightforward: a solo piano album, \u201cSolo a Genova,\u201d featuring covers of songs by the likes of Curtis Mayfield, Joni Mitchell and John Coltrane, in a personal patois that wanders from languid to joyful.\n\n718-774-0042, theowl.nyc\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Ms. Scheinman takes the violin into jazz, Appalachian folk, experimental rock and many zones between. This weekend at the Jazz Standard she presents Mischief and Mayhem, a quartet that makes experimental music of textural enigma, white-knuckle throb and, occasionally, moments of startling melodic clarity. The expert group features Nels Cline on guitar, Todd Sickafoose on bass and Jim Black on drums.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nJEN SHYU at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 24, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.).

Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg had one of the great romances of the 20th century, expressed through two decades\u2019 worth of sly, decadent French love songs \u2014 from the succ\u00e8s de scandale of \u201cJe T\u2019Aime...Moi Non Plus\u201d in 1969 through \u201cAmours des Feintes,\u201d released less than a year before Mr. Gainsbourg\u2019s death in 1991. In recent years, Ms. Birkin has crisscrossed the world performing new orchestral arrangements of her late ex-lover\u2019s music. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling, but equally sad, because the most beautiful songs were written when I left him,\u201d she told The New York Times in November. At this Carnegie Hall show, she will be backed by the Wordless Music Orchestra, with a special guest appearance from Rufus Wainwright, one of Mr. Gainsbourg\u2019s greatest stylistic heirs. It\u2019s sure to be a night of bittersweet beauty and high wit.\n\n212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org\n\nJEN CLOHER at Rough Trade NYC (Jan. 30, 9 p.m.). The Australian songwriter Jen Cloher\u2019s self-titled album was one of 2017\u2019s finest rock releases, full of hard-won insights on matters personal (\u201cStrong Woman\u201d) and political (\u201cAnalysis Paralyisis\u201d). The last time Ms. Cloher toured the United States, this past autumn, it was as an opening act for her partner, Courtney Barnett. This month, she\u2019s back for a headlining run that hits Brooklyn on Tuesday night, fronting an exceptionally tight band whose members include Ms. Barnett on guitar.\n\n888-929-7849, roughtrade.com/us\n\nFLEETWOOD MAC at Radio City Music Hall (Jan. 26, 7:30 p.m.) and ELTON JOHN at the Theater at Madison Square Garden (Jan. 30, 8 p.m.). The Grammy Awards are in New York this weekend, for the first time since 2003 \u2014 which means that several platinum-dusted tributes organized by the Recording Academy are in town this week, too. The hottest ticket is a Radio City Music Hall gala for the five members of Fleetwood Mac, who are being collectively recognized as \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d by the Grammy-run charity MusiCares; they will share the stage with Lorde, Harry Styles, Haim and other A-list fans. The second-hottest: \u201cElton John: I\u2019m Still Standing \u2014 A Grammy Salute,\u201d featuring performances by Kesha, Sam Smith, Miley Cyrus and Sir Elton himself at the relatively cozy Theater at Madison Square Garden. These shows aren\u2019t cheap, but they will surely be memorable.\n\n800-745-3000, msg.com\n\nFRUIT & FLOWERS at Rough Trade NYC (Jan. 28, 7:30 p.m.). This Brooklyn psych-rock group was named one of 2016\u2019s hardest-working local acts by one website after playing upward of 30 shows in the city that year. It recently earned the same honor for 2017. Even if such metrics do little to convince you of a band\u2019s artistic merit, though, Fruit & Flowers are worth a listen: Their recent EP \u201cDrug Tax\u201d is full of dark little hooks that are easy to hum along with and harder to forget.\n\n888-929-7849, roughtrade.com/us", "title": "Pop, Rock and Jazz in NYC This Week", "authors": []}

This group\u2019s most recent album, \u201cAmerican Tragic,\u201d from 2015, is a minor masterpiece of darkly glamorous goth-pop. If you didn\u2019t hear it then, it\u2019s not too late to discover its delights now \u2014 and you\u2019ll be ahead of the game when Wax Idols\u2019 follow-up, \u201cHappy Ending,\u201d which the band\u2019s charismatic singer-songwriter, Hether Fortune, has described as a macabre concept LP, arrives later this year.

Three years after the death at 26 of the estimable hip-hop tastemaker and impresario Steven Rodriguez, known to the world as ASAP Yams, the circle of uptown New York rappers that orbited him \u2014 collectively dubbed ASAP Mob \u2014 remains a hub of exciting new ideas and throwback joys. The group will celebrate Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s memory on Saturday with the third annual Yams Day concert, held this year at a cavernous convention center in the Bronx, with a portion of proceeds going to the Always Strive and Prosper Foundation, a substance-abuse education organization founded by Yams\u2019s mother. Expect dynamic performances from the crew\u2019s torchbearers, ASAP Rocky and ASAP Ferg, as well as some high-profile friends: Lil Yachty and Nav are among the confirmed guests.\n\n888-929-7849, asapmob.com\n\nSIMON VOZICK-LEVINSON\n\nPhoto\n\nJazz\n\nHARRIS EISENSTADT\u2019S \u2018POSCHIAVO 50\u2019 AND PLAY at the Owl (Jan. 18, 7:30 p.m.). Mr. Eisenstadt, a drummer, is also possessed of a cinematic compositional voice. He wrote 50 short pieces during a residency at the Uncool Festival in Switzerland last year, and he\u2019s been gradually unveiling them at the Owl, playing one show per month since November. For each concert he\u2019s enlisted one or two different collaborators; at this one he\u2019ll be joined by two fellow percussionists: Patricia Brennan on vibraphone and Chris Dingman on marimba. Also on the bill is Play, a trio led by the drummer Vinnie Sperrazza and featuring the pianist Jacob Sacks and the bassist Masa Kamaguchi. Play investigates the repertoires of mid-20th-century composers, usually in a briskly swinging style.\n\n718-774-0042, theowl.nyc\n\nBILLY HARPER QUINTET at Smoke (Jan. 12-14; 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Harper was of the most consistently exciting tenor saxophonists to emerge in the late 1960s and early \u201970s. He seemed to wield his horn like hot iron; his book of compositions, meanwhile, read as an insurrectionary tract, while fusing concepts from John Coltrane and Joe Henderson. His powers are undiminished, though we haven\u2019t seen a leadership recording from him in roughly a decade, and he does not headline his own shows in New York often enough. Catch him here with Freddie Hendrix on trumpet, Francesca Tanksley on piano, Hwansu Kang on bass and Aaron Scott on drums.\n\n212-864-6662, smokejazz.com\n\nTOM HARRELL at the Village Vanguard (through Jan. 21, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Harrell boasts a smoky surety on both trumpet and flugelhorn; at 71, he\u2019s making some of the best music of his career, employing his bop-Romantic sensibility in midsize ensembles that feature some fabulous supporting actors. Through Sunday, he performs with Danny Grissett on piano, Ugonna Okegwo on bass and Adam Cruz on drums. After a break on Monday, the band plays six more nights with Jaleel Shaw joining on alto saxophone, and the drummer Joe Dyson subbing for Mr. Cruz.\n\n212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the fall Mr. Harrold released a bold, expansive album, \u201cThe Mugician.\u201d It finds his trumpet coaxing an electrified ensemble into all sorts of approaches \u2014 slow-jam, vague Caribbean groove, contemporary jazz balladry \u2014 then tearing into them with animated, inventive soloing. He will draw on that material here, likely with special guests. (The album features a long list of guest vocalists, and when he played the Blue Note last January, Mr. Harrold brought along the rapper Big K.R.I.T. and the vocalist Bilal.)\n\n212-475-8592, bluenote.net\n\nANNA WEBBER at the Jazz Gallery (Jan. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The compositions of Ms. Webber, a saxophonist and multi-reedist, play in fresh ways with chime and repetition and schematics. The synced-up interactions she has with her band don\u2019t feel clinical or bolted down; they\u2019re open and resonant and exposed to the wind. Here she leads a remarkable septet, featuring Jeremy Viner on tenor saxophone and clarinet, Jacob Garchik on trombone, Chris Hoffman on cello, Matt Mitchell on piano, Chris Tordini on bass and Ches Smith on drums and vibraphone.\n\n646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc\n\nWINTER JAZZFEST (through Jan. 17).

{"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "text": "On his flight back to Rome, Francis issued a rare apology for what he called a \u201cslap in the face\u201d to victims. He was referring to the crisis he had created in Chile when he said that he had seen no \u201cproof\u201d that a bishop covered up abuse.\n\n\u201cHere I have to apologize because the word \u2018proof\u2019 hurt them,\u201d he said on the plane. \u201cIt hurt a lot of abused people.\u201d He added: \u201cI know how much they suffer. And to hear that the pope told them to their face that they need to bring a letter with proof?\u201d\n\nBut then he wound up making an unclear distinction between proof and evidence, and offered a spirited defense of Bishop Juan Barros Madrid, the Chilean accused by some abuse victims of protecting the Rev. Fernando Karadima, a notorious Chilean pedophile priest.\n\nSome of those victims have said Bishop Barros witnessed the abuse and did nothing, an accusation he denies.\n\n\u201cSomeone who accuses insistently without evidence, this is calumny,\u201d the pope said. \u201cIf I say, \u2018You stole something, you stole something,\u2019 I\u2019m slandering you because I don\u2019t have evidence.\u201d\n\nThe pope revealed that he had twice rejected the resignation of Bishop Barros in recent years, explaining that while an investigation continued into the bishop, whom he appointed to the small diocese of Osorno in 2015, \u201cI cannot condemn him because I do not have the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am also convinced he is innocent,\u201d the pope added.\n\nThe pope\u2019s inaction and missteps on the issue seem to be drying up his once seemingly bottomless well of good will.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf he wanted evidence, why didn\u2019t he reach out to us when we were willing to reaffirm the testimony that not only us, but so many witnesses, have been providing for more than 15 years,\u201d said Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean victim of sexual abuse by members of the clergy.\n\nThe death last month in Rome of Cardinal Bernard F. Law, the disgraced face of a complicit church hierarchy that enabled sexual abuse, drew attention in the Vatican to a rift on the issue.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn one side are those who believe a policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d and accountability remain vital for the church\u2019s credibility and the protection of minors. On the other are those who feel that the church has already done enough on the issue, and that the problem is behind them and has become a cudgel used by enemies of the church.\n\nFor some advocates, Pope Francis this week moved decisively into the second camp. The website BishopAccountability.org said the pope had \u201cturned back the clock to the darkest days of this crisis.\u201d On Monday, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said in a statement that \u201cPope Francis has made his true feelings known.\u201d\n\nEmiliano Fittipaldi, an Italian investigative reporter who has looked into sexual abuse and who is the author of the book \u201cLust,\u201d said \u201cfor Francis, addressing sex abuse is priority in words, not actions.\u201d He said the pope\u2019s belief in zero tolerance seemed to evaporate when the accused were his friends.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Vatican scrapped a proposed tribunal to try bishops. Francis brought to Rome Cardinal George Pell, who subsequently became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic prelate to be formally charged with sexual offenses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn September, the Vatican recalled Msgr. Carlo Alberto Capella, a high-ranking priest working as a diplomat in the Holy See\u2019s embassy in Washington, after American authorities sought to strip his immunity and potentially charge him with possession of child pornography.\n\nLast month, the three-year terms of members of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which the pope created in 2014, expired without any news of renewed terms or appointments. Ms. Collins and another abuse survivor on the commission resigned. The pope said on the plane that he had received a list of possible new members and called the delay \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nCardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the archbishop of Boston \u2014 Cardinal Law\u2019s old diocese and ground zero for the global sexual abuse crisis \u2014 leads the commission. After the pope\u2019s defense of Bishop Barros, Cardinal O\u2019Malley released an extraordinary statement chastising the pontiff for doubting victims, calling it \u201ca source of great pain for survivors\u201d that relegates them \u201cto discredited exile.\u201d\n\nOn the plane, Francis thanked Cardinal O\u2019Malley for the statement, calling it \u201cvery just,\u201d and he defended his own record on the issue. He said that since the start of his pontificate he had refused to sign \u201ceven one\u201d request for a pardon from about 25 pedophile priests.\n\nHe sought to turn back the clock to happier days, reminding reporters that he landed in Chile expressing \u201cpain and shame\u201d for children abused by priests.\n\nBut many advocates for victims heard less truth in those prepared remarks than in the pope\u2019s off-the-cuff response to a Chilean reporter\u2019s question about whether Bishop Barros was complicit in covering up crimes of abuse.\n\n\u201cThe day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,\u201d Francis said before celebrating Mass outside the northern Chilean city of Iquique. \u201cBut there is not one single piece of evidence. It is all slander.

On Tuesday he will celebrate Mass at a major public park and meet with Ms. Bachelet, government officials, members of the diplomatic corps and Chilean bishops. He will go to Temuco the following day and then visit the northern city of Iquique on Thursday morning before flying to Lima, Peru.\n\nIn addition to the Mapuche, another source of controversy around the visit is the issue of the complicity of Chilean bishops in the case of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, the former head of El Bosque parish in Santiago, who catered to the elite while abusing teenage boys. The Vatican found Father Karadima guilty of sexual abuse in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of penitence and prayer. The church sentence was the only punishment leveled against the abusive priest. Victims were unsuccessful in an effort to get compensation through civil litigation. But no actions have been taken against the tight circle of bishops whom he trained, and who victims say covered up his crimes.\n\nIn January 2015 Pope Francis appointed one of them, Juan Barros, as bishop of Osorno, 570 miles south of the capital, prompting protests by lay and religious groups that continue to this day.\n\nOn Thursday, The Associated Press revealed a letter sent by Pope Francis to the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference that same month after they expressed concern over the appointment. Francis told them that he had planned to offer a sabbatical to Bishop Barros and two other bishops with ties to Father Karadima in order to cool the heated environment over his controversial appointment.

Mr. Figari is in Rome, and the Vatican has instructed him not to return to Peru.\n\nOn Saturday, Sean O\u2019Malley, an American cardinal, criticized the pope for comments he made about sexual abuse cases on an earlier stop in Chile. There, Francis had defended Bishop Juan Barros Madrid, whom he had appointed in 2015 and who is accused of protecting abusers.

He apologized for demanding proof from alleged victims, saying that the word was insensitive, but then reiterated that there was no \u201cevidence\u201d against the bishop, who he again said was the victim of slander.\n\nSome victims of Father Karadima, a powerful priest convicted by the Vatican in 2011 for sexually abusing minors, have accused Bishop Barros of standing by as the priest kissed and abused them in the El Bosque Catholic parish.\n\nOn the plane, Francis said he had twice refused to accept the resignation of Bishop Barros, and in January 2015 he moved the bishop from leading Chile\u2019s military ordinariate to the diocese of Osorno. The installation fractured the faithful and clergy of the city, with many opposing a bishop they considered complicit in sexual abuse.\n\nThe pope\u2019s response mystified observers and vexed his supporters. Possible explanations tumbled out. Was he getting bad advice from his cardinal advisers? Was he protecting a friend? Was he a member of a Vatican faction that believes in \u201czero tolerance\u201d or one that considers the abuse issue finished business? Was the pope, someone who faced accusations of supporting a violent regime as a cardinal in Argentina, loath to give into public pressure?\n\nTuesday\u2019s statement suggested that public pressure had forced the pope to act and that far from infallible, Francis had perhaps spoken in Chile without knowing what he was talking about.", "title": "Pope Francis, After Criticism, Sends Sex Crimes Investigator to Chile", "authors": []}

They could take a single photograph and make two postcards from it \u2014 say, \u201cLondon by Day\u201d and \u201cLondon by Night.\u201d\n\nThey could also create what are known as \u201cexaggerations.\u201d Exaggeration cards at the hotel that day featured, for example, giant apples rolling through an otherwise realistic scene, and an enormous fish rising from the water and tipping a fisherman\u2019s boat (\u201cA fight with a mad pickrel,\u201d read the handwritten caption, from 1911).\n\nWhile collectors browsed in the conference room, a few women came in carrying thick, brown photo albums, which eventually formed a leaning tower in one corner.

{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "Economists have long debated how corporate tax cuts are distributed among shareholders, workers and customers. President Trump and other backers of the tax bill have argued that it will lead to higher wages, more jobs and greater investment. Independent analysts, however, have tended to assume that most of the gains will go to shareholders, especially in the short term.\n\nFor utilities and other regulated industries, however, the situation is different. They are granted a legal monopoly, but in return are expected to see that their customers benefit from any savings.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re insulated from market competition and subject to regulation, the benefits should mostly pass through to consumers,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean customers should expect every dollar in tax savings to show up as savings in their monthly bills. Some states may allow utilities to use part of their savings to fund infrastructure upgrades or to offset future rate increases. And utilities may challenge regulators\u2019 findings about how much they have saved as a result of the tax bill.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bordoff said there might be one good reason for utilities to hold rates constant, as opposed to reducing them. Consumers, he noted, tend to react angrily to rate hikes \u2014 so if a utility knows it needs to make investments in the years to come, it might be better to use the tax savings to do so now, instead of cutting rates only to increase them later.\n\nDavid Springe, executive director of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, said regulators in most states would be willing to negotiate with utilities. But one way or another, he said, any tax savings should ultimately benefit consumers, not shareholders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe simple underlying absolute is that\u2019s consumer money and should in some form or fashion come back to consumers,\u201d Mr. Springe said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After the last major overhaul of the corporate tax system, in the mid-1980s, regulators in many states were slow to act \u2014 in effect allowing utilities to pocket tax savings until new rates took effect.\n\nSome states are trying to prevent that from happening again. Some state utility regulators, such as those in Montana and South Dakota, have ordered their utilities to calculate the windfall they will receive from the tax bill, with an eye toward negotiating lower rates for consumers or freezes in future rate increases. Elsewhere, local industry groups or consumer advocates have begun pressing regulators to act.

At that time, it is all but certain to give Mr. Xi a second, five-year term as president and to appoint a new government leadership lineup to support him.\n\nThe four people were a Chinese government official, a Chinese-American business executive who often meets senior politicians in Beijing, a foreign executive who has met Mr. Wang, and a former United States government official who has met him several times, including last year. They all requested anonymity to avoid damaging ties with Chinese leaders.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, reported in December that Mr. Wang could be appointed vice president.\n\nIn China, the vice presidency is a relatively weak position, and the current holder of the job, Li Yuanchao, has left barely any imprint. But in previous decades, the job was held by powerful politicians who influenced policy and supported the top leader: Yang Shangkun, for instance, a People\u2019s Liberation Army general who was close to Deng Xiaoping.

In the end, though, Mr. Wang stepped down and he has stayed out of the public eye since then.\n\nMr. Wang\u2019s extended political life may magnify speculation that Mr. Xi is looking to stay in power after his dual second terms as Communist Party chief and president end in 2022 and 2023. When Mr. Xi won his second term as party leader last year, he broke with recent precedent by not promoting a likely successor into the party\u2019s topmost body, the Politburo Standing Committee.

Now I\u2019m a senior preparing to graduate in the fall, and I want nothing more than to have them at my graduation ceremony.\n\nI\u2019m a United States citizen, as are my sisters. I first realized that my immigrant parents, who are not citizens, could be under attack during President Trump\u2019s candidacy. Before that, I\u2019d taken for granted that my parents would remain protected. After all, their family is here. Their jobs are here. Their friends are here.\n\nBut then I saw Mr. Trump using the campaign to scapegoat all kinds of immigrants and refugees, and I realized that they might come after us, too. After the first presidential debate, my mom asked me if it was true that Mr. Trump could really take away T.P.S., and I didn\u2019t know how to respond. I was paralyzed by the prospect of telling them that we could lose this protection, and that our lives could be thrown into disarray and that we may be split apart.\n\nNow with T.P.S. ending, our family has to think seriously about what will happen if my parents are sent back to El Salvador. My No. 1 concern is my parents\u2019 survival. We know how difficult the situation is in El Salvador, considered among the most violent countries in the world. We have family members who have been threatened, and that fear kept my parents from trying to visit their native land for years. What\u2019s more, my parents may be too old to find decent jobs there.\n\nI fear for my younger sisters. At 18 and 20, they still need my parents. After the news this week, one of my sisters offered to take a semester off to work and raise money for our family, knowing that we may need savings to get through this difficult time, especially if my parents are forced to relocate.

The forum\u2019s theme \u2014 \u201cCreating a shared future in a fractured world\u201d \u2014 could have been a subtitle for couture, as the old organization and differentiation of the various fashion genres is, indeed, fracturing, and often in very confusing ways. This week, for example, featured not only the usual spring couture but also two collections by brands most associated with New York \u2014 who were showing their fall ready-to-wear.\n\nFall ready-to-wear? Beware of whiplash.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth Proenza Schouler and Rodarte say the decision to swap cities and time periods, (made for the first time last season), has been good for business: They can deliver earlier, and benefit from retailers with full pocketbooks. Though it does raise the stakes for the designers, to make something that is worth everyone waiting months, when it will finally hit shops.\n\nSo did they? Sort of.\n\nIn both cases, the clothes were good \u2014 polished, smart, signature \u2014 but, though Paris is often positioned as a place to raise the creativity game, this was more like maintenance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Proenza, the designers Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough effectively recreated Manhattan on the Seine via a grimy industrial warehouse space apparently under construction, benches placed atop bags of cement mix, and then sent out an urban warrior collection of swaddling teddy bear coats; skinny tie-dye tribal turtlenecks mixed with leather patchwork skirts and big grommet belts; leather and chenille macram\u00e9 finished in extravagant fringe; and prairie dresses with graphic cutouts at the upper ribs and stomach.\n\nMeanwhile, at Rodarte, Kate and Laura Mulleavy \u2014 just off their first feature film, \u201cWoodshock,\u201d as writers-directors \u2014 took a break from the catwalk and instead created a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in an airy showroom, the better to display their trademark high romance dresses in macaron shades and tiers of pointillist netting (some veiling an underlayer of nude sequins for a suggestion of shine), plus their ode to Santa Cruz sweats, splashed with the tongue-in-cheek logo \u201cRadarte.\u201d", "title": "Proenza Schouler and Rodarte Bring Fall Styles to Paris", "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"]}

Publicly funded transportation upgrades or job-training programs, for example, can help entice companies while also benefiting existing businesses. Tax credits aimed at revitalizing abandoned, polluted or blighted areas can encourage development that eventually expands a city\u2019s tax base.\n\nThat is essentially the approach taken by New York, another Amazon finalist. Alicia Glen, the city\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said Amazon would probably get hardly any tax breaks if it chose to locate its second headquarters in Midtown or Lower Manhattan, the city\u2019s two traditional business centers. But the company would get tax breaks if it selected less-established sites in Brooklyn or Queens. Those incentives, she noted, are available to any company that locates in those areas, although New York State could also offer its own tax breaks.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t rely on incentives, but we do have incentives in place to encourage companies to go to parts of the city that they might not otherwise consider,\u201d Ms. Glen said.\n\nOther cities, though, may already be buckling to the competitive pressure. After New Jersey announced its incentive package, Maryland countered with its own $5 billion package. Few packages rival those bids in scale, but other cities have come up with their own creative offerings. Columbus, Ohio, for example, would waive all property taxes for Amazon for 15 years, subject to certain conditions, and would give back a share of the income taxes paid by Amazon\u2019s employees to the company in cash.\n\nMany cities have kept the details of their bids under wraps, but have left little doubt that they are open to negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be outbid on Amazon doing business here,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas. \u201cWe dream no small dreams here. We want to be the biggest and the best.\u201d\n\nBut even in Texas, there are limits.\n\nNelson W. Wolff, the county executive whose domain includes San Antonio, said he would have loved to see Amazon open its new headquarters there, but he was not interested in breaking the bank to make it happen. In a letter to Mr. Bezos in October, Mr. Wolff and Ron Nirenberg, San Antonio\u2019s mayor, said the city would sit out the process and instead invest its resources in education and housing.\n\n\u201cI knew it was going to be a big bloody incentive war,\u201d Mr. Wolff said, \u201cand I just didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to play in that kind of game.\u201d", "title": "Promising Billions to Amazon: Is It a Good Deal for Cities?", "authors": []}

Though Mr. Guzm\u00e1n was eventually caught and served eight years in prison, he was able to maintain \u2014 even grow \u2014 his empire, prosecutors have said.

In the early 2000s, new extradition laws were passed in Colombia, putting the country\u2019s traffickers at risk for prosecution in the United States. As a result, the government says, the Colombians abandoned their American distribution routes. Mr. Guzm\u00e1n stepped into the vacuum, prosecutors said, and soon created his own routes in New York, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois and Georgia.\n\nWith profits pouring in at \u201cstaggering levels,\u201d prosecutors said, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n began to extend his operations not only in the United States and Mexico, but also in Honduras, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama, where he established a series of secret landing strips and started using submarines capable of shipping up to six tons of cocaine. Soon after, the government said, he embedded operatives in South America to guard his supply chain and diversified his business into heroin and marijuana. When he became interested in dealing methamphetamine, he dispatched associates to India and China, according to the government, to search for the ingredients that were used to make the drug.\n\nIt was during this period that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n became the mythic figure he remains today \u2014 \u201ca modern-day Robin Hood,\u201d the government said, beloved by \u201cthe downtrodden and extolled in popular songs.\u201d Prosecutors said he surrounded himself with professional assassins who killed and tortured his rivals, and personally carried a gold-plated AK-47 and a diamond-encrusted pistol. According to court papers, he once gave a $1 million bribe \u2014 in cash \u2014 to Mexican law-enforcement officers to protect a single drug shipment.\n\nBut as Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s infamy increased, so did the efforts to catch him. In 2014, the Mexican special forces tracked him down to a house in Culiac\u00e1n, but ultimately lost him when he escaped through a hatch in his bathtub that led to a maze of tunnels he had built inside the sewer system. After a monthslong search, he was captured in Mazatl\u00e1n and put back into prison. In 2015, however, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escaped again \u2014 this time, through a mile-long tunnel dug into the shower of his cell. A video made at the time showed him, as prosecutors have put it, \u201ccalmly descending a ladder into the tunnel where a motorcycle was waiting.\u201d\n\nThe United States attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn indicted Mr. Guzm\u00e1n in absentia in 2009, but after he was rearrested in 2016 \u2014 found in his undershirt and covered in filth near a Walmart in the city of Los Mochis \u2014 they filed a series of additional charges. Those were used to win his extradition from Mexico last January.

But the 1973 Church Amendment, the first of these conscience clauses, is broader. Rather than sheltering medical personnel from workplace discrimination only when they refuse to provide abortions and sterilizations, this law also protects those who are willing to do so.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services seems to have forgotten these inclusive roots.\n\nIn their zeal to underscore the need for strong conscience protections, none of the speakers unveiling the Conscience and Religious Freedom Division mentioned physicians like Willie Parker, an obstetrician/gynecologist who views providing abortion as religious ministry. But Dr. Parker and his colleagues face enormous obstacles to acting upon their moral convictions. Despite Church Amendment protections, abortion providers are often denied admitting privileges and threatened with adverse employment actions, and they face difficulty getting training. That these obstacles were not highlighted by the department is telling, suggesting that its new enforcement efforts are unlikely to safeguard these exercises of conscience.\n\nHealth care workers seeking to provide services to the transgender community \u2014 care that can be lifesaving \u2014 can also face substantial roadblocks despite their belief in an ethical and professional obligation to act in their patients\u2019 best interest. For example, when Lindsey Dawson set out to provide a hysterectomy to a transgender patient seeking to transition, her efforts were impeded by the Catholic hospital where she practiced. Being forced to refrain from care \u2014 like being forced to provide it \u2014 can conflict with a person\u2019s sense of moral duty. As Dr. Daphna Stroumsa, another physician serving transgender patients, explained to us, \u201cAs a matter of conscience, I am called to do this work.\u201d\n\nIf the new division is as serious about protecting conscience as it claims to be, it should commit to enforcing the Church Amendment\u2019s existing protections for both refusers and providers of abortion and sterilization services, as Congress intended. More generally, it should recognize that conscientious providers encounter legal and institutional barriers to acting on their convictions. The department should encourage Congress to emulate the Church Amendment\u2019s bidirectional protection in all federal conscience clauses and should use its own policymaking authority to protect providers seeking to promote patient access.\n\nIn a landscape littered with obstacles to care, patient access is critical. Yet in the department\u2019s 216-page proposal, patient access is barely addressed outside a request for public comment as to whether \u201cthe existence or expansion of rights to exercise religious beliefs or moral convictions\u201d will affect patient outcomes or result in \u201cunjustified limitation\u201d of access to care.", "title": "Opinion | Protecting Conscientious Providers of Health Care", "authors": []}

This was his third suit against the puppet show, which he previously sued for a skit on the novel \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d A judge threw out that case.\n\nWhen Mr. Sabry succeeds, however, the consequences can be far-reaching.\n\nA clerical televangelist known as Sheikh Mizo, who irked Mr. Sabry with his teachings, was jailed for five years in February.

Khaled Ali, a leftist lawyer, is likely the only real challenger to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in elections scheduled for March, even if few believe he can win.\n\nBut his chances are further hampered by his conviction last year on charges filed by Mr. Sabry for having made an obscene gesture outside a Cairo courthouse. If Mr. Ali\u2019s appeal, scheduled for March 7, fails, he will automatically be disqualified from the presidential race.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCritics say legal crusaders like Mr. Sabry are not only choking the precious little free speech that remains in Egypt, but are hurting one of Egyptians\u2019 proudest attributes \u2014 their ability to laugh at themselves.\n\n\u201cWe are the funny Arabs, the ones who take nothing seriously,\u201d said Hafsa Halawa, a legal expert. \u201cAnd now even that is disappearing.\u201d\n\nMr. Sabry, for his part, relishes his role as moral enforcer. \u201cPeople fear me,\u201d he said.\n\nHe works from an eccentrically appointed office in Cairo\u2019s old city crowded with dozens of tiny figurines, including Roman emperors, Abraham Lincoln, London beefeaters, and the Pope, as well as part of his collection of 3,400 toy cars, carefully arranged on a conference table.\n\nHe stays up late into the night, monitoring a giant television over his desk or prowling the internet on his iPad, looking for anyone he deems to have offended Egypt or Mr. Sisi. For research he turns to his archive: eight rooms filled with towering piles of newspapers and magazines, dating to the 1970s, that provide additional ammunition against his targets.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cJust in case I need to find out what they said previously,\u201d he explained on a tour of the dust-filled chambers. \u201cTo expose their flip-flops.\u201d\n\nSuch an intense pace of work leaves limited time with his wife, Mr. Sabry admitted, but he was never much of a romantic. \u201cAll this love and hand holding \u2014 enough,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows this is my passion. In any case I buy her gifts \u2014 diamond rings, a necklace and a BMW. It makes for a happy marriage.\u201d\n\nHis ardor for Mr. Sisi, though, is virtually boundless. Both men were born in nearby Gamaliyah, among the winding alleys of the old city, where Mr. Sisi\u2019s father was a trader. When Mr. Sisi, then a general, came to power in 2013, Mr. Sabry said, he offered Mr. Sisi advice over drinks at the Heliopolis Club, and later interviewed him for a newspaper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But officials at Boston University, contacted by The New York Times, said they had no record of Mr. Sabry and that they do not offer a Ph.D. in commercial law.\n\nPressed about his claim, Mr. Sabry pointed to a framed certificate issued by Constantinian University \u2014 an educational establishment with an official address at a house in Lincoln, R.I., that, on its website, calls itself \u201can honorary institution.\u201d\n\nMr. Sabry works in a crowded field. In November another lawyer made waves when he moved against \u201cSheikh Jackson,\u201d Egypt\u2019s nomination for best foreign picture at this year\u2019s Oscars, which tells the story of a young cleric who dances like Michael Jackson. The film\u2019s lead actor is being sued for contempt of religion.\n\nLast month another lawyer brought a prosecution that landed a minor pop star named Shyma in jail for two years for a video in which she appeared to fellate a banana.\n\nThis week, an Alexandria lawyer, Tariq Mahmood, filed a complaint against The New York Times, accusing it of undermining Egyptian security over an article about a secret effort by Egyptian intelligence to sway public opinion in favor of President Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. On Tuesday, Egypt\u2019s prosecutor general ordered a criminal investigation into the article.\n\nMr. Sabry is generally dismissive of rival litigants, whom he considers inferior patriots, but they give as good as they get. \u201cWhere is he getting his money from?\u201d asks Ahmed Mahran, a lawyer who helped foment a crackdown on gay people last fall when he lodged a complaint against several people who had waved rainbow flags at a concert. \u201cCould it be the security agencies?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother lawyer, Nabeeh el-Wahsh, disparaged Mr. Sabry as a blowhard who uses the cases as \u201ca chance to get famous.\u201d\n\nMr. Sabry denied the accusations, and insisted that he personally finances his lawsuits with no help from the government.\n\nHe claims that two-thirds of his prosecutions have resulted in convictions, an estimate that seems high. But even when his lawsuits collapse, they can have a chilling impact on free speech. Khaled Dawoud, a journalist targeted by Mr. Sabry, said that although he escaped unscathed, the threat of revived criminal charges is ever-present.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a sword hanging over my head,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch measures are finding favor in Mr. Sisi\u2019s government. Legislation currently before Parliament would make it easier for the authorities to strip dissidents of their citizenship, which one former member of Parliament has likened to Nazi-era laws.\n\nMr. Sabry sees it as a positive development. \u201cGood news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will keep us busy.\u201d", "title": "Protecting His Nation From Puppeteers and Belly Dancers", "authors": ["Declan Walsh", "The Saturday Profile"]}

That\u2019s what I find myself wondering as I hear story after story of adult women who helplessly acquiesce to sexual demands. I find it especially curious given that a majority of women I know have been in situations in which men have come on to them \u2014 at work or otherwise. They have routinely said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested\u201d or \u201cGet your hands off me right now.\u201d And they\u2019ve taken the risk that comes with it.\n\nThe fact that such unwelcome advances persist, and often in the office, is, yes, evidence of sexism and the abusive power of the patriarchy. But I don\u2019t believe that scattershot, life-destroying denunciations are the way to upend it. In our current climate, to be accused is to be convicted. Due process is nowhere to be found.\n\nAnd what exactly are men being accused of? What is the difference between harassment and assault and \u201cinappropriate conduct\u201d? There is a disturbing lack of clarity about the terms being thrown around and a lack of distinction regarding what the spectrum of objectionable behavior really is. Shouldn\u2019t sexual harassment, for instance, imply a degree of hostility? Is kissing someone in affection, however inappropriately, or showing someone a photo of a nude male torso necessarily predatory behavior?\n\nI think this confusion reflects a deeper ambivalence about how we want and expect people to behave. Expressing sexual interest is inherently messy and, frankly, nonconsensual \u2014 one person, typically the man, bites the bullet by expressing interest in the other, typically the woman \u2014 whether it happens at work or at a bar. Some are now suggesting that come-ons need to be constricted to a repressive degree. Asking for oral consent before proceeding with a sexual advance seems both innately clumsy and retrograde, like going back to the childhood game of \u201cMother, May I?\u201d We are witnessing the re-moralization of sex, not via the Judeo-Christian ethos but via a legalistic, corporate consensus.\n\nStripping sex of eros isn\u2019t the solution. Nor is calling out individual offenders, one by one. We need a broader and more thoroughgoing overhaul, one that begins with the way we bring up our sons and daughters.\n\nThese are scary times, for women as well as men. There is an inquisitorial whiff in the air, and my particular fear is that in true American fashion, all subtlety and reflection is being lost.

This is about access, and for whatever reason, which I don\u2019t know and can\u2019t speculate on, but for whatever reason, the Trump administration was comfortable having Michael in the White House, and he was in the White House all the time.\n\nNews organizations and administration officials have pointed out some factual errors in the book.

But now we\u2019ve seen such a big distortion of the process.\u201d\n\nOne reason is the emergence of mapping software that can draw precise lines to maximize any desired outcome. Another is that the Republicans outsmarted the Democrats in the 2010 elections. The Republican Party focused on 18 states in which control of the state legislature was close. Republicans picked up 22 new state legislative chambers just in time for the 2011 redistricting \u2014 and were able to draw the districts for 193 seats in the House of Representatives. The Democrats controlled redistricting for 44. Control of the rest was either split between the parties or nonpartisan.\n\nThat\u2019s why in Virginia\u2019s state government elections two months ago, Democrats didn\u2019t get to control the Legislature even though they won the statewide popular vote by nine points, a landslide. It\u2019s why Michigan Republicans got 16 more seats in their State Legislature than Democrats in 2016, even though the total vote in the state legislative races split down the middle. It\u2019s why North Carolina\u2019s Republican congressional candidates won 10 out of 13 seats with just 53 percent of the total vote. Democrats also gerrymandered in some states where they got the chance, Maryland being the starkest example. They just didn\u2019t have many chances.\n\nStates will redraw the lines anew in 2021. This time, the Democrats aren\u2019t napping. Former Attorney General Eric Holder leads the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which seeks independent redistricting commissions but also wants to elect Democrats.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s judgment is the latest in a series this month. One group of federal judges ruled that North Carolina\u2019s congressional districts had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered for partisan advantage \u2014 the first-ever such ruling. A day later, a different panel found the opposite in Pennsylvania, but that was before the new judgment came down Monday from the state Supreme Court. Other state courts are dealing with lawsuits as well, and the United States Supreme Court has heard arguments on gerrymandering cases from Wisconsin and Maryland.\n\nThen there are nonpartisan citizen campaigns that have nothing to do with Holder\u2019s group. Michigan\u2019s is the furthest along, but citizens are also organizing for ballot initiatives in Ohio, Missouri, Utah, Colorado and South Dakota. In Pennsylvania and Virginia, grass-roots groups sprang up to persuade legislators to establish independent commissions. Other gerrymandered states are still waiting for their Katie Fahey.\n\nFair Districts PA is an arm of the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit that yielded Monday\u2019s ruling. The group will continue to campaign for fairer districts for the state Legislature, which was not covered in the lawsuit, and to insure a fairly drawn Congressional map.

If the case survives this stage, then its settlement value increases substantially because of the potential for more embarrassing information to come to light during the discovery phase.\n\nBusinesses have been hostile to RICO because of the threat of a triple-damage award, and Congress has been receptive to efforts to limit the scope of the law. The dismissal last month of a RICO lawsuit against the private equity financier Lynn Tilton, the so-called Diva of Distress, shows how the law has been limited to keep some disputes out of the federal courts.\n\nThat RICO claim was filed by three funds that Ms. Tilton and her firm, Patriarch Partners, created to raise more than $2.5 billion from the sale of collateralized loan obligations in which the proceeds were used to invest in distressed companies. The funds, named Zohar, claimed that she had misled them about a significant deterioration in the loans and misappropriated the equity in the companies for her own benefit, which constituted mail and wire fraud by stealing their interests.\n\nThe RICO case came on the heels of an administrative enforcement action filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015. The S.E.C. accused Ms. Tilton of violating the Investment Advisers Act by reporting misleading values for the funds\u2019 investments to collect larger management fees. An S.E.C. administrative law judge ruled in her favor by dismissing the case in September, and the agency decided not to appeal that decision, leaving her victory intact.\n\nOn Dec. 29, a federal district judge dismissed the RICO claim against her because it ran afoul of an amendment adopted by Congress back in 1995 to limit the scope of the statute. The amendment precludes filing RICO claims if they \u201crely upon any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation.\u201d In other words, if the alleged violations involve securities fraud, they cannot survive a motion to dismiss even if they could constitute mail or wire fraud.\n\nThough the funds artfully avoided using the term \u201csecurities\u201d in the RICO claim, the judge in the case, William H. Pauley III, concluded that he \u201ccannot ignore allegations that an integral component of that scheme to loot included pillaging portfolio companies of their equity, redirecting Zohar\u2019s equity interests for defendants\u2019 benefit and diverting the equity distributions into defendants\u2019 coffers \u2014 all actions coinciding with the purchase or sale of securities.\u201d So while there might have been fraud, it was close enough to securities transactions that the case had to be dismissed.\n\nRICO lawsuits are tempting. They allow a plaintiff to sue a variety of defendants by claiming that they acted together and seek an award of triple damages, a bonanza in some business disputes that can run into millions of dollars. But these cases should also come with a bright red warning sign: Tread lightly or see your case thrown out of court before it even gets started.", "title": "RICO Lawsuits Are Tempting, but Tread Lightly", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "Commenters unanimously answered in the affirmative for our Student Opinion question \u201cDo Companies Have a Responsibility to Contribute Positively to Society?\u201d\n\nLeah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., said C.E.O.s should work in unison with other employees:\n\nI feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO\u2019s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will \u201cstop significant touch-ups of images\u201d.\n\nJosh Failla of Wilmington, N.C., thinks about the topic often:\n\nEvery weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world. The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don\u2019t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone.\n\nMeghan Miraglia from Massachusetts said business needs to evolve:\n\nThe world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the \u201cgive me this, give me that\u201d norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. \u201cWhere does this product come from?\u201d, \u201cIs this brand cruelty-free?\u201d, \u201cDoes this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?\u201d, and \u201cHow does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?\u201d are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed. Even if a company isn\u2019t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us.\n\nHee Yun Chung from California cited companies that have made a difference:\n\nI think in the past, companies didn\u2019t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities. One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company\u2019s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create \u201ca new capitalism\u201d by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don\u2019t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate. When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years.\n\nBella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., has made personal changes in shopping choices:\n\nWhen it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it\u2019s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase. For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no \u2018Our Story\u2019 page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That\u2019s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren\u2019t as fortunate as me.\n\nAnna Cross from Wilmington, N.C., quoted an American economist:\n\nMilton Friedman said \u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities\u201d, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative. It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called \u201cGen X\u201d, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn\u2019t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it.\n\nFrancesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., wants companies to be held accountable:\n\nThe extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that \u201cmake short term sense\u201d but eventually threaten their \u201clong term viability,\u201d as said by Jana in the article. Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock\u2019s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, \u201cWe know that we\u2019re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!\u201d, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I\u2019ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it.\n\nLogan Bolduc from Wilmington, N.C., wrote about the key role that shoppers play:\n\nI think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap?\n\n_________", "title": "Race in America, College Amenities and Loneliness: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

To choose to find and speak the truth, no matter what it cost.\n\nAs the calls began coming in to the Michigan State University Police Department and the number of reports grew, my horror did as well. Victim after victim came forward. Some were abused when they were as young as 6 years old. Some were victimized nearly three decades ago, others only days before my report was filed. Far worse, victims began to come forward who had tried to sound the alarm years before I walked into that M.S.U. clinic to meet the celebrated doctor. Not only were they suffering the devastation of sexual assault; they were suffering deep wounds from having been silenced, blamed and often even sent back for continued abuse.\n\nMore than 200 women have now alleged abuse by Larry Nassar. Even more staggering than that number is the revelation that at least 14 coaches, trainers, psychologists or colleagues had been warned of his abuse. What is truly stomach-turning is the realization that a vast majority of those victims were abused after his conduct was first reported by two teenagers to M.S.U.\u2019s head gymnastics coach as far back as 1997.\n\nSo how did this happen? How, for 30 years, did this monster manage to prey on little girls and young women without being caught?\n\nPartly it is because Larry was an expert predator. He was calculating, deliberate and a master manipulator. Much of the abuse, mine included, took place with our own mothers in the room, their view casually blocked by Larry, his hand hidden under a towel, a sheet or loose clothing.\n\nBut Larry\u2019s cunning is only a small piece of this story. Because most pedophiles present a wholesome persona, they are able to ingratiate themselves into communities. Research shows that pedophiles are also reported at least seven times on average before adults take the reports of abuse seriously and act on them. In many ways, the sexual assault scandal that was 30 years in the making was only a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem \u2014 the unwillingness to speak the truth against one\u2019s own community.", "title": "Opinion | Rachael Denhollander: The Price I Paid for Taking On Larry Nassar", "authors": []}

Finally, scrambling over the Sierras and across the San Joaquin Valley to San Francisco, we arrive at the edge of the continent, more than 100 miles, and tens of millions of years, short of the Cambrian world revealed in Central Park. Having reached the Pacific Ocean, we have covered 10 percent of earth\u2019s history.\n\nIt has been cynically observed by some politicians that over this vast scope of time, \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is always changing.\u201d Indeed, in our transcontinental walk through earth history, it\u2019s true. The planet\u2019s climate in those first few miles of our walk, through the freeze-thaw seesaw of the recent ice ages, is, in fact, far different from the carbon-dioxide infused wasteland inferno of the early Triassic, more than a thousand miles later. Over the grand sweep of earth history our planet has been many different worlds \u2014 a snowball earth colonized by sponges, a supercontinental broiler ruled by crocodile kin.\n\nBut during the brief window of the past few thousand years in which all of civilization has emerged \u2014 those first few steps in our journey \u2014 we\u2019ve enjoyed an almost miraculously equable interglacial climate, the most stable of the past several hundred thousand years. It\u2019s these pleasant few footsteps that allowed complex societies to blossom. But in the next few footsteps, we\u2019re projected to return to climates last seen hundreds, if not thousands of miles in our past.\n\nIn this century alone, a time scale so laughably brief as to effectively not exist to geologists, we could send the planet back to a climate system not seen for many millions of years. One study recently estimated that humanity has the capacity in the next few centuries to make the planet warmer than it has been in at least 420 million years.\n\nThe story of life on earth so far isn\u2019t one of a tidy march of progress, culminating in humanity\u2019s \u201cend of history.\u201d Other alien worlds have claimed this planet for unimaginably longer spans, relinquishing their place only under the duress of mind-bending episodes of chaos, like asteroid hits and large-scale volcanic activity.\n\nAnd contrary to some accounts of our current moment, we\u2019re not even the first, or only, organism to threaten the planet with mass extinction. At the end of the Ediacaran period, 540 million years ago, burrowing animals and filter feeders might have wiped out vast swathes of exotic life clinging to the seafloor. Almost 200 million years later at the end of the Devonian period, the evolution of trees might have driven such convulsions in climate and ocean chemistry that 97 percent of the world\u2019s vertebrates died.\n\nIn the next few decades we will decide whether humanity\u2019s legacy will be a sliver of clay in the limestone strata \u2014 a geological embarrassment accessible only in remote outcrops to eagle-eyed geologists of the far future \u2014 or an enduring new epoch like the reign of dinosaurs.

Thank you. Thank you all. O.K., O.K. Thank you, Reese. In 1964, I was a little girl sitting on the linoleum floor of my mother\u2019s house in Milwaukee, watching Anne Bancroft present the Oscar for best actor at the 36th Academy Awards. She opened the envelope and said five words that literally made history: \u201cThe winner is Sidney Poitier.\u201d Up to the stage came the most elegant man I had ever seen. I remember his tie was white, and of course his skin was black. And I\u2019d never seen a black man being celebrated like that. And I\u2019ve tried many, many, many times to explain what a moment like that means to a little girl \u2014 a kid watching from the cheap seats, as my mom came through the door bone-tired from cleaning other people\u2019s houses. But all I can do is quote and say that the explanation\u2019s in Sidney\u2019s performance in \u201cLilies of the Field\u201d: \u201cAmen, amen. Amen, amen.\u201d In 1982, Sidney received the Cecil B. DeMille Award right here at the Golden Globes, and it is not lost on me that at this moment there are some little girls watching as I become the first black woman to be given this same award.\n\nIt is an honor, and it is a privilege to share the evening with all of them, and also with the incredible men and women who\u2019ve inspired me, who\u2019ve challenged me, who\u2019ve sustained me and made my journey to this stage possible. Dennis Swanson, who took a chance on me for \u201cA.M. Chicago\u201d; Quincy Jones, who saw me on that show and said to Steven Spielberg, \u201cYes, she is Sophia in \u2018The Color Purple\u2019\u201d; Gayle, who\u2019s been the definition of what a friend is; and Stedman, who\u2019s been my rock \u2014 just a few to name. I\u2019d like to thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, because we all know that the press is under siege these days.\n\nBut we also know that it is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice. To tyrants and victims and secrets and lies. I want to say that I value the press more than ever before, as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this: What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. And I\u2019m especially proud and inspired by all the women who have felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories. Each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories that we tell. And this year we became the story. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry. It\u2019s one that transcends any culture, geography, race, religion, politics or workplace.\n\nSo I want tonight to express gratitude to all the women who have endured years of abuse and assault, because they \u2014 like my mother \u2014 had children to feed and bills to pay and dreams to pursue. They\u2019re the women whose names we\u2019ll never know. They are domestic workers and farmworkers; they are working in factories and they work in restaurants, and they\u2019re in academia and engineering and medicine and science; they\u2019re part of the world of tech and politics and business; they\u2019re our athletes in the Olympics and they\u2019re our soldiers in the military.\n\nAnd they\u2019re someone else: Recy Taylor, a name I know and I think you should know, too. In 1944, Recy Taylor was a young wife and a mother. She was just walking home from a church service she\u2019d attended in Abbeville, Ala., when she was abducted by six armed white men, raped and left blindfolded by the side of the road, coming home from church. They threatened to kill her if she ever told anyone, but her story was reported to the N.A.A.C.P., where a young worker by the name of Rosa Parks became the lead investigator on her case and together they sought justice. But justice wasn\u2019t an option in the era of Jim Crow. The men who tried to destroy her were never persecuted. Recy Taylor died 10 days ago, just shy of her 98th birthday. She lived, as we all have lived, too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. And for too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power of those men. But their time is up. Their time is up. Their time is up.\n\nAnd I just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing that her truth \u2014 like the truth of so many other women who were tormented in those years, and even now tormented \u2014 goes marching on. It was somewhere in Rosa Parks\u2019s heart almost 11 years later, when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery. And it\u2019s here with every woman who chooses to say, \u201cMe too.\u201d And every man \u2014 every man \u2014 who chooses to listen. In my career, what I\u2019ve always tried my best to do, whether on television or through film, is to say something about how men and women really behave: to say how we experience shame, how we love and how we rage, how we fail, how we retreat, persevere, and how we overcome. And I\u2019ve interviewed and portrayed people who\u2019ve withstood some of the ugliest things life can throw at you, but the one quality all of them seem to share is an ability to maintain hope for a brighter morning \u2014 even during our darkest nights.\n\nSo I want all the girls watching here and now to know that a new day is on the horizon! And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say, \u2018Me too\u2019 again.

Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.\n\nNow that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn\u2019t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn\u2019t represent my base\u2014he\u2019s only in it for himself.\n\nSteve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.\n\nWe have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down.", "title": "Read Trump\u2019s Reaction to Steve Bannon\u2019s Comments", "authors": ["The New York Times"]}

Reisinger, high school English teacher and English department chairwoman\n\nSchool: Central Bucks High School South, Bucks County, Pa.\n\nGrade level: 9-12\n\nWhy we chose it: \u201cIt struck me \u2026 that \u2018The Catcher in the Rye,\u2019 a book I\u2019d taught many times, was its own \u201836 Hours\u2019 \u2014 a travelogue of a teenage boy returning to his hometown for several days, escape on his mind, but seeing it as if for the first time,\u201d Ms. Reisinger writes.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen a lot of \u201cCatcher in the Rye\u201d lesson plans \u2014 in fact, we\u2019ve created our own \u2014 but this one is more creative, interesting and just plain fun than most. As students follow Holden on his journey through New York City and he begins to see his home anew, they also learn to see their own hometowns \u2014 and perhaps themselves \u2014 in a different light.\n\n_________\n\nWhat Ms. Reisinger Did and Why, in Her Own Words\n\nIntroduction\n\nPhoto\n\nMost teenagers are looking to escape: the small towns, big towns or cities they\u2019ve inhabited for years that have become unbearably provincial; the confines of their high schools that \u2014 no matter how big \u2014 suddenly become claustrophobically small; their own homes, where their parents, who care deeply for them, can\u2019t possibly understand them.\n\nI know this. I\u2019m one of those parents who live in one of those towns and send their daughters to one of those high schools. And I teach English to high school students who daily rail against the mundanity of their lives.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest with myself, I feel these same nascent pangs of wanderlust from time to time, which is why each week for years I have found great pleasure in spending part of my Sunday mornings reading the weekly installment of \u201c36 Hours\u201d in The Times\u2019s Travel section.\n\nOn one of these summer Sundays a year ago, reading Seth Sherwood\u2019s tour of Parma, Italy, I found myself, in a Holden Caulfield kind of way, imagining I was in the Camera di San Paolo. (Perhaps not clutching my wounded chest and staggering around, but certainly, in the same cinematographic way, sitting in my Missoni dress conversing with Correggio about plans for a vaulted stone ceiling in my master bath.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt struck me then for the first time that \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye,\u201d a book I\u2019d taught many times, was its own \u201c36 Hours\u201d \u2014 a travelogue of a teenage boy returning to his hometown for several days, escape on his mind, but seeing it as if for the first time. For Holden, the Museum of Natural History, the carousel in Central Park and Radio City Music Hall are thrown into sharp relief. (In fact, in 2010, The New York Times actually walked and mapped his route with quotes from the novel.)\n\nI began to see teaching \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d itself in a whole new way: as a potential parallel version of \u201c36 Hours\u201d and a vehicle for using the Times column as a mentor text to allow my students to try their hands at travel writing and all the voiceful, stylistic and structural techniques that come with it.\n\nAnd perhaps, also, to see their hometowns with new eyes.\n\n_________\n\nSeven Steps to Finished Columns\n\nPhoto\n\n1. Students begin, even before I announce the writing assignment, by examining the \u201c36 Hours\u201d articles over several class periods. I use laminated copies of the original print articles and hang them around the room. Working in groups of four, they first travel the world of my room, reading through the articles, chatting about the faraway places and generally gathering some initial ideas about how travel writing differs from other forms of writing they have encountered.\n\nOn subsequent days, students begin annotating the articles \u2014 noticing surface features, outlining specific structural and organizational elements, marking stylistic devices and talking about aspects of voice.\n\n2. During this time students also begin to read \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d so that on the day that I assign their \u201c36 Hours\u201d assignment we simultaneously find Holden returning, in Chapter 8, to New York. At this point, students generally think they have figured out that they will be writing a \u201c36 Hours\u201d article, and the room is abuzz with excitement. As a decoy, I even have students share the places in the world they would want to travel to write such an article.\n\nWhen I distribute the assignment sheet, there is a collective intake of breath as the students realize they will not, in fact, be writing an article about Canc\u00fan, Mexico or Disney World (the most commonly suggested exotic locales my students have experienced), but they will, instead, be writing a travel article about their own hometowns.\n\n3. After the initial shock wears off and I listen to the groans about how \u201cthere is nothing exciting about where we live\u201d and \u201cour town is so boring,\u201d I remind them that being a travel writer is about seeing something with new eyes and giving an old place a fresh look. It\u2019s also, as the assignment requires (and as all writing requires), about writing for a specific audience.\n\nIn this case, their \u201c36 Hours\u201d is to be written for a teenage audience \u2014 teenagers who have been dragged, unwillingly, to Bucks County, Pa., where my students have spent their whole lives, for a weekend with their parents. I encourage my students to write so that their audience feels lucky. Make them want to come back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n4. As we travel with Holden through Manhattan over the next week, my students, in teams of four, begin to travel through Bucks County, making decisions as travel journalists about where to send their audience to eat, play, learn and relax. They begin by making lists of eateries, outdoor spots, shopping locales and historic sites with which they are familiar, as the assignment requires at least one student to have visited the site either before or during the data gathering process. I tell students that just as the original \u201c36 Hours\u201d articles do not send travelers to chain restaurants and shopping malls, they must also avoid these kinds of businesses such that their audiences can experience their hometowns in the most authentic way possible.\n\nThey must also provide three original pictures to accompany the article as well as a guided map and an \u201cIf You Go\u201d section, so students begin to navigate maps, plan out driving routes and consider photo ops.\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Once students decide on their destinations, the legwork begins. Groups send their photographers out to snap photos and their reporters out to taste test pizzas and review the new skate park or visit that museum they once rolled their eyes at when they were 10. In between, we discuss Holden\u2019s visit to the ice skating rink and Central Park as we follow him on his own nostalgic journey.\n\n6. Once students gather their field notes, we return to the annotations we made earlier on the original articles and students work as teams of writers and editors to compose: They argue, revise, question, suggest and edit as a team, playing to one another\u2019s strengths. We use Office 365, which allows them to compose together and allows me to examine their work as they are writing, giving me the opportunity to make comments on their live documents from my desk in my room as they are working in class or from home as they compose remotely together. I also can keep track of which students are contributing what to the articles.\n\n7. Finished articles are printed in columns and mocked up on newsprint to imitate the actual \u201c36 Hours.\u201d As we finish the novel, they finish their travel writing, and all of us, just like Holden, see who we are and where we live in a whole new light.\n\nThe Results\n\nPhoto\n\nHere are excerpts from the work of two of my students to give you a sense of how the final pieces read:\n\nSugar Rush Imagine this on your Snapchat story: you come down after a long night\u2019s rest craving cherry danish and donuts. You hit the last stair to see a nice bowl of \u2026 Raisin Bran your mom just poured from the hotel grab-and-go breakfast? What on earth? So much for your two hundred day streak. Luckily, you are right down the street from the grand old Warrington Pasty Shop. Right at 1380 Easton Rd in Warrington you\u2019ll find breakfast prices that nobody can beat, which is perfect for your meager savings (that shopping trip last week did nothing for your bank account), and sweet morning treats that will make your molars shudder just the way you like. Their cookies are to die for, too, and if you can pass yourself off as a twelve-year old you might even get one for free. Night at the Museum Buried amongst the sleek cosmopolitan exterior of Doylestown\u2019s city center lies a real diamond in the rough: The Michener Museum. You may ask yourself how a museum could by anything more than the opposite of a good use of your time. You\u2019ll have to do the time to understand why \u2014 figuratively for you, thank goodness. You see, beyond being a chill hangout spot with mad intellectual stimulation on offer, this crib was also once a prison. Close your phone and open your eyes to really spot the remnants of this one-time correctional facility behind the spaces for artistic expression: wack bullet holes, a prison courtyard, isolation cells. If that\u2019s not dope I don\u2019t know what is. Only a chicken would be too scared to go \u2014 this place means you no harm or fowl, just fun.\n\n_________\n\nRelated Learning Network Lesson Plans\n\n36 Hours in Learning: Creating Travel Itineraries Across the Curriculum\n\nIdeas for English Language Learners | Recipes, Travel, Idioms and More\n\nText to Text | \u2018The Catcher in the Rye\u2019 and \u2018The Case for Delayed Adulthood\u2019", "title": "Reader Idea | 36 Hours in Your Hometown", "authors": ["Ondrea L.

I graduated from college four years ago; it was a dream come true for my mom. Now my commute is at best bearable if I get a seat on the train, but I\u2019ll always be thankful for the two-seaters on the C trains that introduced me to my mom. Kio Herrera, Washington Heights, Manhattan\n\nI love the New York subway system. I had a rough year of unemployment and found solace in the subway tunnels. With my monthly pass, I had access to a diversity of neighborhoods and culture, leading me to the end of all the lines. I discovered historical landmarks and community activities in the Bronx, the breathtaking views of Inwood, the magic of the 1964 World\u2019s Fair in Queens and the cultural roots deep in Brooklyn.\n\nEven the advertisements become part of the New York culture. The best friend I have made in the city sprang from a common interest and amusement over the \u201cIf you see something, say something\u201d campaign. It became a challenge to find the cars with our favorite vigilantes. This fun is amplified with the holiday vintage cars in December or at the Transit Museum, where you can see the classic \u201cSubway Sun\u201d ads more classily conveying, \u201cDude, stop the spread.\u201d Sharon Kapitula, Kips Bay, Manhattan\n\nHidden Gems\n\nThe subway often surprises New Yorkers with its never-ending pockets of entertainment.\n\nI was having a stressful day at work: long hours, lots of emails, short deadlines. On the way home, on the F train headed to the Lower East Side, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about work and was feeling anxious. A gentleman, who had to be in his late 20s or early 30s, got on the train and announced to everyone that he hoped we were all having a wonderful day. Of course, my first thought was, \u201cHere we go.\u201d Then he started singing and happened to have an amazing voice. While no one stared, you could tell the entire car was listening. He sang a soothing song, and for those few minutes, I legitimately felt my stress levels decrease drastically. The guy made my day and reminded me why I love this city.

Paige, East Village, Manhattan\n\nI lived in New York for five years, from 2003 to 2008, and I still have a subway memory that I think about all the time. It happened when I first moved to New York; I was just out of college and scared out of my mind to be in the city. The train ride took forever, so I would read. One day, I was reading \u201cNaked,\u201d by David Sedaris, and laughing hysterically out loud. Suddenly, the guy sitting right next to me started laughing out loud. I thought it was because of me, but then I looked at him and saw he was reading another David Sedaris book (\u201cMe Talk Pretty One Day\u201d)! I looked at his book, and he looked at mine, and we started laughing together. We didn\u2019t talk or exchange numbers. We both went back to our respective books and enjoyed the ride on that sunny summer day. It was such a nice shared moment and probably one of my best memories from my time in New York. Effie K., Inwood and the Flatiron district, Manhattan, and now Paris\n\nWhere New Yorkers Look Out for One Another\n\nMany readers remember a time when a stranger came to someone\u2019s aid while on the subway.\n\nOne night after celebrating the return of friends from abroad, I caught the 4 train headed uptown from Brooklyn. In the car was an older woman, a middle-aged man, a young woman, a passed-out man and a few others. The passed-out man\u2019s backpack was on the ground. We all looked at one another to see if he was O.K. Having some medical training, I went over and checked to see if he was breathing. He was, with a heavy odor of alcohol coming in waves off his breath. The young woman asked if he was going to be O.K. I said he was, and she smiled as I returned to my seat. As the doors opened at our next stop, she grabbed his backpack and sprinted away. The middle-aged man was off like lightning after her. The older woman jumped between a set of doors screaming, \u201cThief, thief!\u201d I jumped between a set of doors as well, hoping to delay the train until the bag returned. Within minutes, the middle-aged man ran back into the car, bag in hand. I roused the passed-out man and showed him his returned bag and pointed out the man who returned it. He gave a bleary smile and passed out again. A thunderous round of applause came from the other passengers, and those of us who helped rode the rest of the way home with smiles. Kunal, Upper East Side, Manhattan\n\nI was on the subway \u2014 the G, I think \u2014 and an older male stranger started talking to me, asking me increasingly personal questions. He was working around to asking for my number and making me visibly uncomfortable. It\u2019s the type of encounter I\u2019ve learned to selectively forget, and the only reason I still remember it is because of the middle-aged woman who, after watching from a few seats over, came over and asked, \u201cWill you be O.K.?\u201d before she exited at the next station. The look she gave me \u2014 a look that said, \u201cI\u2019m here to step in if you need me\u201d \u2014 moved me in a way I didn\u2019t expect, in this space where people usually keep to themselves and mind their own affairs. It was a moment that made me feel that perhaps this vast community of overworked strangers had my back after all. Tao Tao Holmes, Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe were stuck on the Q train in the tunnel between the Brooklyn Bridge and DeKalb Avenue. It was a long time without any information. A normal-looking man in a suit standing by the door started having a panic attack, basically freaking out. An older woman got out of her seat, went over to him and talked to him in a very calm and caring voice until the train finally started moving again. We applauded when the train doors opened at the station. He got out, and she stayed on. Random people asked her if she was a health care professional, but she was just a regular person who stepped up to help a stranger. It was a beautiful moment in an otherwise miserable commute. Betty, Brooklyn\n\nA Shared Sense of History\n\nFinally, many New Yorkers remember the subway being a place of support during moments of consequence.\n\nThe day after the 2016 presidential election, I cried with other subway riders \u2014 strangers \u2014 on the way to work. Soon after, people began putting up multicolored Post-it notes on the walls of one the walking tunnels at the 14th Street-Sixth Avenue stop. The messages, scrawled in Sharpie, ran the gamut \u2014 some despairing, most hopeful, a few humorous. It sounds dramatic, but that feeling of unity with so many strangers is one of the most powerful things I\u2019ve ever experienced. The subway levels the playing field and, quite literally, brings the city closer together every single day. Ashley Long, Greenwich Village, Manhattan\n\nLate in the day on Sept. 11, 2001, the subways reopened, and I could return home to the Upper East Side. As I boarded the train, I saw a woman in a hijab, a head scarf. I remember marveling at the courage and composure it took, on that day, to be visibly Muslim. But I was more impressed that not only did no one say an angry or intemperate word to her, but also no one even glanced crossly in her direction. The subway is not just an economic engine, a means of mobility, but an agent for tolerance and understanding, as neighborhoods of different hues and accents are fused together. There is too little of that in America today. Haroon Moghul, the Bronx", "title": "Readers Share Their New York Subway Stories", "authors": ["Alice Yin"]}

A fourth lottery is underway for 11 affordable condominiums on Broome Street.

It does so, first, because your thoughts are brain processes. When you read, neural patterns come and go as the words pass before you. Some of those patterns also give rise to memories, subtle molecular changes in cells and the signaling mechanisms that link them. And third, your brain is physically transformed by learning to read. The networks that underlie vision and language are changed. Even people who become literate in adulthood, as a team led by the French neurobiologist Stanislas Dehaene has shown, acquire differences that are visible in a brain scan. With and without literacy, the brain is the same basic organ, with the same shape and chemistry, but a reading brain is different in ways that count. As Cecilia Heyes says in her forthcoming book, \u201cCognitive Gadgets,\u201d if one didn\u2019t know that reading is a recent human invention (literate culture is perhaps 5,000 or 6,000 years old), a skill passed on through learning in each generation, it would be easy to mistake the brain patterns seen in reading as evidence for a genetically encoded reading instinct or \u201cinnate module.\u201d\n\nReading is an apt skill to celebrate in a book review, a piece of writing about a piece of writing. E. O. Wilson\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Origins of Creativity,\u201d is about the role of the humanities in an intellectual culture increasingly dominated by science. Wilson values the humanities, but he wants them to have closer ties to some of the sciences, an argument that draws on his view of the relationships between human biology, thought and culture. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear,\u201d he says at one point, \u201cthat natural selection has programmed every bit of human biology \u2014 every toe, hair and nipple, every molecular configuration in every cell, every neuron circuit in the brain, and within all that, every trait that makes us human.\u201d But reading itself, the reading of books like his own, shows that this isn\u2019t true. The circuits of the brain are changed by literacy, and the molecular configurations in countless cells are being altered as you pick up new ideas from the page, as they make their way into your memory. If what Wilson says were true, there would be no point in reading, in trying to learn songs or engage in many other activities. We\u2019d have little resemblance to humans at all.\n\nI have much admiration for the work Wilson has done in biology, not for the theoretical side but for the crawling in and climbing around side \u2014 his unearthing of new species, his charting of the quirks of their lives and attempting to get into the worlds of countless small fierce invertebrates. I also admire much of the path his life has taken, some of which is sketched here. His parents divorced during the Depression and his youth was spent roaming the South, attending 14 different schools. But he made it to college and then on to graduate work and a career at Harvard. It\u2019s impossible to begrudge such a person a few literary victory laps. Yet Wilson is so widely read and admired that when he makes a public statement about the relationship between science and the humanities, it has to be taken on its own terms and assessed for what it says.

By the \u201chumanities\u201d he means the fields that study languages, literature, history, art and so on. What Wilson would like is for these fields to become more scientifically literate and attend especially to developments in paleontology, anthropology, psychology, evolutionary biology and neurobiology \u2014 what he calls the \u201cfriendly ground of science,\u201d where the humanities can seek alliances.

She uses herself as a \u201ccase,\u201d a person who has been conditioned by advertising and consumerism. She marvels at how quickly people have learned to use the mobile phone, computer, iPod and GPS \u2014 and she is unable to imagine the devices we\u2019ll be using in 10 years\u2019 time. People must keep up, acquire the latest gadgets; to fall behind would be to accept aging and dying. She remarks on how goods can freely circulate, unlike refugees, who are \u201cturned away at the borders.\u201d She knows that possessions can\u2019t make people happy, but also acknowledges the popular belief that this \u201cwas no reason to abandon things.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nChange happens so imperceptibly that only big events like the collapse of the Berlin Wall or 9/11 allow us to establish a \u201cbefore\u201d and an \u201cafter.\u201d Closer to home, photographs set a time line, as do family holidays, and both are used as markers throughout the book. But because everything, no matter how obscure or distant, is now available on the internet, we inhabit \u201cthe infinite present.\u201d\n\nErnaux attributes the \u201cI remember\u201d concept that summons up an endless list of events and products, no matter how trivial, to the French writer Georges Perec, but it actually started with the American artist and poet Joe Brainard. Unlike their random lists, Ernaux\u2019s are arranged chronologically, and so she becomes something more than a list-maker: a Greek chorus commenting on politics and lifestyle changes. And yet her recollections are evanescent, unstable, because the media have taken charge of memory and forgetting. And the media have divided people into generations: \u201cWe belonged to all and none. Our years were nowhere among them.\u201d The media have become the gatekeepers of the imagination.\n\nLike Proust, Ernaux is always trying to envisage the book she will write \u2014 this very book we are reading, in a fluent, idiomatic translation by Alison L. Strayer. \u201cShe would like to assemble these multiple images of herself, separate and discordant, thread them together with the story of her existence, starting with her birth during World War II up until the present day. Therefore, an existence that is singular but also merged with the movements of a generation. Each time she begins, she meets the same obstacles: how to represent the passage of historical time, the changing of things, ideas and manners, and the private life of this woman?\u201d\n\nFeelings themselves seem to go in and out of fashion. People now find the words \u201chonor\u201d and \u201cpatriotism\u201d absurd. Other, newer emotions are unnamable: \u201cThere was no specific word for the feeling one had of simultaneous stagnation and mutation.\u201d Life, caught up in meaningless rituals, feels as if it\u2019s slipping by, but at the same time \u201cprogress\u201d has landed us in a place we no longer recognize.", "title": "Reclaiming the Past in the Internet\u2019s \u2018Infinite Present\u2019", "authors": []}

In college sports there is \u201cGlory, Glory Colorado,\u201d as well as the less-used \u201cGlory, Glory to Ole Auburn.\u201d\n\nThe melody originated in the early 1800s with a hymn, \u201cGrace Reviving the Soul,\u201d according to the book \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic: A Biography of the Song That Marches On.\u201d Its lyrics went, \u201cSay brothers will you meet us,\u201d three times, and then, \u201cOn Canaan\u2019s happy shore.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 1861, the soldiers of a Boston-based Union regiment pinned the tune to the lyrics: \u201cJohn Brown\u2019s body lies a-mouldering in the grave/His soul is marching on.\u201d It was an ode to the man who was hanged for raiding the Harpers Ferry Armory in protest of slavery not two years earlier.\n\nJulia Ward Howe, a well-to-do Northern abolitionist and poet, heard the tune that autumn while observing Union troops in Virginia. She decided to prettify the lyrics, which had expanded to include such lines as, \u201cWe\u2019ll hang Jeff Davis from a sour apple tree.\u201d\n\nShe wrote five verses \u2014 beginning with the famous \u201cMine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord\u201d \u2014 and submitted them to The Atlantic Monthly. The poetry editor published them in the February 1862 issue under the title \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d The lyrics became extremely popular \u2014 Abraham Lincoln praised them \u2014 and remained widely known after the war had ended.\n\n\u201cGlory, Glory\u201d emerged at a time when football was just cropping up in the region, said Bruce Schueneman, an author of an anthology of college fight songs.

(Fifty percent of the people is a stretch.) Those people include self-employed business owners who buy their own insurance, people in the small group insurance market, and people who do not get insurance, but might, if their company could find a cheaper option.\n\nThe association rule is also likely to combine with other policy changes, as Mr. Trump notes.

Another regulation is expected soon that would permit insurers to offer short-term plans for longer periods, perhaps for a year. Mr. Trump is right that the associations are part of a larger set of policies meant to chip away at Obamacare, and are likely to destabilize its markets for individual and small business insurance.\n\nThe degree of disruption these policies will cause remains unclear. But they are likely to work together. The individual mandate is believed to have pushed some healthy, reluctant shoppers to buy insurance, and they may no longer feel the nudge when it goes away.\n\nThe rise of short-term policies that cover fewer benefits and charge higher prices to sick customers might pull some healthier customers out of the Obamacare markets. And the association plans, which, under the proposal, would be open to small businesses and self-employed sole proprietors, may also pull some healthier, younger customers from Obamacare plans.", "title": "Remember Trump\u2019s Pitch on Health Care Associations?

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "The Soviets soon began sending back-channel signals that they had not been involved, but the Johnson administration refused to accept the possibility that North Korea might have acted independently. Instead, President Lyndon Johnson and his advisers continued to search for larger Cold War connections to explain the attack, and soon found them in Vietnam. The director of the C.I.A., Richard Helms, warned that the North had acted for two reasons: \u201cto hinder the movement of Koreans to South Vietnam and to harass the U.S. in its conduct of the war in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze speculated that the attack had been intended to pressure the United States into taking \u201ca weaker position on Vietnam negotiations.\u201d When the North Vietnamese launched the Tet offensive a week after the seizure, the link between the two seemed confirmed. \u201cThe North Koreans,\u201d Johnson wrote, \u201cwere aware of the Tet offensive in Vietnam, which was scheduled to take place eight days later. They were trying to divert U.S. military resources from Vietnam and pressure the South Koreans into recalling their two divisions from that area.\u201d\n\nRecently released materials from Communist bloc archives, however, demonstrate that there was no conspiracy behind the Pueblo seizure. The North Koreans had acted alone, and for reasons that reflected internal dynamics within Pyongyang rather than the exigencies of the Cold War. The country had launched this and other aggressive actions on the peninsula to gain internal propaganda that emphasized the strength of Kim Il Sung\u2019s leadership and to rally the people behind him during difficult economic and political times.\n\nIn fact, not only was there no larger conspiracy afoot, but the Pueblo attack actually drove a wedge between the North and its Communist allies, who resented Pyongyang\u2019s risky behavior and its reluctance to provide information. In April, the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev blasted the North in a speech at the Soviet Party Plenum. \u201cThe measures taken in this case by the government of the D.P.R.K. appear unusually harsh,\u201d he declared. Moscow had demanded that North Korea \u201cshow reserve, not to give the Americans an excuse for widening provocations, to settle the incident by political means.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthe Korean comrades maintained a fairly extreme position and did not show any inclination toward the settlement of the incident.\u201d Other members of the Communist bloc similarly resented Kim\u2019s provocations. \u201cIn newspaper articles and statements, we were on their side,\u201d the East German ambassador to Pyongyang later explained, \u201cbut not in reality.\u201d\n\nAmerican political leaders, however, failed to consider the possibility of an internal motive and instinctively sought solutions rooted in conventional Cold War approaches that presumed a larger master hand was behind North Korea\u2019s behavior. Throughout 1968, American policymakers negotiated with North Korean representatives but never fully accepted the idea that this diplomatic effort could be separated from the larger Cold War struggle. Accordingly, they rejected any resolution that might weaken their efforts on other fronts, particularly in Vietnam. \u201cThe great danger that we must avoid is that the Soviets and the North Vietnamese will interpret something that we do as a sign of weakness,\u201d outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara explained. \u201cIf we show weakness and are not firm, I think it will prolong the Vietnam War substantially.\u201d Negotiations for the prisoners in North Korea were thus held hostage by events in Saigon.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBeyond the immediate fears about sending signs of weakness, American policymakers also failed to consider the possibility that they might be able to drive a wedge between the North Koreans and the rest of the Communist bloc even further. The North\u2019s relations within its allies had fallen so low by 1968 that it was engaging in border skirmishes with the Chinese while also alienating its other allies, and yet the United States continued to negotiate as if it faced a unified monolith.\n\n\u201cAs galling as it is,\u201d a National Security Council staff member advised in March, \u201cI fear that on this Pueblo case we may have to lick our wounds, wait out release of the crew, and wait our chances for action when the advantage is more ours. The only way I see where we could act sooner would be in Vietnam \u2014 presumably by mining Haiphong Harbor. North Korean actions seem partly designed to aid the Communist Vietnam effort and it is important that we not permit that to happen.\u201d Unable to separate Vietnam from Korea, American leaders had thus sent its diplomats to do battle for the Pueblo crewmen in a badly weakened position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerica\u2019s diplomatic response was not the only part of the Pueblo story that was influenced by Vietnam. The attack on the ship sent both the American military and the general public into a frenzy. Demands for violent retaliation echoed through the halls of the Pentagon and the streets of America\u2019s towns. The office of the commander in chief of the Pacific fleet recommended sending a destroyer into Wonsan to do \u201cwhatever was necessary\u201d to retrieve the ship and crew, and the commander of the United Nations forces in South Korea, an American, called for a nuclear ultimatum.\n\nThe public was equally aggressive. A Gallup poll showed those choosing force outnumbered those choosing diplomacy by almost two to one. \u201cThere should be no word mincing in our demand for the swift and safe return of both ship and crew,\u201d The Buffalo Daily News wrote, \u201cnor should North Korea be deprived for long of the measured dose of retribution her sudden belligerency has so emphatically asked for.\u201d\n\nThe military options, however, soon ran into a number of practical obstacles, including the strong North Korean defenses in the Wonsan area, the risk of conflict with the Soviets or Chinese, and concerns for the safety of the Pueblo crewmen. Hovering over all of the discussions, though, were the demands of fighting the war in Vietnam. Begrudgingly, military leaders soon recognized that opening another front in East Asia would be a terrible tactical decision. Within a week of the attack, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs offered Johnson almost a dozen military options, ranging from mining North Korean ports to striking targets with air and naval bombardments, but admitted that he did not find any of them \u201cparticularly attractive.\u201d Accordingly, military options were discarded. \u201cOne war at a time,\u201d Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach said, \u201cis enough.\u201d\n\nEven the public\u2019s response to the crisis was shaped by events in Vietnam. For a week after the incident, the Pueblo was the focus of national attention. Newspapers ran profiles of brave sailors captured by the evil Communists. Songs about the Pueblo graced the airwaves, cars displayed bumper stickers about the ship, and telegrams from private citizens offering to assist in rescue attempts flooded the White House. \u201cThese men,\u201d promised the State Department, \u201care not, nor will they ever become, forgotten men.\u201d\n\nYet, when the Tet offensive exploded on Jan. 30, American eyes quickly returned to Vietnam. Soon, Walter Cronkite called for an honorable exit from Vietnam, a national debate exploded about the military\u2019s request for more troops, and Johnson announced that largely because of Vietnam, he would not run for re-election. In the haze of such Vietnam-related tumult, the Pueblo simply faded from the nation\u2019s consciousness.\n\nSupporters of the crew formed a national \u201cRemember the Pueblo Committee\u201d and offered a rallying cry to \u201cRemember the Pueblo,\u201d to try to keep the men in the public eye, but to no avail. The crew, despite the State Department\u2019s promise, had indeed become forgotten men, lost to the more overwhelming conflict 2,000 miles away. And despite suffering from serious physical and emotional problems resulting from their year in captivity, the men would remain forgotten when they returned to the United States in December 1968. Quickly, they were drummed from the service, ignored by the general public and left to fend for themselves as they struggled to reintegrate with society, often with disastrous results.\n\nEven more significant than these immediate connections, however, was the impact that the convergence of Vietnam and the Pueblo incident had on shaping the long-term American commitment to South Korea. American aid to the South had been declining for years, and America\u2019s military presence was coming under scrutiny as well. These efforts were stymied, however, by South Korea\u2019s decision to commit troops to the American effort in Vietnam. By 1967, South Korea had provided tens of thousands of combat troops, and in return, a grateful President Johnson had been ignoring the drawdown proposals. The attack on the Pueblo now offered the South a chance to strengthen the relationship even more.\n\nPresident Park Chung Hee of South Korea and other leaders suddenly began hinting that they might withdraw their troops from Vietnam to face the increased North Korean aggression. Johnson, who desperately wanted to portray Vietnam as an international effort, was determined to keep them on board. Accordingly, he pushed through an enormous military assistance package for the South. \u201cWe need to give whatever aid is necessary to South Korea,\u201d he told congressional leaders. \u201cThey are among our best allies.\u201d Johnson took other measures to placate Park, including pledging to appoint a South Korean as deputy commander of the United Nations military forces in Korea, promising to increase South Korean access to business opportunities in Vietnam and working to increase economic connections between the nations. In the long run, of course, South Korean forces fighting in Vietnam could not prevent America\u2019s defeat. They did, however, restore a bond that had been weakening and help cement a special relationship between the countries that still exists.\n\nFifty years after the attack on the Pueblo, the ship\u2019s story remains the tragic tale of 83 American men and a doomed spy ship. But it is also a story of how the impact of America\u2019s war in Vietnam went beyond Vietnam in ways that hindered good diplomacy elsewhere, ruined the lives of people far from the front lines and played a vital role in shaping the future of East Asia.", "title": "Remember the Pueblo!", "authors": ["Mitchell B.

It might be a difficult read for some students, but it sums up a year\u2019s worth of news for this topic.\n\nTo help students better understand and consider Mr. Baker\u2019s arguments, we suggest giving students these five excerpts (PDF). Working in pairs, students should first explain Mr. Baker\u2019s claim in their own words. Then they should respond: Do they think his analysis is accurate and fair? Within the article itself, Mr. Baker provides evidence to support his assertions.\n\nExcerpt 1:\n\nMr. Trump is the 45th president of the United States, but he has spent much of his first year in office defying the conventions and norms established by the previous 44, and transforming the presidency in ways that were once unimaginable. Under Mr. Trump, it has become a blunt instrument to advance personal, policy and political goals. He has revolutionized the way presidents deal with the world beyond 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, dispensing with the carefully modulated messaging of past chief executives in favor of no-holds-barred, crystal-breaking, us-against-them, damn-the-consequences blasts borne out of gut and grievance.\n\nExcerpt 2:\n\nThe presidency has served as a vehicle for Mr. Trump to construct and promote his own narrative, one with crackling verve but riddled with inaccuracies, distortions and outright lies, according to fact checkers. Rather than a force for unity or a calming voice in turbulent times, the presidency now is another weapon in a permanent campaign of divisiveness. Democrats and many establishment Republicans worry that Mr. Trump has squandered the moral authority of the office.\n\nExcerpt 3:\n\nWhat worries insiders has electrified many on the outside. Mr. Trump has cast aside the mythology of a magisterial presidency removed from the people in favor of a reality-show accessibility that strikes a chord in parts of the country alienated by the establishment. That indifference to the way things have always been done has energized Mr. Trump\u2019s core supporters, who cheer his efforts to destroy political correctness, take on smug elites and smash a self-interested system that, in their view, has shafted everyday Americans.\n\nExcerpt 4:\n\nIn recent times, most presidents have sought to expand the power of their office, and Mr. Trump has continued that trend. Just as Mr. Obama, frustrated by opposition in Congress, made ambitious use of his executive power, only to be reined in at times by the courts, Mr. Trump has turned to his presidential pen to enact sweeping policies. But he has bristled at the restraints imposed on the presidency as few have, lashing out at judges, lawmakers, investigators and journalists who anger him and expressing frustration that he is not supposed to use the F.B.I. as he sees fit. His sense of government is not based on coalition building or a balancing act between equal branches. It is one where he deems what is necessary and the system should fall in line.\n\nExcerpt 5:\n\nTalk of \u201cabsolute\u201d power and a noted affinity for foreign strongmen have fueled fears of authoritarianism. For the most part, Mr. Trump, with some notable exceptions, has demonstrated more bark than bite. But that bark has become a power unto itself, and the question remains whether he will follow through on his threats in the next stage of his tenure or whether his attacks will prove ultimately self-defeating. Mr. Trump is creating precedents that may outlast his tenure. He is making the presidency more authentic or more autocratic, depending on the vantage point. Either way, it may never be the same.\n\nOnce students have fully examined Mr. Baker\u2019s argument, then the class can hold a Socratic seminar using the article to contemplate how, and to what extent, Mr. Trump has changed the presidency. Possible discussion questions include:\n\n\u2022 In what ways is Mr. Trump reinventing the presidency?\n\n\u2022 Do you think these changes are good or bad for the country?\n\n\u2022 Is he making the presidency more \u201cauthentic\u201d or more \u201cautocratic\u201d?\n\n\u2022 Are the president\u2019s actions and statements corrosive to American democracy? Or are they benign political tools for advancing his policy objectives?\n\n\u2022 Do you think the changes President Trump is making will outlast his tenure?\n\n\u2022 Do you think Mr. Baker\u2019s analysis is accurate and fair?\n\n_________\n\nActivity 3: Study the policy shifts advanced by the Trump administration.", "title": "Report Card Time: Inviting Students to Evaluate President Trump\u2019s First Year in Office", "authors": []}

Winter sports enthusiasts will note one item missing, which we did not fully appreciate until it was too late. (More on that in a minute.)\n\nThe drive took more than four hours, with visibility decreasing as we inched our way over freshly snow-covered roads through the White Mountain National Forest. In the wind-whipped snow and fog, it was impossible to make out the gargantuan rock faces that we knew from previous trips were right in front of us.\n\nBy noon, we had not yet arrived, but our editors wanted a feed \u2014 live material from our reporting trip that they could put online right away.

The only people who get up there after the road closes in October, we learned, are those who, like Mr. Carmon, work at the observatory, and they don\u2019t exactly commute.

The wind almost smacked them shut, forcing us to act like football players, leaning in to push them open with our shoulders. Breathing felt dangerous.\n\nNothing could have prepared us for what lay outside the cozy van: Imagine plunging into a cold lake, then lifting your head out of the water only to have your eyes pelted by a continuous hail of tiny needles. Any moisture on your face freezes almost instantly, coating your eyeballs with a layer of ice that prevents you from blinking. Your eyelashes stick together.\n\n(Note to self: Next time, bring that all-important item we forgot \u2014 goggles.)\n\nCommunicating was a challenge, too, beyond the occasional \u201cOh my GOD!\u201d You have to shout to be heard above the wind, but you have nothing intelligent to say. Going through my mind was a recent National Geographic article quoting a doctor who noted that bitterly frigid temperatures can cause mental confusion. Hence the saying, \u201cCold makes you dumb.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, the editors sitting in their warm offices sent a text. They needed another feed.\n\nI lurched like the Michelin Man back into the SnowCoach and dictated some observations over my cellphone to Jack Healy, The Times\u2019s Denver bureau chief. He would spin my utterances into a coherent narrative that could go up online right away, with added reporting by Alan Blinder in Atlanta and John Schwartz in New York.\n\nMeanwhile, Jess continued to experience the joys of icy air blasting her face, which was not entirely wrapped up. She struggled to take notes while wearing mittens, scrawling absurd phrases with barely legible words like \u201ceyes,\u201d \u201cache,\u201d \u201clegs\u201d and \u201cice.\u201d\n\nFinally, she slipped off one mitten to take an eight-second video and a selfie. Her fingertips went numb almost immediately. She replaced the mitten, but by then the cold had penetrated her boots and two pairs of socks, leaving her toes numb.\n\nWe closed out our adventure wondering if we had really been at the coldest place in the continental United States.\n\nDan Petersen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center, told us on Saturday that, in terms of actual mercury readings, two towns in Minnesota \u2014 Cotton and the interestingly named Embarrass \u2014 had had readings of minus 39 degrees; Mount Washington\u2019s lowest temperature had been minus 36.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe felt deflated \u2014 until he added that, when the wind was factored in, Mount Washington had been colder by far than anywhere else.

The best argument Republicans can make for maintaining control may be the number of candidates running in heavily gerrymandered, Republican-dominated districts.\n\n\u201cIn the House, the best-case scenario is to try to keep loses to a minimum,\u201d said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former congressman from New York who led the House Republican campaign committee when they lost power after the 2006 midterm elections. \u201cIt is not missed by anyone that the president\u2019s numbers are lower than other first-year presidents.\u201d\n\nMr. Reynolds said that Republicans have advantages so far in fund-raising, and they may actually benefit from the enthusiasm among some Democrats that has led to multiple candidates running in primaries that could prove costly.\n\nHe also said that Republicans now have some structural advantages built from their victories over the last few cycles.\n\n\u201cThere is a structure there that may withstand no matter what, but the atmospherics have a caution light,\u201d he said.\n\nThe retirement of Mr. Royce, who represents a Southern California suburban district that Hillary Clinton won by nine percentage points in 2016, presents Democrats with the kind of opportunity they had been hoping to seize.

Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers are below 40 percent in most polls, the worst of any president at this point in his term in the history of polling. His ratings are also far worse than any first-term president when the unemployment rate is under 5 percent.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating in November of 1994 was 46 percent, and Democrats lost 54 House seats and control of the chamber for the first time since the 1950s. President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating in November 2010 was around 50 percent when Republicans won 63 seats.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are making it difficult for incumbents as well.\n\nLast week, the administration said it would dramatically expand the coastal areas open to offshore drilling, a policy that is opposed by many members of Congress who live in districts along the Florida, South Carolina and Virginia coasts and the Pacific Seaboard. And a move by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to free prosecutors to more aggressively enforce federal marijuana laws has prompted breaks from the president by prominent Republicans in states where marijuana is legal, such as Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nMany of the Republicans who are retiring are among the more moderate members of their party in Congress, such as Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. Many were known for the power of chairing committees or for strong constituent service, or both. Among the retirees are the chairmen of the House Foreign Relations, Judiciary, Financial Services, Transportation and Science committees.\n\nRepublicans in recent days, and Mr. Trump, have been talking up the idea of bipartisanship in 2018, in part to try to make the case to suburban voters that they can be accommodating. So far, they do not have results to match their words.\n\nTo be sure, Democrats also have vulnerable members retiring, and the party, unlike Republicans in 1994, has struggled to give voters an agenda to support other than opposing Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a referendum on Republican control and Republican policymaking,\u201d Mr. Lapp said. \u201cThat said, Democrats do need to have a plan, they do need to be for something and be more than just not the other guy.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Steve Stivers, Republican of Ohio and chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, countered the glee from Democrats over Mr. Royce\u2019s retirement. \u201cOrange County has no shortage of Republican talent,\u201d he said in a statement, adding, \u201cWe have just one message for Democrats who think they can compete for this seat: Bring it on.\u201d", "title": "Republican Retirements Raise Talk of Democratic Wave in November", "authors": ["Michael Tackett"]}

Mueller III.\n\nThough Mr. Grassley made no mention of the two men on Friday, he appeared to suggest equivalence between their crimes and his views of Mr. Steele\u2019s actions. \u201cIf the same actions have different outcomes, and those differences seem to correspond to partisan political interests, then the public will naturally suspect that law enforcement decisions are not on the up-and-up,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a short cover letter dated Thursday but transmitted Friday, the senators wrote, \u201cBased on the information contained therein, we are respectfully referring Mr. Steele to you for investigation of potential violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, for statements the Committee has reason to believe Mr. Steele made regarding his distribution of information contained.\u201d\n\nThat section of the federal criminal code refers to knowingly making false or misleading statements to federal authorities.\n\nMr. Steele had repeated contacts before and after the election with F.B.I. counterintelligence agents who were investigating links between the Trump campaign and Russians. The information he shared was apparently valuable enough that the F.B.I. at one point even considered bringing him on as a paid source.

His findings were ultimately compiled into 35 pages of memos outlining a multipronged conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign to boost his candidacy and hurt Mrs. Clinton, including corrupt business dealings and salacious details alleging an encounter between Mr. Trump and Russian prostitutes.\n\nThe firm was first hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website, in September 2015. Its work was later funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign, which paid for Mr. Steele\u2019s work.\n\nThis week has seen Mr. Grassley engage in a heated spat with Fusion GPS over the testimony of one of its executives, Glenn R.

Once they were on the service, the flaw would allow them to grab information like passwords from other customers.\n\nThat is a major threat to the way cloud-computing systems operate. Cloud services often share machines among many customers \u2014 and it is uncommon for, say, a single server to be dedicated to a single customer. Though security tools and protocols are intended to separate customers\u2019 data, the recently discovered chip flaws would allow bad actors to circumvent these protections.\n\nThe personal computers used by consumers are also vulnerable, but hackers would have to first find a way to run software on a personal computer before they could gain access to information elsewhere on the machine.

And as is common practice when such problems are identified, they tried to keep the news from the public so hackers could not take advantage of the flaws before they were fixed.\n\nBut on Tuesday, news of the Meltdown flaw began to leak through various news websites, including The Register, a science and technology site based in Britain. So the researchers released papers describing the flaws on Wednesday, much earlier than they had planned.\n\nFor now, computer security experts are using a patch, called Kaiser, that was originally discovered by researchers at the Graz University of Technology in Austria to respond to a separate issue last year.\n\nSpectre will be much more difficult to deal with than issuing a software patch.\n\nThe Meltdown flaw is specific to Intel, but Spectre is a flaw in design that has been used by many processor manufacturers for decades. It affects virtually all microprocessors on the market, including chips made by AMD that share Intel\u2019s design and the many chips based on designs from ARM in Britain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpectre is a problem in the fundamental way processors are designed, and the threat from Spectre is \u201cgoing to live with us for decades,\u201d said Mr. Kocher, the president and chief scientist at Cryptography Research, a division of Rambus.\n\n\u201cWhereas Meltdown is an urgent crisis, Spectre affects virtually all fast microprocessors,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. An emphasis on speed while designing new chips has left them vulnerable to security issues, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really screwed up,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cThere\u2019s been this desire from the industry to be as fast as possible and secure at the same time. Spectre shows that you cannot have both.\u201d\n\nThe Meltdown flaw was discovered by Jann Horn, a security analyst at a Google-run security research group called Google Project Zero, last June. Mr. Horn was the first to alert Intel. The chip giant then heard from other researchers who had also discovered the flaw, including Werner Haas and Thomas Prescher, at Cyberus Technology; and Daniel Gruss, Moritz Lipp, Stefan Mangard and Michael Schwarz at the Graz University of Technology.\n\nThe researchers had been working through the Christmas holiday on a patch, and coordinating with companies like Microsoft and Amazon to roll out the fix.\n\nThe second flaw, Spectre, was also discovered by Mr. Horn at Google and separately by Mr. Kocher, in coordination with Mike Hamburg at Rambus, Mr. Lipp at Graz University and Yuval Yarom at the University of Adelaide in Australia.\n\nA fix may not be available for Spectre until a new generation of chips hit the market.\n\n\u201cThis will be a festering problem over hardware life cycles. It\u2019s not going to change tomorrow or the day after,\u201d Mr. Kocher said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while.\u201d", "title": "Researchers Discover Two Major Flaws in the World\u2019s Computers", "authors": ["Cade Metz", "Nicole Perlroth"]}

I\u2019ve been working on this one for years; it\u2019s the one that encompasses the need to keep quiet about a child\u2019s choice of attire or music or crush object, the way you would about a colleague\u2019s. We are almost all of us able to refrain from needling the people we work with, the people we meet at parties, the people who ask us for directions on the street. It might not seem like a high bar to show that same level of fairly bland and often insincere courtesy toward children, instead of letting them know where there\u2019s room for improvement, but it takes a lot of reminding and a lot of resolving.\n\nEqual and opposite: Go ahead and be yourself every now and then; we\u2019re all family here.\n\nResolution No. 2: Give grown-up children credit for being grown-up. They are more competent than you think. They manage perfectly well when you aren\u2019t around. They solve problems, they manage their lives.

(\u201cSeriously, Dad, is the \u2018Coming to America\u2019 chair necessary?\u201d) Cultural appropriation, it seems, is a two-way street.\n\nYou may think from this opening that you know how the rest of the story will go: Kelechi\u2019s alienation will gradually be replaced by a sense of belonging. But the expected trajectory is not the path \u201cThe Homecoming Queen\u201d takes. For one thing, as we learn, Kelechi was not very happy even in the States. Love affairs failed, and the success of her novel, \u201cDe Panta, De Tiger and De Bird,\u201d created too much expectation for a follow-up hit. Her trip home, intended in part to inspire her writing, derails her further. Only with the help of her \u201canxious pills\u201d (as Beatrice, her father\u2019s young housegirl, calls them) does she stave off a breakdown, and then only temporarily.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise of how these four main characters \u2014 Kelechi (Mfoniso Udofia), Obina (Segun Akande), Godwin (Oberon K. A. Adjepong) and Beatrice (Mirirai Sithole) \u2014 are connected beneath the play\u2019s surface. But if the plot is compelling, in some ways echoing Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s novel \u201cAmericanah,\u201d it is also sometimes murky; you have to listen hard for the clues to what has happened and also be patient with unmarked detours into flashbacks and fictions. In contrast, too many of the conventionally narrative scenes, especially between Kelechi and Godwin, repeat the same arc, moving predictably from pleasantry to snark to umbrage to apology. They deliver no new emotional information even if they do deliver delight.\n\nThe staging by Awoye Timpo, on a set by Yu-Hsuan Chen that surrounds the audience, could do a better job of ameliorating that problem by differentiating and contouring the material. On the other hand, Ms. Timpo\u2019s work with the principals (who are accompanied by a delightful four-woman chorus playing those gossipy aunties and hymn-singing elders) is exemplary. As Beatrice, Ms. Sithole amply fulfills Kelechi\u2019s description of her as one of those people who, though quiet, \u201cthink loud\u201d; it\u2019s hard not to watch her constantly watching.\n\nI appreciated, too, that the characters\u2019 emotions are not rushed into place as if on a conveyor belt, which often happens in shortish plays. (This one is an hour and 45 minutes.) Though the scene in which Obina asks if he can touch Kelechi appears in the script with no stage direction, the director has encouraged Ms. Udofia and Mr. Akande to take all the time they need.

But on Thursday at David Geffen Hall, the Finnish conductor Susanna Malkki led the New York Philharmonic in a performance of the work that was so urgent, detailed and exciting that I forgot all about cresting sea and splashing waves. I was, instead, engrossed by the way Ms. Malkki brought out the colors, intricacies and radicalism of \u201cLa Mer\u201d (1905), which came across as Debussy\u2019s idea for an alternative kind of 20th-century symphony.\n\nMs. Malkki, making her return to the Philharmonic after a belated debut in 2015, certainly drew out the atmospheric sonorities in the subdued music the opens the piece, with the softly rumbling timpani, flecks of harp, heaving low strings and woodwind lines that seem to peek through the mist. But I was more struck by the unusual clarity of the textures, the careful voicing of chords to highlight pungent harmonies. In the final movement, Ms. Malkki deftly balanced the music\u2019s tumultuous frenzy with symphonic majesty, driving headlong to the brassy climax without a trace of cinematic excess.\n\nShe preceded \u201cLa Mer\u201d with the New York concert premiere of Esa-Pekka Salonen\u2019s \u201cHelix,\u201d from 2005, which the composer has described as a nine-minute accelerando. The music starts tentatively, with halting chords, eerie blips and a strange, tolling bass riff. Moment by moment, this dark music gains intensity and volume, as jerky rhythms break out and fragments try to coalesce into phrases. It hurtles to a dizzying, blazing final stretch, played to the hilt here.\n\nThe concert began with a vanishingly rare sight at the Philharmonic: two women appearing together as concerto soloist and conductor. The brilliant Latvian violinist Baiba Skride gave a magnificent account of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Violin Concerto. Her distinctive sound \u2014 full-bodied and sumptuous but never forced \u2014 ideally suited the passages of melting lyricism and nobility. She brought tender grace to the rueful slow movement. And, with the alert Ms. Malkki there to keep the orchestra right with her, Ms. Skride tore through the breathless finale with impetuous energy and impressive precision.\n\nThis season Ms. Malkki began her tenure as principal guest conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

And in Ms. Yende\u2019s case, it was hard not to look past this performance a bit to April, when she will take over the more demanding and telling title role in the company\u2019s production of Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia di Lammermoor.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, she brought a winning combination of elegance and spunk to the part of the farm owner Adina in her amorous jousting with the ardent peasant Nemorino and the bullying sergeant Belcore.

She deftly executed the acrobatics at the end, with joyous, tumbling high roulades.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Polenzani was a worthy foil, singing with pliant strength and clarion tone while tracing his character\u2019s shifting moods and dispositions, from love-struck, clumsy confusion to puffed-up confidence, owing to what he thinks is a love potion when he is in fact getting drunk on cheap wine.\n\nAfter all that, Mr. Polenzani summoned melting emotion in his second-act showpiece, \u201cUna furtiva lagrima,\u201d fondling and polishing the tone like a fine jewel.

This was the first year that it seemed like a good idea to stay where you were for a long period of time \u2014 or, at most, walk to one of the venues within a close distance.\n\nThere were trade-offs: The festival these days has an outsize footprint, extending all the way from the Bowery Ballroom on the Lower East Side to the New School on 13th Street, nearly a half-hour away on foot.

Later, as the cello and violin plucked bluesy, hurrying phrases \u2014 like cinematic balladry and Romanticism and Ray Nance all run together \u2014 Ms. Ibarra put down her sticks and played with only her hands and feet, smacking a drumhead with her palm and thumping the kick drum.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

Yet even though each is given a moment (a near-suicide, one affair and then another), Jeanne, Ariane and Gilles stick to a disappointingly familiar script.

They seem to skirt the prickly confrontations that come with adolescence \u2014 though Anna is, in the way of so many teenagers, a master of casually if affectionately withering condescension.\n\nBeth, a real estate agent, has finally found a truly good man, a cop named Tim (Robert Manning Jr.) who is calm, dependable, strong \u2014 and, she\u2019s certain, about to propose.

His earlier plays, including his 2012 debut, \u201cSlowgirl,\u201d reflect the qualities \u2014 patience with plot, modesty with character \u2014 that make him a fine short story writer. Working of late with the composer John Kander, he has devised the book and lyrics for musicals, like \u201cKid Victory,\u201d that find grave darkness in the frozen heart of small town America.\n\nBy comparison, the disposition of \u201cCardinal\u201d is antic, even before it gets out of hand. It\u2019s an amusing twist that Lydia, who means to be a do-gooder, is really a classic carpetbagger, tone deaf to the needs of the town she once did everything she could to escape. (She thanks the struggling voters for listening to her pitch by giving them complimentary copies of Italo Calvino\u2019s \u201cInvisible Cities.\u201d) But by the time the plot involves her with a Chinese-American entrepreneur, who swoops in with tour buses and dumpling shops to reap the rewards Lydia hoped would accrue to the town, Mr. Pierce\u2019s concerns have twisted hers into an incomprehensible M\u00f6bius strip.\n\nJeff, too, is dragged down that path, transforming from a sweet underachiever (who once had scurvy) to a vengeful husk \u2014 and then back again. The same thing happens to the characters in both subplots. In the one involving the entrepreneur (Stephen Park) and his son (Eugene Young), a benignly comic caricature veers close to bad-guy Orientalism before veering back for a sentimental ending. And in the one involving a bakery owner (Becky Ann Baker) and her autistic son (Alex Hurt), traits and actions fail to jibe, especially as those actions take a hard right turn toward another genre entirely.\n\nThe tonal lurching makes \u201cCardinal\u201d feel whimsical and even a bit aleatory, like a John Cage sonata. Yet I have to believe that a playwright as sophisticated as Mr. Pierce has made these baffling, disruptive choices meaningfully. Though the bakery is cutely called Bread & Buttons, and sells crocheted monkeys and mittens along with the scones, he is not just satirizing small town America, with its hopeless reinvention schemes and hapless part-time politicians. He\u2019s after something larger about the unintended consequences of capitalism on both individuals and societies: meant to be a cure-all, it is too often a comeuppance.", "title": "Review: Anna Chlumsky and Adam Pally Paint the Town Red in \u2018Cardinal\u2019", "authors": []}

The three completed movements add up to a score of some 60 minutes. Mr. Gatti\u2019s magnificent account of the sublime Adagio made a convincing case for it as a fitting end to this work: a composer\u2019s farewell. The long first movement is an extreme example of Bruckner\u2019s penchant for writing episodic, unconventional forms, in which a theme can seem less a statement than a strand of a later development section that has crept in too soon. Rather than imposing some sense of order on the movement, Mr. Gatti lavished expressive beauty and majestic restraint on the music.\n\nMs. Jansen chose Bruch\u2019s concerto, a staple of the repertory, for this appearance with the pre-eminent orchestra of her homeland. Her performance was so probing and lucid, and so matched by the refined playing of the orchestra, that this popular piece sounded fresh and bracing. I\u2019ll not soon forget the intimate way she shaped the poignant ruminations of the second movement\u2019s wistful melody. She played a beautifully soft-spoken encore: Manuel De Falla\u2019s setting of \u201cNana,\u201d a Spanish folk song.\n\nFor those who prize flawless playing and clean entrances in Mahler, this performance of his First Symphony would have been a little frustrating. But Mr. Gatti and his players dug deep into this early work. The opening of the first movement hauntingly conveyed the primordial, cosmic elements of the music.

Even across the language barrier \u2014 his songs are in Persian \u2014 his commitment was unmistakable, and his chameleonic voice could hold the nuanced clarity of Persian classical singing or turn into a rocker\u2019s howl, an old man\u2019s cackle or a theatrical sob.\n\nThere were smart echoes of tropical\u00eda, Brazil\u2019s iconoclastic (and dictatorship-defying) music of the late 1960s, in the set by Ava Rocha and her band: amiable melodies, poetic lyrics, hints of Brazilian rhythms and taut arrangements that sometimes let the guitars get noisy. Her performance suggested a playful, elusive ritual. She arrived onstage bearing a decanter of what looked like wine, and drank some of it; before she finished her finale, she balanced it on her head. In between, she sang with sultry nonchalance and traced slow-motion gestures both elaborate and inscrutable.\n\nFlor de Toloache, the New York mariachi band that won the Latin Grammy for Best Ranchero/Mariachi Album in November, mingled mariachi tradition with tangents of their own, like Andrews Sisters harmonies, occasional lyrics in English and that Nirvana song.\n\nOther performers hewed closer to tradition. The Iberi Choir, from (the country) Georgia, sang gorgeously harmonized songs, many of them a cappella, with convoluted passages of eerie dissonance; one song had lyrics dating back to the 12th century. Miramar \u2014 with lead singers from Puerto Rico and Tennessee and a Chilean-American keyboardist and composer \u2014 devoted itself to urbanely lovelorn Puerto Rican-style boleros, some vintage and some written by group members.\n\nEva Salina lent her poised, lustrous voice to complexly morose songs from the Balkans in a duo with the Serbian-style accordionist Peter Stan, who backed her with oompah chords and puckish, skittering obbligatos. And Thornetta Davis, a Detroit blues singer, brought backup singers (from her church, she noted) and a horn section for a hearty, formidable set of optimistic blues \u2014 even when the optimism came from finally ditching a no-good man.\n\nFor a musician in the 21st century, those traditions are a matter of choice, not the result of isolation, nostalgia or birthright.

It goes without saying that Gioia Tauro, a beaten-down zone of poverty and petty crime, is no place for such a noble animal. \u201cWhen we were on the road, we were free,\u201d says Pio\u2019s grandfather \u2014 glimpsed as a young man in a brief opening scene \u2014 who watches his descendants struggle to hold onto the old ways of their wandering, proudly ungovernable kind.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cA Ciambra,\u201d the second feature directed by Jonas Carpignano (the first was \u201cMediterranea,\u201d also set in Gioia Tauro), follows Pio\u2019s lurching movement toward manhood and observes his environment with a sympathetic, probing eye. The film, named for the battered apartment complex where Pio lives, provides fresh evidence of the continued vitality of the neorealist impulse as it tries to embed a fictional narrative in the actual world. It has the shape of a fable and the texture of a documentary. The actors are nonprofessionals playing versions of themselves. During the end credits, the frame is filled with more than a few dozen Amatos, Pio\u2019s onscreen (and Mr. Amato\u2019s real-world) family.\n\nKinship is the defining \u2014 and also the confining \u2014 fact of Pio\u2019s life. Home is a hive of siblings and cousins, presided over by Pio\u2019s mother, daughter of the semi-mythic grandpa. Pio trails after his older brother, Cosimo (Damiano Amato), playing the familiar role of sidekick, mascot and occasional annoyance. The younger boy is a natural watcher, a close student of the ways of his elders, eager to emulate them even when he doesn\u2019t quite understand what\u2019s going on.\n\nAfter Cosimo is arrested, Pio tries to fill his shoes and apply the lessons he has absorbed. He steals luggage, ransoms stolen cars to their owners and contemplates bigger scores. He is cunning, though not always smart, and like many adolescents he vacillates between wild overconfidence and childlike na\u00efvet\u00e9. He knows how to drive a car, but not how to read. He goes wherever he pleases, but is afraid of elevators and trains. He is rarely without a cigarette, a habit that apparently begins among boys in his family shortly after they\u2019re out of diapers. Mr. Amato\u2019s brooding man-child features and skinny frame give physical expression to Pio\u2019s in-between, half-formed state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe story, which emerges slowly through the warmth and noise of Pio\u2019s daily life, leads him toward a wrenching moment of moral crisis. In its mood and methods, \u201cA Ciambra\u201d pays homage to the work of Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the living masters of European realist cinema. Like the protagonists in their films, Pio faces an ethical dilemma created as much by his own misjudgments as by the harshness of his circumstances. He is forced to decide, before he is ready and at enormous potential cost, what kind of person he wants to be.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The most frequent visitors to Ciambra are the police and the gangsters known locally as \u201cthe Italians,\u201d who come to dispense assignments and collect payment. It seems inevitable that Pio will end up in trouble with one or the other.\n\nHis best friend outside the family is Ayiva (Koudous Seihon), an immigrant from Burkina Faso who serves as a surrogate big brother while Cosimo is locked up, and who is nicer to Pio in any case. He is also the boy\u2019s guide \u2014 and the viewer\u2019s \u2014 to a world of refugees and migrants that is both similar to that of the Roma and distinct from it. Both groups exist at the margins of Italian society, despised, pitied and ignored, but they experience that marginality, and their own uprootedness, in ways that reflect radically different histories.", "title": "Review: In \u2018A Ciambra,\u2019 a Young Roma Boy Comes of Age", "authors": ["A.O.

Plays about sports are not often very good, plays about tennis even less so, and this particular contest \u2014 recently the subject of the film \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d \u2014 would seem to be overmined.

Sometimes Ms. King (Ellen Tamaki) is upstage; sometimes Mr. Riggs (Donald Corren) is. Sometimes only one of them is seen, sometimes neither. The net may be parallel or perpendicular or diagonal to the audience, or it may move; occasionally there is no net at all. In one lovely black-light scene, only the ball is visible.\n\nThough this action is cleverly devised by the directors Ianthe Demos and Nick Flint, and executed perfectly under the movement direction of Natalie Lomonte, it is neither tennis nor theater but a kind of hysteria. The whole play seems to be constructed backward, starting with a concept requiring a full 85 minutes of athletic representation and ending with the maddening question of how to fill all that time. Narratives so constructed often leave you thinking, \u201cWhy?\u201d but, in \u201cBalls,\u201d the authors\u2019 solutions, trite and tiresome, have you frequently blurting, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBecause, yes, there are clowns.\n\nTwo, actually: one male (Richard Saudek) and one female (Olivia McGiff).

When not dashing back and forth along the net, the ball boy and ball girl (Alex J. Gould and Elisha Mudly) portray a couple whose 40-year relationship, from first flirtation through postdivorce amity, unfolds in a different time scheme from the rest of the play.

This forces him to move in with his father, Bob (Elliott Gould), in a retirement community. In an odd-couple scenario, Nate is self-serious, while his dad can\u2019t stop joking. Nate meets a fellow midlife-crisis sufferer, Allison, a thin role played winningly by the singer Ingrid Michaelson, and agrees to stage a production of Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s \u201cThe Mikado\u201d with older women. Working on this show embarrasses him, but besides being an opportunity for more comic moments from senior citizens, this humble effort inevitably leads to an epiphany.\n\nAmong such old-school plot mechanics is one novel element involving re-enactments of jokes that act as a kind of Greek chorus while underlining a central theme: the power of jokes to bring people together and occasionally keep them apart.\n\nBut don\u2019t get the wrong idea: The movie never gets too deep, which is half of its charm. The other half involves the low-key comic performances by a stellar cast including Annie Potts and Bebe Neuwirth, who plays a theater producer named C.C. Rudin.\n\nMr. Clements works wonders with a deadpan expression, imbuing his role with a repressed melancholy, a nice match for the poignant emotionalism of Mr. Gould\u2019s Bob. Jokes matter to this old man, and he makes telling them seem like an act of vulnerability. One favorite is faking a heart attack, and when his son doesn\u2019t laugh, Mr. Gould looks so wounded you worry he might really have one, suggesting a joke can kill even when it doesn\u2019t.", "title": "Review: In \u2018Humor Me,\u2019 a Dose of Borscht Belt for a Midlife Crisis", "authors": ["Jason Zinoman", "Sam Hoffman"]}

In \u201cBarbecue,\u201d seen at the Public Theater in 2015, he let the audience laugh at the down-market doings of a white family picnic before continuing the same scene with a black family. In \u201cBootycandy,\u201d an earlier satire of black theatrical tropes and the white people who love them, a stand-in character for the playwright tells audience members at a postshow talk back that he hopes they will \u201cchoke\u201d trying to swallow what he\u2019s written. \u201cThe work should be work,\u201d he says.\n\nBut at their intermittent best those plays were so hilarious that the work was not work \u2014 or if work, then the highly pleasurable kind. Each had a defining gimmick that made it deliciously theatrical: a twist, Mr. O\u2019Hara writes in a program note, \u201cthat gives the play its Shout.\u201d So does \u201cMankind,\u201d in its triumph-of-the-patriarchy premise. The problem here is that the story keeps twisting even when you need it to stay put and shout. Another switcheroo arrives every few minutes, which quickly grows as tiresome as a joker roommate and lets the satire deflate into mere sarcasm.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem of focus. Satire is about the sharpness of the darts but also of the targets. Here there are too many targets to leave a coherent impression. Religion seems to be the intended bull\u2019s-eye, and it\u2019s certainly instructive to see how the church of \u201cShe\u201d (whose name is thought to be unpronounceable) grows into a grotesque expression of mansplained feminism. So is the way casual, catty utterances of Jason and Mark are misinterpreted by apostles and transformed into dogma.\n\nMr. O\u2019Hara also asks you to cackle about the vapidity of talk shows, the clich\u00e9s of dystopian dialogue, bromosexuality, sexism, Trumpism and futurism itself. This pinwheel of snark feels like a stunt, and there\u2019s little that the cast \u2014 which also includes David Ryan Smith, Ariel Shafir, Stephen Schnetzer and Andr\u00e9 De Shields \u2014 can do, under the author\u2019s seemingly distracted direction, to keep a feeling of agitated desperation at bay. Their varying choices to play the material as serious drama or sketch comedy seem almost random.\n\nMr. O\u2019Hara has said that with satire, especially now, you can\u2019t go partway: \u201cYou have to go for the throat.\u201d That\u2019s probably true \u2014 and the viciousness of \u201cMankind\u201d that would offend some people is perhaps its best quality.

Although the plot mechanics are no more or less implausible than any such genre film. Mary is a hit woman for one drug cartel, Uncle was an operative for a rival one, and the scenario eventually spirals into a minor morass of misidentified killers and lethal paybacks.\n\nBut Ms. Henson, ever simmering, takes Mary\u2019s moral conundrum very seriously. Her expressive eyes and nuanced body language work well for the character; she can put across a major change in attitude just by shifting a hip. The script, though, doesn\u2019t give her a whole lot of material with which to credibly enact her character\u2019s crisis. Her exchanges with Benny (Danny Glover), the drug kingpin who took her under his wing, or with Tom (Billy Brown), Benny\u2019s son, heir and an ex of Mary\u2019s, provide some idea of a potentially richer movie.\n\nBy the end, \u201cProud Mary\u201d is of course obliged to hew to the prerogatives of its genre, with a warehouse action sequence scored to a Tina Turner version of the title song. The over-the-top nature of the sequence (Mary\u2019s car gets shot up enough it could double as a sieve) is not served well by Mr. Najafi\u2019s execution.

The directors and brothers Eshom Nelms and Ian Nelms have obviously made a study of the genre, both in its old and more recent iterations, and while they\u2019re happy to play around with the form, they pretty much leave the basics intact. By far their smartest, most inspired move is to have cleared room for John Hawkes, one of those actors who are more often seen nibbling at the edges of a scene, leaving perfect little teeth marks that sometimes give a movie its primary texture.\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Hawkes plays Mike Kendall, a former cop.

He\u2019s halfheartedly looking for work, but all he seems to want to do is drink and pal around with his brother-in-law (Anthony Anderson). So Mike drinks and drinks some more, tossing back beer until he staggers, stumbles and blacks out. He doesn\u2019t seem otherwise affected by his prodigious consumption and, for some reason, the filmmakers seem amused by it. He looks healthy enough, even when lifting weights between sips.\n\nOne morning, Mike finds a badly beaten woman (Stefania Barr) near a field that he\u2019s slept in after another soused night. She\u2019s an enigma and soon his possible redemption, a sacrifice to the story gods that lets him play lawman again. With a cheap business card and an equally cheap jacket and tie, he smilingly ambles it into the shamus role, knocking on doors and sniffing out leads among all the yammer and serviceable visuals. Before long he is chasing down a familiar dark tale of very young women and very bad men, and trading patter with both a silky rich cat (Robert Forster) and a smooth pimp (Clifton Collins Jr.), who rolls up with a scowl, pummeling first, asking questions later.\n\nThe supporting players slide into their types just fine, though for the most part they remain little more than satellites orbiting Mike or, rather, Mr. Hawkes.

I should actually say \u201csubjects.\u201d As per the title, this fictionalized portrait is a family one. The movie opens in 2005, the year of Beksinski\u2019s death, with him making some wry and libidinous comments about future technology to a man we\u2019ll learn was his biographer. It then jumps back to 1977, and Beksinski (Andrzej Seweryn, unimpeachable, as is the rest of the cast) and his wife and mother walk across a plaza from their own apartment block to an unfinished one, where Beksinski\u2019s adult son, Tomasz, will live. At this point Tomasz is already struggling with mental illness.\n\nBeksinski himself, while a painter of apocalyptic, sci-fi landscapes, is a cheerful, sardonic sort. He\u2019s perhaps a little too bluff about Tomasz\u2019s condition. Discussing their son with his wife, he notes, \u201cAt least he\u2019s not running around with a razor, threatening to slice up his grandmas.\u201d Tomasz, who is present, retorts, \u201cI only consider knives and razor blades in relation to my own wrists.\u201d\n\nEntering the camcorder age, the Beksinskis become relentless chroniclers of their own lives. The director, Jan P. Matuszynski, mixes simulated home-video footage with stealthily virtuosic long-take scenes, including a remarkable one depicting an airplane excursion with Tomasz. The tragedies in this family\u2019s life are nearly constant, but Mr. Matuszynski approaches them with a tone that\u2019s matter-of-fact while also partaking in the particular wry irony that has been a hallmark of Polish cinema since the early 1960s.", "title": "Review: In \u2018The Last Family,\u2019 a Polish Artist\u2019s Tragic Home Life", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny", "Robert Bolesto"]}

Without explanation, a man jumps on the hood of a stranger\u2019s car, beating the glass first with his fists and then with his head.\n\nPerhaps strangest still is that throughout the bedlam, the drivers rarely betray their shock.

He knows that most theatergoers will be familiar with Mr. Urie for his breezy television work (\u201cUgly Betty\u201d). And rather than have us wait, judgmental minds at the ready, for Mr. Urie to show up in Scene II, Mr. Kahn throws him at us, in full monologue, before the play proper begins.\n\nSwathed in shadows and standing next to what appears to be an open grave, Mr. Urie delivers the \u201ctoo too solid flesh\u201d soliloquy (which usually comes toward the end of Scene II) as a prologue. It\u2019s a gamble that pays off. This monologue offers a surprisingly cogent summing up of the state of Denmark we are about to enter.

The Hamlet who steps into the court of Elsinore is clearly the same guy we just met. But it\u2019s as if he had unleashed himself from some confining mental corset, and he\u2019s grimacing and gesturing up a storm.

A too-familiar sickbed scene should not end with the doctor saying, \u201cThe fever has broken,\u201d and yet it does. The need to compress history leads to moments that are maudlin or heavy-handed.\n\nBut she has a Julian Fellowes-like ability to keep a story moving and fill it with interesting, engaging characters. Diana Rigg, no longer needed in \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d joins the cast in high curmudgeon mode as a lady in waiting, a harrumphing embodiment of British propriety and narrow-mindedness.

The ease with which Mr. Lithgow inhabits the character, merely untucking his shirt to suggest a barber\u2019s smock, hints at the way all effective storytellers are complicit in their stories.", "title": "Review: Surprise Lessons From John Lithgow\u2019s \u2018Stories by Heart\u2019", "authors": []}

The three other performers each portray a character (Petra\u2019s daughter, Petra\u2019s friend, Petra\u2019s mother), but also take turns as the abused, passive Marlene, sometimes embodying her collectively.\n\nThese three wear overalls labeled \u201cstaff,\u201d and the work\u2019s principal choreography consists in how they move the minimal set pieces: foam-board cutouts, a plush, pink rug. The outfits flag a possible analogy: Is the sadomasochistic Petra-Marlene relationship somehow akin to the one between a director and his cast?\n\nThe idea is present, less obviously, in the Fassbinder film. Late in \u201cPetra,\u201d the performer Paz Tanjuaquio brings it up explicitly. In previous scenes, cast members speak as \u201cthemselves,\u201d giving brief monologues about their love for their husbands or for dance, but Ms. Tanjuaquio resists telling her story. Would such a confession, she asks, be for her or for the audience or just for Mr. Moss to use?\n\nThe Petra-Moss parallel, however, lacks conviction, and the true crux is Mr. Moss\u2019s use of the Fassbinder film. Were \u201cPetra\u201d merely a stage adaptation, it would be a terribly flat one. Ms. Schaal\u2019s performance is single note and static, and no one else even tries to act. None of the film\u2019s sexual tension is preserved, none of the pathos beneath the histrionics that makes it at once hilarious and haunting.\n\nPerhaps Mr. Moss was after something else. In place of the film\u2019s stunning ending, he has Ms. Sinha (who also sings several times) lead members of the audience in a group recitation of bureaucratic suggestions for increasing audience diversity.

When Mr. Kaufmann appeared onstage (after a tension-inducing 15-minute delay), the audience broke into prolonged applause and bravos. Mr. Kaufmann apologized for starting late and then, in somewhat confusing comments, he explained why: The work (a cycle of 20 songs lasting some 60 minutes) would be performed without a break, he said, and he wanted to make sure everyone in the audience had arrived. (Officially, no latecomers were admitted.)\n\nThe performance started off strongly. In the opening song, \u201cDas Wandern,\u201d the cycle\u2019s protagonist, a journeyman miller, sings of the joys of his lifestyle, wandering from town to town, taking work at a mill and moving on, just like the babbling waters of the brook. The qualities of Mr. Kaufmann\u2019s voice that have made him the most sought-after tenor in opera were vividly present, especially the unusual combination of burnished, virile sound and slightly covered, dusky shadings. In the second song, \u201cWohin?\u201d (\u201cWhither?\u201d), Mr. Kaufmann brought poignant earnestness to the questions that run through the miller\u2019s thoughts as he looks to the gurgling brook for guidance: \u201cIs this then my path?\u201d \u201cWhy do I speak of babbling?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSoon, however, some vocal glitches and moments of tightness started creeping into Mr. Kaufmann\u2019s singing.

Incontestably, the 18-year-old was unarmed when a police officer fired 12 shots at him on Canfield Avenue in Ferguson, Mo., on Aug. 9, 2014, two days before he was to enroll in a technical college. The officer, Darren Wilson, was white. Mr. Brown, it almost goes without saying, was black.\n\nWhat the younger man had done earlier that evening, or not done; what racist thoughts Mr. Wilson harbored, or didn\u2019t; whether Mr. Brown was surrendering, with his arms up, or threatening Mr. Wilson through the patrol car\u2019s window: The answers to all these questions seem irretrievably lost in a cloud of contention. What we can say is that one man, having avoided indictment, is free three years later and the other is still dead.\n\nNeither that conclusion nor the uncertainty of what came before it releases us, though, from the burden of trying to understand the meaning of the killing, and in that sense Dael Orlandersmith does a great public service in her new play \u201cUntil the Flood,\u201d which opened on Thursday at Rattlestick Playwrights Theater.

To research \u201cUntil the Flood,\u201d whose title ties together the many images of flow and overflow in the script, she conducted a series of interviews in and around Ferguson.

{"date": "2018-01-02 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe experience of watching the documentary \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u201d is a lesson for our times. As its title suggests, it is a head-to-battered-toe consideration of a male ballet dancer that takes you from studio to stage and points in between. It is formally conventional and draws on the usual zippy you-are-there moments with lots of gabby talking heads. What elevates it, though, is its charming \u2014 and from all accounts \u2014 deeply talented subject, Marcelo Gomes. So after it was over I eagerly searched Google for him on my phone only to discover that the day before, on Dec. 21, he had resigned from the American Ballet Theater after he was accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe details remain sketchy. The New York Times reported that Andrew F. Barth, the chairman of the company\u2019s board of trustees, had announced the bombshell news in an emailed statement: \u201cLast Saturday, A.B.T. was made aware of a highly concerning allegation of sexual misconduct by Mr. Gomes, occurring approximately eight years ago.\u201d Ballet Theater took \u201cimmediate action,\u201d and during its investigation, Mr. Gomes resigned. His spokeswoman told The Times in another emailed statement: \u201cThis is a time of reflection for Marcelo. He is gratified and strengthened by the support he has received from family, friends and colleagues. We have no further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThese revelations aren\u2019t in \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer,\u201d which was produced, directed and shot by David Barba and James Pellerito. And while the accusations don\u2019t invalidate the documentary, they have inevitably transformed its generally breezy, sometimes teary and altogether upbeat portrait. The movie is a classic underdog story, that of a Brazilian prodigy who \u2014 with a great deal of raw talent and drive, along with the kindness and encouragement of family and friends \u2014 matures into a genius of dance. Now, invariably, every painstaking step of that journey, each beat and milestone, comes with an unsettling asterisk as delight at his artistry mixes with doubt about his character.\n\nThe artistry is unassailable. Mr. Barba and Mr. Pellerito began shooting the movie in early 2010. Mr. Gomes had joined Ballet Theater in 1997 at 18 and was promoted to a principal dancer in 2002. He soared. In a 2007 review of \u201cCinderella\u201d in The Times, Alastair Macaulay wrote that Mr. Gomes \u201cis at his finest as her prince: handsome dancing, modest, relaxed, attentive\u201d \u2014 a description that nicely fits scene after scene of his performances here. Much of the documentary\u2019s drama involves the countdown to his 20th anniversary with Ballet Theater and all that entails, including Mr. Gomes\u2019s acute attention to his aging body and his hope that his father will see him dance in New York.\n\nDocumentary portraits of this type often incorporate testimonials from affable, encouraging experts who smilingly help burnish the subject\u2019s reputation. \u201cAnatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u201d is stuffed with such enthusiastic recommendations, including from numerous dancers \u2014 Misty Copeland, Julie Kent and Veronika Part \u2014 with whom Mr. Gomes partnered over his career. The love for him just pours off the screen in these moments, as does the respect and admiration. These persuasive testimonials are scattered among the dances, festivals and interstitial sections in which the energetic, very peripatetic Mr. Gomes quiets down and settles in for some intimate on-camera sharing.\n\nMuch of this is agreeable, or at least was. In retrospect, the sheer amount of gush in the movie, all the praise and feverish shouts of bravo, underscores the limits of affirmational documentaries. It is also a reminder that a movie\u2019s meaning is made (and remade) by its viewers, not just its content. Mr. Barba and Mr. Pellerito set out to create a portrait of Mr. Gomes, who comes across as an extremely nice guy. When I saw the movie in December, their portrayal seemed rather too fluffy and fawningly one-note, but it was also hard to resist. Mr. Gomes can be thrilling to watch even when partly obscured by a partner\u2019s dress, but it may be that more of him was hidden from us than this movie suggests.", "title": "Review: The Incomplete Vision of \u2018Anatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer\u2019", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis", "David Barba", "James Pellerito"]}

The first question posed of the performers being interviewed, before a video camera, is that aforementioned conundrum \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho I am is the question I ask myself, often, every time I look in a mirror\u201d goes one response. And \u201cPanorama\u201d turns into one big, double-sided looking glass that keeps reflecting them (on the stage) and us (in the audience), until the mirror cracks.\n\nThe performers we encounter in the flesh are Maura Nguyen Donahue, John Gutierrez, Valois Mickens, Eugene the Poogene, Perry Yung, Zishan Ugurlu and Heather Paauwe. (We meet many others through video interviews, and sometimes the live actors take on the identities of the two-dimensional projections.) And you may well ask what\u2019s in a name, because they certainly do.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And simple nomenclature becomes a gateway onto endless, globe-crossing vistas of family histories and fraught stories of immigration.\n\nBut such words aren\u2019t even half of the story. These people are, above all, performers, whose nomadic lives have lead them to the all-inclusive sanctuary that theater, especially marginal theater, can be. (God bless the urban avant-garde!) And they do a lot of celebratory acting out, and directing others in acting out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEvery performer makes use of a camera or projector. Video images and simulcasts, as deft as the hands of a three-card monte artist, keep your eyes moving so you often know where sounds and images originate. (The video design is by Bosul Kim, Sangmin Chae and Billy Clark.)\n\nAnd yes, there is the occasional more traditional audition piece, including the performance of a scene from the Antonioni movie \u201cThe Passenger\u201d (which you may remember was all about escaping identity); some musical numbers (like a Michael Jackson moonwalk) and perhaps the most joyous, non-objectifying strip tease I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nA strip tease in \u201cPanorama\u201d inevitably involves taking off a whole lot of layers. Once you hit bare flesh, though, you have by no means arrived at the end of the process.\n\nThe shape, texture and color of that skin may offer some clues to the person within.

It sings of how men become warriors and of how they can reach across seemingly impossible divides to clasp hands and lock eyes before blowing their mutual enemy to pieces. And while Sept. 11 gives Mitch and his men their mission, the locals aren\u2019t entirely ignored, not exactly.

Divided into clear, concise chapters and conducted in a style that might be called street-corner Ken Burns, this documentary, directed by Manfred Kirchheimer, is more essay than epic, preferring coherence to comprehensiveness. In looking at a smattering of buildings in two big cities, and focusing on the work of a handful of major architects, Mr. Kirchheimer sketches the skyscraper as a feat of engineering, a work of imagination and part of an ongoing cultural argument.\n\nAll of a sudden, toward the end of the 19th century, it became possible to conceive of ordinary urban commercial and residential buildings whose height would surpass the limits of human stamina. The invention of the modern elevator by Elisha Graves Otis was crucial, and so was the development of iron and steel frames that enabled lighter, higher and slimmer constructions. As often happens (see also: the internet and the automobile), technological advances created aesthetic challenges. What were these gigantic new buildings supposed to look like?\n\nOne answer: like the old buildings, only bigger. Mr. Kirchheimer associates this idea with Daniel Burnham, the Chicago planner and architect who is in some ways the villain of \u201cTall.\u201d Burnham, whose legacy includes the grounds of the World\u2019s Columbian Exhibition of 1893 \u2014 part of the backdrop of Erik Larson\u2019s true-crime historical best seller \u201cThe Devil in the White City\u201d \u2014 adapted ornate European styles to new uses and proportions.\n\nBurnham\u2019s foil, and Mr. Kirchheimer\u2019s hero, was another Chicago architect: Louis Sullivan, a brilliant draftsman and theoretician often identified as the father of the modern skyscraper. (\u201cTall\u201d comes with the subtitle \u201cThe American Skyscraper and Louis Sullivan.\u201d) Famous for declaring that \u201cform must ever follow function,\u201d Sullivan tried to find an organic, authentic identity for modern tall buildings. While hardly averse to ornament, he envisioned each structure as a dialectic of utility and beauty. His great disciple, Frank Lloyd Wright, would extend Sullivan\u2019s philosophy in his own writings and architectural projects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat philosophy is understood in \u201cTall\u201d to be quintessentially American, partaking of the same democratic spirit that breathes in the writings of Emerson and Whitman. Sullivan appears as a prophet without much honor in his own country, denied the celebrity and the lucrative commissions enjoyed by the Europe-besotted Burnham.", "title": "Review: \u2018Tall\u2019 Is a Little Movie About How Buildings Got So Big", "authors": ["A.O.

It takes place in southeastern Brazil in 1821 \u2014 some six decades before the abolition of slavery \u2014 on a squalid farm deep in the mountains. There, a white drover turned farmer, Antonio (Adriano Carvalho), is trying to make a go of it on the backs of enslaved black men, women and children. He\u2019s failed to cultivate the land, blaming it for his defeat, and seems equally terrible at everything else. Soon after the movie opens, his wife and baby die during labor, a tragedy that suggests that here life itself is doomed from the start.\n\nIndolent and apparently untroubled by his multiple failings, Antonio had received the farm as part of his wife\u2019s dowry. Her doddering mother, Zizinha (Juliana Carneiro Da Cunha), came with the place, and presumably so did the slaves who mind the house, like Joana (Geisa Costa), and others who tend the farm, like Porf\u00edrio (Adilson Magh\u00e1). It\u2019s an austere, pitiless world and might be a near-unbearable, unwatchable one if the director Daniela Thomas didn\u2019t hook you early. But she does, starting with the black-and-white cinematography that draws you in, just because it\u2019s so infrequently used these days.\n\nVideo\n\nThe palette is alluringly exotic, but it\u2019s also expressive, with subtle shades \u2014 white, dove, slate, jet \u2014 that soon take on metaphoric resonance. (Inti Briones is the director of photography.) Yet while the visuals and natural world catch the eye, Ms. Thomas, who has directed movies with Walter Salles, rarely lingers to admire the view or her own handiwork. There\u2019s a bracing lack of vanity in how she conveys this long-lost world and not an iota of misplaced nostalgia. She shows you the loveliness, but she also insistently juxtaposes it with the grim sights and clanging sounds of heavily shackled men.\n\nMs. Thomas, working from a script by her and Beto Amaral, plots the narrative coordinates fairly leisurely. The movie\u2019s rhythms are unhurried, though for the most part not indulgently so, and fit both the period and Antonio\u2019s uneasy lassitude (which makes a stark contrast with the slaves\u2019 work). Characters enter and exit, offering up names and filling in the back story. Antonio\u2019s brother-in-law, Bartholomeu (Roberto Audio), slides into the picture with his unhappy wife, Ondina (Sandra Corveloni), and their daughters, Maria Joaquina (Isadora Favero) and Beatriz (Luana Nastas).

He soon departs on business, leaving his child bride (she hasn\u2019t started menstruating) and addled mother-in-law with his openly restless slaves, a development that makes next to no narrative sense but gives Ms. Thomas ample time to stir up trouble and add some dramatic tension. With Antonio away, Beatriz is soon running through the fields with a young slave, Virg\u00edlio (Vinicius Dos Anjos). His mother, Feliciana (Jai Baptista), is routinely forced to share Antonio\u2019s bed, which suggests that Virg\u00edlio may be Antonio\u2019s son, one more complication in a lyrically minded movie that wafts into schematic tidiness and bluntness.\n\nThis shift is at odds with Ms. Thomas\u2019s embrace of ellipticism. She\u2019s obviously interested in how race influences gender and class, and how they all press against \u2014 and impinge on \u2014 one another until they\u2019re inseparable. (The lack of indigenous people in this story is a curious absence.) It\u2019s also evident that she doesn\u2019t want to make a thesis movie or put speeches in anyone\u2019s mouth. So for much of the movie she comes at her ideas sideways, circling them much as her characters orbit one another and letting her images \u2014 a black boy gently running his fingers over a white girl\u2019s arm \u2014 carry the weight of her meaning.\n\nBy the end, it\u2019s hard not to wish that Ms. Thomas had traded a bit of her art-film drift for something more direct. One of her strongest characters turns out to be an unnamed slave (Toumani Kouyat\u00e9, excellent), who\u2019s part of a new group that Antonio brings to the farm. A ferociously charismatic presence, this man serves as the group\u2019s leader and insistently speaks up, commanding attention with each utterance. In a misguided decision, though, his dialogue hasn\u2019t been subtitled, ostensibly because no one at the farm understands the newcomers. \u201cIt ain\u2019t Bantu,\u201d an older slave says, referring to an African language.

On orders from Moscow, they were shot and bayoneted, and their mutilated bodies were set afire.\n\nThat much has been generally agreed on, based on overwhelming evidence gathered by numerous experts. Yet the Russian Orthodox Church continues to pose more questions, hinting at the darkest of conspiracies: Were the remains that were later exhumed really those of the imperial family? If not, how many were murdered, and where were they buried?\n\nLate last year, church officials added another twist with dark implications, suggesting that the execution of the Romanovs was \u201ca ritual murder\u201d \u2014 a phrase evoking calumnies directed against Russia\u2019s Jews as part of their persecution in czarist times.\n\nNow those words have come from Bishop Tikhon Shevkunov, during a speech on Nov. 27 at a church-sponsored conference convened to re-examine the circumstances of the Romanovs\u2019 murder.

He made $57.50 a week, he said, survived on 35-cent ham salad sandwiches from Woolworth\u2019s and lived in an actress cousin\u2019s apartment on 23rd Street while she was in upstate New York doing stock theater.\n\n\u201cIt was a one-room apartment over a Chinese restaurant, where all the roaches came up to visit at night,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would turn on the lights, they were so brazen they would just stare at you, they wouldn\u2019t even run. I thought, \u2018This is horrible, but it\u2019s New York.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe studio eventually laid him off after budget cutbacks, and in 1965 he fled the city to knock around Europe with friends in a rented red Volkswagen. He ended up at the Venice Film Festival just as his money was running out. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to get home,\u201d he said. Mr. Reed decided to pose as a journalist and bluff his way into interviews with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Buster Keaton, the aging silent film star who was promoting \u201cFilm,\u201d a 22-minute experimental silent movie written by Samuel Beckett. Mr. Reed sold both articles, making enough to buy a return ticket to the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Keaton article, which appeared in The New York Times, was hammered out on film-festival stationery. (\u201cBuster Keaton was there, looking for all the world like the kind of man dogs kick. \u2026\u201d)\n\nSettling in New York, Mr. Reed soon became an in-demand magazine writer, then a hot job: churning out swashbuckling profiles of Tennessee Williams, Warren Beatty and many others. His unflinching Ava Gardner profile for Esquire in 1966 portrayed an embittered former screen siren two-fisting Dom P\u00e9rignon and cognac, complaining about her tenure at MGM as \u201c17 years of slavery\u201d in which the studio \u201ctried to sell me like a prize hog.\u201d The article wound up in Tom Wolfe\u2019s 1973 anthology, \u201cThe New Journalism.\u201d\n\nMr. Reed was also becoming a regular on \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d and \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Johnny Carson.\n\n\u201cHe developed his own fan club on the show,\u201d Mr. Cavett said in a phone interview. \u201cI remember on one show, he said about Nancy Sinatra that she looked like a \u2018pizza waitress.\u2019 I actually began to worry.

In 2013 he was denounced for calling the actress Melissa McCarthy \u201ctractor-sized\u201d and a \u201cfemale hippo\u201d in his review of the comedy \u201cIdentity Thief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt really bad for someone who is swimming in so much hate,\u201d she told The Times then.\n\n\u201cShe went nuts because all her fans came out of the woodwork and were mad at me,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cBut what did she do? She lost 50 pounds. She started doing her own fashion designs. She looks terrific now, and is getting roles that don\u2019t require her to fall down in mud puddles.\u201d\n\nMr. Reed knows firsthand the mercilessness of the camera, and the critics. In 1969 he edged out George Hamilton, he said, for a prominent role in \u201cMyra Breckinridge,\u201d the big-budget film adaptation of the Gore Vidal novel whose protagonist undergoes a sex change \u2014 a scandalous notion then.\n\nIn the film, the sex change was reduced to dream sequence. Mr. Reed played the pre-transition Myron to Raquel Welch\u2019s Myra.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the outset, the film, which also starred Mae West and Farrah Fawcett, looked like a blockbuster. It quickly became a very different sort of disaster movie. The original director, the venerable George Cukor, fell out, along with Bette Davis and Burl Ives, Mr. Reed said. Ms. West, then in her late 70s, was entrusted to write key scenes, in which Mr. Reed and Ms. Welch refused to appear. \u201cShe didn\u2019t understand the movie at all,\u201d Mr. Reed said.\n\nNothing made any sense. In one scene Mr. Reed sashayed through an orgy scene \u201cwith a bottle of champagne, and my jacket over my shoulder, like William Holden in \u2018Sabrina.\u2019\u201d But it was \u201ca completely ridiculous orgy, everybody was fully clothed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen this picture ended, it was $30 million over budget and they had filmed half of it.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, the project established him socially among the Hollywood A-list. He recalled dinner parties at Ruth Gordon\u2019s house: \u201cOn my right would be Jean Renoir, and on my left would be Orson Welles.\u201d\n\nOther dinner parties, he was glad to miss. Like Steve McQueen, John Phillips and seemingly half of Hollywood, Mr. Reed claims to have turned down an invitation to dine, along with Jacqueline Susann, the \u201cValley of the Dolls\u201d author, at Sharon Tate\u2019s house the night of the Manson family murders.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Jackie, I want to stay home and eat lemon meringue pie in my pajamas, in front of the T.V. at the Beverly Hills Hotel,\u2019\u201d Mr. Reed recalled.\n\nHe was back in New York by the time the devastating reviews for \u201cMyra Breckinridge\u201d rolled in. Howard Thompson of The Times seemed to be channeling Rex Reed himself when he described the film as a \u201cgrim grotesquerie\u201d that \u201ccollapses like a tired, smirking elephant with no place to go.\u201d\n\nWhile there would be other scattered roles \u2014 \u201cInchon,\u201d \u201cSuperman\u201d \u2014 Mr. Reed\u2019s destiny would be to write about movies, not star in them. \u201cI just never had the luck,\u201d he said. \u201cI was never handed a good script. I just think that one of the reasons that movies are so profoundly screwed up today is because the last person who gets any credit for anything is the writer.\u201d\n\nLennon Gave Him TV Guide\n\nMr. Reed may not have made a fortune in the film business, but he is sitting on millions of dollars of real estate. \u201cIt\u2019s an awfully comfortable bachelor pad,\u201d he said of the book-filled Dakota apartment he has lived in since 1969, which he bought for $30,000.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe found the apartment through his friendship with Ruth Ford, the Broadway actress who lived there with her husband, the actor Zachary Scott, whose family \u201cowned half of Texas,\u201d Mr. Reed said. The playwright William Inge, Judy Garland, Judy Holliday and the saxophone player Gerry Mulligan were all neighbors at various points.\n\n\u201cI moved into this apartment with an A.&P. shopping cart, some books and whatever I could drag over from my little walk-up on 73rd Street,\u201d Mr. Reed said. His only furniture was a corduroy Queen Anne chair and a sleeping bag. The night he moved in, the film star Robert Ryan, who was president of the Dakota\u2019s board, rang the doorbell to welcome him, and the two shared instant coffee, Mr. Reed on the sleeping bag, Mr. Ryan in the chair. \u201cDo you think that happens today?\u201d he asked.\n\nBoris Karloff was another neighbor. Rudolf Nureyev, Leonard Bernstein and Rosemary Clooney lived in the building. \u201cBetty\u201d Bacall, whose spacious three-bedroom apartment sold for $21 million in 2015 after her death the previous year, and Mr. Reed used to eat together regularly, he said.\n\nHe once signed a petition supporting John Lennon when the government was trying to deport Mr. Lennon because of his drug use and political activism. Mr. Lennon thanked him with a one-year subscription to TV Guide, Mr. Reed said, adding, \u201cThat was his bible. All he did was lie around stoned watching television.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Lennon famously sang, \u201cAll You Need Is Love,\u201d Mr. Reed appears to disagree.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have \u2018relationships,\u2019 except friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, love is not something that I\u2019ve been really good at. I think people are intimidated by people with opinions.\u201d\n\nHe sighed, as if resigned. \u201cI think it\u2019s all over as far as that goes. How do you go start looking for a wife or a boyfriend or a significant other? It\u2019s too late. It would be nice, though, to find somebody who\u2019s really handy with a wheelchair, because that day is coming.\u201d\n\nBut even if his mobility is impaired, Mr. Reed will remain a bucking bull in the china shop of current sensibilities.\n\n\u201cIf I had to give the greatest dinner party of my own choosing in the world, the only person I would invite that I have never met was Adolf Hitler,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody else, I\u2019ve met.\u201d", "title": "Rex Reed Bangs a Gong on the Mediocrity of Modern Life", "authors": ["Alex Williams"]}

So far, however, those rollbacks have failed to halt the market forces that continue to drive coal plants into retirement. Last year, utilities announced plans to shut down more than 22 gigawatts of coal capacity across the country, and more retirements are expected this year.\n\nMr. Perry\u2019s proposal was the most aggressive move yet in support of coal and nuclear power and would have shielded a number of plants in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic from those competitive forces. An analysis by Resources for the Future estimated that the rule, if enacted, would have prevented the retirement of 25 gigawatts of coal capacity and 20 gigawatts of nuclear capacity. The analysis found that the proposal would have cost electricity users an extra $72 billion through 2045.\n\nWhile coal is more polluting than natural gas, nuclear plants do not produce any emissions, and some states like New York have moved to rescue their ailing reactors to help combat climate change.

For example, the city\u2019s fleet of Nissan NV200s require that the back seats fold down to fit a wheelchair, meaning that a wheelchair user can only ride with one friend in the front.\n\n\u201cAnd for getting around on a daily basis it\u2019s too expensive,\u201d she added about cabs.\n\nThe Taxi and Limousine Commission spent nearly a decade making improvements to its dispatch program in Manhattan, which arranges 250 trips a day, before rolling it out to all five boroughs.\n\nPhoto\n\nGraham Hodges, a former New York cabdriver and a historian at Colgate University, lauded the expansion, but questioned the city\u2019s slow pace in addressing the needs of the 90,000 wheelchair users in the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction, but why they took so long to do it is a question,\u201d said Mr. Hodges, who wrote a book on the history of New York cabdrivers.\n\nOver the years, the time it takes for a cab to pick up a wheelchair user has decreased. The average wait time for a wheelchair-accessible cab was 34 minutes during a two-year pilot phase in 2008. Today, riders typically wait 13 minutes for a ride, according to Allan J. Fromberg, the commission\u2019s deputy commissioner for public affairs. In the boroughs outside of Manhattan, the average wait time has been 15 to 20 minutes during a test phase launched in September, said Alex Elegudin, the accessibility program manager at the commission.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For years, for-hire car services were not required to dispatch accessible vehicles.\n\nBut that changed in December, when the commission adopted a rule requiring that ride-hailing companies complete 25 percent of their trips every year using wheelchair-accessible cars by 2022. The rule is meant to increase the circulation of accessible cars for people who need them.\n\nThe rule will go into effect on July 1.\n\nThe Accessible Dispatch Program was started in 2012, when the Bloomberg administration was embroiled in a bitter feud with advocates for the disabled over the wheelchair accessibility of New York\u2019s taxicabs.\n\nIn December 2013, three weeks before Mayor Bill de Blasio was sworn in, the Bloomberg administration settled a class-action suit that accused the city of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act because only a fraction of its taxis were accessible.\n\nThe city agreed to adopt regulations to make 50 percent of the city\u2019s more than 13,000 yellow cabs wheelchair-friendly by 2020. The de Blasio administration approved a 30-cent surcharge on taxi rides to help pay for it.\n\nThere were 233 accessible yellow cars in 2012, Mr. Fromberg said.

In practice, the authors suggest, trade shocks\n\ncatalyze anti-redistributionist sentiment (seen in the election of conservative Republicans) in majority white non-Hispanic locations where taxpayers may perceive themselves as transfer-payment donors.\n\nThis white male effect was critical to the link connecting, as Autor and his co-authors write,\n\neconomic adversity to in-group/out-group identification, as motivated by group-based resource competition or opportunistic use of political extremism.\n\nTheir analysis resonates, they suggest,\n\nwith the themes of recent literature on the political economy of right-wing populism, in which economic shocks to dominant population groups engender a political response that sharpens group identities and enhances support for conservative politicians. This pattern is evident in our finding that the impact of trade shocks on political polarization appears largely attributable to increases in foreign competition facing manufacturing industries that are intensive in the employment of non-Hispanic white males.\n\nAcemoglu, Autor and their colleagues provide a synthesis between the economic and the sociocultural explanations of the rise of the populist right. In doing so, they provide a corrective to the recent tendency in segments of the liberal media to downplay economic factors and to focus instead on racial resentment and cultural dislocation as the primary forces motivating Trump voters.\n\nI myself have written that\n\nRepublican voters have a strong sense of white identity, they harbor high levels of racial resentment and they sometimes exhibit authoritarian leanings.\n\nThe point here is that the two generalized explanatory realms \u2014 the one focused on race and the other on economic shock \u2014 overlap. It is not either/or but both that gave us President Trump.\n\nStill, explanations tend to become monocausal.\n\nTake, for example, the Dec. 15, 2017 headline at the Vox website: \u201cThe past year of research has made it very clear: Trump won because of racial resentment.\u201d According to German Lopez, the article\u2019s author, \u201cemployment and income were not significantly related to that sense of white vulnerability.\u201d What was? \u201cRacial resentment.\u201d\n\nA May 9, 2017 story in The Atlantic asserted that\n\nthat fear of societal change, not economic pressure, motivated votes for the president among non-salaried workers without college degrees.\n\nThose stories were by no means alone.

{"date": "2018-01-21 00:00:00", "text": "So how did one decision 45 years ago become synonymous with abortion and nothing else? In part, other privacy fights fizzled when the coalitions backing new rights collapsed. Feminists and libertarians clashed about the line between sexual coercion and sexual privacy. Those who hoped to expand data privacy disagreed about when the government had a good enough reason to collect personal data.\n\nAbortion foes and Republican politicians consciously tried to redefine Roe, equating the decision with abortion and judicial activism. Ronald Reagan had to assure social conservatives that he would pick federal judges who opposed abortion, but he also consistently promised to select nominees based on their accomplishments and judicial philosophy. Labeling Roe an activist decision helped Reagan and other Republicans strike this balance.\n\nAbortion opponents initially did not take much interest in arguments about judicial activism, seeing them as a distraction from the fight for an amendment that would ban all abortions. But by the 1980s, it was obvious that a fetal rights amendment would not pass soon. Delegitimizing Roe suddenly seemed an important step toward the movement\u2019s new goal of overruling the 1973 decision.\n\nOn Roe\u2019s 45th anniversary, we should stop to think about where the right to privacy stands today. The picture does not seem very rosy. Since the new year, there have been fresh concerns about data breaches and the misuse of digital information by giants like Facebook and Google. Privacy and conscience have taken center stage as the Supreme Court considers whether a Christian baker can refuse to serve a same-sex couple. It is easy to believe that the right to privacy is ineffective, more likely to shore up a dissatisfying status quo.\n\nBut part of Roe\u2019s legacy is the many ways conservatives and liberals once reimagined the right to privacy. Social movements hardly felt constrained by what the Supreme Court had written.\n\nSome pointed to privacy not just in asking for freedom from the government but also in demanding financial support from the state. Others asked not just to be left alone behind closed doors but also to get respect for relationships in public. People tried to use the right to privacy to transform attitudes about sexuality, death and the collection of digital data.\n\nAmericans have rethought the right to privacy before.

{"date": "2018-01-28 00:00:00", "text": "Though seeded No. 2 behind Rafael Nadal, Federer was the clear favorite coming into this year\u2019s tournament based on his hardcourt results in 2017 and the fragile physical state of his traditional archrivals. Still, he resisted that label.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think a 36-year-old should be a favorite of a tournament,\u201d Federer said before the Open began.\n\nBut he proved the pundits correct, defending the title he won much more unexpectedly last year, when he was returning from a six-month break to heal a lingering knee problem.\n\nThat surprise victory, earned after a series of marathon matches, meant so much to him in part because he was playing free of big expectations for a change.\n\nBut Sunday night\u2019s five-set win over the sixth-seeded Cilic resonated deeply, too.\n\nFederer broke down in tears \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 during the trophy ceremony in Rod Laver Arena as Laver himself was taking pictures with his phone from the front row.\n\n\u201cThe fairy tale continues, for us, for me,\u201d Federer said, looking toward his team and his family in the players\u2019 box.\n\n\u201cAfter the great year I had last year,\u201d he said, hesitating and fighting to keep his composure, \u201cit\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe continued to struggle, even after he was done speaking as the crowd roared while he and Cilic posed for pictures.\n\nThis has been one of the finest late-career runs in any sport. And though Federer did not lose a set on his way to Sunday\u2019s final, Cilic pushed him to a fifth with his power baseline game and with Federer\u2019s nerves and serves betraying him in patches. He put only 36 percent of his first serves in play in the fourth set.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat had started as a rout, with Federer winning the first set in just 24 minutes, became much more complex, in part because of Federer\u2019s anxiety and in part because Cilic adjusted to the indoor conditions after playing and practicing outdoors all tournament.\n\nBut Cilic was ultimately too inconsistent and not quite opportunistic enough while Federer, using his backhand chip to fine effect, was often able to put the tall Croatian in body positions and zones of the court where he was forced to be subtle instead of forceful.\n\nStill, it was close, and with the match on the line, Federer fought off two break points on his serve in the first game of the fifth set and then broke Cilic in the next game. He challenged a second serve at 30-30 that turned out to be a double fault, then hit a deep return on the next point that Cilic failed to handle.\n\nFederer held serve to go up by 3-0 in the next tense game and then accelerated to the finish line, one he has crossed more than any man at the major championships that define careers, even more so now than in Rosewall and Laver\u2019s era.\n\nNeither Rosewall nor Laver played a Grand Slam final under a closed roof, and though it was not raining on Sunday, temperatures in Melbourne surged again, hitting 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) in the late afternoon.\n\nThough the final was to begin at 7:30 p.m., when the weather was slightly cooler, the organizers determined one hour before the match that the combination of high temperatures and humidity called for them to put in effect their extreme-heat policy and play the final indoors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was surprised to hear they had the heat rule in place for a night match,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI never heard that before.

Federer practiced indoors, and Cilic chose to stick with practicing outdoors and then paid the price.\n\n\u201cWith the roof closed, it was way, way cooler than I expected,\u201d Cilic said. \u201cThat was very, very difficult, especially for the final, to be in that kind of situation.\u201d\n\nHe questioned the decision afterward but said he did not argue about it. Some former players, including the Australian star Pat Cash, cried foul, but Tennis Australia officials defended the move. Despite soaring temperatures for a few days during the first week, officials said, Sunday night was the first time all tournament that the threshold on their heat and humidity index had been reached.\n\nThe grueling, three-set women\u2019s final on Saturday night, in which Caroline Wozniacki defeated Simona Halep, was played on a slightly cooler, less humid evening with the roof open. ESPN reported that after the match was over, Halep spent several hours in the hospital being treated for dehydration.\n\nDarren Cahill, Halep\u2019s coach, said on Monday that she was \u201cO.K., and on her way home\u201d to Romania.\n\nTennis Australia officials said Halep\u2019s health problems had not factored into the decision to close the roof on Sunday.\n\nPhoto\n\nFederer trains regularly in the heat in Dubai, but playing conditions would certainly have been slower with the roof open.\n\nHis indoor record is now 273-65; Cilic\u2019s is 109-55. But Federer was still edgy as the 3-hour-3-minute match played out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s why I was so bloody emotional again at the end, because I was thinking about the outcome all day,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring the first set. During the second. During the third. During the fourth. \u2018How would I feel if I lost? How would I feel if I won?\u2019 And it just wouldn\u2019t stop, and I think that\u2019s why this match was particularly difficult today.\n\n\u201cIt reminded me a little bit of 2006, when I really got to the finals in a great way and played that match against Marcos Baghdatis that was also nerve-racking. I was the big favorite going in, and in the end you win and you are so relieved.\u201d\n\nFederer cried after beating Baghdatis in the final and receiving the trophy from Laver. He choked up again after being beaten by Nadal in the 2009 final, saying, \u201cGod, it\u2019s killing me.\u201d He eventually backed away from the microphone and was consoled by Nadal.\n\nBut Federer has not needed much consolation of late as he glides on at an age by which nearly all of the great men\u2019s players have moved on. He said it helped that his recurring back problems did not affect him here after troubling him post-Wimbledon last season.\n\n\u201cI was a bit worried at the end of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cI was relieved that after vacation, it was better. I think that\u2019s why I was able to win here.\u201d\n\nFederer said that, unusually, he did not take any anti-inflammatory pills during the tournament. \u201cI know guys my age who took one every day,\u201d he said.\n\nFederer tied Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson for the most Australian men\u2019s singles titles. He is 9-1 against Cilic, whom he defeated in last year\u2019s Wimbledon final in straight sets.\n\nDuring that match, Cilic, suffering from deep foot blisters of his own, cried in frustration during a changeover at his inability to compete at full strength.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and Federer have grown closer since that match. In September, they were part of the winning European team in the inaugural Laver Cup, an event created by Federer and his management company. In late November, they ended up vacationing on the same island in the Maldives, where they socialized and even practiced together twice.\n\n\u201cWe were both looking for a hitting partner, and it happened that we were there,\u201d Federer said. \u201cIt was the weirdest thing.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, they exchanged tennis blows in a much more public place. And as has been the case so often in the last 15 years, the man who ended up as the champion was Federer, somehow still hungry for more and still moved when it comes.\n\n\u201cI like to care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good I can care about these matches.\u201d", "title": "Roger Federer Wins the Australian Open for His 20th Grand Slam Title", "authors": ["Christopher Clarey"]}

Mr. Bennett condemned the seizure as illegal. In a raucous exchange in Parliament the following year, the country\u2019s justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, told Mr. Bennett that his ancestors had been \u201cthieves and murderers.\u201d A scuffle broke out and Mr. Bennett shoved Mr. Chinamasa to the ground; he was imprisoned for a year for assault.\n\nGranted early release for good behavior, Mr. Bennett complained of prison abuses, saying that he had been issued a uniform covered in excrement and lice, and made to stand naked in front of guards.\n\nBy then, Mr. Bennett had become a top deputy of Mr. Tsvangirai, and he was named the party\u2019s general treasurer. Fearing rearrest, he fled to South Africa in 2006 and was eventually granted asylum there.

But on his return to Zimbabwe in February 2009, he was promptly arrested and charged with treason, ostensibly in connection with a cache of arms found at his home in 2006. Mr. Tsvangirai denounced the arrest as politically motivated and warned that military intelligence officials \u2014 who remained loyal to Mr. Mugabe \u2014 had plotted to harm Mr. Bennett.\n\nThe government\u2019s case was based mostly on testimony from a witness, Peter Michael Hitschman, who, it later emerged, had been tortured \u2014 his buttocks were burned with cigarettes \u2014 and told that his wife and son would be harmed if he did not implicate Mr. Bennett. The trial began in October 2009. In March 2010, a judge ruled that Mr. Hitschman\u2019s testimony had been coerced.

Other than supporting a few small media literacy programs, Twitter doesn\u2019t seem to have a plan for eliminating the problematic content that originates within America\u2019s own borders.\n\nFacebook, which played its own round of Whack-a-Troll last year, scrubbing its platform of Internet Research Agency-created pages and accounts, doubled down on efforts to abdicate responsibility for defining high-quality content. On Jan. 19, Facebook announced that it will poll users to determine which outlets they trust and with which they are most familiar, giving those outlets priority in the News Feed.\n\nThese polls seem likely to reinforce existing biases, privilege well-known media giants and leave small outfits in the dust. After a year in which the United States witnessed a 37 percent decline in trust in institutions, the country\u2019s dwindling local newsrooms are more important than ever, interpreting and contextualizing events from Congress to the City Council for their readers in a way that larger news organizations struggled to do. Facebook should place local news in a prominent location, prioritize content from high-performing smaller outlets, perhaps through a competitive application system, and make serious investments in local journalism.", "title": "Opinion | Russian Trolls Are Only Part of the Problem", "authors": []}

Taylor McCuiston, 21, a manager at the restaurant who graduated from Marshall County High School two years ago, was working when the shooting occurred down the road.\n\n\u201cIt was very scary because, like, 90 percent of the staff that works here goes to that school,\u201d she said. \u201cSo for the first hour we were just scrambling trying to make sure they were all O.K. and accounted for.\u201d\n\nThe town of Italy, Tex., is not any bigger than Benton. On Monday, a 15-year-old girl there was hospitalized after she was shot by a 16-year-old classmate, according to local news reports. That suspect, a boy, was taken into custody by the Ellis County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The authorities said on Tuesday that the victim was recovering.\n\nThe F.B.I. study that Ms. Schweit helped write examined active shooter episodes in the United States between 2000 and 2013. It found that nearly one-quarter of them occurred in educational environments, and they were on the rise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the first half of the study period, federal officials counted 16 active shooter incidents in educational settings, meaning instances of a person \u201cactively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a confined and populated area.\u201d In the second half, the number rose to 23. (Many, but not all, of the school shootings tallied by advocates so far this year meet that definition.)\n\n\u201cAny time there\u2019s a school shooting, it\u2019s more gut-wrenching, and I think we have a tendency to react in a more visceral way,\u201d Ms. Schweit said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think as a whole, in society, we\u2019re taking shootings more seriously than we were before \u2014 and that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nEven so, jarred and fearful school administrators across the country have been placing greater emphasis on preparing for the possibility of an active shooter. According to a report issued by the Government Accountability Office in March 2016, 19 states were requiring individual schools to have plans for how to deal with an active shooter. Only 12 states required schools to conduct drills, but two-thirds of school districts reported that they had staged active shooter exercises.\n\nSchool safety experts say steps like the drills are crucial, if imperfect, safeguards.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve become somewhat desensitized to the fact that these things happened, and it takes a thing like Sandy Hook to bring us back to our senses,\u201d said William Modzeleski, a consultant who formerly led the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that if you don\u2019t hear about a school shooting for a while, educators move on to other things,\u201d he said. \u201cPrincipals are busy. Teachers are busy. Superintendents are busy.\u201d\n\nIn Kentucky, lawmakers have grappled with how to address the risk of school shootings. Last year, state legislators considered, but did not pass, a bill that would have allowed people with concealed-carry permits to bring weapons on to public school campuses, where proponents argue they could be used to respond to active shooters. A similar bill, limited to college campuses and certain other government buildings, has been introduced this year. It was not immediately clear how the shooting in Benton might affect the debate in Frankfort, the Kentucky capital.\n\nBut in Benton, \u201cthis is a wound that is going to take a long time to heal,\u201d said Mr. Bevin, the governor, \u201c and for some in this community, will never fully heal.\u201d", "title": "School Shooting in Kentucky Was Nation\u2019s 11th of Year.

Though not nearly as big as the protests a year ago, it was still a larger public manifestation than anything the Tea Party ever managed. And though the demonstration was meant as a rebuke to Donald Trump, one central demand was that Congress stand up for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, who were brought to the country as children. They now face deportation because Trump has moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program protecting them.\n\nThe energy of the progressive grass roots should be seen as a valuable resource for Democrats.

That\u2019s why it was so infuriating to see the Senate Democratic leadership sell the Dreamers out.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Senate Democrats made a deal with Republicans to reopen the federal government, which has been shut since Congress failed to pass a budget bill on Friday. Democrats had been using their leverage in budget negotiations to demand that Congress pass DACA protections into law. But almost as soon as the shutdown began, Democrats lost their nerve, and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced a deal to fund the government through Feb. 8.

Mostly, they were looking at the genes of patients who might develop leukemia or, in one research project, schizophrenia.\n\nThe scientists searched databases from genetic studies involving tens of thousands of people whose DNA had been obtained from their white blood cells.\n\nTo their great surprise, the teams converged on the same phenomenon. Unexpectedly large numbers of study participants had blood cells with mutations linked to leukemia \u2014 but they did not have the cancer. Instead, they had just one or two of the cluster of mutations.\n\n\u201cThis clearly wasn\u2019t happening by chance,\u201d said Steven McCarroll, a geneticist at the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School. \u201cWe knew we were onto something, but what were we onto?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe investigators quickly guessed the broad outlines.\n\nWhite blood cells, the attack dogs of the immune system, arise from stem cells in the bone marrow. Every day, a few hundred such stem cells spew out blood cells that begin dividing rapidly into the 10 billion needed to replace those that have died.\n\nSometimes, by chance, one of those marrow stem cells acquires a mutation, and the white blood cells it produces carry the same mutation.\n\n\u201cSome mutations are just markers of past events without any lasting consequence,\u201d said Dr. David Steensma, a blood cancer specialist at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\nBut others, especially those linked to leukemia, seem to give stem cells a new ability to accumulate in the marrow. The result is a sort of survival of the fittest, or fastest growing, stem cells in the marrow.\n\n\u201cSome mutations may alter the growth properties of the stem cell,\u201d said Dr. Steensma. \u201cSome may just make the stem cell better at surviving in certain less hospitable parts of the bone marrow where other stem cells can\u2019t thrive.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe mutated stem cells outlast normal stem cells in the marrow, and their progeny \u2014 an increasing percentage of white blood cells \u2014 show up in the blood with mutations.\n\nPerhaps the most extreme example of how this can play out was reported in 2014, when researchers described a 115-year-old woman. Nearly her entire supply of white blood cells was generated by mutated stem cells in her bone marrow.\n\nAt the first she had developed just two mutated stem cells.

He turned for help to Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist and genetics researcher at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute, who had genetic data from four more large studies.\n\nThey confirmed that CHIP doubled the risk of a heart attack in typical patients \u2014 and increased the risk fourfold in those who had heart attacks early in life.\n\nBut how might mutated white blood cells cause heart disease? One clue intrigued scientists.\n\nArtery-obstructing plaque is filled with white blood cells, smoldering with inflammation and subject to rupture. Perhaps mutated white cells were causing atherosclerosis or accelerating its development.\n\nIn separate studies, Dr. Ebert and Dr. Walsh gave mice a bone-marrow transplant containing stem cells with a CHIP mutation, along with stem cells that were not mutated. Mutated blood cells began proliferating in the mice, and they developed rapidly growing plaques that were burning with inflammation.\n\n\u201cFor decades people have worked on inflammation as a cause of atherosclerosis,\u201d Dr. Ebert said. \u201cBut it was not clear what initiated the inflammation.\u201d\n\nNow there is a possible explanation \u2014 and, Dr. Ebert said, it raises the possibility that CHIP may be involved in other inflammatory diseases, like arthritis.\n\nFor now, doctors advise against testing for CHIP, since there is nothing specific to be done to reduce the increased risks of cancer or heart disease that it confers.\n\nBut, he said, if people really want to know if they have CHIP, they can get a blood test that costs a few thousand dollars. (If there is no particular reason for the test, insurance may not pay.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Steensma said that if he had CHIP, he would make sure he did his best to control all of his heart disease risks, like cholesterol and blood pressure, and that he had a healthy diet and exercised. Drugs may be developed to help stem the inflammation in arteries, he added.\n\nAs for the cancer risk, Dr. Ross Levine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center just opened a C.H.I.P clinic in part to explore whether some patients with CHIP have a greater risk of blood cancers, and if so, what to do about it.\n\nAt the moment, CHIP is mostly found accidentally in patients who are genetically tested for other reasons \u2014 like Brian Gear.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his leadership tenure at the E.P.A., Mr. Pruitt has often won praise from Mr. Trump as a key executor of the president\u2019s aggressive efforts to roll back regulations on business and industry. Mr. Pruitt was among the most influential voices urging Mr. Trump to withdraw the country from the landmark Paris climate change agreement, making the United States only nation in the world not party to the accord.\n\nIn a sign of the high regard in which the president holds his E.P.A. chief, Mr. Trump has assigned Mr. Pruitt, rather than his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, to craft the legal tactics to implement that withdrawal.\n\nMr. Pruitt\u2019s 2016 remarks appear sharply at odds with his tenure at the Environmental Protection Agency. Last year, Mr. Trump issued multiple executive orders aimed at undoing environmental regulations on air, water and planet-warming pollution. Mr. Pruitt responded swiftly, drafting a list of legal proposals to undo those rules.\n\nHowever, on the 2016 radio show, Mr. Pruitt said, \u201cThis, if Donald Trump is the nominee and eventually the president, he would take, I think unapologetic steps, to use executive power to confront Congress in a way that is truly unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pruitt has come under criticism for the swiftness with which he has sought to undo those existing regulations, a multistep legal process that usually takes years, as well as for doing so in secrecy.\n\nIn an opening statement provided to senators on Tuesday, Mr. Pruitt stressed his commitment to process, rule of law and the Constitution. \u201cE.P.A. will seek to improve its processes and reinvigorate the rule of law as it administers environmental regulations as Congress intended, and to refocus the agency on its core statutory obligations,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a firm believer that federal agencies exist to administer laws passed by Congress, as intended.\u201d\n\nThroughout the rest of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s Senate testimony, Republicans heaped praise on him while Democrats hammered him for his push to strip away regulations.\n\nSenator Tom Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said: \u201cMr. Pruitt, you often say that the rule of law matters. Well, Congress was very prescriptive when it wrote the Clean Air Act. The law sets timelines that E.P.A. must use to determine whether our country is meeting federal standards for harmful ozone pollution. But your E.P.A. has chosen to continuously ignore and delay that very specific mandate from Congress, which leaves downwind states and vulnerable communities at risk indefinitely.\u201d\n\nSenator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, the chairman of the environment panel, applauded Mr. Pruitt\u2019s legal actions at the agency. \u201cDuring the last administration, E.P.A. administrators created broad and legally questionable new regulations that undermined the American people\u2019s faith in the agency,\u201d he said. \u201cThese regulations have done great damage to the livelihoods of our nation\u2019s hardest working citizens.\u201d\n\nOf Mr. Pruitt, Senator Barrasso said: \u201cHe has balanced the need to prioritize environmental protection with the desires of Americans to have thriving and economically sustainable communities.

He said the department was \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing related to the FISA process.\u201d\n\nTo obtain the warrant involving Mr. Page, the government needed to show probable cause that he was acting as an agent of Russia. Once investigators get approval from the Justice Department for a warrant, prosecutors take it to a surveillance court judge, who decides whether to approve it.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment, and a spokesman for Mr. Nunes did not reply to requests for comment. The people familiar with the contents of the memo spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details remained secret.\n\nA White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said in a statement: \u201cThe president has been clear publicly and privately that he wants absolute transparency throughout this process. Based on numerous news reports, top officials at the F.B.I. have engaged in conduct that shows bias against President Trump and bias for Hillary Clinton. While President Trump has the utmost respect and support for the rank-and-file members of the F.B.I., the anti-Trump bias at the top levels that appear to have existed is troubling.\u201d\n\nMr. Page, a former Moscow-based investment banker who later founded an investment company in New York, had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years. In 2013, an investigation revealed that a Russian spy had tried to recruit him.

They shut down the tunnel and arrested all of the 21 would-be fugitives.\n\nThe tunnel was filled in, abandoned and forgotten, only to be discovered recently when workers at the Mauerpark, a green area near the former buffer zone around the wall, found it during building work.\n\nPhoto\n\nDaring escapes\n\nAbout 75 tunnels were built under the wall during its three-decade existence, many of them around Bernauer Strasse. Residential buildings nearby provided handy shelter for digging and for entering the passages.\n\nOne escape that received widespread attention was filmed by NBC in 1962. The network provided money for an effort by students in West Berlin to connect two cellars on either side of the wall. The resulting documentary, called \u201cThe Tunnel,\u201d related the escape of 29 men, women and children, and it raised questions about the journalistic ethics involved.\n\nIn the autumn of 1964, 57 people from the East escaped through a tunnel that started in a disused courtyard bathroom. But this escape marked a turning point. An East German border guard was killed in a gunfight between the security forces and those helping the escape on the Western side. The 21-year-old guard, Egon Schultz, became a hero in the East after his death, leading many in the West to question the wisdom of promoting such crossings.\n\nPhoto\n\nPreserving a legacy\n\nFor a long stretch, Bernauer Strasse runs parallel to the site of the former wall. The street is also home to the Berlin Wall Memorial.\n\nMr. Dressler, the archaeologist, says there has been a shift in attitudes about preserving the wall. At first, there was a zeal to eradicate all signs of the hated barrier. But a push to document \u2014 and, in some cases, preserve \u2014 the border\u2019s infrastructure has gained traction. In the mid-2000s, a group of archaeologists, preservationists and city planners started compiling a list of the structures involved in dividing the city.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A year before the fall of the wall, the border was moved about 165 feet to the west in a land swap that the East German government apparently hoped would prevent people fleeing from a nearby soccer stadium.\n\nIdentifying remains of the wall and of escape tunnels like this one is a crucial part of ensuring that history \u2014 and the people affected \u2014 are not forgotten, Mr. Dressler said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was a tunnel that had dramatic effect,\u201d said Mr. Holzapfel, who helped to dig it. \u201cTwenty-one people were arrested as a result of that tunnel, and one woman died while she was in prison.\u201d", "title": "Secret Tunnel in Berlin Is an Echo From the Cold War", "authors": ["Christopher F.

Such sensors are critical in the operation of autonomous vehicles. One of the eight secrets was a so-called \u201cnegative trade secret\u201d \u2014 a term for a valuable lesson about what does and doesn\u2019t work that was learned through time-consuming trial and error.\n\nWhat Uber is arguing\n\nTRADE SECRETS. Uber says that what Waymo claims are trade secrets actually aren\u2019t. Uber is expected to argue it developed all of its autonomous vehicle technology and know-how independently and that the information Waymo claims are trade secrets are generally known or ascertainable by Uber\u2019s own experts.\n\nIt is a position that is fitting with the start-up spirit of Silicon Valley, where engineers move freely from company to company, taking what they know with them. A free flow of ideas and personnel can open the door to claims of theft or copying, but technologists often look down on companies that resort to legal action to kneecap a competitor.\n\nCHANGING JOBS. In a pretrial proceeding with lawyers for Uber and Waymo, Judge William Alsup, who will preside over the trial in federal court, pressed them on how to protect the rights of engineers to advance their careers elsewhere if their former employers designate \u201ceverything in the universe\u201d as a trade secret. He cited a hypothetical example of an engineer who learned the best way of doing something through trial and error.\n\nWhen that engineer moves to another company and is assigned that same task, will that person need to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d and go through all the experiments again to make sure they are not using a former employer\u2019s trade secrets? \u201cIs an engineer really supposed to get a frontal lobotomy before they go to the next job? I think the answer has to be no,\u201d Judge Alsup said.\n\nKEEPING SECRETS. Uber\u2019s lawyers are expected to argue that even if the knowledge amounted to trade secrets, it was not misappropriated, because \u2014 among other reasons \u2014 Waymo didn\u2019t do enough to keep its secrets secret. Besides, Uber can point out that it didn\u2019t benefit from any potential trade secrets because autonomous vehicles are still in development.", "title": "Secrets or Knowledge?

In a recent article for the online magazine Taste, the writer Mari Uyehara traced kale\u2019s kaleidoscopic success \u2014 from relative obscurity as an Italian cooking green to chain-restaurant salads to the diets of millions of Americans \u2014 back to the fall of 2007.\n\nThat\u2019s when Joshua McFadden was working as the chef de cuisine at Franny\u2019s, a pizzeria in Brooklyn, and improvised a new dish using the raw dark leaves of lacinato kale. The vegetable, with roots in the Mediterranean, was typically cooked to break down its network of tough fibers, and it was still fairly unusual, though not entirely unheard-of, to serve it raw. McFadden rolled the kale tightly to make a chiffonade, cutting it into thin, delicate strips measuring 1/16 of an inch wide, and marinated these with garlic, olive oil, lemon juice and cheese. It was a low-key dish on a low-key day, but it became a part of American restaurant mythology all the same, because it wasn\u2019t long afterward that the kale salad ascended to fame and kale, once an esoteric green, went mainstream.\n\nIn his cookbook \u201cSix Seasons: A New Way With Vegetables,\u201d published last May, McFadden includes a recipe for the dish and calls it \u201cThe Kale Salad That Started It All.\u201d I\u2019d had the salad, and in the following years I had my fill of its rough, endlessly chewy imitations \u2014 too often made with thick, ancient leaves. It had the effect of putting me off kale altogether, especially when it was served raw. When I spent a few weekends last year cooking from McFadden\u2019s book, propelled from one recipe to the next, I was careful not to brush up against a single bunch of the stuff.\n\nThis was easy. I made the fava beans on toast. The celery dressed with minced anchovies and raisins. The buttery walnut crostata filled with chard and ricotta. His instructions were loose but sharp-eyed, with constant reminders that a wide range of possibilities exists for every vegetable. Celery, for example, could be dressed raw, or it could be braised with olive oil and white wine, or it could be simmered with vegetable stock and blended into an unexpectedly luxurious soup. Every vegetable could shine, not in the limited ways you expected them to, but in many ways.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs winter started to creep in, later than usual, and hardy greens took over the market stands in Brooklyn, I turned increasingly to McFadden\u2019s suggestions for what to do with collard greens (stew them with beans and chiles and an old, dried-out rind of cheese). And kale. I\u2019d nearly forgotten that kale wasn\u2019t only a hyperbolic pitch or a lazy headline; that it was a reliable, cheap green that made for good eating, especially when it was cooked \u2014 until I followed McFadden\u2019s recipe for a kale-centric pasta sauce.\n\nPhoto\n\nI was drawn in by the simple technique: You pull lacinato kale leaves from their pale, woody ribs and blanch the greens in salted boiling water, just until they are tender. Then you whir the dripping-wet kale in a blender with some garlic and the olive oil that the garlic was fried in and season it all with salt and pepper. The kale, pur\u00e9ed this way, turned a vivid green \u2014 a sunny almost neon green. It appeared glossy and completely smooth, and it tasted sweet and mellow. Tossed with pasta, grated Parmigiano and a little extra pasta water, it loosened up, becoming very nearly creamy. And it was done in the same amount of time it would take to make a salad.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very simple way to convey new olive oil and a winter green,\u201d McFadden told me on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s an unexpected flavor in the dead of winter.\u201d McFadden left New York years ago and opened Ava Gene\u2019s, his own restaurant, in Portland, Ore. He devoted himself to the growing and cooking of so many other vegetables, but still, somehow, reporters were calling him and asking about kale. I wondered if he was tired of talking about it. \u201cSure,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be?\u201d I saw his point. And I asked if he used other varieties of winter greens to make the same sauce, thinking that this way I might write about something else.

It is difficult to see how the two men could expect to get away with it. Who would lie to the F.B.I. if one\u2019s colleagues, interviewed at a later date, would contradict the false account of the same set of events?\n\nWe now know Mr. Flynn\u2019s phone call during the transition in December 2016 with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador, was coordinated with other senior transition officials meeting at Mar-a-Lago, in Florida. When it came to Mr. Flynn\u2019s F.B.I. interview, a story was already in place. The day before, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, had adamantly denied that Mr. Flynn spoke to the Russians about sanctions. So to get away with lying to the F.B.I., whether or not he alerted White House officials to the meeting beforehand, Mr. Flynn would presumably have to count on the others sticking to that lie, too.\n\nThe same goes for Mr. Papadopoulos, who risked going to prison for lying to the F.B.I. As with Mr. Flynn, his communications with the Russians were well known and approved by senior campaign officials.\n\nThe pattern goes on from there. If Mr. Flynn was counting on others to cover his tracks, he seems to have calculated correctly. For example, K. T. McFarland, the former deputy national security adviser who also served on the transition team, told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, in writing, that she was not aware of Mr. Flynn\u2019s contacts with the Russian ambassador. That was a lie, disproved by court documents revealing her close strategizing with Mr. Flynn before and after the call and by the news report of her email coordinating on the matter with senior members of the Trump transition team at Mar-a-Lago. (Mr. Spicer was one of the email\u2019s recipients.)\n\nJeff Sessions also infamously lied to federal authorities or at least risked perjury. During his confirmation hearings for attorney general and in subsequent written answers to a senator, Mr. Sessions denied having communications with the Russians.

Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, the men who are front and center in most Civil War narratives, are seldom mentioned by Ayers\u2019s subjects.\n\nImage\n\nMany accounts of the war, both in print and film, depict the victory by the North as inevitable, because of its greater military manpower and industrial might. Ayers\u2019s intimate, chronological approach allows him to challenge that thesis. Rather than inevitability, the people of Staunton, Va., and Chambersburg, Pa., demonstrate contingency.\n\nAgain and again, Ayers will bracket a poignant passage from a diary or letter with the phrase \u201cat the time,\u201d to set up contrasts with standard interpretations. Thus, \u201cat the time\u201d of the Union victory at Gettysburg, the individuals whose letters and diaries are quoted here did not understand the battle to be a decisive turning point in the war. Again, for residents of Augusta County, Philip Sheridan\u2019s attacks in the Shenandoah Valley in 1864 did not \u201cat the time\u201d feel like the total destruction described by later accounts.\n\nSlavery is a central thread that connects both of Ayers\u2019s books. In this one, he portrays the courageous determination of African-Americans after emancipation trying to take control of their own destinies. Their hopes are contrasted with the condescending racist attitudes of whites, not simply in Virginia, but also in Pennsylvania. A new word, \u201cmiscegenation,\u201d conjured up a new threat, the fear of the mixing of the races.\n\nWomen emerge as central actors in this volume, too. With men either away fighting, or fleeing in the face of invasions in both Virginia and Pennsylvania, wives, mothers and daughters stood up and spoke out against the occupying armies. Staunton experienced invasion in both June and September 1864; letters and diaries reveal women\u2019s outrage directed not at the destruction of railroads and warehouses, but at the violation of the private spaces of their homes.", "title": "Seeing the Civil War From the Ground Up", "authors": []}

The store\u2019s interior has been furnished as a gallery of sumptuous surfaces: panels of midnight blue velvet offset with enormous beveled mirrors; columns and floors in a storm-cloud-patterned marble; rectilinear sconces of a translucent black-veined marble; timbering of dark lacquered walnut and mahogany; side tables set with purple succulents in glimmering copper spheres and moon-white orchids. To the rear is a clubroom, supervised by a large photograph of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin on an aircraft\u2019s staircase \u2014 Varsano sold Sinatra a Learjet in the early 1980s, though his honor obligated him to tell me it wasn\u2019t the one in the picture \u2014 and Varsano\u2019s personal office, swathed in gray crocodile skin, where he sits, behind an armored door, at a desk once owned by Margaret Thatcher.\n\nThe front window acts as a behemoth aquarium for Varsano\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the bulk of the fuselage of an actual Airbus A319. The segment of plane in Varsano\u2019s window, were it a JetBlue workhorse, would represent perhaps 20 rows of plastic trays and passenger elbows. The Jet Business mock-up has the capacity for one passenger of roomy ambition, along with a small entourage. Varsano encourages his clients to appoint an airplane interior as if it were a second home, and in that spirit he directed a tony design firm to decorate his floor model to the last degree of his own preference, a nostalgic homage to aggressive 1980s overkill: suede linings; black mink throws on couches and captain\u2019s chairs of cream leather; hardwood and chrome; a heavy wooden artisanal backgammon board; chandeliers of droopy rectangular mirrors. Bottles of Royal Dragon Superior Vodka are set into the cupholders, and the bars are stocked with Dom P\u00e9rignon. Behind a fixed bulkhead where the fore galley would be, fitted lengthwise into the cross-section, is a corporate-raider-inflected \u201cboardroom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt an industry trade fair in Geneva last May, I overheard an industry analyst explain Varsano\u2019s storefront to a Russian lawyer: \u201cIt\u2019s like you go to his shop to buy an airplane the way you might buy a dress or a car.\u201d The booths at the fair seemed to make this comparison plausible; while some of them offered pragmatic aviation solutions (soundproofing, flameproofing, protecting your cockpit from laser attack), there were also great billowing capes of sample leather upholsteries called Monarch and Noble and Duchess, and honeycomb composites made to resemble the fine grain of any protected wood, and vendors that offered bespoke seat-perforation patterns. Varsano, however, finds the analogy flippant. In a 2013 interview, shortly after his shop opened, Varsano told the BBC: \u201cThe view that it\u2019s all about flying off on a skiing trip with Champagne and girls is just so untrue.\u201d For Varsano, an aircraft is a practical necessity \u2014 a \u201cbusiness tool\u201d or a \u201ctime machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood usage of a private aircraft is about 400 hours a year,\u201d he told me. \u201cI did the math, and my calculation is that even 200 hours of use of a corporate jet adds 33 days to an executive\u2019s year. Now, you bring two or three other execs with him \u2014 do the math, and all of a sudden you\u2019ve got a free C.E.O.! When the automobile companies came to appear in front of Congress and they got such a hard time for arriving on their corporate jets, they shouldn\u2019t have been so wimpish! They should have said, \u2018Yeah, we came in on a private jet, we have a million employees and we\u2019ve got to fly back tonight at midnight to be in the office at 7 a.m. to save this company.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn a Saturday in October, two days before he was set to reopen, Varsano invited me to a late dinner with two of his friends at a restaurant in Berkeley Square that was reserved through 2018. After we finished dinner a little after 11, Varsano suggested we visit his office for a sort of soft opening. The showroom was arrayed in muted sky blues and overcast grays, and we took our places in deep-set swiveling club chairs oriented in a semicircle before 32 tiled wide-screen panels of vivid high-definition display. Overhead was a large elliptical inset of soft eggshell leather, gently branded with the company\u2019s geometric logo of intersecting flight paths, illuminated by a recessed orbit of dusky yellow.\n\nTHE JET SET Part 1 Private-plane use can be hard to track. Aircraft are often registered to bank trustees or other third parties, and the Federal Aviation Administration will keep some flight paths private upon request. But based on F.A.A. registrations and other public records, here are some of the oligarchs and moguls who count an airplane among their considerable assets. By Joanna Pearlstein GULFSTREAM G650/G650ER Customers swarmed to Gulfstream\u2019s longer-range ER jet when it first arrived in 2014. Starting price (new G650): $67.4 million. Jeff Bezos: The founder of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post is the sole member of an LLC that owns a Gulfstream G650ER. In 2015, the LLC also purchased a Seattle airplane hangar for $5.5 million. Elon Musk: SpaceX, his commercial space enterprise, owns a Gulfstream G650ER; it\u2019s registered to Falcon Landing, another Musk company. Maurice Marciano: The co-founder of Guess retired in 2012 and now sells wine and collects art. He also manages an LLC that owns a G650. Fayez Sarofim: An 80-something Egyptian-born billionaire, he\u2019s part owner of the Houston Texans football team and the full owner of a G650. David Geffen: The philanthropist and producer (he\u2019s the G in DreamWorks SKG) has owned Gulfstreams dating back to the 1990s; his latest, a Gulfstream G650, has been photographed by plane-spotters in Sydney, Malta and Spain. Tom Gores: The Beverly Hills financier counts hotels, transit companies and an aerospace provider among his private-equity firm\u2019s assets; he\u2019s also the owner of the Detroit Pistons basketball team and, via his firm, a Gulfstream G650. Phil Knight: A firm managed by Knight, Nike\u2019s former chief executive, owns a plane that makes clear two of his passions: The Gulfstream G650 (tail number N1KE) has the athletic company\u2019s swoosh on the wing, while the tail and undercarriage are decorated as a homage to the University of Oregon\u2019s sports teams, the Ducks.\n\nHe picked up an infrared mouse and asked one of the two friends \u2014 a luminously preserved businessman who asked not to be named \u2014 to begin by telling him how much he\u2019d be willing to spend, in theory, on a replacement of his seven-year-old plane.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say 60 million,\u201d the businessman said. Varsano entered a price setting on the enormous screen\u2019s left sidebar. This number, it should be noted, represented only the price of the aircraft itself. For the larger planes, buyers often spend the same amount of money on personal customization as they do on the initial purchase.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the longest trip you do regularly?\u201d\n\n\u201cLondon to Los Angeles.\u201d Varsano set the range to 4,700 nautical miles.\n\n\u201cHow old a plane would you feel comfortable with?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say two years,\u201d Varsano proposed. The businessman looked away from the screen and at Varsano. \u201cO.K., one year.\u201d Varsano clicked the corresponding setting.\n\n\u201cHow many passengers?\u201d\n\n\u201cFourteen.\u201d\n\nVarsano finalized the search, and the screen tiled itself into brochure-quality images of aircraft exteriors. \u201cThere are 13 suitable planes potentially on the market for you.\u201d By \u201con the market,\u201d he meant planes that were either actually advertised somewhere or were technically off-market but, as with anything, available at the right price. Varsano scanned over the images. \u201cShould we include an A.C.J. or a B.B.J., or not one of those big ones?\u201d About 20 years ago, in an attempt to capture a share of what was then an increasingly profitable private market, Boeing and Airbus developed imprints of their companies \u2014 Boeing Business Jets, or B.B.J., and Airbus Corporate Jets, or A.C.J. \u2014 that sell commercial airliners with V.I.P. configurations. These \u201cbizliners\u201d are much larger than a typical private jet, with space for multiple bedrooms and showers or thrones, and use more gas; they can cost from $90 million to $500 million, and as much as $13,000 an hour to run. Individuals, Varsano told me in Geneva, often avoid them because of what the industry calls \u201cramp presence\u201d: The size and bulbousness of a B.B.J. or an A.C.J. invite class resentment, and, worse, might remind onlookers of the easyJet they flew in on. A Gulfstream is regarded as a more prudent and tasteful choice. The G650, Gulfstream\u2019s flagship product, is currently the skyfaring object of greatest desire, and it is no exaggeration to call the $70 million aircraft the world\u2019s single greatest status commodity. Desire for them is so ardent in part because of their physical elegance \u2014 they have a phocine aspect, with a silkily sloping underbelly and large, widely spaced elliptical portholes, with an interior like a conch shell \u2014 and in part because they cut a more discreet profile.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll compare three possibilities: a bizliner, a Gulfstream G650 and a Global 6000\u201d \u2014 the last of these a roughly comparable model from the Canadian firm Bombardier. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the ranges,\u201d Varsano proposed, and the screen lit up with a world map, centered on London and overlaid with \u201cmaximum range perimeters\u201d in red, blue and yellow, scrolling across the continents in chromatic sine waves. The ranges swept down from Los Angeles almost to S\u00e3o Paulo before coming back up to the east, to comfortably include Dubai, and then ultimately sweeping in a band between Beijing and Tokyo. The businessman nodded.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNow let\u2019s look at the differences in cross-section.\u201d Three overlapping fuselage outlines appeared on the screen, again in red, blue and yellow. \u201cIt\u2019s a 100 percent scale,\u201d Varsano said. \u201cGet up and stand there.\u201d The businessman measured himself against the images and did not find the dimensions wanting.\n\n\u201cO.K., sell me the B.B.J.,\u201d the businessman said, in a failed attempt to seem idly flirtatious.\n\nVarsano clicked again. \u201cHere\u2019s the market data, all the B.B.J.s for sale around the world according to our database.\u201d The video wall exhibited a branded, proprietary table with the relevant real-time statistics \u2014 date of manufacture, delivery date, passenger allowance, range, expected price \u2014 for around 20 planes. The top line featured an aircraft that had only a thousand hours on it, which represented either about two and a half years of private use or perhaps a month and a half of commercial deployment. It was located in an Asian country for more than $70 million and had been on the market for almost a year. Varsano scrolled through images, drawn from his firm\u2019s database, of the actual interiors of the available planes, while subtly discouraging the businessman from his instinct to purchase one brand-new. This was in part because delivery of new planes can take a very long time and in part because there is no rational reason for anyone to purchase a new plane, and on some level the idea violates Varsano\u2019s respect for his product\u2019s engineering and durability.\n\n\u201cSo, Steve,\u201d the businessman asked, with the merest hint of vulnerability, \u201cwhat would you buy?\u201d\n\nVarsano shrugged; he was used to the question. He also knew exactly what the businessman should buy \u2014 he could size that up within minutes \u2014 but was careful never to seem pushy. \u201cI would buy the B.B.J. if I was taking long flights all the time and bringing along my kids and their nannies and whatever animals.\u201d He paused. \u201cOn the other hand, you can\u2019t fly directly to Aspen,\u201d because the runway is too short. \u201cYou\u2019d have to fly to Rifle, and then drive 45 minutes. In London, you couldn\u2019t fly in and out of Northolt at maximum weight, but you\u2019d be O.K. in Farnborough and Luton.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat about the Gulfstream?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d get to L.A. an hour faster, but you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy with the kids and the nannies and the animals.\u201d The businessman, who had both grown children and still-nannied children, said nothing.\n\n\u201cBut the thing is,\u201d Varsano continued, \u201cyou have to fly on one of these yourself \u2014 and that means chartering one and taking the whole family to L.A., not just taking an empty one to Milan alone. You won\u2019t have the real experience that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I love the idea of a B.B.J., but I don\u2019t like the noise, the cabin volume.\u201d He paused again. The pretense that this was simply a fun half-drunken near-midnight exercise had been openly abandoned. \u201cThis is coming up. I have to do it sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVarsano wears special French cuffs with round cutouts to display a saucer-size watch; he glanced down and saw that it was nearly midnight. He stood up and asked us to take our places on the dimly moonlit sidewalk outside. We watched as he ceremonially lifted the shades for the first time, revealing the pristine fuselage bathed in pools of aquamarine and royal blue. Tufts of cumulus, floodlit from below, had been painted on the ceiling above the plane. After just a few moments, Varsano closed the shades again, and the incandescent celestial blue disappeared once more into the reflected red and white flashes of terrestrial traffic.\n\nUnderneath Varsano\u2019s burnished charm is the working-class New Jersey of his youth. At one point, he made T-shirts for his friends and prospective clients that said, \u201cHappy Holidays, Happy New Year, stop apologizing for your success, buy a jet!\u201d He is known for his honesty and diligence, as well as a certain slickness to his operation. On a shared panel at the Geneva fair, an industry journalist looked over at Varsano and said, \u201cSteve is a guy, he goes to one wedding in India and he came back having sold eight jets.\u201d He bristles at the idea, however, that he is a good salesman who happens to sell airplanes. When the third-generation scion of a private-fleeted family told him he should diversify his wares, Varsano just shook his head. Planes are what he knows and has adored since childhood. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the guy opening up the trench coat\u201d \u2014 he pantomimed a black-market peddler \u2014 \u201csaying, I got watches in here, yachts over here, real estate here.\u201d\n\nTHE JET SET Part 2 BOMBARDIER BUSINESS AIRCRAFT The Canadian company claims its Global jets cost less to operate than rival models. Starting price (new Global 6000): $62.3 million. Larry Ellison: The Oracle co-founder and owner of the Hawaiian island Lanai counts three Bombardiers and several Cessnas among his companies\u2019 possessions. Ann Walton Kroenke: A Montana LLC registered to the Walmart heiress and her husband claims a Global 6000 and two planes from the Challenger 300 series. Steve Ballmer: After stepping down as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team; one of his firms owns a Bombardier. Samuel Zell: The Chicago billionaire owns three planes, including two Bombardiers. Foster Friess: A septuagenarian Wyoming businessman who recently announced that he is considering a run for the United States Senate, Friess owns two planes, including a Challenger 300. Vivek Ranadive: The Tibco founder and Sacramento Kings owner has a Challenger 604. Craig Ramsey: The longtime tech executive owns a Challenger 350, and in 2016 he bought the penthouse in San Francisco\u2019s famously sinking Millennium Tower. Floyd Wilson: The Houston-based energy executive flies in a Challenger 604. Tom van Loben Sels: Van Loben Sels, a partner at a Palo Alto tax-consulting company, either owns a Challenger 604 himself or registered it for a wealthy client. (His name has appeared on public records for real estate widely reported to belong to Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and the Napster co-founder Sean Parker.)\n\nMore than one person told me that Varsano probably knew more billionaires personally than anyone alive. He admitted he had never quite gotten used to his current circumstances. Though he had been dealing jets on and off for almost 30 years, for a long time, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t really part of this world. I just worked in it.\u201d Varsano was born in Manhattan but raised on the far side of the George Washington Bridge, in the working-class suburbs near Teterboro Airport. Teterboro now hosts the largest share of American private-jet traffic, but back then it was just another local airstrip. He was brought up by a single mother \u2014 his father left his family when Varsano was 5 \u2014 who always worked at least two jobs, as a waitress and in beauty salons, where Varsano swept the floor. When he was 14, a friend\u2019s older brother took him up in a four-seater Cessna. He would work for a month as a dishwasher to be able to afford an hour of flying lessons and got his pilot\u2019s license when he was 17. He went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a prestigious flight academy in Daytona Beach that he calls \u201cthe Harvard of the sky.\u201d It was his first exposure to extreme international wealth, especially the variety that accrued to despots and their associates. \u201cIt was full of kids like the son of Idi Amin, who drove Ferraris around Daytona and would then go back to the military in their country. It was a real who\u2019s who.\u201d\n\nHe first worked as an intern at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater airport, then moved to Washington in 1978 for an entry-level job as an aviation lobbyist. The association had a plane he could fly whenever he liked, as long as he paid for gas, but he was making only $13,000 a year. It was the age of disco, and his roommate ran the Apple Tree, \u201cthe hottest club in D.C. It was the place to go, a special elite place.\u201d He worked as a doorman to make gas money for the plane. One day a guy came into the Apple Tree with a Learjet on his tie pin. \u201cThese were the days people used to wear tie pins,\u201d Varsano explained to me. \u201cWhen people used to wear ties.\u201d Varsano went up to him and discovered he worked for a jet brokerage. \u201cI said, Screw this, I want a job there.\u201d The man got him an interview.\n\n\u201cI put on the best polyester suit I could find, and I go in there, and everybody\u2019s sitting around in T-shirts and jeans. They told me they never meet their customers. They do it all on the phone. I say, \u2018How do you sell a $5 million plane on the phone?\u2019 But that was just the way the business was done.\u201d They allowed him to work on a commission-only basis. At night he put in shifts as a waiter in McLean, Va., and by day he tried to sell planes. \u201cAt 4 p.m. I\u2019m talking to a guy about a $4 million Learjet, and at 6 p.m. I\u2019m getting yelled at to refill some guy\u2019s coffee. It was a humbling experience, and it kept me grounded. Seven or eight months later, I sold a Westwind II to one of the richest guys in Venezuela.\u201d (He claims that as they neared Miami during the delivery, the Venezuelan\u2019s associates pulled a gun and tried to kidnap him to Caracas, but he managed to escape.)\n\nIn the 1980s, Varsano began to move in Washington\u2019s society circles; he hosted charity benefits, including one at the Old Post Office building, which is now Trump\u2019s Washington hotel, and dated socialite doyennes like Shari Theismann, the ex-wife of the Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann. He took a trip to England to pick up a plane for delivery and came back with a right-side-drive Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer; his vanity plate was \u201cBUYAJET.\u201d He once drove it up the White House driveway to return Fawn Hall, Oliver North\u2019s secretary, to her car. In the spring of 1985, Varsano was named Bachelor of the Month by Cosmopolitan magazine. \u201cAt 29,\u201d the Washington journalist Rudy Maxa reported, in a follow-up about the thousands of scented letters Varsano received from Cosmo\u2019s readers, \u201che earns more than $100,000 a year traveling the world, selling private jets. With thick, dark hair, a strong chin and firm physique, he\u2019s an Italian stallion who dresses sharp, looks sharp and feels sharp.\u201d\n\nAfter Varsano sold a plane to the corporate raider Nelson Peltz in the mid-\u201980s, he went to work for him in the world of private equity, where he developed a halfhearted fondness for the Gekko manner. Varsano coordinated Peltz\u2019s purchase and overhaul of High Winds, DeWitt Wallace\u2019s estate in Bedford, N.Y.; Peltz infuriated the local community by flying his helicopter to Manhattan almost daily. (A representative for Peltz disputed Varsano\u2019s account of their relationship but declined to provide specifics.) When Varsano and a subsequent boss acquired some fast-food companies in the early 2000s, he found himself in charge of the developing-market expansion of the Long John Silver\u2019s brand. Each time he visited the offices of Russian oligarchs or Middle Eastern royals, he found they invariably displayed a model of their private planes. They loved the opportunity to talk about them with someone as knowledgeable as Varsano, and he realized that he had stumbled into an enormous opportunity. Fifteen years ago, 85 percent of the private planes in the world were in the United States, but he could see that was changing. The deals he does today bear out this shift. He outlined one example: \u201cRussian owner, Panamanian shell company, Swiss-registered airplane, selling to a Chinese corporation, with the inspection in Switzerland, lawyers in Germany and the U.K. and the escrow agent in the U.S.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nVarsano knows his relevant client base down to nearly the last person, and his aim is to maintain up-to-date records on every single one of the six or seven thousand jets that are large enough for the Jet Business to follow. Roughly a quarter of its business is with first-time buyers, but those leads tend to be so dicey that Varsano\u2019s staff dedicates most of its time and energy to plane-owning people and organizations. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a fast-food restaurant,\u201d Varsano told me, \u201cit\u2019s easier to get the guy who comes in three times a month to come in four times a month than it is to get a new customer. So we try to check in with all the current owners at least every quarter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA research staff works on a trading floor behind convexities of smoked glass, at cockpit-like desks of kid-glove Bentley leather with three screens apiece. They begin with an industry-standard subscription database, but its information \u2014 serial number, registration information, sales history, whatever is known of the ownership and any publicly listed current prices \u2014 is almost always incomplete or unreliable, as the most sensitive data is concealed underneath layers of shell companies incorporated in places like Delaware, Panama or the British Virgin Islands. Beyond ferreting out the basic question of ownership, Varsano\u2019s researchers try to gather as much market information as they can. They\u2019ll see that a given plane is going out of warranty in a year or two, or is about to hit the end of a corporate depreciation schedule, or is due for the sort of routine but expensive engine check that regulators require, or they\u2019ll know a new model is due from the factory soon, and they\u2019ll ask if the owner has given any thought to a sale. Varsano is known to represent serious buyers, so if they call and say they\u2019ve got a customer in the market for a G650 or a Falcon 900LX, his researchers are confident they\u2019ll get legitimate (if exaggerated) bid-ask spreads.\n\nAfter a long afternoon with one of his researchers, I mentioned to Varsano that his constant emphasis on the utility of jets was at times hard to square with the tenor of a market that seems to rely so much on appurtenance and churn. Airplanes are so rigorously regulated in their maintenance that there\u2019s practically no difference, outside cockpit avionics and maintenance fees, between a 20-year-old Gulfstream GV and a freshly delivered G650 except that new-plane smell and about $50 million.\n\nVarsano had a prepared answer \u2014 about range and cabin pressure and what it\u2019s worth to a chief executive of a $10 billion company to land at his or her destination refreshed and ready to go \u2014 but on some level he\u2019s well aware that his business relies on covetousness and increasingly customized definitions of need. One of the peculiarities of inequality, as psychologists and social scientists have somewhat belatedly come to understand, is that it has a kind of fractal nature. The relationship of the middle class to the rich is replicated in the relationship between the merely rich and the extremely wealthy. Varsano\u2019s target class is so small that these dynamics, here between the extremely wealthy and the unimaginably so, are crystallized on the level of the individual. The owner of a $25 million plane feels morally judicious \u2014 even humble \u2014 insofar as he doesn\u2019t own a $70 million plane, while at the same time he admires that of his neighbor and hopes for an upgrade. The three or four hundred owners of the $70 million plane come to see it in short order not as a luxury but as a business and lifestyle requirement, and are in turn frustrated that the wireless signal isn\u2019t strong enough and that there just aren\u2019t enough landing slots in Hong Kong or hangar spaces for parking in Mumbai.\n\nOver the spring, Varsano had insisted that I really couldn\u2019t comprehend the appeal of these planes unless I flew with an owner myself. \u201cYou could read a book about swimming,\u201d he said, \u201cbut until I throw you into the pool, you\u2019re not going to swim.\u201d He offered to connect me to a customer who might grant me that privilege: his buddy Tony Robbins, motivational guru to the jet-possession set. Robbins flies 400 hours a year, including regular runs to London and Australia, and wherever he goes, he takes an entourage \u2014 usually a trainer, a bodyworker, two assistants, his wife and her Yorkie.\n\nTHE JET SET Part 3 THE \u2018BIZLINERS\u2019 Most of these large jets are Boeing or Airbus models converted from commercial use; others are made specifically as private jets. Starting price (new): $90 million. Donald J. Trump: The president reportedly paid $100 million in 2011 for his converted Boeing 757, which originally was flown by two discount airlines. Steven Spielberg: An entity linked to Amblin Entertainment, one of the director\u2019s companies, is the listed owner of a Boeing 737. Sheldon Adelson: Adelson, who spent more than $5 million to elect Donald Trump, claims several large jets either personally or through his casino empire: a 747, two 737s and an Airbus A340. Eric Schmidt: Companies managed by the departing executive chairman of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, claim a Boeing 767 and a Dornier Alpha-jet. Alisher Usmanov: Uzbekistan Airways recently announced that it is leasing an Airbus A340 belonging to Usmanov, the Russian billionaire, to transport the nation\u2019s president. Ron Burkle: The Montana-based hotel, grocery and investment magnate has a Boeing 757. Hassanal Bolkiah: The Sultan of Brunei flies on a Boeing 747; among many other assets, a firm owned by his investment fund manages elite hotels like the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in Paris, the Dorchester in London and the Beverly Hills Hotel. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal: Saudi Arabia\u2019s most famous billionaire travels in a Boeing 747, but at the moment he isn\u2019t able to use it: In November, he was arrested along with several other Saudi princes.\n\nOne summer day, my phone rang from an unknown number, and Robbins\u2019s deep but sweetly croaking voice boomed on the line. A few years ago Robbins mentioned to his friend Steve Wynn that it was time for him to buy a plane, and Wynn told him that he was crazy to talk to anyone but Varsano \u2014 that he would never even think of buying a plane from anybody but Varsano. Varsano helped Robbins buy a Bombardier Global Express previously owned by Micky Arison, the chairman of Carnival cruises and the owner of the Miami Heat, who had recently decided to upgrade to a Gulfstream G650. Varsano literally had to walk across hot coals to close the deal. Robbins loved the plane. It felt like his second home \u2014 or, to be more precise, his seventh.\n\nRobbins told me he was flying to Vancouver that afternoon and said that I was welcome to fly with him in about 10 days\u2019 time from Vancouver to Las Vegas, with a stopover in Spokane to drop off his wife. His schedule, he explained, probably wouldn\u2019t coalesce until a few days before he set off \u2014 \u201cPart of the value of having a private jet,\u201d he explained in a subsequent voice memo, \u201cis that you don\u2019t have to make decisions until the last minute\u201d \u2014 and he ultimately decided on a Friday that he\u2019d be leaving for Vegas the following Tuesday morning. My overbooked flight to Seattle arrived late, but fortunately my overbooked connecting flight to Vancouver was also late. One of Robbins\u2019s assistants texted me the night before to ask if I had any dietary restrictions and to say that the plane was set to depart at 11:30 the next morning, so I should be at the Shell Aerocentre at Abbotsford, some 40 miles east of Vancouver, no later than 11:20.\n\nWhen I arrived at the private terminal, I was supposed to look for a tail number that included, as many registrations do, the owner\u2019s initials. That task was made considerably easier by the fact that the plane \u2014 the size of a building and bone-white against the wildfire-smoked sky \u2014 was emblazoned with a modestly stylized \u201cTR\u201d monogram. It was also the only aircraft there, just sitting on the apron slightly askance, the way you might hurriedly park at midnight in an otherwise empty lot. The underbelly of the aircraft was painted a soft navy, with curved racing stripes of silver and gold. Robbins showed up with his wife and her parents, proceeded through a gate in the chain-link fence and strolled slowly to the plane\u2019s stairs. The pink-necktied captain came to relieve me of my bag, stuck a green Post-it on it upon which someone had scrawled \u201cVegas\u201d and asked if it would be acceptable to place it in the rear cargo bay. He did that himself. Two maintenance men loaded the rest of the luggage from the tarmac into the hold, saving the garment bags and the golf clubs for last.\n\nWith five minutes before takeoff, the captain came to usher me to the plane, where I was met by Robbins\u2019s aeronautic major-domo, Ariane, a tall, well-seasoned flight attendant in a gray business-suit uniform. The interior smelled faintly of eucalyptus. She took me to Robbins, who was sitting in what Varsano had told me was the V.I.P. chair, on the starboard side facing forward toward the galley and the pilots. After briefly introducing me to his wife, Robbins suggested we retire to the rear of the aircraft to introduce ourselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt 6-foot-7, Robbins could not begin to stand fully upright in any non-bizliner plane, but the Global came close, and he had to reduce himself by only a head to make his way past the couch and the sideboard to the rear of the cabin. About a minute with Robbins is enough to convince anyone that his size is actually a practical matter of spatio-energetic prerequisite: Any smaller vessel would simply disintegrate at the slightest vent of his life force. This energy is indivisible into units of small talk, and if Robbins ever allows for a moment of conversational entropy \u2014 by looking away from your eyes for a split second \u2014 it\u2019s only out of politeness, to afford you the opportunity to regather your own wan, windblown vitality. He wore all black, a black exercise V-neck over black shorts, with a black baseball cap and black-and-red Nikes, in what could only have been a genuine if futile attempt to dim the charge of his fluorescence.\n\nBoth the couch in the main cabin and the conference-room area in the rear had been opened out into their bed configurations, with fleecy comforters and pillowcases monogrammed with the plane\u2019s registration number. The beds and corridor were littered with multicolored balloons and confetti and conical party hats, and above the entrance to the rear of the cabin was affixed a sign that read HAPPY BIRTHDAY. The family had celebrated the birthdays that weekend of both his wife and one of his assistants, Mary, whom he called his \u201cright arm,\u201d though as an adult human of regular size she seemed relatively petite in comparison to his actual right arm. While Robbins had been with his wife\u2019s family, Ariane had found the most well-stocked party store in northern Vancouver and had decorated the plane as a surprise. This effort had not gone unnoticed. \u201cYou went to north Vancouver to find a party store? You\u2019re so incredibly dedicated.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cShe makes it feel like home.\u201d\n\nAriane began to back away. \u201cWell, it is your home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAriane,\u201d Robbins continued, \u201cis like family for us. She treats this place like it\u2019s a home \u2014 and it is a home away from home. You\u2019ve got all your stuff on it, all your family on it.\u201d He\u2019d been chartering planes since he was 31 or 32, and he was now 57. He had been an owner for only three years, but the difference had come to seem like one of the great disjunctures of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a different quality of life, for sure. I can go from the West Coast to China nonstop, East Coast to Australia with one stop. I have a resort in Fiji, and obviously going there before was a difficult situation, but now it\u2019s easy. You can do everything on your own terms, on your own timeline, which is wonderful.\u201d The beds were out and made because the beds were always out and made in case somebody decided to sleep.\n\nAriane came back and offered us a selection of newspapers and some scones. \u201cThe captain says the flight to Spokane will be 37 minutes and should be pretty smooth.\u201d He told me about his admiration of Varsano, then moved on to talk of Crispr, the Human Genome Project and machine learning, and Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 always stopping to make sure that I was there with him, that I was interested, that if I had something to contribute I should feel welcome, that we were \u201ctossing the ball back and forth\u201d \u2014 and how he wanted to make sure that there was enough investment in new biotechnologies that the rejuvenatory stem-cell therapy for which he\u2019d paid a Panamanian clinic many tens of thousands of dollars would soon be cheap enough that everybody could benefit. He pointed at me as an example of someone who could benefit. Then he abruptly stood up and said that he wanted to spend a little time up front with his wife, but that we could resume such an interesting conversation on the leg to Vegas.\n\nAs he moved to the front, he invited me to help myself to the breakfast buffet \u2014 hash browns, scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, a vast array of fruit \u2014 that Ariane had set up on the sideboard. I looked at the panel behind the chair that Robbins vacated and saw that we had only 17 more minutes to arrival. I hadn\u2019t even noticed we\u2019d taken off. We stopped in Spokane, dropped off his wife, went through private Customs and Border Protection and resumed our way to Vegas. Robbins invited me to the front and asked if I\u2019d made sure my family would have a secure financial future.\n\nIt was only the soft bing-bong chime that indicated our initial descent over the rumpled and barren landscape of southern Nevada that even remotely recalled the experience of commercial flight. Otherwise, the experience felt nothing at all like being on an airliner. In fact, it didn\u2019t quite feel like flying at all. It was more like sitting in a comfortable leather armchair in a pleasingly cool and well-appointed room that at some point incidentally rose above the clouds and stayed there for a little while. Many of the people I spoke to in Geneva talked about private aviation as a variety of peak experience \u2014 and such an inarticulable experience was, after all, why Varsano told me that I could never understand private aviation without an experiential component \u2014 but that wasn\u2019t quite right. It was if anything the opposite of a peak experience, distinguished not by anything explicitly euphoric or divine but by its total coruscating absence of everything that makes contemporary commercial air travel a pricking trial of alienation and diminishment.", "title": "Selling Airborne Opulence to the Upper Upper Upper Class", "authors": ["Gideon Lewis-Kraus"]}

Wade, abortions are safer today than getting your tonsils out,\u201d declared Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. \u201cA lot of women are alive today because of Roe.\u201d She called the ban \u201cpart of a broad and sustained assault by Republican politicians on women\u2019s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.\u201d\n\nBut Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said it was time for the Senate to act.\n\n\u201cThe life of the unborn is a precious life, and we as members of the United States Senate and the U.S. Congress are tasked with making sure we protect all lives in America,\u201d Mr. Tillis said, adding, \u201cThis is just a very important, precious, helpless part of the population.\u201d\n\nThe 20-week ban, named the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, is central to the strategy of the anti-abortion movement, which is newly emboldened under Mr. Trump. The president\u2019s election in 2016 ushered in a wave of anti-abortion victories in states like Ohio, where lawmakers adopted a 20-week abortion ban in December of that year.\n\nAbortion foes say that if enough states pass such bans, Congress will be more likely to follow. They note that it took their movement 15 years to persuade Congress to outlaw the procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion. They see the 20-week abortion ban on a similar trajectory.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

She added, \u201cWe want to get vulnerable Democrats who are up for re-election this year on the record once again.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights advocates, meanwhile, say the opponents are badly misreading the political climate. In the era of the #MeToo movement, they say, Republicans will face a backlash for supporting a bill that prevents women from taking control of their own health care decisions.\n\n\u201cI think they fail to recognize the context of the moment and what they\u2019re contending with,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights advocacy group. \u201cWe are seeing a rising up of women, unprecedented in my lifetime, and women who recognize that the role of abortion rights is so crucially important for women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said vulnerable Republicans \u2014 she cited Dean Heller in Nevada \u2014 might have as much to lose in voting for the measure as vulnerable Democrats had in voting against it.\n\n\u201cSince when\u2019s the last time we saw a Democrat pay for what is essentially a pro-choice vote?\u201d Ms. Duffy asked. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\n\nPolling by the Pew Research Center shows that backing for abortion is as high as it has been in two decade. As of 2017, 57 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40 percent said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the issue animates social conservatives; 71 percent of conservative Republicans said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, the Pew poll found.\n\nThe United States is one of just seven countries \u2014 including China and North Korea \u2014 that permit elective abortion after 20 weeks, a fact that backers of the failed measure brought up repeatedly on Monday.\n\n\u201cThe United States keeps the company of countries like China and North Korea. They deny unborn children the most basic of protections,\u2019\u2019 Senator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, said on the Senate floor Monday. \u201cThis, folks, is not who we are as a nation.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the ban cite medical studies suggesting that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks. But the science surrounding fetal pain is complex. In a July 2013 memo, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists wrote that \u201cthe fetus does not even have the physiological capacity to perceive pain until at least 24 weeks of gestation.\u201d", "title": "Senate Rejects Measure to Ban Abortion After 20 Weeks of Pregnancy", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg"]}

Angus King, independent of Maine, also voted to move forward on the bill.\n\nComplicating matters, the bill contains a gesture toward creating a requirement that the authorities get a warrant for such surveillance when F.B.I. agents already have a criminal investigation open into an American with no national-security angle. Mr. Warner, who is the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cited that provision as meaningful reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut critics noted that the provision is so narrowly written that it would not apply most of the time when government officials query Americans\u2019 private information, such as security-related searches by any agency, or F.B.I. searches when agents are pursuing ordinary criminal tips before opening a formal investigation.

The Senate has become mainly an arena for political warfare, allowing the parties to thrive on doing their best to sabotage each other\u2019s priorities. Breaking those entrenched habits will be difficult, if not impossible. Powerful forces will be aligned to prevent any immigration measure from even clearing the Senate so as to avoid putting pressure on the House and the White House to act.\n\nWhile Mr. Jones just arrived from Alabama, most of the others have been venting their frustrations over the polarized nature and inertia of the Senate. They share a desire to show that Congress can work if given the opportunity for free-flowing debate and contend that party divisions can be bridged.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s an alternative to some of the constant tribal warfare that goes on around here,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana, another of the red-state Democrats in the group who will be fighting for re-election this year.\n\nTheir independent push to end the shutdown sprang out of a view that the two respective Senate leaders \u2014 Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat \u2014 were locked in a partisan staredown that was leading nowhere.\n\nLeadership was just \u201c jousting back and forth,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat who, along with Ms. Collins, played a primary role in assembling the group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMembers of the coalition say the present Senate frequently operates too rigidly along party lines.\n\n\u201cMy critique of this place is that everything gets run by the caucuses,\u201d Mr. Kaine said, \u201cAnd of course I want the caucuses to be strong and I strongly support my caucus leader. But there\u2019s got to be some noncaucus space where people can work together, not just with folks in the same party.\u201d\n\nIn recent years under both Democratic and Republican rule, the Senate has been a constrained institution, with highly centralized decision making by leaderships that miserly limits amendments to prevent their members from having to take politically tough votes. With just a few exceptions, the major legislative packages that have reached the floor were the product of the majority and any fights were over Senate process rather than substantive policy.\n\nIt is a far cry from the Senate\u2019s storied image as the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body with full-throated give-and-take and rousing speeches that win over opponents.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since 2009 and I have never seen the kind of the glory days description,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, one of many former governors who over the decades has found the chamber a stultifying place to serve.\n\nIn tackling immigration, the group is taking on an issue that for years has defied congressional solutions. Now the group is racing against two deadlines \u2014 Feb. 8, when the current stopgap spending bill expires, and March 5, the deadline set by President Trump to find a way to protect undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.\n\nBut members of the group, energized and empowered by their success in shutting down the shutdown, remain positive. They hope the process ends with legislation that could attract as many as 70 senators \u2014 the kind of bipartisan majority that would be difficult for either the president or the House to ignore.\n\nMr. McConnell reiterated again on Tuesday that as long as Democrats agreed to keep the government funded, he would allow a \u201cfair and open process\u201d meant to end with a new immigration measure.\n\n\u201cWhoever gets 60 votes wins,\u201d he said.\n\nThose engaged in the bipartisan effort say they realize the difficulties ahead but are eager to get started.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad to have the prospect of legislating again,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a functioning body right now.\u201d\n\nWhile the possibility of a wide-open floor fight on immigration has no doubt made some senators nervous as they weighed the prospect of tricky votes, others have found it invigorating.\n\n\u201cNow comes the test \u2014 the real test \u2014 as to whether we can get this done \u2014 whether we can be the Senate again,\u201d said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, who will be working with the group, addressing his colleagues on the floor. \u201cFor some of you, it will be the first time you have ever seen it, but believe me, it is worth the price of admission, all it took for you to come to the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nIf successful, the bipartisan push could become a model for taking on stubborn issues in the future, one that engages a broader range of voices and ideas from both parties in the outcome.

But Mr. Wray responded that he needed to move at his own pace to make changes, and that if Mr. Sessions and the president wanted replacements made more quickly, someone else would have to do it, a person familiar with the exchange said, adding that Mr. Wray stopped short of threatening to quit.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wray\u2019s tenure has been tense as the president has repeatedly fanned suspicion about whether the F.B.I.\u2019s work is politically motivated, including the Russia investigation.\n\nMr. Trump and his allies have focused their ire on Andrew G. McCabe, the bureau\u2019s deputy director. Mr. McCabe\u2019s wife was a Virginia State Senate candidate in 2015, and she received donations from the \u201csuper PAC\u201d supporting the state\u2019s governor at the time, Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of Hillary Clinton\u2019s.\n\nOne person familiar with Mr. McCabe\u2019s meetings with the president said there had been a small handful of encounters between the two the week Mr. Comey was fired, as Mr. Trump was deciding whether to name Mr. McCabe the acting director.\n\nAt one of the meetings, another person said that Mr. Trump asked Mr. McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. McCabe said he had not voted. The meeting was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt their final meeting, Mr. Trump offered him the job and told him he planned to give him the role of acting director, and that the president planned to make a rally-the-troops appearance at the F.B.I. Headquarters that week. Mr. McCabe responded that it would be a risky move for the president to show up at the building after firing a well-respected director, so Mr. Trump scuttled the trip, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nThough Mr. Wray has resisted the pressure to change Mr. McCabe\u2019s role, he has begun to alter the F.B.I.\u2019s leadership. He removed James Baker, the general counsel for the bureau under Mr. Comey, and replaced him with Dana Boente, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s national security division, according to a person familiar with the move.\n\nMr. Wray also said in a statement on Tuesday that he has replaced his departing chief of staff, James Rybicki, who served under Mr. Comey, with Zachary Harmon, whom Mr. Wray worked with in private practice and who previously served at the Justice Department.\n\nDuring the daily White House news briefing, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that the president has \u201c100 percent\u201d confidence in Mr. Wray and that it was up to Mr. Wray to decide how to handle the bureau\u2019s leadership.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, confirmed that the interview with Mr. Sessions occurred. He was accompanied to the interview by the longtime Washington lawyer Chuck Cooper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Breaking News Emails Get the latest on the special counsel investigation \u2014 and other major news \u2014 delivered to your email inbox.

Mr. Sessions was involved in developing Mr. Trump\u2019s position toward Russia and he met with Russian officials, including the ambassador.\n\nAlong with Mr. Trump, Mr. Sessions led a March 2016 meeting where one of the campaign\u2019s foreign policy advisers, George Papadopoulos, pitched the idea of a personal meeting between Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October to lying to federal authorities about the nature of his contacts with Russians and agreed to cooperate with the special counsel\u2019s inquiry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Trump learned in March that Mr. Sessions, by then the attorney general, was considering whether to recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, the president had the White House\u2019s top lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, lobby Mr. Sessions to remain in charge of the inquiry.\n\nMr. Sessions instead followed the guidance of career prosecutors at the Justice Department, who advised him that he should stay out of the investigation. When Mr. Trump was informed, the president erupted in anger, saying he needed an attorney general to protect him.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s investigators have also asked witnesses about the president\u2019s desires to fire Mr. Sessions, whom Mr. Trump has criticized publicly and privately for recusing himself from the inquiry, though he has left Mr. Sessions in charge of the Justice Department.\n\nMr. Trump believes Mr. Mueller would never have been appointed if Mr. Sessions had not stepped aside. After Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, Mr. Trump again grew angry at Mr. Sessions, who offered to resign. Days later, Mr. Trump rejected that offer.\n\nThe questions that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators have asked in relation to Mr. Comey were based in part on information he provided during his own interviews with the special counsel\u2019s office last year, according to people familiar with the matter. In one of his memos, Mr. Comey wrote that Mr. Trump had asked him to end the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Mr. Flynn.\n\nAfter the president\u2019s request was revealed publicly, the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, appointed Mr. Mueller as the special counsel to lead the Russia investigation and examine whether the president obstructed justice.", "title": "Sessions Is Questioned as Russia Inquiry Focuses on Obstruction", "authors": ["Michael S.

But if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m a man with absolutely no power in Hollywood. I\u2019m not even the most powerful Seth in the room tonight.

This was a celebratory meal for two of them, who had spent the semester at a nearby art school, a rare splurge to commemorate their studies and a chance to show family and friends what it is the old man does for a living, snooping around restaurants, considering the delicious.\n\nA server glided past Minnillo to place some glistening wafer sandwiches on the white-clothed table. \u201cThese are Ritz crackers, essentially,\u201d he said as Minnillo poured Champagne for the adults. \u201cWith caramelized shallots.\u201d They shatter-melted into our mouths, salty against the intense allium sweetness of shallots enhanced by Cheddar and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Eyes went wider. No one in our party of five had been expecting what were essentially grandma canap\u00e9s here at one of the most formal and inventive restaurants in the United States, and no one, least of all the teenagers, had been prepared for the experience of eating one. There was silence at the table as we ate, followed by laughter. My eldest looked at me and said, \u201cI think this meal is going to be fun.\u201d\n\nAnd it was. We had little cups of cr\u00e8me de champignons that bolstered feelings of home \u2014 \u201cOur version of Campbell\u2019s cream-of-mushroom soup,\u201d the server said \u2014 and tiny ice cream cones of fluke tartare and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche that did not. There was the restaurant\u2019s famous dish of oysters and caviar in a tapioca sabayon, as well as nuggets of king-crab tempura; delicate roulades of Dover sole; poached eggs with celery-root pur\u00e9e and soubise served below shaved white truffles. We ate Parker House rolls with sweet butter and a choice of salts, and duck with collard greens and beautiful sweet carrots. There was charcoal-grilled Wagyu beef and bordelaise sauce; then goug\u00e8res with more truffles and on to dessert: 18 courses of food in all, not counting those delicate little crackers that started the meal.\n\nBut it was the crackers that stuck with us longest, that we talked about, again and again, in the days following the meal. It is a condition of my employment that when a dish does that, I try to make it at home. And so on a recent evening, I caramelized shallots and mixed them with the cheese and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, a splash of sherry vinegar, a dash of hot sauce, then spread them onto actual Ritz crackers and heated the resulting sandwiches in the oven before painting them with melted butter and preparing for transportation back to Napa County in our minds.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd they were pretty good! But making home-cooked food into restaurant food and then returning it to the home turns out to be more of an equation than a conjuring spell. After all, magic in the world of food is often situational. So while we\u2019ll always remember those crackers at the French Laundry, what we\u2019ll remember about making them at home is the dinner that followed: a simple sausage risotto that, in its way, offered the same transporting delight of our meal at the restaurant. It is a dish that you really ought to try yourself, on one of these dark winter nights when all anyone wants to do is stand around the stove, stirring and talking, waiting to eat.\n\nThe recipe was, after a fashion, my youngest daughter\u2019s. A friend from school made her the dish a few weeks earlier, and she wanted me to make it for her myself, off her memory of the meal. And so I stood at her side, asking questions, taking direction, stirring onions and Arborio rice together with butter until they were translucent, then adding strong chicken stock to the mixture slowly, serially, with endless stirs of a wooden spoon, until the risotto achieved that melting tender consistency the Italians call all\u2019onda, or wavy. We folded grated Parmesan into the pot and topped the whole thing with crisp, crumbled sweet sausage, a drift of parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice against the heft. The result was as incredible as anything a restaurant can provide. There was that silence again while we ate, before the old familiar laughter pealed.\n\nRecipe: Risotto With Sausage and Parsley", "title": "Settle In for Winter With This Sausage Risotto", "authors": ["Sam Sifton"]}

The Vatican will in no way oppose Peruvian efforts to detain Figari.\u201d\n\nThe scandal has nonetheless cast a pall over Pope Francis\u2019 arrival in Peru on Thursday. Francis offered an apology to sexual abuse victims this week in Chile, but many Peruvians are asking: If the pope wants to be tough on such crimes, how could the Vatican protect one of its alleged perpetrators?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how the church operates, they bring their own \u2018home\u2019 as it were, and then there are no consequences,\u201d said Peter Saunders, an abuse survivor who was suspended in 2016 from a commission that Francis announced in 2013, to much fanfare, to establish guidelines for sex-abuse cases. Mr. Saunders resigned from the commission last month.\n\nMr. Figari, a layman, stepped down as the leader of Sodalitium in 2010, but he remains a member of the group.\n\nIt was one of several communities in Latin America \u2014 like the Rev. Fernando Karadima\u2019s El Bosque in Chile \u2014 allegedly headed by abusive leaders who experts say operated with impunity because the Vatican, under Pope John Paul II, ignored reports of problems. His successors have been accused of moving too slowly to address the issue.\n\nLast week, before his trip to Latin America, Francis ordered a Vatican takeover of Sodalitium, saying he had concerns about its management and finances. But his announcement did not explicitly address victims or abuses.\n\n\u201cThis announced intervention does not take care of us, the victims,\u201d said a former member, who said that when he was 15, Mr. Figari had anal sex with him several times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Vatican did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Sodalitium, which commissioned its own investigation in 2016, has laid out chilling details of abuse in a report that it released. The report says that Mr. Figari and other members sexually abused at least 19 minors and 17 adults starting in 1975.\n\nThe report said Mr. Figari had engaged in \u201cmultiple acts of sodomy of a minor male,\u201d instructed a man to kiss his penis and touched and hugged members while naked. Mr. Figari also knew of three adult members who sexually abused minors, the report said.\n\n\u201cFigari told some of his victims the indecent acts were part of his mystical powers, yoga exercises, or an energy generating technique,\u201d Sodalitium investigators found.\n\nPeruvian prosecutors say too much time has elapsed to bring sex-crime charges. Instead, they say Mr. Figari ran a \u201ccriminal organization\u201d that preyed on young men, and have asked a judge to approve his arrest. That would allow them to seek his extradition.\n\nIn October 2016, Mr. Figari, who is now 70, said he was \u201cnot aware that there are any victims.\u201d The Vatican later barred him from speaking to the press, the Vatican documents show.\n\nArmando Lengua Balbi, a lawyer for Mr. Figari, said his client denied the allegations. He said that Mr. Figari was undergoing cancer treatment and that he was \u201cexercising his right to resist\u201d the Peruvian authorities.\n\n\u201cIf he comes back, people will lynch him,\u201d Mr. Lengua Balbi said.\n\nHe said the encounter with Mr. Osterling might not even be considered abuse at all.\n\n\u201cThis could lead you to think, \u2018Well, this man is weird, this is wrong, I shouldn\u2019t have acquiesced, I should have pushed back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lengua Balbi said. \u201cBut to accuse someone under the label of a sexual crime or sexual abuse? Asking someone to drop their pants is not a crime. That\u2019s not a crime anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe also said the accusations involving the 15-year-old would be impossible to prove in court. \u201cHe should have gotten medically examined,\u201d Mr. Lengua Balbi said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Figari was known to his followers as a foul-mouthed, larger-than-life figure.\n\nHe founded Sodalitium in the early 1970s on deeply conservative values and the promise of a life of obedience.

The group gained a foothold among well-heeled Peruvian families, spreading through Latin America and even to an outpost in Denver. When Francis was still a cardinal, he invited Sodalitium to set up a community in Argentina.\n\nMembers recall that during Mr. Figari\u2019s heyday, Sodalitium focused on discipline and obedience. Recruits were young, usually 14 to 16.\n\n\u201cWhen you lived in community, you couldn\u2019t go out on the streets if you didn\u2019t have permission from a superior,\u201d said Martin Scheuch, who was a member for 15 years.\n\nMr. Osterling, who left Sodalitium in 2011, recalls being asked to send Mr. Figari photos and videos of young men who were potential recruits saluting him. \u201cFigari supposedly would review the film, look into the kids\u2019 eyes and was able to see their souls,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Figari would then choose which boys to invite to Sodalitium retreats, where he would send them cryptic messages. \u201cI\u2019ve heard much about you,\u201d he might say, according to a legal complaint filed with prosecutors by former members of the group.\n\nObedience and abuse were often intertwined.

So I did it, and he called another Sodalite to start whipping my bare back. The Sodalite doubted, so Mr. Figari repeated his order and he whipped me with his belt.\u201d\n\nMr. Salinas recalled Mr. Figari once came in with a prospective applicant and made a strange request. He asked for a candle and matches, then asked Mr. Salinas to pull up his sleeve and extend his arm.\n\nMr. Figari proceeded to burn him, he said.\n\n\u201cI had my poker face on because I understood implicitly that the point was to impress the prospective applicant,\u201d Mr. Salinas said. \u201cI ended up with a big red blister and a bandaged arm for a few days.\u201d\n\nAt least 18 people were victims of physical abuse, according to the group\u2019s report.\n\nMr. Figari served as Sodalitium\u2019s superior general until his resignation in 2010. Sodalitium\u2019s internal investigation found that he had left over the abuse revelations.\n\nVictims say it took far too long for the allegations to come to light, and say that in many cases their accounts were not believed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve given my testimony to countless people in search of justice since 1978,\u201d said the man who accused Mr. Figari of sexually abusing him as a teenager. He asked not to be named.\n\nIn May 2011, the man filed a complaint with Peru\u2019s ecclesiastical court that was forwarded to the Vatican. More complaints were filed in 2013 and 2014, according to Sodalitium\u2019s internal investigation.\n\nThe Vatican finally acted in April 2015, sending a Peruvian bishop to investigate. But it was not until six months later that Sodalitium publicly confronted Mr. Figari, when Mr. Salinas and Ms. Ugaz published their book. By then, Mr. Figari had left the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn January 2017, the Vatican investigators concluded that Mr. Figari had engaged in sexual activity \u201cwith some young men,\u201d at least one of whom was under 16, who were being trained by the group.\n\nStill, the documents say, the allegations contained \u201cinconsistent timelines, contradictions and some aspects were not very clear.\u201d And it said that investigators were \u201cperplexed by the notable, anomalous and not entirely comprehensive echo\u201d the abuse allegations had generated in Peru.\n\nMr. Lengua Balbi said Mr. Figari was appealing the ruling, and had hired two canon lawyers.\n\nThe man who says Mr. Figari abused him when he was 15 said the Vatican\u2019s investigation was a whitewash.\n\n\u201cThe church has never contacted me,\u201d he said. \u201cNever.\u201d", "title": "Sex Abuse Case Shadows Pope Francis\u2019 Visit to Peru", "authors": ["Marcelo Rochabr\u00fan", "Andrea Zarate"]}

Surgical scars, lost body parts and hair, chemically induced fatigue, radiological burns, nausea, hormone-blocking medications, numbness from neuropathies, weight gain or loss, and anxiety hardly function as aphrodisiacs.

Sometimes the pain can be worse after sex.\n\nThis woman I met briefly is no different than the patients I have been seeing for 25 years.

For many, the pain comes and goes and reasons for this transient pain include inadequate foreplay, breast-feeding (which lowers estrogen), infection and other causes.\n\nPain that is more persistent affects 7 to 22 percent of women, and up to 45 percent of menopausal women and 60 percent of cancer survivors report pain with sex. Pain with sex is up there in prevalence with migraine and low back pain, and yet it is woefully understudied and rarely discussed. The number of articles indexed in PubMed, a search engine for scientific literature, for dyspareunia is 3,694, and the number for erectile dysfunction, one type of sexual problem for men, is 19,796.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMuscle spasm (my dinner diagnosis) is one of the most common diagnoses, but other common causes include nerve pain, skin conditions, low estrogen and endometriosis. There are psychological factors, but that does not mean that it is in your head. Ever.\n\nIf sex hurts, many women begin to anticipate the pain, which increases the pain response and diminishes lubrication and libido. If every time I offered you the finest chocolate in the world I hit you with a hammer at your first bite, you would soon learn to dread and fear chocolate. You may also reflexively flinch at the smell of chocolate, or even when I walked into the room, and lose your taste for chocolate altogether. For some women sexual trauma can also be a factor and start a cycle of pain.\n\nGetting facts ahead of fallacies in medicine is hard enough, but with sex there are many more layers. Most people receive a less than adequate sex education, and many do not learn how to talk about sex. When I ask a woman if she has discussed her pain or her sexual needs with her partner, it is not uncommon for me to hear, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d That many doctors do not feel comfortable discussing sex only compounds the issues.\n\nThere are also some other solutions:\n\nAddressing the sex itself. Treating pain with sex involves addressing the physical aspects, making sure technique is appropriate, discussing emotional consequences, and, of course, looking at the relationship. If you are deeply unhappy, you may not get the kind of sexual stimulation you need or be able to mount an adequate sexual response. No medical therapy can compensate for not liking your sexual partner.\n\nLubricant can help many women who have pain with sex, and no, it does not mean there is something wrong. The other myth that I frequently dismantle is this idea that women should achieve some kind of fantasy wetness. I have heard many women tell me that lubricant helps their pain, but their male partner does not like it or judges them for it. That, my friends, is messed up. No one thinks you are less if you need glasses. Some people have always needed glasses, and some of us, ahem, need glasses as we age. Who cares as long as you can see?\n\nForeplay is part of the sexual response cycle, but what is needed or desired varies greatly from person to person. At the dinner table the gentleman was quick to note that there was \u201cenough\u201d foreplay. I looked at my plate to keep my professional side-eye in check. This is why I always initially see women for consultation without their sexual partners. While foreplay alone rarely cures painful sex, most people actually want more than they are getting, so doubling up on foreplay is good sex hygiene, and, most important, it is fun.\n\nFinding a good doctor. Many women who find the right practitioners will have their pain with sex treated. In addition to a doctor and physical therapist, a sex therapist and psychologist may be helpful. For some women, treatment can be challenging because they may not find the right providers and a few have conditions that are difficult to treat. Some therapies are costly, and others do not fit with the person\u2019s sense of self. Some women have past sexual traumas that have never been discussed or are simply too painful to address, but doing so can go a long way.\n\nTreating pain with sex is incredibly rewarding; it is the only medical condition I treat in which my patient shows up giggling at her follow-up visit. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it could feel so good!\u201d is a common response. Even when we don\u2019t resolve the pain completely, getting a diagnosis can be incredibly validating and many women tell me just being taken seriously is very helpful.\n\nA woman who experiences painful sex is not broken.

For those forced to retire, however, particularly those chiefs who \u201chave had highly successful careers and were key players in the resurgence of the city,\u201d it is a disappointing end that is not of their own design, Mr. Richter said.\n\nWith the changes, Mr. O\u2019Neill is promoting a new cadre of commanders to carry on with his overarching goal: to continue to construct the department\u2019s new neighborhood policing by encouraging officers to engage in deeper outreach with city residents.\n\nSo far, the program has been rolled out in 56 of the city\u2019s 77 police precincts and all nine of its housing bureaus.\n\n\u201cWe have to complete the transformation of the N.Y.P.D.,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said in his statement on Monday, \u201cwhich we can only do in partnership with all the people of New York.\u201d\n\nAt the top of his change, Mr. O\u2019Neill said he would name Chief Terence A. Monahan as the department\u2019s highest-ranking uniformed officer, the chief of department, and would promote Assistant Chief Rodney Harrison to fill Chief Monahan\u2019s spot as chief of patrol. Both men have been overseeing the neighborhood policing efforts and consider it a philosophy for policing, more than simply an experiment.\n\nChief Monahan has been a senior commander for more than a decade, and his performance during the police response to protests at the 2004 Republican National Convention prompted a lawsuit by the New York Civil Liberties Union and was later sharply criticized by the city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board.\n\nAndrew Case, a lawyer who was a spokesman for the review board at the time, recalled on Monday that then-Assistant Chief Monahan ordered 227 arrests of people on Aug. 31, 2004, but that all of the cases were later \u201cdismissed\u201d by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When Mr. Bratton became commissioner the first time, in 1994, he ushered in a phalanx of young \u201csuper chiefs\u201d and carried out a smaller shake-up when he took over a second time in 2014. Patrick V. Murphy, who became police commissioner in 1970, began his tenure by asking top commanders, \u201cWhat is your intention?\u201d recalled Robert J. Louden, a New York police officer from 1966 to 1987 who is professor emeritus of criminal justice at Georgian Court University, in New Jersey.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. O\u2019Neill moved slowly in moving those in ranks below him. He could have acted in September 2016, when he succeeded Mr. Bratton, rather than awaiting the election\u2019s outcome. \u201cBut he took his time, and watched as neighborhood policing evolved, and the result is the lowest homicide rate, lowest shooting rate and pushing toward community confidence,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, the head of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington think tank.\n\nStill, whether such moves resonate with the public, particularly within an agency that \u201cplods along, irrespective of who is wearing the stars,\u201d is an open question, said Eugene J. O\u2019Donnell, a former officer who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\n\n\u201cAll in all, this jockeying and churning consumes an inordinate amount of precious time and energy and creates a roiled environment that drives the agency far away from citizen centeredness and being mission oriented,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Donnell.\n\nThose being forced out include Joseph Fox, the department\u2019s transit chief; Joanne Jaffe, its chief of community affairs; Diane Pizzuti, its chief of personnel; and Thomas Purtell, its chief of citywide operations, a position created for him but now being discontinued.\n\nAs part of his reorganization, Mr. O\u2019Neill is making departmental history: By selecting Nilda Irizarry Hoffman as chief of community affairs, he is elevating the first Hispanic woman to a three-star chief position. He is also creating an Office of Equity and Inclusion to develop more women and minority policing leaders who better reflect the communities they serve.\n\nTo Edward Mamet, a retired captain, Mr. O\u2019Neill may be the first leader to successfully carry out a form of community policing, which \u201chas been tried several times and failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has the next four years to do so,\u201d said Mr. Mamet. \u201cUnless, of course, he leaves office before that.\u201d", "title": "Shake-Up in Hierarchy of the New York Police Department", "authors": ["Al Baker"]}

The political news site Smart Politics found that after the 2016 elections, 15 states sent delegations to Washington with members all from one party \u2014 double the number from eight years prior. Nine are Republican, six are Democratic.\n\nIn the others, one party typically dominates a state\u2019s delegation. But even in the most lopsided groups, there are members from the other side scattered through the membership \u2014 Republicans outside the urban centers of Democratic states and Democrats representing cities and liberal enclaves of Republican states.\n\nThe diversity can provide benefits to both lawmakers and their constituents. Majority parties have traditionally been reluctant to take too direct an aim at states where their numbers are lower since any repercussions could still hit their own members, often the most vulnerable to challenge.\n\nOn issues such as energy and transportation, geography and parochialism can trump party allegiance. Having members of both parties from a state rally behind a project can help build a bipartisan critical mass of support.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn a personal level, lawmakers of opposing parties from the same state can develop working relationships and friendships while partnering on state issues, forging ties that can pay off in other ways. Given the current level of partisanship of Congress, lawmakers don\u2019t have many other chances to build strong personal bonds.\n\nBut the 2018 outlook poses problems for Republicans, who, like Democrats in the South in recent decades, could find themselves with reduced numbers and influence in some regions of the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTake three states in particular. New York currently has 18 Democrats and nine Republicans, California has 39 Democrats and 14 Republicans, and New Jersey has seven Democrats and five Republicans.\n\nThose Republican numbers are expected to shrink \u2014 perhaps significantly \u2014 in the November elections because of a number of factors, including the new tax law. The law made a number of changes that will fall harder on these higher-tax states, particularly the new prohibition on the ability to deduct state and local taxes above $10,000.\n\nThat could result in a tax increase for homeowners in the Northeast and California who might want to take out their unhappiness on Republicans \u2014 whether they voted for the new law or not. Elections held in 2017 have shown that Mr. Trump\u2019s low standing has already cost Republicans support from suburban voters critical to the Republican coalition.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

King, a New York Republican who warned his party\u2019s leadership about the potential tax law ramifications, said there would be negative consequences as voters grappled with their tax situation.\n\n\u201cThe tax bill is going to hurt Republicans in New York and New Jersey and California,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is definitely going to have an impact. We are going to spend the entire campaign defending ourselves against what our own party did. It is entirely self-inflicted.\u201d\n\nIn the past, the party might have been inclined to take steps to protect incumbent lawmakers from areas where legislation would have a negative impact on their voters. But Republican leaders eager for a long-sought tax cut seemed to consider the tax overhaul a higher priority than the political outlook for Republican members in higher-tax states, though they did adjust the state and local tax proposal to try to limit the damage as well as find votes for approval of the legislation.\n\nAfter the tax vote, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan canceled plans to raise money for a centrist New York Republican as punishment for opposition to the tax bill, a response that penalizes a member of the speaker\u2019s party just when help is most needed to win re-election.\n\nMr. King said he was concerned that states like his own could become represented by a single voice. He said he would like to think he would feel the same apprehension if the roles were reversed and it was Democrats who were in danger of being pushed out.\n\n\u201cWe need the clash of ideas,\u201d said Mr. King.\n\nBut given the election outlook and current trends, the biggest clashes to come in Congress could be between state delegations and members who find they have even less to connect them than they do now.", "title": "Sharper State Divide in Congress Seen as \u2018New Civil War\u2019", "authors": ["Carl Hulse", "On Washington"]}

When Ms. Yuan was growing up there with a nuclear-physicist father and a glass-artist mother, international travel wasn\u2019t in the scope of her experience: \u201cIt took me half an hour biking on a dirt road to get to my best friend\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nSeveral decades later \u2014 she\u2019ll turn 40 this year \u2014 Ms. Yuan has just been named The Times\u2019s inaugural 52 Places correspondent, which will take her to each of the destinations our Travel desk has deemed unmissable in 2018. Her application was chosen from among more than 13,000, a pool representing plumbers, project managers, teachers, basketball players and even State Department officials. The selection committee remained open until the very end to handing the commission to someone other than a journalist, explained Dan Saltzstein, the 52 Places coordinating editor, but in the end, he said, \u201chaving somebody with a robust reporting background is going to be a really important tool.\u201d\n\nThe gig was the first to which Ms. Yuan had applied in 17 years; she started at New York magazine as an editorial assistant in 2000 and has been on staff ever since. Though she\u2019s best known for entertainment writing, her work extends beyond the glamorous demimonde of celebrity profiles and movie premieres: She also covered the 2008 presidential conventions and the Ferguson, Mo., protests for the magazine.\n\nUltimately it was Ms. Yuan\u2019s writerly voice and her keen sense for personal narrative that pushed her to the top. \u201cThe way I thought of it was, whose version of this trip do I want to hear?\u201d Mr. Saltzstein said. \u201cSo much of this was going to be about the journey,\u201d he said, as when something \u2014 a missed flight or a canceled reservation, for instance \u2014 inevitably goes wrong. \u201cReaders will be following along for both the highs and the lows.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom Ms. Yuan\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s covering film festivals that has provided the most directly relevant experience for this job. \u201cThat is really exactly what the job description was: parachuting down and being able to churn out a ton of material, not really knowing what the lay of the land was,\u201d she said. Festivals taught her the art, she said, of \u201cknowing how to walk into a room like you\u2019re supposed to be there,\u201d an ask-forgiveness-not-permission approach that has served her particularly well in seemingly impossible reporting conditions. She cites, for example, the French security guard presiding over the entrance to a sold-out screening of Terrence Malick\u2019s \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d at Cannes in 2011. \u201cThe line was crazy, it was total chaos,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just gave me this look that made me think that he would not stop me if I jumped over several barricades.\u201d So that\u2019s what she did.", "title": "She Has 52 Places to See and One Year to Do It", "authors": ["Raillan Brooks", "Alexandria Symonds"]}

Versions of this sanctions regime have been adopted by Canada, Mexico and the European Union. The increasingly multilateral character of sanctions makes them more effective.\n\nThe United States and its partners need to avoid the temptation to broaden the scope of the sanctions. Widening economic sanctions to an oil embargo, for example, would further harm a population that is barely hanging on. And such a broadening of targeted sanctions, which are supposed to drive a wedge between those who are sanctioned and those who are not, would dull their effect: If almost everyone is sanctioned, the unity of the Maduro government would be reinforced.\n\nInstead, the American government and its allies should deepen the current sanctions.

The company accounts for about 20 percent of the organization\u2019s $1.2 million in sponsorship revenue \u2014 roughly on par with the federation\u2019s other top sponsor, Toyota \u2014 but in this cycle Under Armour is providing resources and expertise in addition to money.\n\n\u201cAdversity is the best teacher,\u201d Kevin Haley, Under Armour\u2019s executive vice president for strategy, said about the company\u2019s experience in 2014. \u201cIt forced all of us to realize that we actually needed to do more. We needed to expand our relationship.\u201d\n\nThe hubbub over the suits began midway through the 2014 Games. The American speedskaters were scuffling and would ultimately fail to win a single medal. Soon questions arose about, and fingers were pointed at, Under Armour\u2019s so-called Mach 39 suit, which had been developed with the help of Lockheed Martin and released with much fanfare. Some members of the American team came to believe that a set of vents on the back of the suit was letting in air \u2014 creating drag that was slowing them down.\n\nTed Morris, the executive director of U.S. Speedskating, said that a coach from another country planted the idea in one of the American skaters\u2019 heads, and from there it infected the team like a virus. The issue exploded publicly when The Wall Street Journal published an article in which members of the team anonymously cast doubt on the suit\u2019s technology.\n\nUnder Armour to this day has stood by the science of the suit, and U.S. Speedskating, in a post-Olympics review, determined that the suits were not the problem. Kevin Plank, Under Armour\u2019s chief executive, at the time called the controversy \u201ca witch hunt,\u201d though he stopped short of ever criticizing the athletes.\n\nBefore the Sochi Games ended, though, Under Armour and U.S. Speedskating renewed their contract through the 2022 Olympics. Then they sat down to reimagine their working relationship. The stakes are high for Under Armour, which stumbled through a dismal 2017, reporting losses for two straight quarters and seeing its share price fall 45 percent.\n\n\u201cWe basically did what I would call a performance audit,\u201d said Paul Winsper, the vice president for athlete performance, who previously worked for Nike and multiple professional soccer teams. \u201cWe looked at their staffing. We looked at their technology. We looked at how we can help with training support, how we can help educate the athletes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTai chi was just one part of the equation. Under Armour hired Jens Voigt, a German cyclist who competed in the Tour de France 17 times, to lead brutal bicycle workouts at the speedskaters\u2019 conditioning camps in 2016 and 2017. It brought in Pete Naschak, a former Navy Seal, to lead team-building activities.

Clay Dean, Under Armour\u2019s chief innovation officer, said the design team tested 100 different fabrics in more than 250 blends, spending at least 100 hours in wind tunnel tests with the help of the bicycle manufacturer Specialized.\n\nThe boldest feature of the suit, Dean said, was the use of an asymmetrical design, with seaming that runs diagonally along the body instead of evenly across, meant to minimize tension in the suit when the skaters are navigating turns in crouched positions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

American speedskaters won 31 medals combined at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 Games before being shut out in Sochi.\n\nTo start, the review determined that the degree of disappointment experienced in Sochi was a matter of perspective. The racers were simply not as good as they thought and said they were.\n\nMorris said that going into 2014, it had become the expectation that the team was good for another 10 medals.\n\n\u201cWhen we finished this review, one of our main conclusions was that our expectations were unrealistic,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you really look at the data and the results and where we were, we bought into our own hype.\u201d\n\nMorris said the report also faulted the team\u2019s strategy of using last-minute \u201cgame-changers,\u201d an idea favored by Finn Halvorsen, the former high-performance director, who was let go shortly after the 2014 Games. The Mach 39 suits were given to the skaters one month before Sochi, as was a new skate polish.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHis philosophy was to introduce these as late as possible in the process because then they\u2019d go to the line feeling like they had a jetpack on their back,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIn hindsight, that was the wrong decision.\u201d\n\nThis Olympic cycle, the team is striving for comfort and continuity. The current suits were introduced to the skaters last February, specifically tailored to each athlete with the help of body-scanning technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had ups and downs with the suits since Sochi, and I think Under Armour has done a pretty good job going all in,\u201d said Mitch Whitmore, who specializes in the 500 meters. \u201cWe\u2019ve tested these personally instead of just them testing them.\u201d\n\nBefore the Sochi Games, the team went through a punishing travel schedule that culminated with an outdoor training camp in Collalbo, Italy. It was an odd choice \u2014 many of skaters had never trained outdoors before, and the Sochi races were indoors \u2014 and it looked even worse after the camp was marred by inclement weather.\n\nThis year, the skaters will gather in Milwaukee until departing for South Korea, recreating the ice conditions they expect to find at the Games. They also are sleeping in and training in the evenings, to align themselves with the unusual nighttime competition schedule.\n\nThese were significant, positive changes, Morris said. But he thought better of making any bold predictions.\n\n\u201cI think it got us in trouble in \u201914,\u201d Morris said, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to go down that road again.\u201d", "title": "Shut Out in 2014, U.S. Speedskaters Modify Their Suits, Their Training and Their Expectations", "authors": ["Andrew Keh"]}

And even if he does endorse a plan, Republicans worry that he could change his mind at any time.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who has been a major impediment to an immigration compromise with Democrats, said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he could not commit to back a proposal simply because the president endorsed it. And some on Capitol Hill believe that Speaker Paul D. Ryan\u2019s leadership post would be in jeopardy if he pushed through an immigration bill that most House Republicans opposed.\n\nIn recent months, Republicans suggested that they would hold a strong hand in any funding showdown because Democrats would be reluctant to force a government shutdown over undocumented immigrants. If Democrats did, Republicans figured they would have a strong message to counter with by attacking Democrats as willing to shortchange Americans to help those who entered the country illegally.\n\nThey are now aggressively pressing that line of assault.

The Serena Hotel, a luxury establishment in Kabul, has been struck three times, including an attack in 2014 that killed nine. In that assault, Taliban gunmen hid small pistols in the soles of their shoes to evade heavy security, then entered the restaurant and killed guests at close range, including a well-known Afghan journalist, his wife and all but one of his children. The events led to an unusual apology for what the Taliban called a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the Park Palace hotel in downtown Kabul was the site of an attack that killed at least 15 people, including one American.\n\nIncreasing Violence\n\nThe latest Kabul attack comes amid intensifying violence around the country. In the northern province of Balkh, which has been at the center of a recent political showdown with the central government, at least 18 people were killed in an attack by the Taliban late Saturday, most of them members of a local police militia, officials there said.\n\nNazar Gul Sholgarai, a commander of the local militia, said the men had been lured to a dinner reception where a Taliban infiltrator had paved the way for the attack. He said a delegation had returned with samples of the meat served at the dinner to see if the men had been poisoned before they were shot.\n\n\u201cThe bodies are still lying there, we haven\u2019t buried them \u2014 we are chasing after the Taliban footsteps,\u201d Mr. Sholgarai said. \u201cThe Taliban had come on six horses and four donkeys.\u201d\n\nSeparately, in the western province of Herat, a Toyota Corolla carrying laborers struck a roadside bomb, leaving at least eight dead, said Abdul Ahad Walizada, a spokesman for the province\u2019s police.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the neighboring province of Farah, the Taliban have been tightening their presence around the provincial capital, Farah City, for weeks.

Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, the Mexican economic secretary, said that the three countries were at \u201ca better moment in this negotiation process,\u201d and that progress made so far had put the countries \u201con the right track to create landing zones to conclude the negotiation soon.\u201d\n\nChrystia Freeland, the Canadian foreign minister, said that Canada had come to the table \u201cwith creative ideas we believed could move us forward.\u201d She also emphasized the benefits of trade with Canada for the United States.\n\nThe Nafta pact, negotiated by President George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, spurred trade between the three countries by reducing Mexico\u2019s high tariffs on goods from Canada and the United States. But, as President Trump has often highlighted, it also incentivized companies to shift labor-intensive manufacturing to Mexico.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the trade pact if it cannot be renegotiated in the United States\u2019 favor, a position that has put him at odds with many in the business community and Congress, who see trade with Mexico and Canada as integral to industries as varied as manufacturing, agriculture and energy. The auto industry, in particular, has arranged its North American supply chains around the deal\u2019s terms.\n\nWith talks now reaching into their seventh month, negotiators are about to butt up against several political events that could make an agreement even more difficult, including the Mexican general election on July 1.\n\nThe election could usher in a leftist political party that may be less willing to make concessions.

Last year, officials insisted that the deal must be largely concluded by the end of 2017. Then in October, they decided to extend the talks into the first quarter of 2018, with March widely cited as a deadline.\n\nNegotiators did not specify a new target for concluding the talks. In remarks on Monday, Ms. Freeland said that Canada looked forward to continuing its work at the next round in Mexico City in late February, and in Washington in April.\n\nOfficials from all three countries say they would rather have a good deal than a rushed one. But the delay is not without risks \u2014 some trade analysts fear that an extended process could cause Mr. Trump to lose patience, and spur an American withdrawal.\n\nMidterm elections in the United States on Nov. 6 could also complicate the deal. The administration will need a simple majority in both the House and Senate to approve their revised trade agreement, which could prove difficult if Democrats win control of either chamber.\n\nMr. Lighthizer reiterated in his remarks on Monday that he hoped to win the support of some Democratic lawmakers. That may hinge on the administration\u2019s efforts to improve labor standards. Last Tuesday, more than 180 Democrats and one Republican lawmaker sent a letter to Mr. Lighthizer urging the administration to propose stronger measures to improve Mexican labor conditions.\n\nRepresentative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat and one of the signatories, said the Trump administration\u2019s current labor proposals just \u201cmask maintaining the status quo.\u201d Mr. Levin said \u201cthe traditional view of these issues is that they\u2019ll work out in the wash, but workers have been taking a bath.\u201d\n\nNegotiators said they reached agreement on a Nafta chapter focusing on anti-corruption, and were nearing completion on several other sections. But the ideas Canada brought forward to counter the Trump administration\u2019s proposals were proving a source of contention.\n\nThe United States has proposed significantly raising the so-called rules of origin, which govern how much of a car needs to be manufactured within the free-trade area to be exempt from tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Canadians last week discussed changing the way the figures were calculated to include design, investment and parts of an automobile like high-tech software and sensors that are common in cars today but not measured under Nafta.\n\nThe change is likely to raise the proportion of a car\u2019s value produced by the United States, because many high-tech industries are centered there. But it also appeared unlikely to address Mr. Trump\u2019s primary reason for renegotiating Nafta: strengthening American manufacturing.\n\nMr. Lighthizer criticized the idea, saying that it \u201cmay actually lead to less regional content than we have now\u201d and said \u201cthis is the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Lighthizer also used his remarks to criticize a recent case Canada brought to the World Trade Organization, in which it claimed that the United States system for policing dumping and subsidies was unfair. \u201cIt is imprudent, and my suspicion is, spiteful,\u201d he told reporters.", "title": "Signs of Progress in Nafta Talks but Countries Remain Deeply Divided", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

A lobster salad and a green market salad will be served only in New York. Some of the menu changes daily. Though the name makes the chain sound like a spot for salads, most of the items that are the backbone of the menu, including sandwiches and plates (not bowls), depend on a hearty component.

Another that I usually abhor are on relationships or self-help, but I\u2019ve really enjoyed Laura Kipnis\u2019s \u201cAgainst Love\u201d which explores the absurd rules of love and marriage in the West since the 19th century.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\n\nVoracious, excitable, starry-eyed. Dumas\u2019s \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201d encapsulates so many fantasies of my childhood \u2014 the escape from prison, the mysterious fortune, vengeance on enemies. I was a lover of vicious fairy tales like Struwwelpeter. I remember sobbing over Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Happy Prince.\u201d I relished the poetry of Byron, Keats and Kipling; my favorite was \u201cThe Highwayman,\u201d by Alfred Noyes. I was taught Shakespeare brilliantly by an eccentric genius at Harrow named Jeremy Lemmon who made me want to be a writer. I consumed everything by Robert Graves and Mary Renault, then Orwell, Hemingway, Guy de Maupassant, and Michael Moorcock\u2019s Colonel Pyat novels in a frenzy until I discovered Tolstoy, Bulgakov, Pushkin, Lermontov and, my favorites, Isaac Babel and Kurban Said\u2019s \u201cAli and Nino,\u201d which infected me with a feverish fascination for Russia and the Caucasus that led me to go out there in 1991 as the U.S.S.R. dissolved.\n\nIf you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be?

The president would be fascinated by the Kaiser and enjoy a strange sense that he is not unique: He aspires to be an American czar but may be an American kaiser. On the recognition of Jerusalem and understanding the Middle East, I recommend four old but vibrant masterpieces: Josephus\u2019s \u201cThe Jewish War\u201d; Usama ibn Mundiqh\u2019s \u201cThe Book of Contemplation: Islam and the Crusades\u201d; Ibn Khaldun\u2019s \u201cThe Muqaddimah,\u201d; and Evliya Celebi\u2019s \u201cAn Ottoman Traveller.\u201d\n\nDisappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t?

Its characters, led by the writer Benya Golden, who joins one of Stalin\u2019s punishment battalions during World War II, are so familiar to me now. In the last period of real cavalry warfare, Benya enrolls in a cavalry battalion with a crew of cutthroats and Cossacks who encounter the Italians.

Yet last month, I spent Christmas with its former president, Anote Tong, and his family in their beautiful ancestral homeland.

The latest climate estimates project that sea levels could rise as much as six feet within this century, threatening to put Kiribati under water.\n\nOver the past few years, I have followed Anote Tong as he has traveled the world to ring the alarm about climate change\u2019s dire consequences. Kiribati is a heartbreaking case study for those interested in taking stock of our rapidly accelerating climate woes.

By conservative estimates, some 200 million citizens will be forced to flee their homelands by 2050. Where will we relocate all these climate refugees?

{"date": "2018-01-31 00:00:00", "text": "Watching is The New York Times\u2019s TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s World War II film \u201cDunkirk\u201d is one of the most critically lauded of this year\u2019s Academy Awards nominees, racking up nominations not only for best picture but also for cinematography, editing, production design and director (Nolan\u2019s first). The heavy praise in both creative and technical categories speaks to the scope of Nolan\u2019s accomplishment: In his telling of the Dunkirk evacuation \u2014 in which over 300,000 Allied soldiers, pinned down on a French beach by the Germans, are evacuated against all odds \u2014 he made a war movie that is both precise in its craft and compelling in its storytelling.\n\nOf course no film, however great, arises in a vacuum. If you value \u201cDunkirk\u201d as much as the Academy does, here are a few streamable films that are bound to resonate, whether in story or aesthetic.\n\nIf You Loved the Story\n\nA scene from \u201cDunkirk.\u201d MGM\n\n\u2018Dunkirk\u2019 (1958)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk\u201d is not a remake of this 1958 British film from director Leslie Norman, though it bears the same title and portrays the same event. Norman\u2019s version is a far more conventional telling of the Dunkirk evacuation, done in a traditional style, with none of the shifting time frames of Nolan\u2019s interpretation. It is, however, a tightly crafted, hard-nosed war picture, told mostly through the eyes of two protagonists: one a British soldier (John Mills) awaiting evacuation from Dunkirk beach, the other a British reporter (Bernard Lee), who covers the events and then leads the charge of civilian boats assisting the rescue. It may not be as formally flamboyant as Nolan\u2019s telling, but it\u2019s a brilliant antecedent.\n\nIf You Love Films About World War II\n\nRobert Shaw, left, and Christopher Plummer in \u201cBattle of Britain.\u201d United Artists\n\n\u2018Battle of Britain\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBarely a month after the Dunkirk Evacuation, the Royal Air Force\u2019s extended defense of Britain from German Luftwaffe began. That campaign, which lasted nearly four months, is the basis of this 1969 war film from director Guy Hamilton. Hamilton was best known for such classic Bond films as \u201cGoldfinger\u201d and \u201cDiamonds Are Forever,\u201d and his work here is less winking but just as technically impressive; the large-scale flying and battle sequences are spectacular, their scale, scope and intensity not unlike those in Nolan\u2019s \u201cDunkirk.\u201d\n\nBut Hamilton pays just as much attention to his human interactions. The all-star cast (which includes Laurence Olivier, Michael Caine, Trevor Howard, Christopher Plummer, Susannah York and Robert Shaw) shines, and the film takes great pains to include the perspective of German soldiers and officers, rather than paint them as background cartoon villains. That choice lends \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d a moral complexity that helps it transcend the usual war movie conventions \u2014 much as \u201cDunkirk\u201d does.\n\n0\n\nIf You Love Poetic War Films\n\nA scene from \u201cThe Thin Red Line.\u201d Merie W. Wallace/20th Century Fox\n\n\u2018The Thin Red Line\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine Nolan\u2019s pulling off such a stylistically experimental World War II movie without the this 1998 masterpiece from director Terrence Malick as precedent. Adapted from the novel by James Jones (sprinkled with bits from another of his novels, \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d), it was Malick\u2019s first film in two decades, extending his shift away from the straightforward narrative inclinations of his debut feature, \u201cBadlands\u201d (a shift begun with his shimmering pastoral from 1978, \u201cDays of Heaven\u201d). Malick had become more interested in cinematic poetry than prose, and set about crafting images and voice-overs that captured mood more than story points.\n\nThat sounds like anathema to a war story, but Malick pulls it off: With the help of an illustrious cast (including Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto and many others), he crafts a film that trembles with the humanity to be found in all conflict, and is intoxicated by the possibility that beauty and bloodshed may exist side-by-side.\n\nIf You Loved the Sweeping Scope\n\nP\u00eet\u00e2, left, and Tatsuya Nakadai in \u201cRan.\u201d Studio Canal\n\n\u2018Ran\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\n\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMany critics described \u201cDunkirk\u201d as an \u201cintimate epic\u201d (while acknowledging the phrase is an oxymoron), and if the modesty of the characterizations and dialogue recalls \u201cThin Red Line,\u201d the film\u2019s sweeping scope has a decidedly more international flavor. In many ways, it recalls the last majestic epic from the master filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, \u201cRan,\u201d a 1985 riff on \u201cKing Lear\u201d that reimagines Shakespeare\u2019s tragedy in 16th century Japan. Kurosawa alternates intensely vibrant full-canvas battles \u2014 symphonies of blood and barbarism \u2014 with quiet scenes of psychological struggle and stunned silence. To attempt both modes in the same picture is daring; to pull it off is a miracle. \u201cRan\u201d is a miracle.\n\nIf You Loved the Silence\n\nA scene from \u201cBattleship Potemkin.\u201d Kino International\n\n\u2018Battleship Potemkin\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: FilmStruck, Amazon\n\n\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cDunkirk\u201d is Nolan\u2019s shortest film, and also his most succinct; rather than rely on the reams of expositional dialogue that usually summarize his plots and characters, he parachutes us into the action (much like the troops at the story\u2019s center) and tells the story via action, montage and onscreen text. In other words, \u201cDunkirk\u201d is the closest he\u2019s come to making a silent movie, and when approached that way, its debt to this 1925 Soviet classic from Sergei Eisenstein is all the more apparent. The force of its images, the immediacy of its telling, and the evocative, ticktock urgency of its editing style all owe a debt to Eisenstein, as do its underlying themes of self-sacrifice and hope.\n\nIf You Loved It, but Want Something More Fun\n\nA scene from \u201cTheir Finest.\u201d Lionsgate\n\n\u2018Their Finest\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Amazon, iTunes\n\n\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to follow up \u201cDunkirk\u201d with something a bit less solemn, try this winking behind-the-scenes story of \u2026 the making of a motion picture about the Dunkirk evacuation. Lone Scherfig (\u201cAn Education\u201d) directs this story about the British Ministry of Information, which paired with the empire\u2019s cinematic talents during World War II in order to create movies that would boost troop morale and lift civilian spirits. It has all the touches of a great backstage comedy \u2014 a sweet romantic entanglement (between the charismatic Gemma Arterton and the charming Sam Claflin); a curmudgeonly co-star (Bill Nighy); an uproariously ill-prepared leading man (Jake Lacy). But ultimately it speaks, earnestly, of the power of motion pictures to rally, to inspire and to unite.\n\nIf you loved \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d as well, here are six films to watch next; we also have six more to watch with \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d", "title": "Six Films to Stream if You Loved \u2018Dunkirk\u2019", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "Polaris Hall from Danvers High School in Massachusetts was surprised how much the cold affected her daily life:\n\nI\u2019ve never experienced cold like this before. Until I moved up north this past summer \u2014 I\u2019d never been in temperatures below 20 degrees fahrenheit and hadn\u2019t planned on it \u2014 but this? Experiencing negative temperatures has been a huge blow. I know how to deal with the heat \u2014 I grew up in Texas and spent time in New Mexico and Louisiana and other sweltering southern states. I can handle heat exhaustion. Vomiting from the heat, worrying about dehydration, getting lectured for melting my shoes on the pavement \u2014 I\u2019ve dealt with it. But now? My first blizzard? I\u2019m completely out of my element. I\u2019d never shoveled snow before. I\u2019d never actually seen a snowblower. I\u2019d never even owned a down coat. It\u2019s overwhelming and has impacted my day to day life more than I could have even imagined. I try to be grateful for these new experiences, but honestly? I\u2019m just too cold to appreciate them.\n\nTj Salvo from Danvers, Mass., agreed:\n\nThe cold weather is way too much even for me. As a kid I used to love when it snowed and going outside to build a snowman and sled. As of today I am officially over winter and am in desperate need of summer. I honestly think the weather has affected everyone negatively in one way or another. Whether it be having to shovel 14 inches off their driveway, or having to wake up an extra 30 mins earlier because they have to drive slower to work / school due to how bad the roads are. I also think this weather affects students a lot. With summer being very far away and the cold freezing us every morning on the way to school, we\u2019re losing any and all effort of trying to work hard. We are cold and all we want to do is go and warm up with a heavy comfy blanket, not sit down and work on the ice cold kitchen table finishing our math homework.\n\nBut Jackson Spiers from Wilmington, N.C., was enjoying it:\n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve loved the recent cold weather we\u2019ve been having. I\u2019ve always loved to walk outside and feel a cool refreshing breeze against my face. I am so grateful to have missed a few days of school and have an extended break. I really needed more time off for obvious reasons. This recent weather has surprised me because normally we have mild weather here in Wilmington. I have not been through any extreme weather to this point luckily, the worst I\u2019ve experienced has been a category 2 hurricane.\n\nAnd Collin MacRae from Massachusetts was grateful that a frigid chill was the worst weather New England was facing this year:\n\nSince Christmas it seems like all of America has been trapped in a harsh cold front especially in places like New England where cities and towns were bombarded with two feet of snow and countless days near or below zero degrees not to mention the windchill that sends cold wintery air deep into your core making it almost unbearable to do anything outside your home. However, we have seen worse so I guess in some way it\u2019s better to be really cold and snowy across America rather than to have to fight hurricane after hurricane such as this summer when it seemed as though there was never a time without a major hurricane ravaging some area of the country or during the fall when California saw one of the most massive, destructive, and deadly wildfires in history. So we can all at least be thankful that all we have to deal with is frigid temperatures and snow instead of walls of flames that march their way across cities and towns or hurricanes strong enough to rip homes from their foundations.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nWe received impassioned responses from believers and nonbelievers alike for our Student Opinion question \u201cDo You Believe in Astrology?\u201d\n\nHee Yun Chung from California was one such doubter:\n\nI do not believe in Astrology. In fact, I think the whole concept of Astrology is nonsense. In my opinion, to think that the current location of Saturn or any other star dictating whether if I pass or fail a test is mindboggling for me. I understand that Astrology has recently become a \u201ctrendy\u201d thing to have fun with, but to fully buy into the concept is a betrayal to the scientists and astronomers that have dedicated time, resources, and effort to explain our universe logically. First off, Astrology is not a science. Astrology is not based on evidence, the conclusions aren\u2019t testable, and can\u2019t be proven wrong. These qualities are the main foundations of what science is and Astrology fails to meet any of these qualities. Secondly, scientists have put Astrology to the test multiple times in the past and have found Astrology to be inconsistent. A French study in the 60s which aimed to find if people\u2019s careers correlated with the placement of celestial bodies resulted in no correlation. However, despite the debunking of Astrology as a significant amount of Americans believe that Astrology is a type of science. It is concerning that Americans believe in an ancient practice that has no ground or base in science in terms of evidence and testability. To conclude, I think that Astrology can be practiced as a fun activity for family and friend gatherings but not applied to science that is based in reality\n\nVoltron Thunderstorm from Wilmington was also disturbed by astrology\u2019s recent rise in popularity:\n\nIt\u2019s appalling to see a concept as ridiculous as astrology actually making its mark on today\u2019s society. In a world where our scientific capabilities are vastly expanding, the last thing that we should be doing is resorting to untestable and unreliable methods for explanation and prediction. I fully understand that astrology might be a fun activity to mess around with, but attempting to apply it in the real world is just plain stupid. As a species, we have evolved past looking at relations between stars for answers to completely unrelated problems. Astrology has proven to be inconsistent in various scientific tests, and it seems that the best defense people have for it is a coincidence here and there. If people want answers they should be looking to a science \u2014 a real science \u2014 that can give them real answers. My hope is that astrology only continues to gain popularity as an activity for fooling around, and people won\u2019t truly put faith in a completely defenseless practice.\n\nOthers, though, put themselves in the category of astrology devotees. Like Maickel from New Jersey:\n\nNot only do I believe in astrology, I do find it to be the tool through which we can understand ourselves and the universe in which we live. In fact, you might as well could have asked me if I believed in gravity or in earth being round. For me it\u2019s a hard fact. I started by questioning Astrology many years ago, and had a very skeptic approach. But I would then find things that were not coincidence, that were very specific about me. And is fine when is one or maybe two things. But astrology has taught me that I am more than a combination of circumstances, that the future is not written in stars but is written in you, but within the choices taken in the present and that the reaction, not the event, to what happens in one\u2019s life, is what matter the most. Is not about finding out when you will get a boyfriend or a new car. Is more about if and why you are ready for it. It is not so much a religion as it is a system. Unfortunately, most people exposure to astrology is a section in a newspaper that is referring to a whole group of the population and they believe this is all there is to it. To say that someone is from one sign or the other is obviously simplistic. Is like saying someone is from a country or another. There are dozens of other factors astrology considers. If you haven\u2019t gotten your Birth Chart done by a credited astrologer, I doubt you ever know what the big deal is about it, and why it has not gone anywhere in the over 10,000 years of history on its back.\n\nAnd Sydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., who learned a lot about herself through studying the stars:\n\nWhile growing up, I remember looking at the newspaper and seeing a section for horoscopes. It always interested me and I wanted to learn more. I\u2019ve always been into learning more about my personality, taking the Myers-Briggs personality test and looking at my natal chart. The natal chart uses when you were born, what time you were born, and where you were born to show you each house or planet you fall into. It\u2019s more in depth than just finding the zodiac sign of the month your birthday is. I believe in astrology. It helps us better learn about ourselves and the universe we live in. Through analyzing my chart, I was able to understand myself and how I am. The astrology chart was pretty close to what I got on the Myers-Briggs personality test too. Most people base their belief of astrology on the horoscopes people put into their blogs, but that isn\u2019t individualized for them. That\u2019s more of a general belief and that\u2019s not what you should go by. If you take the time to do a natal chart and read your results, you will find that it\u2019s pretty accurate and you may discover some things you didn\u2019t really know about yourself, but it\u2019s true. I will say, astrology and the future it tells you is not set in stone. You can change the future. The choices you make shape who you are and what will happen in your lifetime.\n\nAnd Julia Broderick from Danvers, Mass., who finds comfort in being able to explain the universe:\n\nYes, I do believe in astrology. The horoscopes that tell you you\u2019re going to win a million dollars may not be right and sometimes the placement of the planets won\u2019t determine whether or not you find your soul mate, however I do believe that astrology has actual meaning. The universe is a vast and unpredictable place, humans have barely scraped the surface of what is the universe is made of, what it looks like, what it\u2019s function is, etc. There is no literal knowledge of what the universe is fully capable of because we have not witnessed or tested it all. So, astrology, the study of the planets, the dependence on their patterns, makes sense to me. The planets are a wonderful and almost magical force. The giants in the sky are centers of their own universes of life. They are important and I think incorporating them into your life is valuable to being humble and being knowledgeable about your spiritual and mindful self. The idea that these beasts can tell us why we are sad and why the day is going bad is so nice for humans to hear that we cling to it. It is in our nature to look for why things happen or what causes things. So, if someone believes that the position of mercury explains why they can\u2019t communicate properly then that\u2019s that. The human race, with all its complexity and differences, is the same at the core with needing to find something comforting to understand. So, astrology works perfectly to explain the inexplicable universe.\n\nEthan Kim from California enjoys reading his horoscopes, but advised to take them with a grain of salt:\n\nAstrology helps us pinpoint our personality traits and characteristics, but reading your horoscope can provide you with attracting information when life seems to be at a stand-still. By explaining why certain things happen, horoscopes can help you cope with the most subjective affairs that are going on in your life. Whether you are experiencing great times and fortune, or you are going through dark, and tough times, your horoscope can provide solace when you don\u2019t know where to turn. Life is about decisions, and keeping up with your astrological identity and horoscope can help you fix your mind to what you should do when you make decisions. Some say that just having a short read every once in awhile can help you benefit from the energy the cosmos are pushing towards you, but I believe that horoscopes can be a waste of money and time. In fact, nobody can totally rely on horoscopes to solve his or her problems. Rather, consider them as fortune cookies which give momentary pleasure but cannot sustain you forever.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents studied an illustration of \u201cSocial Media\u201d to decipher what it says about our society.\n\nAllison Zafiri from Massachusetts suggested:\n\nThe picture illustrates the role social media has in one\u2019s life. Below each person is the set number of followers that they have which defines each as more \u201cpopular\u201d than the other. The image provides the audience with information on how social media is used and how impactful it can be when being used to appeal to an audience. As depicted, social media is a place that is welcoming of all ethnicities, genders, etc. Everyone has the right to equal use and popularity of social media \u2014 which represents that the use of social media and being a part of sites demonstrates unity for all those a part of the program. Social media relates to society because it shows how each person has the ability to break away from everyday life and be anyone they want to be on social media. Social media can be beneficial in communicating with long distant family and friends, or even sharing a fascinating picture! The image comments on current day society by revealing that people utilize social media to potentially make insecurities more hidden (due to the lack of background knowledge given to a \u201cfollower\u201d on social media), or release any stress. Having this interpretation of the image allows for the conclusion that social media can be used positively in society, or its power can be over used resulting in an over obsession with the site.\n\nPhoebe S from Wilmington, N.C., had a more sinister interpretation:\n\nTo me this picture says that social media is everywhere. It controls us. We are always worried about what is new on it, who has texted us, snap chatted us. We look up to people who we do not even know, to people who we want to look like, to act like, to people who we aspire to be. We are glued to our phones, constantly seeing the people we wish we could be like, but that is not healthy. The almost impossible standards that we are exposed to almost every time we open our phone. Worrying about how many followers or friends we have. We are addicted to our phones and social media. The real question is though, why are we addicted?\n\nEmily Lane Player from Hoggard High School related the image to current events:\n\nIn my opinion, this picture represents the huge impact that social media has on our daily lives. Each of these social media stars has millions of followers, many looking up to them. However, what this picture does not show, many celebrities who attained their fame in a different way, have massive followings as well. One of these celebrities is none other than our president, Donald Trump. As said by Kashana Cauley, Trump has used Twitter to \u201cpromote a tax bill that would disembowel the middle class and to attack prominent black people.\u201d She says, however, that these tweets have made her feel more patriotic, by voicing what she believes is right for our country. Even though many argue that this is unpatriotic because it goes against our president, but in reality, this is patriotism. Patriotism is believing in one\u2019s country and being proud of the nation. Kashana Cauley is proud of the people in America standing up for their rights, such as the football playing kneeling for the national anthem. If Americans supported everything Trump says, all of his bigotry and ignorance, simply because he is our president, this would be nationalism. Nationalism is the toxic idea that one\u2019s nation is better than other countries, and blindly supporting one\u2019s country, even if their nation is wrong. I believe Kashana Cauley is patriotic, because she is striving to improve our country instead of conforming to the misogynistic and racist views ingrained in the American political system.\n\nIN from KOP PA explained how social media \u201clikes\u201d create a social hierarchy:\n\nThis picture illustrates the standard at which people need to stand at to be famous or well known is receiving many likes and followers. Every social media user is different and is able to stand out in their own way, but this picture only makes well known users stand out. Not everyone has thousands of likes and followers, and for those that do have special attention. This shows that for the people that have the largest amount of likes and followers having a higher ranking. This is redundant because everyone was born equal and it is not fair to be placed in a position where you are lower than someone.\n\nAnd Addison Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., made a personal connection:\n\nThis image sums up a perfect explanation on how social media is changing people\u2019s lives. One\u2019s popularity is determined by the amount of followers we have or the number of likes we get on our recent picture. Everyone of us have been impacted by social media and for some, it has changed our lives. We are addicted to our smartphones, laptops and tablet screens. However, it is up to us to determine whether we use social media in a negative way or if we positively affect the social media world.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nIn response to our \u201cGIFs\u201d Picture Prompt, students told us how they use images to communicate their emotions.\n\nAmanda Donahue from Massachusetts wrote:\n\nGifs are the perfect way to express how you feel when you can\u2019t find the words to do so. People do say \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d for a reason. If you want to passive-agressively show someone you are upset with them, send a gif. If you want to show your appreciation for someone but are too awkward to put it into words, send a gif. Gifs are used all over the world because they can express universal feelings in ways that words can\u2019t always do. Happiness, love, sadness, and anger are all emotions popularly represented by gifs in many different countries. This is because despite being universal feelings, they are much easier to express through facial expressions or actions. But, it\u2019s 2018, hardly any communication is face-to-face anymore, gifs bring the element of expression that cannot be expressed through text.\n\nMakena Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., told us how she uses emojis:\n\nI use emoji when I am shocked, excited, or sad about something. By using emojis, it helps the person who is reading it understand how you feel about the situation. By using emoji it expresses if I am kind, mean, or judgmental. It expresses this because it shows what I feel about the topic being talked about.\n\nAddison Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., thinks GIFs are changing the way we communicate:\n\nGifs are a new culture to the social media world. They are the perfect way to express how you feel, what you\u2019re thinking or what you\u2019re doing. By using gifs and emojis we can show exactly how we feel without misleading the other through words. Our words often get interpreted or altered in ways we didn\u2019t even mean them to sound. Therefore, gifs are a great way to show how we feel!\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion prompt \u201cWhen Have You Reinvented Yourself?\u201d yielded introspective comments, both from a personal standpoint and a universal one.\n\nMakena Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., said:\n\nI have reinvented myself multiple times, but my biggest was just a few months ago. When hanging out with my friends I used to be shy and always afraid to voice my opinion. One day I asked myself, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, why are you so reserved.\u201d I had no answer so after that day I have been outgoing and im never afraid to say what\u2019s on my mind. I have had so much more fun with my friends than I ever have before. Even though I might be a little hesitant to talk in front of the class, I imagine one day that will change. But, until then i will make the most of it. I think that someone can control if they change or not out of high school. It is all about where you end up.\n\nEthan McGrath from Danvers, Mass., said change is continual:\n\nKnowledge is used to move forward. As people learn more, life is made easier. Tasks such as washing laundry and cooking food continue to change with the creation of new inventions and developments. Not only does the way tasks change, but people do too. People never stop reinventing themselves. From the day someone is born, the process of reinvention never ceases to reoccur. Moving up to a high school, with different expectations than past schooling meant that I especially had to change to meet higher expectations. Reinventing myself included, trying harder in specific subject areas in order to fulfill class requirements that were more difficult than before. Energy in certain subject areas needed to be re-focused and adjusted. To overcome obstacles, I had to reinvent my approach to school, which meant that I had to reinvent myself.\n\nAnnie Cote from Massachusetts said change is unexpected and outside our control:\n\nChange is inevitable. For some, this realization is unfortunate and rather scary; while for others it is exciting and makes them eager to experience these changes in their lives. Personally, I do not believe that we can control how much we will change over time. Most personal change is a result of experience, most of which is unexpected or uncontrollable. For instance, experiencing a tragic event like a death in your family is completely out of your control, but it will in fact change who you are as a person. It may make you more angry, bitter, or it may even reshape the way you look at life and express yourself to others. On the other hand, there are change-causing things that we can control, like who we decide to be friends with, where you work, what you choose to do in your free time. But change will always remain inevitable, something that will not always be completely in our control.\n\nEmily Ball from Wilmington, N.C., thinks reinvention can be planned, and rejected:\n\nPart one: I believe that I was given an opportunity to reinvent myself, but I did not take it. When I was going into my 8th grade year, I was leaving my school of about 40 people in the whole grade, a school that I had been at since Kindergarten, for a school with about 40 people in just one class. Although I knew a handful of people, there were many that I was yet to be acquainted with. I felt that this was a chance to reinvent myself, being that hardly anyone would know me. I thought this for a little while, and then decided that I would rather be who I felt I had always been. Looking back, I do not believe that there has really been a time when I have \u201creinvented\u201d myself, per se, but I have gradually changed over time. I believe that change within people is inevitable, either it being a sudden change, or a gradual one. I have seen some of my friends reinvent themselves though, and sometimes I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. Much like Navlakha in the article, I don\u2019t want to lose them. I am a sophomore in high school right now, and I feel like I will definitely change when I leave for college and continue that change throughout my freshman year. I think this because leaving home and going to college is one of the biggest events that will happen in my life. As Navlakha did, I hope to also change in the way I feel about certain subjects in academics in college.\n\nKevin Jordan from Danvers, Mass., said a person\u2019s essential nature never changes:\n\nIn her article on reinventing oneself in college, Meera Navlakah argues that change is inevitable in our lives when we place ourselves in new environments. I agree with Meera that new experiences alter our personalities. For example, many of my friends in middle school who attended private school instead of Danvers High have grown differently in the past couple years than the rest of us have. While our attitudes have remained the same, many of them have a more privileged life than public school students. At private schools, they are required to dress much more formally, often enduring more rigorous principles at their respective schools. In turn, they have developed a first class attitude compared to us. While the difference in wealth may affect students attitudes, I have remained good friends with these preparatory students. The core of their personality remains beneath the surface. People do not really change that much. Deep down, people are who they have always been. New environments seem to change people on the surface. You cannot teach an old dog new tricks however. While I expect my friends and I will change over the course of our lives, the core of our personalities will remain the same.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Picture Prompt \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d brought in some predictable, and some not-so-predictable, responses.\n\nCoco Liu from Taipei, Taiwan, said:\n\nI do make New Year\u2019s resolutions each year, but it\u2019s actually hard for me to keep.\n\nJessica Lee from Wilmington, N.C., thinks resolutions are for yourself, not others:\n\nMany people perceive New Years resolutions to be ways to make other people like you, but I think they are about making you like yourself. To me, New Years resolutions are about making yourself the best you can be, whether it be in health, or in mindset. In the past I have not stuck to my resolutions, but this year I made a goal that I can achieve. My resolution is to drink more water. It will help me be a stronger athlete, which is something I myself strive to be. Hydrating is not all about sports, however. Hydrating also helps your body function better and keeps you healthy. I downloaded an app that keeps track of your fluid intake so I don\u2019t have an excuse to fall short. It is important to hold yourself accountable to your New Years resolutions, and not just tell your peers how well you\u2019re doing. Remember, the reason why you\u2019re doing this should be for you, not for them.\n\nHal Warren from Massachusetts doesn\u2019t feel the need to make any resolutions this year:\n\nIn years past I had always made some sort of resolution. I would do something like I want to lose weight or I want to be kinder to others. But this year I found that I\u2019ve bettered myself, I\u2019m happy with myself and I\u2019ve done all the important things I needed to do. Sure, I realize it\u2019s important to keep going, to keep working out, to keep being kind; but I don\u2019t think that requires a new resolution.\n\nGabriel Preusser from Craryville, N.Y., aims for health:\n\nI tend to make New Year\u2019s resolutions. Most of the time I don\u2019t keep them. This year I have a lot of good and healthy ones that I want to keep. For example i want to eat healthier, and spend less time on my phone and video games. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be.\n\nMcKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., agrees:\n\nPersonally I try to make \u201cNew Year\u2019s Resolutions\u201d but I typically forget about them and move on. I do however, make sure that I try to improve myself in one way or another throughout the new year. Whether it\u2019s improving my grades, volunteering more, or simply just making sure I stay healthy and take care of myself. In general I believe that new year\u2019s resolutions are a bit clich\u00e9. Most people make them after they have had a rough previous year, and hope that the next year improves, but, usually it doesn\u2019t. Usually we create a mindset that we are going to improve ourselves and our lives by making these resolutions but the average person doesn\u2019t actually try to keep up with them. We simply state what we want to do to improve ourselves for the next year and made mediocre steps to complete that goal. I do believe that some people really can and will complete their new year\u2019s goal, and I applaud those people because usually I, myself, cannot complete the many goals that I have set for myself at the beginning of the year. I only have one goal this year and it\u2019s to take care of myself, to make sure that I am healthy mentally as well as physically. The steps that I am willing to take in order to complete this goal is to, eat healthier, drink more water, (try to) procrastinate less and to make time to hangout with loved ones such as friends and family. I\u2019m excited to start these steps in working towards my goal which is to be the healthiest and happiest that I can be.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nCommenters who answered our prompt \u201cWhat Are Your Predictions for 2018?\u201d made reference to much negative news and less-than-hopeful events from 2017.\n\nCalvin Walker from El Dorado, Ark., was not optimistic:\n\nI think 2018 will be a year full of disagreement and conflict in our government and country. I feel like Trump will continue to lead our country in a direction that won\u2019t benefit us. I also believe that we will go into further debt.\n\nKJ from El Dorado, Ark., touched on many issues:\n\n2017 was a year to remember. There were a lot of events that have raised questions and caused tensions to rise. With trump being elected there has become a great division within the country. He has also started rising conflicts with other nations most notably North Korea. Now that it is 2018, I believe things can get better. Now that we went through an entire year with the way things have ran, people will wake up and begin to take a stand in what they believe. Both parties of congress will start to work together to some extent because the president is somewhat against his own party. I think we will start to see a lot more states that are usually red will start to tip blue or at least not be as red. The House will become split after the midterms. I believe many of the social issues such as taking a knee and the me too movement will only continue. I do believe however if the movement continues we will have more and more people become against it because it is starting to take the form of a witch hunt. Countries will try to find better ways to crackdown on terrorist. As for the Korea missile crises, I believe that it is very likely that Russia will try to step in and force the situation. That is if Putin wins his next election which I think he could lose. If he does win it will be a close one. In the world of sports, I believe the Saints will win the Super Bowl, Arkansas the college mens baseball championship, and the Boston Celtics the 2018 NBA Finals.\n\nLauren Clement from Massachusetts said things will stay the same:\n\nOur world in general will not change in 2018. The idea of 2018 being a new year is just a label. Even though the new year seems like the epitome of all things change, nothing ever does. I predict there will be just as much if not more conflict. As for U.S. politics, I believe Donald Trump will further his border wall agenda and attacks against other countries. I believe the economy will continue to improve as it has, and stocks will continue to rise. Fashion will continue to be increasingly edgy and our culture will continue to be rivaled by racism, bigotry, and societal conformity. As for my family and loved ones I hope they have a happy, safe year and I wish for academic and athletic success for myself.\n\nSamman Naz from Massachusetts agreed:\n\nI predict that 2018 will be no better than 2017. There have been so many countless global, national, and local disasters in 2017, that they cannot be recovered by 2018 or possibly even 2019. In fact, such disasters will continue to pile on to the existing ones and eventually there will be more than we can bare and shortly after, there will be nuclear war and an extinction the human race. I am only predicting extreme circumstance because after what 2017 left us with, going to extreme measures is the only way we can prepare for what 2018 holds for us. I mean think about it. We put a racist businessman who has no logical knowledge on how to be a leader in charge of our nation. How can I not predict that there will be a nuclear war? But that is only my political predictions for 2018. As for economic predictions, I can honestly say I don\u2019t know. Finally, the future for the realms of culture, arts, fashion, and style is looking bright. Despite all of the political and economic dilemmas that will go on, I feel like culture, arts, etc. will truly flourish because I\u2019ve noticed in 2017, that people began to embrace their love for different cultures and arts and I think it will continue like that in 2018. But, in the end, the bad overshadows the good and despite such improvements in the arts and culture, the political issues will rise higher. But, these are only my predictions. Maybe, that won\u2019t happen. Maybe everything will lighten up in 2018. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n\nDerek Moore from Aruba is cautiously optimistic:\n\n2017 was a year overcome by an overwhelming blanket of controversy and violence. However, it is possible that some of this could be resolved in 2018, especially with the formation of improved policies around the world to hinder gun violence, drug abuse, and terrorism. Furthermore, the people of the United States have been hiding under their desks in fear of a nuclear attack or getting hacked. I predict that in 2018, the Russia investigation on the hacking in the 2016 election that had plagued the nation for the past year will be progressed upon, and the United States will become a more secure nation as a whole. Along with the booming economy, this development could bring America to a state of enhanced greatness and prosperity. Although there is still a lingering issue with \u201cRocket Man\u201d in North Korea, hopefully there will be a continuation of the six-party talks or some form of bilateral treaty with the aggressive nation that will leave countless countries feeling much more secure. Outside of politics, there will most likely be major changes in the world of entertainment. With widespread debate over national anthem protests in leagues such as the NFL, there will most likely be a shift in viewership of this sport, to other leagues such as the NBA or the NHL. This was mildly evident during this football season, but more viewers will most likely return to watch the upcoming playoffs, and the New England Patriots winning another championship.\n\nChloe Raesly from Danvers, Mass., doesn\u2019t know what will come next:\n\n2017 has been a very eventful year. Our country has experienced many catastrophes that range from political to economic. Politically, our country has elected a man who is hated by most. There has been a large variety of national disasters along with global and local ones. I predict that 2018 will not be much different than 2017 regarding these issues. For example, I believe that since the minimum wage increase, small businesses are going to be greatly effected. In order pay their employees, small businesses will have to increase their prices so that they will still be bringing the same amount of money into their business. Additionally, social media shows how people nowadays especially children will believe anything they see. This will negatively affect the minds of our youth as it has already done in some situations in 2017. 2017 was a year of unpredictability. We could not predict the various terrorist attacks, along with the hurricanes and the forest fires. I believe the 2018 will also be a year of unpredictability. There is no way of knowing what will come next. Positively, fashion and trends will continue to increase and change. Maybe there will be a fashion breakthrough. We will just have to wait and see. The world is constantly changing around us and there is no way of knowing what will follow next, like a story book. I guess we\u2019ll just have to keep turning those story book pages in order to see what will happen next, positive or negative.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents enjoyed discussing their personal \u201cStyle\u201d for our Picture Prompt. Here are just a few:\n\nAddison Liney from King of Prussia, Pa., says style is expression:\n\nYou are what you wear. We can express a lot about our personality through our sense of style. Imagine a world where everyone wore the same thing, bought the same items and wore the same accessories. Fortunately, you can create and express your style in any way you wish through your feelings, thoughts and interest. Clothes say a lot about a person. Have fun with it!\n\nOlivia Rotondo from Philadelphia says outfits can change your mood:\n\nPersonally, I think the way you dress has a huge impact on who you are and who you strive to be. But, your outfit does not always accurately define who you are. Some days I dress a little more edgy, some days I dress a little more preppy, but overall I dress how I am feeling that day.\n\nPolaris Hall from Danvers High School in Massachusetts conjured up visions:\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forgot who are (and who you want to be) when you\u2019re going through school and ushered through life, but personal style helps me feel grounded. Sorting through vintage and thrift shops for hours on free weekends can almost seem tedious, but finding the right piece \u2014 an old military coat or patterned silk blouse \u2014 or even the very, VERY wrong piece \u2014 a pair of leather pants with cowhide patches or tasmanian devil underwear \u2014 helps me rediscover a little part of myself I sometimes feel is lost. Lots of color and accessories, jewelry and patterns \u2014 they all help remind me that I\u2019m me and I\u2019m alive and there\u2019s nothing greater than that. Cutting my hair in a split-second decision makes me feel in control and makes any other quick choice a lot easier to handle. Leather jackets and bright pink combat boots help me feel whole and are a celebration of life and of love and are, more than anything, a reminder that I am stronger than I may seem, and certainly stronger than I feel.\n\nVictoria Jackson from Wilmington, N.C., has an indescribable style:\n\nEach day when I come into class, at least one classmate says \u201cooh she\u2019s got a different look today!\u201d I love changing up the clothes I wear and keeping my peers on their toes guessing what I\u2019ll wear next. There\u2019s really no way to describe my style. I take inspiration from all types of styles, grungy, preppy, chic, couture and more. I usually shy away from regular clothes you find at a mall and always find my key unique pieces at thrift stores. To get the real feel of vintage clothing, I even shop around in my grandmas closet! I would say my style reveals my personality, it shows I\u2019m always open to new things and I\u2019m unpredictable. I really only started to dress the way I do now about two years ago. What stopped me from really expressing myself in my outfits before was my fear for what others may think of me. I\u2019m glad I learned to let that go and just be me.\n\nCassie Prentiss from Massachusetts takes style inspiration from others:\n\nIf someone who is my moms age were to look at my overall style of clothing, they would probably say \u201cthat\u2019s something I would have worn when I was a kid\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t say I dress in parachute pants and backwards caps, but I would say I dress differently from the modern t-shirts and jeans trends. I think my clothing choices say that I\u2019m unpredictable, I tend to wear things that are completely different from what I\u2019ve worn the day before. Although I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m the most original person on the planet, I know it\u2019s not true. The clothes I wear may be different, I might not wear any makeup at all and my hair may be shorter than the normal girl\u2019s hair, but I still take inspiration from those I\u2019d love to be one day. The types of girls who can wear absolutely anything on the market and constantly look amazing are the girls I\u2019d love to become. It takes time to fully understand who you are, personal style is a huge part of that. I would say I\u2019m experimenting with my style any way I can, even though I could completely change my mind tomorrow. It\u2019s a journey I\u2019m glad to take.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion prompt \u201cWhat City or Town Most Captures Your Imagination?\u201d captured the imagination of our readers.\n\nDerek Moore from Aruba has a specific city in mind:\n\nThe most interesting city in the United States, in my opinion, is Detroit, Michigan. In my lifetime, I have never witnessed a more disappointing city, with less impressive attractions. First off, the sports teams in Detroit are an overall disaster. The Detroit Tigers, Detroit\u2019s astounding MLB franchise, finished last in their division, behind even the 67-95 Chicago White Sox. Additionally, the Tigers have won only four championship titles in the history of the MLB, and the last time they won was in 1984. Furthermore, the Detroit Lions, Detroit\u2019s incredible NFL team, has not appeared in the playoffs for 26 years. Along with this outstanding drought, the Lions have never appeared in a Super Bowl Championship game. For some odd reason, I am amused by Detroit\u2019s lack of success in sports. This is not an insult, but I am waiting for the day where I look up at the television and see the sports teams of Detroit dominating everything. Other than its sports teams, Detroit is also plagued by abandoned houses and failing properties. Mobile homes and trailer parks are widely popular in this city, and this reflects some famous people from this city, such as Eminem, who often speaks of the poor conditions in this city. Despite its many downsides, Detroit does have rich history in music, and it has many museums and such that are fascinating and fun to explore. I find Detroit interesting because it is so abstract and different from every other city in this country.\n\nMadison Seeley from King of Prussia, Pa., said a change of scene can elevate a person\u2019s mood:\n\n\n\nWhen I was about 8 years old, I moved from Maine to Pennsylvania. This was a HUGE change. Although, my all-time favorite place to go is Puerto Rico. I absolutely love Puerto Rico. When my dad asked me to go on this trip with me, I was hesitant at first. I am so glad that I went, though. I associate my favorite place, Puerto Rico, with the beach and sunshine because at that point in my life, I was very sad and I didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone or do anything. When I dream about going somewhere, I dream of going to Australia because it is so different than the United States. It is on the opposite side of the world! I believe that everyone should be able to go to the place that makes them smile.\n\nLola Byers-Ogle from Wilmington, N.C., seeks diversity in a chosen place:\n\nI have grown up in a relatively small city in the south and lived there my entire life so far. I traveled to Washington D.C. when I was 12 years old, and ever since I knew that I wanted to live out my adult life there. Unlike Ms. Gerwig, I don\u2019t associate a person/people with the city, in fact, I\u2019ve always seen it as a symbol of my independence and freedom from the people in my small town. The reason I love D.C. is the rich culture in the city. Coming from a family of Italian immigrants, I have always been curious about other countries. My dream is to live in a nice apartment in D.C. and work at one of the foreign embassies. There isn\u2019t much diversity in my hometown as D.C., which is why I hope to move there eventually.\n\nShelby Johnson from Massachusetts finds cities electrifying:\n\nMuch like Ms. Gerwig, I have grown up in a small, suburban town. I too love New York, with its constant energy and amazing collection of people. However, not just New York is enticing to me. Of all of the places I\u2019ve been lucky enough to travel to, cities have always been my favorite part. I\u2019ve always loved going into Boston, even though it\u2019s just a short distance from my hometown. Philadelphia, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Prague, Dublin, and Barcelona have been where some of my favorite memories were made. Wherever I go, cities all seem to have an electricity from being filled with all different kinds of people. In a city, it seems that there is always something to do, always something happening, always new and interesting people who are different from each other. No matter where I end up in life, I want to be in the heart of this energy and life. I can\u2019t say for sure if there\u2019s one city in particular that I know I\u2019ll be drawn to, but as long as I\u2019m in the midst of this excitement I think I will be very happy.\n\nAnn Nguyen from Massachusetts wants to stay in-state:\n\n\n\nThe city that most captures my imagination is Boston, my home state\u2019s capital. I might want to live there one day when I am in my 20s. Boston has a special place in my heart for its millennial spirit and innovation. Boston is not too crowded, but when there are small concerts or protest rallies, the people of Boston come together to enjoy life. Friends stroll along the city sidewalks, laughing, while strangers politely greet each other. I love the tall buildings that soar above the city, surrounded by beautiful bodies of water like the Charles River. People can walk and bike in the welcoming atmosphere of Boston. What I love most about Boston is its culture and diversity. There are so many museums to explore and admire. My favorite painting is \u201cthe Dos Mujeres\u201d by Frida Kahlo in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. At night time, the city hums with jazz music by the park and chattering by the movie theater. I like visiting Boston, but one day, I would love to be a part of the city.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nAmid the most recent app craze, we asked students \u201cWhat Makes HQ Trivia So Popular?\u201d\n\nMadison Capezzuto from Danvers, Mass., had one theory:\n\nWhat caused the sudden outbreak of popularity for this simple game? Having the application myself, I have an inside opinion on why and how it has risen in popularity. Competition. The simple game brings upon a rather Americanized view on competition and the connotations that go along with winning and losing. Just the word \u2018loser\u2019 has extreme negative connotations as it implies that someone is less than others when a majority of people would rather be in the position of power that goes along with winning. Although this game is based off of facts that many people just simply would not know, it brings out the competitive and rather neanderthal ways of many people. Playing just one game of HQ, you would be able to discover many things about the human psyche and how detrimental a lose or a simple wrong answer can be to someone.\n\nSydney Durner from Wilmington, N.C., gets the appeal from personal experience:\n\nJust yesterday morning, I got in my cousin\u2019s car at school and he told us about this addicting game, HQ. I had heard of it before, but I was nervous to download it. When my brother and I got home, we both downloaded the game and were waiting for the new game to start at 9. The prize for this game was $2000. As soon as the clock hit 9, we both joined. I think the appeal of the games lies in the fact that it is challenging and there is a chance for a cash prize. Trivia has always been popular, I remember when everyone was hyped over Trivia Crack. HQ is challenging, engaging, and just a fun experience overall. The hosts make (cringey) jokes which creates a bond with the players. Everyone loves Scott, the questions vary, and as it mentions in the article, the \u201cDarwinian aspect\u201d of the game, watching thousands of people get eliminated, boosts your ego for the time being and makes you feel superior. It\u2019s a very highly addicting game and I understand why after playing it.\n\nSharan Srinivasan from King of Prussia, Pa., compared the popularity of the app to another game:", "title": "Sneaker Heads, Astrology and New Year\u2019s Resolutions: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

{"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "text": "The difficulty in being a bridesmaid comes in being at once an emotional support and a prop. You must act out your friendship in prescribed ways: wearing a certain outfit, being at particular events before the wedding and in general prioritizing a day that has nothing much to do with you. And though modern couples love to say you just have to \u201cshow up and stand there,\u201d even that is work.\n\nSetting your expectations\n\nThe idea of saying \u201cno\u201d to being a bridesmaid genuinely horrifies some people.\n\n\u201cIf one of your besties asks you to be a bridesmaid, I can\u2019t imagine saying no,\u201d said Seri Kertziner, co-founder of Little Miss Party Planner, an event planning service focused on events surrounding weddings.\n\nThough she recognizes it\u2019s a huge commitment of time, energy and money, she said that being asked is a symbol that you are a cherished friend \u2014 and saying no would disrespect that. But sometimes \u201cno\u201d needs to happen, whether in small ways like rejecting a dress or in turning down the role altogether.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is that everything is unspoken in weddings, in a way that can be really detrimental to everybody involved,\u201d said Maddie Eisenhart, the chief revenue officer of \u201cA Practical Wedding.\u201d People say yes because they are honored and excited, without realizing what is really expected.\n\nSo the first step is to make those expectations, and your limitations, explicit. Instead of just saying yes, say you\u2019re honored and ask what the bride wants from you. Someone to wear a rented dress and do nothing else? Someone to plan four different showers? Someone who can spend $10,000 on the day?\n\nFrom there, you can either say yes, or let the couple down easy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to anyone to say \u2018I just don\u2019t think I have space in my life to take on this responsibility, even though I\u2019m very honored that you asked,\u2019\u201d Ms. Eisenhart said.\n\nEstablishing a budget\n\nNo matter what, you will be spending money, so accept that at the start. But you\u2019re more in control of your budget than you may think.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing I would have told myself before being a bridesmaid ever was to be upfront with the bride about your financial situation,\u201d said Jasmine Guillory, author of \u201cThe Wedding Date,\u201d and an eight-time bridesmaid.\n\n\u201cIt probably cost me a thousand dollars for every wedding, at least,\u201d she said. \u201cSo be upfront with the bride about what you can afford.\u201d\n\nWedding magazines and Pinterest usually don\u2019t include price tags, which warps how we think a wedding should look and what\u2019s realistic for those involved. Suddenly spending thousands of dollars on a friend\u2019s wedding becomes \u201cnormal,\u201d and you\u2019re the villain for complaining. Establishing a budget is the best thing you can do to plan against that: Think of the absolute maximum you\u2019d be willing to spend on everything (dresses, travel, hotel rooms, bachelorette gifts), and in any initial planning correspondence, say that number out loud.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

It\u2019s quite likely that you\u2019ve never planned a bachelorette party before, and now you\u2019re expected to be an expert. Ms. Kertzner suggests that, again, establishing who is paying and how much everyone can afford is key. And if the bride is insisting on something too expensive, talk to her. She very well may budge, or if she doesn\u2019t, now you know how to say no gracefully.\n\nAdvocate for yourself, but go with the flow\n\nMs. Guillory recalls one wedding in which the bride was white but all her bridesmaids, save her sister, were women of color. While shopping for bridesmaid dresses, the bride chose a color that the others thought would be unflattering.\n\nOne bridesmaid spoke up, saying \u201c\u2018I just have to say, this\u2019ll look great on your sister but not on the rest of us.\u2019 And the bride was like, \u2018Oh! I hadn\u2019t thought of that, I\u2019ll change the color.\u2019\u201d This is not to say you won\u2019t have to wear an unflattering color or have to take more vacation days than you\u2019d like, but most of the time, the couple wants their friends to be happy, and are willing to make small changes to accommodate that.\n\nStill, you will not be getting everything you want.\n\n\u201cThere is a delicate balance between advocating for yourself and sucking it up a little bit,\u201d Ms. Eisenhart said. \u201cI\u2019m O.K. with wearing a somewhat unflattering dress for a day for the sake of my loved ones.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, don\u2019t feel obligated to agree to things that push you too far outside your comfort zone, whether that\u2019s with minor fashion choices or asking a friend with a baby or a new job to drop everything and be your wedding confidante 24/7.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you\u2019re being pushed too far, it\u2019s a sign that you and the couple need to have a serious talk. But having to wear silver jewelry when you wanted to wear gold isn\u2019t that.\n\nComfort in, dump out\n\nAs a bridesmaid, there will be a time during wedding planning where you need to complain, whether it\u2019s about the groom\u2019s family or the bachelorette destination or the 70 dresses the bride can\u2019t choose between. This is when you should be applying the rule of \u201ccomfort in, dump out.\u201d\n\nOne of your main duties is to be an emotional support, and to not add more stress to the couple\u2019s lives. So comfort the couple and other bridesmaids when they\u2019re stressed, and complain to \u201canybody who is not in a position of being deeply enmeshed and more stressed out by your stress,\u201d Ms. Eisenhart said.\n\nThink of it like a group of expanding rings surrounding a central point: People on the inner circle \u2014 the happy couple \u2014 can dump to the outer circle \u2014 the bridesmaids \u2014 while that outer circle should offer only comfort back in. But that outer circle of bridesmaids should feel fine dumping to a circle even further removed \u2014 say, their friends who aren\u2019t involved in the wedding \u2014 and so on. This is called sometimes called the ring theory.\n\nThe dress\n\n\u201cI wish brides would stop trying to find a dress \u2018you can all wear again!\u2019\u201d Ms. Guillory said.\n\nAll the dresses in my closet look like bridesmaid dresses. I will not be wearing them to cocktail parties, and that\u2019s just fine. \u201cYou don\u2019t wear strapless ruched chiffon on the regular,\u201d Ms. Eisenhart said. Instead, she suggested that more couples embrace the idea of renting bridesmaid dresses, just like groomsmen rent tuxedos, whether from Rent the Runway or companies like Vow to Be Chic. Not everyone knows this is an option, so bring it up, and you might save yourself some money.\n\nThe tiny details are what count\n\nMake sure you\u2019re rested the night before, since you\u2019re going to have to be \u201con\u201d all day. Hair and makeup starts early, photographers start circling, and expect all manner of family, friends and vendors to come to you with their questions.\n\nAnd, of course, prepare yourself for unexpected drama.\n\n\u201cThings always get messy at weddings, so there have been times where I\u2019ve run interference between family members, or jumped in to pull that person out of the sight of the bride because they were doing something ridiculous,\u201d Ms. Guillory said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Eisenhart recalled a time when the skies opened up during pre-wedding photos and the couple didn\u2019t have a rain plan, so her husband ran out to buy a bunch of photogenic umbrellas. Things will happen, so be ready to act.\n\nTo help any potential drama go down smoother, make sure everyone eats. The morning getting ready may be filled with mimosas and snacks, but try to build in time where everyone can eat an honest meal before drinking champagne and dealing with a hundred family members. \u201cEverything looks a lot less stressful with pizza in your stomach,\u201d Ms. Guillory said.\n\nCorrection 1/16/2018: An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Maddie Eisenhart\u2019s role at the website \u201cA Practical Wedding.\u201d While Ms. Eisenhart does edit content at the website, she is the site\u2019s chief revenue officer.", "title": "So You\u2019ve Been Asked to Be a Bridesmaid.

He rose to become its chairman by age 29.\n\nBorn on April 28, 1982, in Beverly, Mass., Mr. Johnson grew up in nearby Middleton in a working-class family. His mother, Ann Richardson, who attended Wednesday\u2019s vote for Mr. Johnson, worked a variety of jobs while raising him and his sister. His father, David Johnson, born in South Korea to an American father and Korean mother, was an alcoholic who left the family before his son was old enough to remember him, Mr. Johnson said.\n\n\u201cMy mom dropped him off at work one day when I was 11 months old and he never came home,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. They reconnected only by phone, years later; Mr. Johnson said his father died in 2014. His stepfather, Rod Richardson, played a more central role in raising him, but also struggled with alcohol and with gambling and died relatively young. \u201cWe always had problems with money,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nWhen an article of his coming out appeared on the front page of The New York Times and recirculated on national television, it opened up a new world to a young man who had never left the Northeast: paid speeches, trips to Europe and South America, and the world of New York City.\n\nMr. Johnson eventually made his way up the Democratic ladder, working for Mark J. Green, then the public advocate, before moving to Mr. Green\u2019s failed mayoral campaign and then to a bid for governor by H. Carl McCall, who also lost. In 2004, Mr. Johnson was diagnosed as H.I.V. positive.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Quinn, then the speaker of the City Council.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen he first got in it, it was perceived as an uphill fight,\u201d said Mr. Elmendorf. \u201cAs with the speaker\u2019s race, my sense is, he just outworked everybody.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson began lobbying to become the Council speaker early in his first term, in September 2015, traveling the city by transit and taxis (he does not own a car). He had no white board of names, or a personal system of vote-counting, he said. \u201cIt was all in my head.

Some of these works include memoirs by decorated servicemen, like Everett Alvarez Jr.\u2019s \u201cChained Eagle\u201d and Roy Benavidez\u2019s \u201cThe Three Wars of Roy Benavidez\u201d; Charley Trujillo\u2019s \u201cSoldados: Chicanos in Viet Nam\u201d; John C. Trejo\u2019s \u201cCarnales: A History of Chicano Vietnam Veterans\u201d; Z. E. Sanchez\u2019s \u201cTiger Mountain: Hispanics in the Vietnam War\u201d; Juan Ramirez\u2019s \u201cA Patriot After All: The Story of a Chicano Vietnam Vet\u201d; George Mariscal\u2019s \u201cAztl\u00e1n and Viet Nam: Chicano and Chicana Experiences of the War\u201d; Lea Ybarra\u2019s \u201cVietnam Veteranos Recall the War\u201d; Lorena Oropeza\u2019s \u201cRaza S\u00ed, Guerra No!: Chicano Protest and Patriotism During the Vietnam War Era\u201d; Myl\u00e8ne Moreno\u2019s 2015 documentary film \u201cOn Two Fronts: Latinos & Vietnam\u201d; and two oral history projects, Tom\u00e1s Summers Sandoval\u2019s \u201cVietnam Veteranos: Latino Testimonies of the War,\u201d based at Pomona College, and Maggie Rivas-Rodriguez\u2019s \u201cThe Voces Oral History Project,\u201d based at the University of Texas.\n\nThe voices recorded in these works reveal how the story of Edgewood is not exceptional to but representative of Latino experiences during Vietnam. Across the country, barrios in places like Greenlee County, Ariz.; Corcoran, Calif.; and the Bronx produced significant numbers of servicemen and suffered high casualty rates, largely because of limited economic and educational opportunities that left young Latino men especially vulnerable to the draft (as they were often ineligible for college deferments) or led them to enlist as a means of escape from foreclosed possibilities in jobs or schooling.\n\nYet, while Latino veterans share many commonalities, their experiences in the war are as diverse as the category of Latino itself. Some, like Mr. Alvarez, a Navy pilot whose plane was shot down in the Gulf of Tonkin incident and who spent eight and a half years as a prisoner of war, enlisted as a way to follow a family tradition of military service and patriotic duty. Others joined the service as a means of exerting control over their destiny in response to what they understood as the inevitability of the draft. A few, like the Chicano student activist Rosal\u00edo Mu\u00f1oz, bravely staged public protests refusing induction; many more, like my father, received their draft notice and reported for duty.\n\nThis broad range of Latino veteran experiences, coupled with Dr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s research, galvanized the robust Latino antiwar efforts that culminated in one of the largest antiwar demonstrations during the Vietnam era: the Chicano Moratorium on Aug. 29, 1970, in which nearly 30,000 Latinos marched through Los Angeles. Latino antiwar activists were as diverse as Latino veterans and included university students like Mr. Mu\u00f1oz; draft board members like Julian Camacho, a Korean War veteran who resigned from the Santa Cruz County draft board to protest the class inequities of the induction system; and family members of servicemen, such as Mr. Alvarez\u2019s sister, Delia Alvarez, who, as a modern-day Antigone, spoke out against the state in an effort to honor her brother.\n\nThe history of Latino participation in Vietnam, then, not only deepens our understanding of American involvement in the war but also, according to Dr. Summers Sandoval, \u201cacts as a prism for a larger social history of the Brown Baby Boom generation and offers lessons about the terms and costs of integration for Latinos in the United States.\u201d Or as the Vietnam veteran Charley Trujillo observed, \u201cThey wanted us to come out here and work in the cotton fields and call us Mexicans but as soon as there\u2019s a war, all of a sudden, we\u2019re American.\u201d\n\nA few months after the Edgewood Vietnam Memorial\u2019s unveiling, I entered my senior year at a high school across town. By then I had already begun to consider myself an aspiring writer and a child of the war. These two facts were, for me, profoundly connected. My first poem, written when I was 12, was a poem about Vietnam. So many of my poems since then have also returned to Vietnam and its particular impact on Latinos. Like Tom\u00e1s Summers Sandoval, whose father also served, I am part of a generation of writers and scholars who are now adult children of Vietnam \u2014 the descendants of veterans or refugees \u2014 who grew up with the war and who try in our own work to do as my father did: stare into that dark hollow in an effort to extract what\u2019s painful or to heal what\u2019s broken. We write our way toward our parents, we write a way back from the war.\n\nAs the recent anthology \u201cInheriting the War: Poetry and Prose by Descendants of Vietnam Veterans and Refugees,\u201d edited by Laren McClung, suggests, we recognize our profound connection to one another precisely through our attempts at documentation. My father came back from Vietnam, and together we create space to move through the silences left by the historical record, by the lasting effects of war, and by those Edgewood neighbors who never returned.", "title": "Soldiers in la Guerra", "authors": ["Deborah Paredez"]}

Early in his career, he worked as a teacher and then as a principal in New York City. He served in several positions at the city\u2019s Department of Education, including as senior deputy chancellor, overseeing teaching and learning across the school system during a time of real transformation.\n\nAnother is Jaime Aquino, who once worked as a local superintendent in the city and went on to do distinguished work in the Denver school system. He is now chief program officer for New Leaders for New Schools, a nonprofit focused on developing principals.\n\nPaymon Rouhanifard, the superintendent of the Camden City School District in New Jersey since 2013, was also trained in New York City. In Camden, which was seen as one of the most troubled school systems in the country, Mr. Rouhanifard has improved graduation rates and lowered suspension rates. He has shown a tireless enthusiasm for the job and appears to be having a dramatic impact on public attitudes in Camden toward education.\n\nJohn White, who has served as the Louisiana state superintendent of education since 2012, is another highly competent manager who formerly worked for the New York City Department of Education. In Louisiana, he has vigorously pushed reforms on curriculum and teacher preparation. In 2015, the state\u2019s fourth graders showed the most growth in the country in the reading test of the federally backed National Assessment of Educational Progress, and the second-most in the math test. Graduation rates have risen under his stewardship, and many more students have completed high school with early college credits.\n\nAmong the candidates without roots in New York that Mr. de Blasio should consider is Kaya Henderson, who garnered a national reputation for leadership in the once beleaguered district of Washington, D.C., before stepping down in 2016. Over her six years at the helm, she strengthened academic offerings, created more confidence in the city schools, and engineered a personnel evaluation system that rewards highly competent teachers and steers the lowest performers out the door. An independent 2016 study found that this system had a significant impact on student learning.", "title": "Opinion | Some Bright Hopes for New York\u2019s Schools", "authors": []}

For a year now, judges there have been deciding whether to hold people before trial based on the risk of flight and the risk a defendant might pose to others if released.\n\nMr. Vance and Mr. Gonzales both said they would like to see the New York State Legislature pass a similar statute. In New York, judges are only allowed to weigh the risk a defendant will not show up in court, and may not take public safety into account in setting bail.\n\nThe Bronx district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, also voiced support on Tuesday for changing the bail laws to limit the use of monetary bail, especially in misdemeanor cases. \u201cIf we are not asking for jail, then we should not be asking for bail,\u201d she said at a Citizens Crime Commission breakfast. \u201cFor my ADAs, the default is no bail, unless there is a reason for it.\u201d\n\nThe Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, said he saw no need to change his policy of asking for bail whenever a defendant has history of not showing up to court, no matter the charge. That has resulted in bail being set in only about 6 percent of the misdemeanor cases in Queens, he said; nearly all of those defendants had prior convictions and bench warrants.\n\nIt remains unclear how many defendants the new policies will affect over time. Both Manhattan and Brooklyn guidelines include a long list of exceptions. Bail is still going to be requested, for instance, for people with violent felony convictions, for sex offenders or for people accused of domestic violence.\n\nMr. Vance said judges set bail for only about 15 percent of the 54,000 people arraigned in Criminal Court in Manhattan last year. He expects that proportion to shrink substantially. In Brooklyn, about 9 percent of the 55,000 people arraigned on misdemeanor charges were asked to post bail, down from about 30 percent two years ago, Mr. Gonzalez said.\n\nTina Luongo, the attorney-in-charge of The Legal Aid Society\u2019s criminal defense practice, said the policy changes were welcome to public defenders, but she added that only the Legislature could revamp the state\u2019s bail system in a meaningful way.\n\n\u201cClosing Rikers Island, reducing mass incarceration and saving lives will require more than long-overdue, piecemeal changes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a step in the right direction, but we need Albany to act now on a statewide basis.\u201d", "title": "Some Prosecutors Stop Asking for Bail in Minor Cases", "authors": []}

Aides said Mr. Trump did a practice run in the White House Map Room on Monday afternoon.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan of Ohio, an outspoken conservative Republican, said he was willing to accept a more dignified tone from Mr. Trump on Tuesday night as long as the president stuck to the conservative principles that got him elected.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s real clear,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep focused on what the American people sent us here to do: Drain the swamp, drain this place and remember that we work for the families that sent us. If we do that for the next year, we\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the president plans to formally ask Congress for a bipartisan effort to address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure with a plan of at least $1 trillion financed by the federal government, states and private industry.\n\nThat message could rally even some of the more conservative members of his party.\n\n\u201cI expect him, because it\u2019s his style, to go off the teleprompter a few times,\u201d said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

The game is a fund-raiser for Kernan\u2019s Heroes, a charity that benefits homeless veterans here in Indiana.\n\nWhether enacting legislation in the Senate to protect service members\u2019 mental health or raising money for Hoosier veterans, I\u2019ve tried to help take care of those who\u2019ve worn the uniform of our country. And it\u2019s no surprise to me that back home in Indiana, that might occasionally involve basketball. After all, sometimes it seems like nearly everything here does.\n\nMay in Indiana belongs to auto racing, but the other 11 months belong to basketball. You\u2019ll find hoops above Gary\u2019s blacktops and on Vincennes farmhouses.

Another activity Indiana ought to be known for, in addition to basketball? Believe it or not, crossword puzzles.\n\nThere are plenty of my fellow Hoosiers who are a master of that art, two of whom I had the pleasure to work with: my good friend Mickey Maurer, owner of The Indianapolis Business Journal and author of a book of his own crosswords, as well as Crawfordsville\u2019s own Will Shortz, who needs no introduction. After hearing Mickey talk about the joy of creating his own puzzles, it was a joy to create one with him.\n\nThis was the first puzzle I\u2019d helped create, an experience both very familiar and strange after previously only solving them. Working with Mickey and Will on this to write clues for today\u2019s puzzle required drawing on a depth of knowledge to make a coherent puzzle that brought together two of our state\u2019s passions. That in turn meant plenty of writing, erasing and rewriting. The tools needed to solve a puzzle, then, are not much different from those that are needed to create one \u2014 only on this side, there\u2019s the knowledge that the entire New York Times audience will see your work.\n\nIt was my goal that this is as enjoyable for you to solve as it was for me to help make. Good luck.\n\nMickey Maurer: I am delighted when my puzzle appears in The New York Times, so I always try to maintain three puzzles in the queue to feed that addiction.\n\nPuns and quips are my favorite crossword puzzle themes. We should all know by now that it is difficult to shoot a quip puzzle idea past Will Shortz. I keep trying. Many of my recent puzzles, including this collaboration with Senator Joe Donnelly, are themed puns. Some of these puns made me laugh out loud. See 18 across.\n\nIt was a pleasure to work with Senator Donnelly. I am not making a political statement here, but I was not surprised to learn that Senator Donnelly was recognized as the second most bipartisan senator since 1993 by the Lugar Center, McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. He is easy to work with. I had originally intended to hide his name in the puzzle (don, nelly) but those letters didn\u2019t mesh well with the theme clues.\n\nWe chose a basketball theme for Indiana, a basketball-crazy state that produced Oscar Robinson, Larry Bird and George McGinnis.

According to BuzzAngle, another music data tracker, American listeners streamed 377 billion songs last year, up 50 percent from 2016.\n\nSpotify is by far the most popular audio streaming outlet, with at least 60 million paying subscribers around the world and an additional 80 million who use its ad-supported free version, according to the company\u2019s most recent public statements. Apple says it has at least 30 million subscribers to its Apple Music service, which is available only by subscription.\n\nDespite Spotify\u2019s size, it has never turned a profit, and music licensing costs are still its greatest expense. In 2016, Spotify had about $3.3 billion in revenue, up 52 percent from the year before, but its net loss also grew sharply, to about $600 million, according to its most recent filings with European regulators. The company is based in Sweden.\n\nSpotify would be coming to the public stock markets at an auspicious time. Last year, 138 companies \u2014 including well-known ones like Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat \u2014 went public, up 45 percent from 2016, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Together they raised $30.6 billion, roughly double the amount raised in 2016.\n\nBut last year\u2019s burst of activity remained well below the decade-high mark set in 2014, as the ease of raising money in private markets has dissuaded big start-ups from pursuing I.P.O.s. Companies like Uber and Airbnb have pushed off market debuts while amassing valuations that rival their publicly traded brethren.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Most companies that have pursued direct listings have been much smaller, with the exception of Freddie Mac in 1989. Deal makers and analysts have said a direct listing is available to Spotify because of its already wide name recognition among potential investors, which makes the standard I.P.O. meet-and-greets largely unnecessary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA prospectus from Spotify, expected to be made public before the listing, would shine additional light on the company\u2019s finances and on the economics underlying streaming music.\n\nWhen Pandora went public, it, too, was buoyed by rapid user and revenue growth but dogged by a lack of profitability. Last year, short on cash and with its growth slowed, Pandora accepted a $480 million investment from SiriusXM that gave that SiriusXM a 19 percent stake and three board seats. In 2017, Pandora\u2019s stock lost 62 percent of its value.\n\nSpotify is hoping to avoid that fate with newly renegotiated licensing deals with the major record companies that lessened Spotify\u2019s royalty rates by a few percentage points, and by maintaining its growth around the world. The service is available in 61 territories, from Greece to Guatemala.\n\nBut while streaming has lifted revenues at the major record companies, which have minority stakes in the company, musicians and songwriters remain skeptical of Spotify\u2019s model, and of their ability to earn livable wages from Spotify.\n\nIn late December, Wixen Music Publishing, which represents songs by Tom Petty, Neil Young, Stevie Nicks and other songwriters, sued Spotify in a federal court in California, accusing it of using thousands of songs without proper licenses, the latest in a string of such copyright suits. The suit asks for $1.6 billion in damages, $150,000 for each song.\n\nSpotify had no comment on the lawsuit.", "title": "Spotify Is Said to Be Going Public in Early 2018", "authors": ["Ben Sisario", "Michael J.

Though his mandate requires holding growth companies, he has been lightening up on some highfliers. \u201cWe have been trimming back some of the winners,\u201d Mr. Galvin said. The fund has sold off roughly 20 percent of its Amazon stock and roughly one-third of its position in Facebook, he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Galvin emphasizes that the tech rabbits have raced ahead largely because they\u2019ve met or exceeded expectations. Apple\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth has accelerated in recent quarters. Apple cited its revived strength in China, along with better-than-expected unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs, in its most recent quarterly report.\n\nSimilarly, a year ago, analysts expected Facebook to earn about $4 a share over the next 12 months, Mr. Galvin said. But Facebook succeeded so well in making its gigantic membership an audience for ads, it earned over $5 a share in the last four quarters.\n\nGrowth stocks may also have fared well because they are suited to current economic conditions. \u201cI think growth stocks do very well in a low-inflation environment, when pricing power is elusive and therefore unit growth is the key driver to profit growth,\u201d Mr. Galvin said.

These acts, approved by Mr. Carter and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, sought to subvert the control of information that was the foundation of repression in the Communist world.\n\nNone of this enhanced the C.I.A.\u2019s understanding of the Soviet Union, Mr. Turner acknowledged. \u201cWe were appreciating as early as \u201978 that the Soviet economy was in serious trouble,\u201d he said after the Cold War was over, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t make the leap that we should have made \u2014 I should have made \u2014 that the economic trouble would lead to political trouble. We thought they would tighten their belt under a Stalin-like regime and continue marching on.\u201d\n\nThe C.I.A. did not see the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan coming in December 1979. But days later, Mr. Carter ordered the agency to begin shipping weapons to the Afghan resistance. During the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, the United States poured billions of dollars into that C.I.A.-run effort. The Reagan administration also greatly expanded small covert operations that had begun under Mr. Carter to undermine the left-wing Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.", "title": "Stansfield Turner, C.I.A.

He said public-private partnerships, like the ones the administration has considered, can save money for taxpayers, but he added, \u201cIf we really want to rebuild our infrastructure and modernize, we can\u2019t keep patching it over, and we can\u2019t do it on the cheap.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is also likely to call for more efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. But aides declined to say whether Mr. Trump would talk about health care in the speech, a subject of debate among administration officials for weeks.\n\nThe White House is proud of the fact that Republicans were able to repeal even a small part of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the penalties for people who go without health insurance. The president could take credit for that and for regulatory efforts to dismantle other parts of the law that Republicans dislike. But his party appears far away from its yearslong goal of doing away with the law entirely.\n\nIt is also unclear what Mr. Trump might say about the high cost of many prescription drugs. Mr. Trump said last year that drug companies were \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d but he has not taken many steps to solve the problem.\n\nConsumer advocates and employers, who pay the bills for drug coverage, are hoping to hear more from the president, who could at least point to the work of the Food and Drug Administration to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs.\n\nOn national security, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides said the president would make his case for a bigger military, more secure borders and fair trade, which critics say is a euphemism for protectionist policies.", "title": "State of the Union Preview: Will Trump Stick to the Script?", "authors": []}

Following is the statement the woman issued on Friday, shortly before the police official, John J. Miller, sent her his apology.\n\n\u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.\u201d \u2014 the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., quoting Theodore Parker\n\nI\u2019m grateful to Detective Andrea Sorrentino, who worked tirelessly on my case back in 1994, and to Detective Sarah Mathers who solved it 23 years later. I\u2019m grateful that someone believed the four women James Webb raped after he raped me, and that he was finally brought to justice. I\u2019m extremely grateful that James Webb is not eligible for parole until 2070.\n\nImmediately after I was raped, the policemen who responded drove me around the park, stopping and questioning black men who looked nothing like the description I had given them. When I told them that as a black woman that made me uncomfortable, that it made me feel unsafe, they were visibly angry. I also wrote a statement that my friends and colleagues read aloud that weekend at a rally protesting violence against lesbians in Park Slope. I guess that made someone at 1 Police Plaza very angry. To see in print that police sources had called me a liar had a silencing effect on me, to say the least. I paid a terrible, terrible price for my #MeToo.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday larger societal issues are framing my personal experience of trauma, just as they did then. There are thousands of cold cases, thousands more rape kits from the 1990\u2019s and beyond that have not been tested with modern technology. Don\u2019t those victims deserve closure, too? There are still victims receiving substandard treatment from cops and ER doctors who don\u2019t know how to deal with assault victims sensitively. Can\u2019t we put training in place to correct that? Most disturbingly, stories of assault are still discounted; cases are not vigorously prosecuted. Schools and workplaces deal with sexual assaults as internal disciplinary matters instead of as what they are - crimes. #MeToo is not a movement, or a moment. It is an ongoing reality women have lived with that MUST CHANGE, starting now.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jessica Goosmann, a wildlife technician with Montana\u2019s Fish, Wildlife & Parks Department, stepped outside to greet them, reaching for the neck of each freshly killed deer to cut an incision and remove a lymph node for testing.\n\nOn the edge of this south-central Montana village, where deer hunting is a way of life, the game check station has become the front line of the state\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of a deadly infection known as chronic wasting disease.\n\nIt has ravaged deer herds throughout the United States and Canada and forced the killing of thousands of infected animals in 24 states and three Canadian provinces.

{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "So South Dakota essentially created a tax to provide a vehicle for the Supreme Court to reverse the Quill decision. The state required certain online retailers that did more than $100,000 worth of business in sales in South Dakota to collect the 4.5 percent state sales tax. When the online furniture retailer Wayfair challenged the tax, the South Dakota Supreme Court ruled against the state, citing Quill.\n\nIn early January, the Supreme Court will decide whether it wants to revisit the Quill case by taking up South Dakota\u2019s appeal in the Wayfair case. I am one of the economists and law professors who have filed a brief urging the court to do so.\n\nThere are compelling reasons to overturn Quill. Most important, according to market analysis, state and local governments will lose about $34 billion in revenue in 2018 because of the physical presence requirement, a number that will rise to nearly $52 billion by 2022. In 1992, in e-commerce\u2019s infancy, the loss was $700 million to $3 billion.\n\nFor their part, retailers say that out-of-state retailers should not be deputized as an agent of the state. That job, they say, is for the state to do, through the enforcement of the use tax. This is essentially the same argument made in Quill.\n\nBut Quill arguments are less compelling now than in 1992. For example, the administrative and record-keeping burden didn\u2019t disappear under the physical-presence rule \u2014 it was merely shifted to consumers, who are left to comply with tax obligations on their own. And improvements in technology mean that collecting sales tax for different states isn\u2019t nearly the burden for retailers that it would have been in 1992.\n\nThe Quill decision has now not only hurt states but also distorted behavior of big retailers: It discourages them from establishing a brick-and-mortar location (and creating jobs) in a new state and being liable for collecting its sales tax. Online retailers also enjoy state services \u2014 like roads that allow their products to be delivered efficiently to customers \u2014 without contributing to their upkeep.\n\nNormally, one does not have an opportunity to fix a mistake. Let\u2019s hope the Supreme Court in Wayfair takes advantage of that opportunity.\n\nIf not, you may notice worse roads because most consumers are not voluntarily reporting the use tax.", "title": "Opinion | States Pay the Price When You Buy Online", "authors": []}

On Tuesday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, announced that he had enough support to force a vote on a congressional resolution to bring back the rules. He gained an important Republican supporter, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who said she would vote in favor of it. Such a measure is a long shot in the House, however, and would also need President Trump\u2019s signature.\n\n\u201cNet neutrality will be a major issue in the 2018 campaigns, and we are going to let everyone know where we stand and where they stand,\u201d Mr. Schumer said at a news conference, warning Republicans to vote in favor of the Democratic-led resolution.\n\nIn addition, lawsuits against the commission are expected shortly after the policy becomes official.

It was that after the U.S. lifted sanctions on Iran in 2015, the Iranian government promised a big economic boom for everyone. But while the rich in Iran are getting richer, ordinary Iranians aren\u2019t noticing the benefits. And I know this third-world stuff is hard for some Americans to relate to, but just imagine if the U.S. government promised tax cuts for the middle class, but then only the rich benefited.

She feared that some of the website\u2019s cheerleading coverage of populist conservative campaigns \u2014 like the Senate race in Alabama \u2014 could be construed as corporate contributions to those candidates, which are barred under federal election law.\n\nNumerous people who have worked with Mr. Bannon over the past few months said that his attitude lately had grown more imperious and aloof than normal. And his outward lack of any emotion about his messy public breach with the president and the Mercer family struck some not as the calloused indifference of a political operative but as nihilistic.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump first denounced Mr. Bannon last week, saying, \u201cHe not only lost his job, he lost his mind,\u201d Mr. Bannon insisted to his writers and editors at Breitbart that it would all blow over. When reports began circulating that Ms. Mercer had cut him off, he denied it outright. And when friends started asking him about rumors that his job was in jeopardy, he insisted that everything was fine. \u201cThe Mercers haven\u2019t given me money in years,\u201d he told multiple people, playing down their significance in his work and insisting that an initial $10 million investment in the website was all they had provided.\n\nIn fact, recent tax filings suggest how difficult it will be for Mr. Bannon to fill the void left by the Mercers. The Mercer Family Foundation has donated more than $100 million over the past decade to mostly conservative nonprofit groups, including nearly $6 million to one that Mr. Bannon helped found, the Government Accountability Institute, which has also sought to distance itself from Mr. Bannon in recent days.\n\nMr. Bannon refused to admit any missteps or lapses in judgment, people close to him said.\n\nDespite putting his name on a statement in which he expressed regret \u2014 but did not apologize \u2014 for his comments about Mr. Trump\u2019s son, he resisted uttering any words of contrition until an unusual statement on Sunday morning.\n\nWhile Mr. Bannon edited and approved the version that ultimately became public, an associate sent out the statement without his knowledge, according to three people familiar with the situation. And when he learned that it had been given to Axios, a website read by Washington insiders, he was furious and blamed his colleagues for overreacting, these people said.\n\nEnvisioning Breitbart without Mr. Bannon \u2014 or Mr. Bannon without Breitbart \u2014 was almost inconceivable a month ago. Inside the townhouse called the Breitbart Embassy on Capitol Hill, where photographs of Mr. Breitbart still hang on the wall and half-filled coffee mugs emblazoned with the website\u2019s block \u201cB\u201d logo clutter the kitchen, Mr. Bannon\u2019s presence is just as prevalent.\n\nUpon entering, visitors see a table stacked with copies of the Time magazine from last year with Mr. Bannon on the cover under the headline \u201cThe Great Manipulator,\u201d along with other articles that have chronicled his rise to national prominence. On one ground-floor wall is a picture of a honey badger, the animal Mr. Bannon has claimed as his mascot because of its savage and relentless pursuit of prey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFriends of both Ms. Mercer and Mr. Bannon have described their rupture like \u201ca bad divorce.\u201d But Ms. Mercer was just one person among a growing list of powerful onetime allies whose backing Mr. Bannon had lost in recent months. In addition to disparaging Mr. Bannon as \u201cSloppy Steve\u201d and calling into question his relevance during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump blessed moves by the White House to further ostracize Mr. Bannon. And in the words of one associate of the president\u2019s, he wanted \u201ca scorched earth approach.\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, took the unusual step last week of suggesting that Breitbart remove Mr. Bannon.\n\nOver the weekend, the White House dispatched Mr. Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill and key members of the administration to the Sunday talk show circuit to defend the president and attack Mr. Bannon\u2019s credibility. The most vocal was Stephen Miller, who worked closely with Mr. Bannon in the White House and was someone Mr. Bannon considered a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Mr. Miller appeared Sunday on CNN and declared Mr. Bannon\u2019s comments in the book by the journalist Michael Wolff \u201cgrotesque\u201d as he played down the significance of Mr. Bannon\u2019s role in the administration.\n\nMr. Bannon\u2019s expression of regret did little to soothe the anger at the White House. Asked on Monday whether the statement, in which Mr. Bannon said Donald Trump Jr. was \u201ca patriot,\u201d had changed anything, the deputy White House press secretary, Hogan Gidley, balked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any way back for Mr. Bannon at this point,\u201d he said.", "title": "Steve Bannon Steps Down From Breitbart Post", "authors": ["Jeremy W.

That may have contributed, but when it comes to women facing workplace abuse, another dynamic does just as much harm: the culture of income inequality.\n\nThe report of Mr. Wynn\u2019s misconduct reminds me, a casino worker, of every time a manager stepped across the line or a V.I.P. guest\u2019s behavior was excused because of his financial status. Here, low-income workers are made to feel indebted to the rich men like Mr. Wynn who pay their wages. In a city with little economic diversity, good middle-class jobs like those offered by Wynn Resorts are difficult to find.\n\nThe women coming forward were lower-paid employees at the times of the alleged harassment. They were hospitality workers trained to be welcoming and smiling, and to always strive to say yes. Most of Mr. Wynn\u2019s accusers had behind-the-scenes roles like food and beverage servers, manicurists and receptionists, employees whom executives often view as easily replaceable.\n\nIt is a similar approach taken by Harvey Weinstein, who preyed on female actors when they had little power \u2014 before their Hollywood debuts or successes. What many powerful sexual harassers seem to know is that when women don\u2019t have the economic agency or career security to speak out, they often will choose not to.\n\nThere is a reported $7.5 million settlement between Mr. Wynn and his former manicurist, which prohibits her from speaking publicly about her experience. Many working-class and low-income women who never report misconduct are informally making similar deals, on a much smaller scale. Each day at work, they may decide to remain silent about sexual harassment for the sake of their families and their own sense of safety, in exchange for a much-needed paycheck from someone who has astronomical wealth.", "title": "Opinion | Steve Wynn and the Economic Inequality Behind #MeToo", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "One of the biggest problems in trying to convince people that they need to immunize against things like the flu is that they don\u2019t really feel the pressure. After all, for most people, the flu shot is an inconvenience, and they\u2019re unlikely to get the flu in a given year. So why bother? Quite a few readers expressed this view after my article \u201cWhy It\u2019s Still Worth Getting a Flu Shot\u201d on Thursday, including this one.\n\nI promise this is an honest question: Are people routinely being destroyed by the flu or something? (I mean, first I\u2019d ask, \u2018Is everyone but me simply vaccinated, and thus gifting me with herd immunity?\u2019 And so I did. My first Google search brought me to yearly C.D.C. flu-vaccine coverage statistics, and for the last four years, the percentage of flu-vaccinated adults has been in the low 40s. So... nope.) I\u2019m not a particularly healthy person \u2014 I get colds, sinus infections, etc. \u2014 but I just can\u2019t recall ever having had the flu, or at least *knowing* I had it. This seems to indicate that the flu is either 1) rare enough that it\u2019s possible for me to have been lucky forever (in which case it\u2019s fairly rare, apparently), or 2) not severe enough of an illness for me to have noticed experiencing it. Both lead me to conclude that skipping the vaccine is fine. I\u2019m just a regular idiot, presumably representing other regular idiots, amenable to changing their habits, but who haven\u2019t done so \u2014 not due to obstinance or contrarianism, but due to signals so mixed as to inspire ambivalence \u2014 and if this article can be said to have provided the \u2018why\u2019 its headline promises, unfortunately it hasn\u2019t provided the \u2018why\u2019 idiots like me need to hear: Why is the flu a big deal literally at all? \u2014 Chrystie, Los Angeles\n\nAlthough I devote some of my articles to telling you not to worry so much about some diseases or other risks, influenza is one thing you actually should worry about. It\u2019s terrible; it\u2019s also far too common.\n\nInfluenza, commonly called the flu, spreads easily. You can catch it from someone who coughs, sneezes or even talks to you from up to six feet away. You can infect others a day before you show any symptoms, and up to a week after becoming sick. Children can pass along the virus for even longer than that.\n\nInfluenza is not a reportable disease, so its prevalence must be estimated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes that, since 2010, between 9.2 million and 35.6 million people have come down with the flu in the United States each year. That means that in a bad year, more than one in every 10 people in the United States might get it.", "title": "Still Not Convinced You Need a Flu Shot?

She dodged several questions about how many of the so-called dreamers might be eligible for what she called a \u201cpermanent solution\u201d to their legal status, or how it might be put into effect, or when deportations of DACA recipients might begin.\n\n\u201cThey say they want to negotiate so much so that they were willing to shut down the government,\u201d Ms. Sanders said of Democrats in response to a specific question about when deportations would start.\n\nShe dodged a question about whether Mr. Trump had a role in dictating a web ad his campaign released over the weekend that said Democrats would be \u201ccomplicit\u201d in murders committed by undocumented immigrants. But she anticipated a full restoration of federal services by Tuesday morning.\n\nWhite House official Marc Short credited the president with impacting the tide turning by calling into the House Freedom Caucus meeting on Thursday. He then - mostly - held to a script that his aides prescribed that blamed Democrats. The White House consistently said they believed Democrats in red states would be forced to come around.\n\nBut aides at the White House, many of whom had never lived through a shut down before, were unsure how to spend their time. A group of press aides considered sending volunteers to the Mall to clean up after the women\u2019s rally on Saturday to highlight that the govenrment was shut, but they scuttled the plan when they found out that the Washington D.C. police were already doing it.\n\n\u201cPut this mess behind us.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell said on Monday morning that the Senate would move ahead with a scheduled procedural vote at noon on a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and he urged his colleagues to put an end to the shutdown.\n\n\u201cEvery day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defense spending or any of our other shared priorities,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program put in place by the Obama administration that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. McConnell reiterated a pledge he offered on Sunday night that he intended for the Senate to take up immigration legislation in February if the issue has not been resolved by then. A major question as senators seek to end the shutdown is what kind of commitment Mr. McConnell is willing to make regarding the consideration of legislation for the young immigrants, a central issue in the current impasse.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. McConnell pledged that the Senate\u2019s immigration debate would have \u201ca level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe very first step is ending the government shutdown,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Thomas Kaplan\n\nDemocrats wanted more than McConnell\u2019s word.\n\nModerate Senate Democrats Monday morning had sought a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell that the Senate would move to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Democrats were part of a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators working throughout the weekend to forge a compromise to reopen the government. Mr. McConnell signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their demands, saying from the Senate floor that he intended to move ahead with immigration legislation in February if the issue had not been resolved by then.\n\nBut on Monday, Democrats wanted more in exchange for the votes to end the shutdown.\n\n\u201cWell I think the first thing he needs to do is strengthen his statement from last night,\u201d said Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who votes with the Democrats. \u201c \u2018I intend.\u2019 I would much rather he say, \u2018I commit\u2019 or \u2018I will move.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs senators from the group shuffled in and out of leadership offices, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and another member of the group, expressed optimism that such a public statement by Mr. McConnell would be enough to win over enough Democrats to vote to end the shutdown. Some Democrats called on Mr. McConnell to delay a procedural vote schedule for noon.\n\nThe crux issue, it seemed, was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. Democrats have not forgiven Mr. McConnell for blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland for almost a year pending the election of a Republican to the White House. And Mr. McConnell\u2019s promises to Republican Senators Flake and Susan Collins of Maine for votes on health care and immigration in exchange for their support of the tax cut have yet to materialize.\n\nVideo\n\nHow much of the issue is that mistrust?\n\n\u201cUh, most of it,\u201d said Senator Joseph Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2014 Nicholas Fandos\n\nLiberal activists weren\u2019t ready to relent.\n\nA broad array of liberal advocacy groups \u2014 including unions and immigrants\u2019 rights activists \u2014 stepped up pressure on Democrats not to accede on Monday to any deal that does not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.\n\nThe advocates made clear that they do not trust Mr. McConnell.\n\n\u201cTo anyone considering such a move, let me clear, promises won\u2019t protect anyone from deportation, because delay means deportation for us,\u201d said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant rights group.\n\nModerate Senate Democrats on Monday were seeking a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell. But the groups remained skeptical. Vanita Gutpta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, harked back to Democrats\u2019 vote on Friday to block a spending bill that would have kept the government open, without protecting the Dreamers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear that the broad progressive movement is unified in saying the Democrats stood strong on Friday, they absolutely need to continue to do so,\u201d Ms. Gupta said. She added, \u201cSimply put a dream deferred right now is a dream denied for hundreds of thousands in our country.\u201d\n\nThe Sierra Club\u2019s executive director, Michael Brune, was blunt: \u201cEveryone in the Senate should have learned the lesson Senators Flake and Collins learned: you can\u2019t trust Mitch McConnell. His promises are empty from the start.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg\n\nThe White House comment line had an attitude.\n\nOn Monday morning, a telephone call to the White House comment line reminded callers that the federal government was shutdown and offered the Trump administration\u2019s explanation for why: \u201cUnfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,\u201d a recording said. \u201cDue to this obstruction the government is shut down.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

But this came after he\u2019d already been president about four years (having first finished out John F. Kennedy\u2019s term) and as the Vietnam War began to drag down his presidency.\n\nMr. Trump started in a far worse position than other incoming presidents. His initial approval rating was in the low-to-mid 40s, while most presidents enter with an approval rating over 60 percent. It was fair to speculate that his approval ratings would gradually rise with the benefit of a strong economy. Perhaps he would even benefit from low expectations, as many suspected he did during the presidential campaign.\n\nBut by now the economy would have been expected to lift his approval rating into the 50s, based on an analysis of presidential approval and economic data going back to 1950. This is despite the tendency for presidents\u2019 approval ratings to decline during their time in office. If the economy were to overcome Mr. Trump\u2019s unpopularity and send his approval ratings up, you would think we would have started to see signs of it.\n\nIt is certainly possible that the economy \u2014 or other good news \u2014 will still lift his ratings. But it seems just as likely that Mr. Trump will continue to feel the burden of his time in office. On average, a first-term president\u2019s approval rating drops by about a point per quarter after controlling for inflation and unemployment (and controlling for the large bump George W. Bush received after the Sept. 11 attacks).\n\nMr. Trump still has some of the advantages that helped him win despite low favorability ratings in 2016. He appears to maintain the support of his base and fairly high levels of Republican unity. Indeed, his favorability ratings are still higher than they were in the weeks heading into the 2016 election, when they were in the mid 30s. Many pollsters aren\u2019t asking the favorability question anymore, but those that do find it roughly equal to his approval ratings (high 30s).", "title": "Strong Economies Lift Presidents.

(Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied \u201cany allegations of nonconsensual sex.\u201d) But Mr. Cooper also said that the fallen mogul\u2019s impact on Sundance had long been overstated.\n\n\u201cNobody on the ground here ever gave him a crown,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cHe was just the loudest and the media followed and built him up.\u201d\n\nTom Bernard, the co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics, who has attended Sundance since its inception and shepherded such celebrated indie films as \u201cWhiplash\u201d and the current Oscar contender \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d said in an interview that the festival had matured and diversified in ways that the news media often ignored. \u201cSundance coverage tends to play into a mystique that just isn\u2019t true anymore,\u201d Mr. Bernard said.\n\nSundance\u2019s anything-goes aura was established in the 1990s and the 2000s, when independent film reigned as the epitome of cool. Fueled by the DVD boom, almost all of the big studios created specialty divisions and poured money into Sundance distribution deals, leading to all-night bidding wars in luxury condos around Park City. Marketers for fashion labels, cellphone companies and vodka brands scrambled to capitalize on the heat, setting up gifting suites that attracted celebrities with no connection to the festival.

A newly implemented Sundance code of conduct states that the festival can kick out anyone engaging in \u201charassment, discrimination, sexism and threatening or disrespectful behavior.\u201d A lot of gray hair can be seen on the festival shuttle buses; people who started coming here in their 20s are now in their 40s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for those bidding wars, this year\u2019s Sundance opened on a quiet note. By Sunday afternoon, four days into the 11-day festival, only one significant distribution deal had been struck. Bleecker Street, founded in 2014 with backing from Manoj Bhargava, the 5-Hour Energy drink entrepreneur, and 30West, a company financed by the Texas billionaire Dan Friedkin, teamed up to pay roughly $5 million for distribution rights to \u201cColette,\u201d a costume drama starring Keira Knightley as the French novelist Sidonie Gabrielle Colette. (Amazon was also a bidder.)\n\n\u201cThere are two different worlds intersecting, one that is traditional and focused on ticket sales and one that only cares about signing up more subscribers,\u201d said Peter Broderick, a film distribution strategist. \u201cTraditional distributors have a lot of challenges. So many are looking backward \u2014 what has worked for us before. At the same time, they are being priced out of the market for the better films.\u201d\n\nDistributors, including relatively new players like A24, Neon and Annapurna, may be erring on the side of caution. Some sales agents cited the dampening effect of \u201cPatti Cake$,\u201d a rap-infused drama that sold to Fox Searchlight for an estimated $10 million last year and ended up taking in just $800,148 in theaters. But the mix of movies this time around could also be a factor; some distributors complained that films that premiered early in the festival were flawed, including the opening-night selection, \u201cBlindspotting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as big of a marketplace for finished films as it was in the \u201990s and early 2000s,\u201d said Mr. Bernard of Sony Pictures Classics. \u201cBut it\u2019s still an enormous marketplace for talent: Casting people looking for actors, producers looking for directors and cinematographers.\u201d (One example from recent years: After gaining attention at Sundance for quirky films like \u201cHunt for the Wilderpeople,\u201d Taika Waititi went on to direct \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d for Disney.)\n\nThis year\u2019s primary festival lineup \u2014 122 feature-length films culled from 3,901 submissions \u2014 includes many movies that examine race. \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d starring Daveed Diggs, best known for winning a Tony for \u201cHamilton,\u201d is a raucous, hip-hop-infused story of racism, stereotypes and gentrification.

Alito Jr. said there had been several questionable rulings in the case, suggesting that the precise problem in it was unlikely to recur. It was not clear, he said, that Mr. McCoy was competent to stand trial. It was possible that the trial judge should have allowed Mr. English to withdraw from the case, allowed Mr. McCoy more time to find another lawyer or allowed him to represent himself.\n\nIn the end, Mr. English\u2019s trial strategy failed. Mr. McCoy was convicted and sentenced to death. He appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court, saying his lawyer had betrayed him. The court ruled against him.\n\n\u201cGiven the circumstances of this crime and the overwhelming evidence incriminating the defendant,\u201d the court said, \u201cadmitting guilt in an attempt to avoid the imposition of the death penalty appears to constitute reasonable trial strategy.\u201d\n\nThe decision relied on a unanimous 2004 ruling from the United States Supreme Court in Florida v. Nixon, which said lawyers need not obtain their clients\u2019 express consent before conceding guilt in a capital case.

Instead, except in emergencies, officials would need to obtain a court order to query the repository for an American\u2019s information.\n\nThe amendment is chiefly sponsored by Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan, and Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California. It would substitute in the text of another bill, dubbed the USA Rights Act, which would extend Section 702 by only four years.\n\nThe bipartisan coalition backing overhaul efforts \u2014 which includes some of the most conservative and most liberal members of the House \u2014 say that change is necessary to uphold the meaning and substance of Fourth Amendment privacy rights in light of 21st-century communications technology and surveillance powers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There are also lawmakers of both parties \u2014 backed by House leadership \u2014 who oppose the amendment.\n\nAides to Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, distributed a one-page sheet this week denouncing the amendment as imposing \u201cunnecessarily severe requirements\u201d that would endanger Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nComplicating matters, the base bill backed by Mr. Nunes contains a gesture toward a court-order requirement, too. It would apply only under narrow circumstances: if F.B.I. agents have already opened a criminal investigation into the American whose information they are searching for, and if the agents have no national-security rationale.\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff of California, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the warrant requirement in the base bill would be sufficient to \u201cprevent the database from being used as a general tool to gather evidence and introduce it in court in cases that have nothing to do with terrorism.\u201d\n\nBut the base bill would still permit routine queries for Americans\u2019 information without warrants. Its warrant requirement would not apply to national-security-related queries by a range of agencies, including the C.I.A., the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. Nor would it apply to F.B.I. queries when agents are merely pursuing tips about an American but do not yet have enough evidence of wrongdoing to open a criminal investigation.\n\nIn short, the base bill would give greater privacy protections to criminal suspects than to people the F.B.I. has no solid basis for thinking had committed any wrongdoing.\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, dismissed the base bill\u2019s limited warrant provision on Wednesday as \u201cfake reform\u201d that was really just \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, in 2014 and 2015, the House approved amendments to appropriations bills that would have required warrants to search the 702 repository for Americans\u2019 information, but they were rejected in negotiations with the Senate. When the idea came up again in 2016, shortly after the terrorist attack on a nightclub in Orlando, Fla., the House voted it down.\n\nAnother significant difference between the base bill and the amendment centers on the N.S.A.\u2019s old practice of scanning Americans\u2019 international emails and other internet messages and collecting those that mention a foreign target \u2014 but are neither to nor from that target. The technique came to light amid the Snowden leaks and ended last year.\n\nSuch collection is technically complex, and the N.S.A. shut it down after repeatedly running into trouble adhering to limits imposed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. But the agency wants to retain the flexibility to turn it back on. The base bill would permit it to do so after briefing the congressional intelligence committees. The amendment would ban the practice.", "title": "Surveillance and Privacy Debate Reaches Pivotal Moment in Congress", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"]}

When I booked that cottage online, I sifted through the reviews, trying to glean whether the location was as pristine as the pictures suggested. I didn\u2019t spend much time wondering how those depictions made the host feel \u2014 I just wanted to make sure the place wasn\u2019t a dump. I understand that hosts want reassurances, too.

When such a critique comes at the end of a long and intimate experience like a stay in an Airbnb house, you can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s true. Maybe I am an incompetent housekeeper.\n\nStay in someone\u2019s home long enough and you feel like you know the person, even if you have never meet.

I spotted a box of art supplies in the closet, and wondered how long she had spent painting that seascape in the bedroom.\n\nIn text messages, I told her that we enjoyed the house and let her know when I noticed ants by the front door. Her replies were curt, but she gave me directions for how to address the issue, so I didn\u2019t hold it against her.

Since the process is double-blind, guests and hosts can only see each other\u2019s reviews after both have written them. You cannot revise what you wrote in light of new information from the other side, and no wonder. Like in the aftermath of a heated argument, I replayed the words I had written, imagining what I would have said if I had let loose \u2014 I\u2019m talking about that ant trail and the scant cleaning supplies (hello! a bottle of Lysol certainly would have helped get the job done).\n\nSince I couldn\u2019t rewrite my own assessment, I instead fired off a response to hers, in defense of my efforts. I hit send and my response appeared publicly below the one she had left of me. It didn\u2019t take long for the doubt to creep in: Maybe, by responding, I looked not only messy, but crazy, too.

Other Airbnb guests have also felt burned by a harsh critique. Alrica Goldstein, 42, a book editor in Reno, Nev., was shocked by a bad review she received after staying in an apartment in Kuala Lumpur with her family in August 2016. \u201cI was terribly offended,\u201d she said.\n\nThe apartment was left in a sorry state, with a dirty stove and toilet, according to the host. But Ms. Goldstein had not seen the criticism coming. The host had stopped by on checkout day and stayed to chat for a while, never voicing any concerns. \u201cI feel like when you stay in an Airbnb, it\u2019s a community. There\u2019s a give and take and trust,\u201d she said. In this case, Ms. Goldstein felt the circle of trust had been broken.\n\nHow much does a bad review harm you? It\u2019s hard to say. But I suspect that naysayers have a way of sounding like soothsayers. \u201cI see just one negative review, and it makes me wonder,\u201d said Turner Wright, the digital media manager for AirbnbHell.com, a website that chronicles Airbnb miseries. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the real one.\u201d\n\nMaybe Mr. Wright was right. Maybe I would be shunned. When it came time to book another stay a few months later, this time in Northampton, Mass., I admit, my heart was racing. \u201cWhat if they reject us?\u201d my son asked. To improve our chances, I wrote a witty note, one that would paint a picture of a responsible and charming little family. Maybe the owner would fall for it. The host \u2014 a superhost, in Airbnb speak, or someone considered experienced and a role model for other hosts \u2014 accepted my request within minutes. I had dodged a blacklist!\n\nThese reviews are meant to make us better versions of ourselves \u2014 next time that stove will sparkle \u2014 but maybe they just make us more neurotic.\n\nWhen we arrived in Northampton after a long drive, tired and disheveled, our host let us into the apartment. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about cleaning up when you leave,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\n\nI wanted to believe that she said this to be helpful, but I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she really said it because she knew I was a slob.", "title": "Surviving a Bad Airbnb Review", "authors": ["Ronda Kaysen", "Right At Home"]}

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "If you keep swatting at a mosquito, will it leave you alone?\n\nSome scientists think so. But it depends.\n\nSome blood meals are worth a mosquito risking its life. But if there\u2019s a more attractive or accepting alternative to feed from, a mosquito may move on to that someone or something instead. That\u2019s because if you keep trying and missing, the mosquito may learn to associate your swatting vibrations with your scent, a study published Thursday in Current Biology suggests. And it just may remember: This is not a person who will tolerate me.\n\nMosquitoes, which transmit diseases like Zika, Malaria and West Nile, do not just bite anything, said Jeffrey Riffell, a neuroecologist at The University of Washington who led the study. They prefer people over other animals, and some people over others. Attraction depends on how a person looks, smells or acts. But when a feeding situation isn\u2019t favorable, a mosquito can switch preferences.\n\nTo find out more about mosquito biting preferences, Dr. Riffell and his colleagues put mosquitoes and different odors into a vortex that creates vibrations similar to those created when a hand swats a forearm, but misses. In just 15 minutes, the mosquitoes learned to associate the odors with the vibrations. Some once attractive odors became threatening signals that the mosquitoes learned to avoid. Rather than approach them again, the mosquitoes chose to approach a new odor instead. For at least 24 hours, they retained this memory.\n\n[READ: Mosquitoes Really Do Prefer Some People Over Others]\n\nRemembering the smell of a particularly defensive individual with a propensity to swat is important for a bug\u2019s survival. One good smack to a mosquito stuck biting, and splat. Knowing who smells like a splat-maker means mosquitoes can seek out potentially less risky hosts instead. Dr. Riffell thinks learning about odors helps drives these decisions.\n\nPhoto\n\nMosquito senses are tuned for locating perfect hosts. From far away, carbon dioxide from our breath draws them in and triggers their visual system to seek out high contrast objects for inspection. Up close, mosquitoes detect odor, temperature, sweat and even the presence of alcohol or pregnancy (pregnant women emit more carbon dioxide). If signs of a good host don\u2019t check out, the mosquito doesn\u2019t bite.\n\nBut just how the insect processes the more than 200 chemicals in a person\u2019s scent signature isn\u2019t fully understood. One thing that helps, the researchers determined, is dopamine, a chemical in the brain that contributes to learning in humans, honeybees and other animals. Dr. Riffell thinks dopamine works by helping mosquitoes pick out an individual\u2019s scent signature from other odors.\n\nPhoto\n\nDopamine travels through the brain and binds to receptors like a key in a lock, opening doors and creating connections between nerve cells that can drive behavior or thinking. When the researchers edited mosquito genes to remove these dopamine receptors, the insects lost their ability to learn. They also lost activity in the area of their brain associated with olfaction.\n\n[READ: How to Deal With All the Bites and Stings of Summer]\n\nUnderstanding more about how mosquitoes process information and select hosts can help people develop more targeted ways to control disease transmission, like combining traps or lures with bed nets and insecticides. Another possibility once more is known, said Dr. Riffell, would be to target dopamine and impair learning in mosquitoes with insecticides or genetic tools. While a dopamine-impaired mosquito may not recognize your scent, it also may not realize swatting is avoidable.\n\nUntil then, Dr. Riffell says: \u201cIf there are mosquitoes around and you\u2019re shooing them away (and you\u2019re mean) you could encourage your friend to talk a lot and move around and sweat, and they\u2019ll probably avoid you and go to your friend.\u201d", "title": "Swatting at Mosquitoes May Help You Avoid Bites, Even if You Miss", "authors": ["Joanna Klein"]}

And it is resisting even the small political compromises that Russia says it is trying to wrest from Mr. Assad.\n\nNo one expected Sochi to produce a peace agreement. Instead, Sochi was supposed to broaden the range of Syrian voices in the talks, and it did draw in some civilian, nonviolent dissidents and officially tolerated opposition groups based in Damascus.\n\nPerhaps the most consequential negotiation in Sochi was between the United Nations and Russia. The United Nations agreed that its Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, would attend, lending Sochi gravitas, if Russia would stop trying to make Sochi, not Geneva, the site of discussions for rewriting Syria\u2019s Constitution.\n\nOn Tuesday, the issue was finessed, with the Sochi delegates proposing a list of committee members that can be approved only in Geneva. But if that agreement refocuses the Geneva talks on rewriting the Constitution instead of replacing the government, Russia will have scored another point for Mr. Assad.\n\nThe way Sochi played out also showed how far-off a real, productive debate between Syria\u2019s combatants remains.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDelegates sent from Damascus were approved by the security services, participants said, and most were loyalists, from unions and other groups controlled by the ruling Baath Party. Even tolerated, Damascus-based dissidents \u2014 allowed to go as a counterbalance against the armed opposition \u2014 were given strict orders by Syrian officials on how to act at the talks.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo days before the conference, hundreds of delegates \u2014 loyalist and Damascus-based opposition alike \u2014 filed into the Damascus Opera House, where a senior security official and Syria\u2019s foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, gave them instructions. One participant said the officials spoke like teachers to students, giving lessons on Syrian patriotism. And they did not entirely toe Russia\u2019s line.\n\nThe Syrian officials, according to participants, gave the delegates red lines: no discussion of writing a new constitution, only modifying the one adopted in 2012. (The United Nations, Russia and others have all called for a new constitution.) No discussion of the country\u2019s army or security services. (United Nations principles call for reforms to make them abide by human rights and rule of law.) And above all, no discussion of changing the president.\n\nThe pan-Arab newspaper Al Sharq al-Awsat reported one additional detail: They were also told not to shake hands with opposition figures arriving from abroad.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But upon arrival, they were confronted with banners emblazoned with the conference logo that featured only the current Syrian flag and not the older Syrian one they have adopted as a symbol of revolution.\n\nThey refused to exit the airport.\n\nThe delegation, including Lt. Col. Ahmad Saud, an army defector and rebel commander once backed by the United States, ended up stranded in the arrivals area.\n\nIn Syria, military tensions flared between Iran and Turkey, two of the Sochi talks\u2019 sponsors. Iranian-backed militias were said to have shelled a Turkish convoy that was operating inside Syria with Russian permission.\n\nPhoto\n\nAirstrikes by the Syrian government and Russia continued.\n\n\u201cSochi\u2019s white doves\u201d was what Moaz al-Shami called the warplanes flying over his town, Saraqeb, where a market and hospital were hit Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cRussia is telling us, accept Bashar,\u201d he said, in a video of the destruction. \u201cAccept Sochi or you\u2019ll be destroyed.\u201d\n\nOne of the delegates to the Sochi conference was Mihrac Ural, a Syrian militia leader accused of inciting pro-government forces who killed scores of civilians, including children, in a raid on the Syrian coastal towns of Baniyas and Bayda in 2013.\n\nPhotographed with him was Qadri Jamil, a prominent delegate and member of a tolerated opposition party who once served in Mr. Assad\u2019s cabinet.\n\nIn perhaps the conference\u2019s sole moment of spontaneous public debate, Mr. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, was interrupted as he claimed in a speech that \u201cSyria, with Russian air support, managed to destroy the terrorist forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop your aircraft from bombing the Syrian people!\u201d a man shouted.

As a corporate raider in the 1980s, Mr. Pickens \u2014 along with men like Carl C. Icahn and Michael Milken \u2014 helped develop a shrewd new playbook for making money. He would take a small stake in a public company, call on it to slash expenses and return money to investors, and often pressure the company to sell itself. He was Gordon Gekko before \u201cWall Street,\u201d and his influence was profound.\n\nThat philosophy now shapes the investment decisions of big institutional investors and shareholder activists alike. Depending on whom you ask, it is responsible for the creation of a huge amount of wealth for a great many people, or for a reckless short-term perspective that is widening income inequality and destroying jobs. In either case, it happened, at least in part, because of T.

So I gave a lot of thought to what I needed to be doing, what I needed to be focused on.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim had worked closely with Mr. Bharara for about four years, initially as his counsel, then as chief of the office\u2019s criminal division and, in July 2015, becoming his deputy.\n\nHis first major public act was the March 16, 2017, announcement that his office was closing the de Blasio campaign fund-raising inquiry without bringing charges, a decision reached before Mr. Bharara\u2019s firing.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Kim said at the time that his office had examined several instances in which the mayor and \u201cothers acting on his behalf\u201d solicited donations from people who sought official favors from the city, \u201cafter which the mayor made or directed inquires to relevant city agencies on behalf of those donors.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio, responding to Mr. Kim\u2019s statement (and to a separate letter by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which had also investigated and declined to bring charges), said he, his staff and colleagues had \u201cacted in a manner that was legal and appropriate and ethical throughout.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat has been confirmed by the results of this investigation,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nMr. Kim, in the recent interviews, differed with Mr. de Blasio\u2019s synopsis, saying the office\u2019s conclusion was \u201cvery limited,\u201d based only on whether the provable evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cWe do not ask the question, \u2018Is the conduct ethical or appropriate?\u2019\u201d Mr. Kim said.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs a private citizen, I certainly hope that a decision by a prosecutor not to bring criminal charges is not the standard that we should expect from our leaders.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim departs as his office begins trying a series of corruption defendants, starting on Monday with Joseph Percoco, a former top adviser and close friend to Gov.

Turkish officials claimed the evidence had been fabricated by Gulenists, a movement banned in Turkey as a terrorist organization. Turkey even opened an investigation into Mr. Kim and Mr. Bharara, who had announced the charges in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe attacks from Turkey based on wild conspiracy theories were frankly ludicrous,\u201d Mr. Kim said.\n\nHe said he was glad the case could be presented in a full-blown trial, with Turkish reporters and crowds of spectators in attendance.\n\n\u201cIt was important for this evidence to come out in a public courtroom for everyone to assess,\u201d he said, \u201cto show to the public and others who are beyond our borders who are skeptical of our motivations, of our system, to see it work, including the public in Turkey.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim noted that Mr. Zarrab\u2019s guilty plea was critical because it validated the government\u2019s case and showed a key conspirator \u201caccepting responsibility for his crimes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe pleaded guilty because he was guilty,\u201d Mr. Kim added. \u201cHe was not able to buy his way out of these charges.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim noted that the prosecutors from his office, which has long been called the \u201cSovereign District\u201d for the way it jealously guards its independence from Washington, were shown to be professionals \u201cwho were not going to be intimidated and who were just doing their jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we realized,\u201d Mr. Kim said, \u201cwas that independence meant more than just resisting interference from other parts of the U.S. government, but also having the ability to withstand criticism and attacks from anywhere, including foreign governments.\u201d", "title": "Taking On Terrorists and a Turkish Scandal, Beneath a Fleeting Spotlight", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser"]}

These crowdsourced trips usually top out at $2,000 a person, a fraction of the $8,000 or more per hour it can cost for a traditional charter. \u201cMy goal is to make private jet flying less elitist,\u201d Mr. Petrossov said.\n\nBlade, which doesn\u2019t require membership, also sells flights, but only from December through mid-March and on one route, between Westchester County Airport (with or without a helicopter transfer from Manhattan) and its own terminal in Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport. From $1,285 each way, fliers travel on a Bombardier commercial jet retrofitted with 16 seats and receive an array of amenities such as catered meals from Dean & Deluca as well as iPad Pros loaded with first-run movies; they also get accommodations for the weekend at Faena Miami, a luxury beachfront hotel.\n\nThe Miami route made its debut two years ago and has been so popular, said company founder Rob Wiesenthal, that this season, the flights will be offered four days a week, instead of the two days that they previously were.\n\nPaul Cappuccio, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., and is the general counsel for Time Warner, flew to Miami on Blade most weekends last winter and plans to do the same this year. \u201cIt\u2019s such a relaxed way to fly, an elegant experience and so hassle-free,\u201d he said. While not necessarily budget-friendly, Mr. Cappuccio said that Blade hits the sweet spot on price. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that much more than a full-fare first-class ticket, but a small fraction of what it would cost to fly on a chartered private jet,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for travelers who only want their own chartered plane without having to pay an exorbitant price, there are options like JetSuite\u2019s \u201cSuiteDeals.\u201d The company\u2019s primary business is private jet charters for hourly rates of between $4,000 and $7,000 while \u201cSuiteDeals\u201d are sales of flights called empty legs \u2014 routes that jets are scheduled to fly on without any passengers.\n\nMeredith Broder, an adviser with the Villanova, Pa., travel company Avenue Two Travel, said that empty leg flights have changed the private jet game. \u201cRather than have the plane fly empty, air companies or private jet brokers try to sell that route at a discount,\u201d she said. \u201cThis strategy helps with fuel costs and puts private jet flying within reach to people who wouldn\u2019t normally be able to afford this luxury and convenience.\u201d\n\nMs. Broder frequently books private jets for clients and gets a weekly list from several private jet companies of empty leg availability for the coming week (other agents specializing in private jet travel also get similar lists). Recent flights included an $8,500 trip from Naples to Cleveland on a Beechjet 400A, a plane that seats seven people, and a $6,500 trip from Scottsdale, Ariz., to Colorado Springs on a Learjet 45XR, accommodating eight fliers.", "title": "Taking a Private Jet Could Be More Affordable Than You Think", "authors": []}

Commander Nangyalay, who like many Afghans uses only one name, said the attack started at 2:30 a.m. and fighting continued for two hours, leaving at least six soldiers and two police officers dead. In addition, the militants briefly occupied the base, destroying a Humvee vehicle and looting mortars and other weapons before fleeing, Commander Nangyalay said.\n\nThe Taliban\u2019s spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said that the group was responsible. He added that the insurgents had used a \u201cspecial forces\u201d unit to carry out the attack, which he claimed had killed 20 soldiers. Such casualty claims are often inflated.

Egyptian religious leaders close to the government refused to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, and Egypt submitted a United Nations Security Council resolution demanding a reversal of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. (The United States vetoed the resolution, although the General Assembly adopted a similar one, over American objections, days later.)\n\nKing Salman of Saudi Arabia, arguably the most influential Arab state, also publicly denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nAt the same time, though, the kingdom had already quietly signaled its acquiescence or even tacit approval of the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. Days before Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement, the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, privately urged the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, to accept a radically curtailed vision of statehood without a capital in East Jerusalem, according to Palestinian, Arab and European officials who have heard Mr. Abbas\u2019s version of events.\n\nPhoto\n\nSaudi Arabia publicly disputed those reports.\n\nThe hosts Captain Kholi called all heeded his advice, and most other voices in the state-owned and pro-government news media across the Arab world were also strikingly muted, even unemotional, about the status of Jerusalem.

We have enough on our plate as you know.\u201d\n\nThe Egyptian military has struggled for more than four years to try to defeat a simmering militant Islamist insurgence centered in the North Sinai, and Egyptian officials have sometimes accused Hamas, the militant Palestinian group that controls the adjacent Gaza Strip, of abetting violence against the government of Egypt.\n\n\u201cThe point that is dangerous for us is the intifada issue,\u201d Captain Kholi explained. \u201cAn intifada would not serve Egypt\u2019s national security interests because an intifada would revive the Islamists and Hamas. Hamas would be reborn once more.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, later on, Jerusalem won\u2019t be much different from Ramallah.

It got old,\u201d Mr. Megahed told his viewers about the issue of Jerusalem.\n\nIn his conversation with Mr. Megahed, however, Captain Kholi added an extra flourish.

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The last time that Congress approved a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code, in 1986, it created a tax credit meant to encourage the private sector to invest in affordable housing. It has grown into a $9 billion-a-year social program that has funded the construction of some three million apartments for low-income residents.\n\nBut the Republican tax plan approved last month amounts to a vast cutback, making it much less likely that such construction will continue apace. Because the tax rate for corporations has been lowered, the value of the credits \u2014 which corporations get in return for their investments \u2014 is also lower.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest shock to the affordable-housing system since the Great Recession,\u201d said Michael Novogradac, managing partner of Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco.\n\nAccording to an analysis by his firm, the new tax law will reduce the growth of subsidized affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next decade, compounding an existing shortage.", "title": "Tax Overhaul Is a Blow to Affordable Housing Efforts", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "The new plan, like any tax loophole, is simple in theory and complex in execution, but it could work more or less like this: Paramus, for example, would start a charitable trust and a taxpayer who pays $20,000 in annual property taxes would contribute that exact amount to the charitable trust.\n\nThe charitable trust would then allocate the $20,000 to various entities \u2014 the schools, the police department and other agencies \u2014 as though the donation were a tax payment. The town would then credit the taxpayer for 90 to 95 percent of the donation, making it nearly entirely deductible. (The town could factor in administrative costs to lessen a donation\u2019s value.)\n\nBut building a town-run trust to take the place of a local tax collection process is relatively uncharted waters \u2014 for one thing such a change in municipal governance would require approval by each town\u2019s local governing body.\n\n\u201cOur attorneys are already going through the plan,\u201d said Richard LaBarbiera, the mayor of Paramus.\n\nStill, in New Jersey, which has the highest property taxes in the country and where municipalities rely on them to pay for schools, libraries, police departments, fire departments and other essential functions, the three towns want to alleviate what would be a major burden on taxpayers.\n\nGovernor-elect Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat who has made finding ways to lessen the impact of federal tax plan a high priority, supports the towns\u2019 efforts.\n\n\u201cWe are all in on this,\u201d Mr. Murphy said on Friday. \u201cNot just this \u2014 we\u2019ll continue to pursue all available means, legal, constitutionally, tax code and otherwise. But this one, we believe, has real legs and real precedent.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Trump administration seems keenly aware about efforts to come up with new loopholes.\n\n\u201cI understand what they are trying to do for their cities and their states and their taxpayers,\u201d Gary Cohn, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, said in an interview on Friday with Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe at the federal government still have to collect revenue so we\u2019re going to have to evaluate what decisions they make in terms of what it does for overall collections at the federal level and the federal tax system.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is not clear that using charitable donations to fund government operations is actually feasible.\n\nThe conservative Tax Foundation released a report suggesting that such a maneuver could violate I.R.S. rules. The reason is that the donation is being given purely for the financial benefit of the donor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Alabama, residents can receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit when they donate to an approved organization that funds education scholarships. In California, residents and local businesses can receive a 50-percent state tax credit for donations to a state-run fund that raises money to help students pay for college.\n\nThe move by New Jersey communities comes as confusion and frustration have spread across the country among anxious taxpayers.\n\nLast week, thousands of taxpayers scrambled to prepay their 2018 property taxes believing they could deduct them under the rules of the old tax code. But an I.R.S. advisory warned that not everyone would be eligible to write off property taxes from this year.\n\nIn response, Representative Leonard Lance, a Republican from New Jersey, said he planned to introduce legislation that would ensure that homeowners who prepaid their 2018 property taxes would be able to deduct the full amount, rather than just the portion of their 2018 property taxes that they had already been assessed.\n\n\u201cIt will not affect a lot of people, but it will affect those who paid their 2018 property taxes in 2017,\u201d Mr. Lance said.\n\nThe lack of clarity over the tax plan could lead to a wave of litigation, and state treasurers are anticipating that Congress will work to clarify murky parts of the law. In the meantime, state officials have been approaching tax experts for help in finding ways to diminish the tax burdens on residents since the federal tax plan now allows taxpayers to deduct a total of $10,000 in state and local taxes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Washington, Congress is likely to face pressure to find ways to close new loopholes, but Democrats, who were shut out of the process of rewriting the tax code, are unlikely to help Republicans do anything that would harm taxpayers in blue states seeking relief. This will be an especially fraught challenge in a midterm election year and it puts Republicans in the awkward position of trying to regulate state tax systems, despite the party orthodoxy that states know best how to regulate themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a classic federalism conflict,\u201d said Itai Grinberg, a Georgetown University law professor and former tax policy official at the Treasury Department.\n\nIn New Jersey, Mr. Gottheimer came up with the idea for a municipal charitable trust after a bipartisan bill he sponsored with Mr. Lance to save the state and local tax deductions never made it out of committee.\n\nBut the hope among all the Democrats involved in developing and promoting the donation idea was that the issue of taxes and helping New Jersey taxpayers would transcend politics.\n\n\u201cThis is not partisan,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThis is a smart versus not smart.\u201d", "title": "Taxes as Charity?

Ms. Wortham writes:\n\nA few days ago, when I heard that several male actors were joining some actresses in their plans to wear all-black to the Golden Globes in solidarity with those who have experienced sexual misconduct, I felt the old flames of anger reignite. There is something unsettling about how little these celebrities have to lose by taking these stances. They aren\u2019t risking financial ruin, nor are they vulnerable to violence, as is the norm for most who take a bold position. It feels completely privileged, and a little complicit, to still participate in the larger system that has condoned sexual violence in their industry.

He\u2019s going to say what he wants to say. I can\u2019t do nothing about it.\u201d When asked by those same reporters if he\u2019s still behind Walton, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll play for anybody,\u201d adding: \u201cMy job is to play basketball. I don\u2019t decide who coaches.\u201d\n\nMaybe Lonzo Ball feels he can\u2019t do any better than the Lakers have in trying to stop his father from spouting off to the media, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from making it clear he doesn\u2019t agree with him or at least pushing harder to defuse the situation. The surrender in his voice, along with the tepid support he voiced for Walton, inevitably leaves the impression that he feels the same way as LaVar Ball \u2014 or, worse, that he fed him those opinions.\n\nThe Lakers knew what they were getting into when they selected Ball with the No. 2 overall pick in last June\u2019s draft, but this is not a great look for a player who has been in the league for 39 games and isn\u2019t exactly having a Magic-esque rookie season. Ball\u2019s player efficiency rating is 11.67, well below the league\u2019s average of 15.0.\n\nFrom the moment Lonzo Ball arrived in the N.B.A., there has been no shortage of attention paid to his plight, given the target he has become so early in his career because of his father\u2019s chatter and the relentless social media scrutiny he endures.

Some of the assistance came from well beyond the county line: the most seriously wounded were flown to a hospital in Nashville, about 100 miles away.\n\n\u201cWe see major incidents on the news and we say, \u2018Thank God it didn\u2019t happen here,\u2019 \u201d the sheriff said. \u201cYesterday, that has changed for those of us in Marshall County.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe attack on Tuesday was at least the 11th episode of gunfire on school property in the United States since Jan. 1, and the worsening pace and intensity of shootings in schoolhouses and on college campuses in recent years have left educators and law enforcement officials shaken. About two-thirds of American school districts conducted active-shooter drills last year, federal officials reported.\n\nTraining for school shootings has become a standard feature of police work, law enforcement officials and criminologists say. Even small departments, facing the threat of a shooting where backup might not reach the scene quickly, have made such training mandatory in the years since 26 children and staff members were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012.\n\nA scarcity of trauma care capacity can present another challenge. According to the American Trauma Society, there was just one Level I trauma center \u2014 one that is \u201ccapable of providing total care for every aspect of injury\u201d \u2014 within 100 miles of Marshall County High School in Benton, and that one only barely.\n\n\u201cI would be really scared if I had a mass shooting in a rural area where there was no access to a trauma center,\u201d said Dr. Richard S. Miller, the chief of trauma and surgical critical care at that one center, the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it on a daily basis, you lose that pattern recognition and that competence to take care of something. These rural areas, they don\u2019t see this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nIn crises that turn on action in seconds or minutes, not hours or days, local doctors and medics on the scene are still vital. Dr. Miller said that on Tuesday, emergency officials in Kentucky had established clear airways and applied tourniquets to the wounded at the high school, long before the helicopters had carried any of them to the trauma center.\n\nOne boy, who had been shot in the head, died at the hospital. Another, who had been shot in the belly and was in a life-threatening hemorrhagic shock when he arrived at Vanderbilt, remained \u201cvery sick\u201d on Wednesday, Dr. Miller said, while three other patients from Benton were doing \u201cextremely well.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, after flying a student to a hospital in a Bell 206 helicopter, Mr. Johnson, the pilot, flew back to base in neighboring Graves County.

It\u2019s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets.\n\nTogether, the hedge fund and teachers\u2019 pension giant want Apple to take responsibility for how its products are affecting children. In a letter to the board on Saturday, the activists \u2014 which include the pop star Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, as advisers \u2014 cited research that suggests heavy smartphone use is linked to a rise of depression and suicide among teenagers and young adults.\n\nThe popularity of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago, has spread to an ever-younger demographic, leaving educators and researchers scrambling to understand how it may be affecting children\u2019s development.

{"date": "2018-01-28 00:00:00", "text": "With the deadline for the new rules now just a few months away, Silicon Valley\u2019s tech behemoths have been scrambling to get ready. Facebook and Google have deployed hundreds of people to make sense of the regulations. Many of the companies have overhauled how they give users access to their own privacy settings. Some have redesigned certain products that suck up too much user data. And in some cases, companies have removed products entirely from the European market because they would violate the new privacy rules.\n\n\u201cEvery person who works for us has, in some way, been involved in preparing the company for G.D.P.R.,\u201d said Doug Kramer, general counsel of CloudFlare, an internet performance and security company based in San Francisco that has tightened its data storage and processing practices. \u201cG.D.P.R. is going to introduce very fundamental changes to the way the internet works for everyone.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe rush of activity is a reminder of how Europe has set the regulatory standard in reining in the immense power of tech giants, while other places \u2014 including the United States \u2014 have largely taken a noninterventionist stance. The G.D.P.R. rules were approved in late 2015 after tech companies like Facebook ran into problems over data protection with national privacy watchdogs in various European countries.\n\nEuropean officials said the coming rules are forcing American tech giants to take a step back.\n\n\u201cThere has not been any pushback from American companies,\u201d said V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality. \u201cIf anything, they seem very eager to understand how exactly they can comply with the regulation.\u201d\n\nOfficials from Facebook, Google and other companies said in interviews that they had been working to give people more control over what data they share anyway. In the past, many of the companies fought back in European courts over privacy rules and declined to offer certain products in the region rather than redesign them to meet privacy standards.\n\nThe coming of the new rules has nonetheless pushed a huge scale of internal change, Gilad Golan, Google\u2019s director for security and data protection, said at a San Francisco event last month to introduce new security features. \u201cWhen G.D.P.R. goes into effect in 2018, we will be ready,\u201d he said.\n\nThe biggest challenge, he said, has been preparing for the regulation\u2019s mandate that people in Europe must have control over how their digital data is organized. Google, he said, has had to go through each of its services \u2014 from Gmail to its Cloud storage services \u2014 to comply. Since the new rules require individuals to give their consent before a company accesses data, for example, Google has had to redesign many consent agreements, as well as change underlying technology to make it easier to remove someone\u2019s data.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Sunday, the company began offering a new privacy center that puts user security settings on one page instead of dispersing them across different sections of the social network. While the company said the changes was separate from its preparations for the new European regulations, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, connected the two in a speech in Brussels last week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new privacy center would give Facebook a \u201cvery good foundation to meet all the requirements of the G.D.P.R. and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.\n\nRob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, said the social network has also held a series of \u201cDesign Jams\u201d where it invites designers and engineers to reimagine how products look so that people can more easily see and control their online data.\n\nPhoto\n\nWith the new rules coming, Facebook also decided not to roll out some products in Europe that would violate the privacy laws.\n\nLast November, for instance, the company unveiled a program that uses artificial intelligence to monitor Facebook users for signs of self-harm. But it did not open the program to users in Europe, where the company would have had to ask people for permission to access sensitive health data, including about their mental state. The social network has also kept out of Europe facial recognition software that tracks when photos of users are posted across the platform.\n\nAmazon, too, has made changes. Last April, the company wrote a blog post outlining its efforts to comply with the new European regulations. The internet retailer said it would strengthen the encryption around the data it stores on its cloud storage services, and reaffirmed the rights of customers to choose which region \u2014 Europe or otherwise \u2014 where they want their data stored.

Adolescents are impulsive by nature and gaps can readily emerge between what they know they ought to do and what they actually do. Teenagers who are asking, much less harassing, peers for sexts almost certainly realize that they are crossing a line. But if that line is never stressed or enforced by adults, they are far less likely to heed it. I\u2019m also sure that plenty of boys would appreciate having a clearly articulated rule upon which they could blame their good behavior when they are pressed by peers to obtain illicit images.\n\nNearly a decade ago, the head of the school where I consult two days a week sternly warned our students to stay out of an ugly imbroglio involving kids at another school, which was playing out on Facebook. When it was clear that our students had totally complied, I asked one of our most levelheaded juniors how she accounted for her peers\u2019 surprising restraint. She said, \u201cWell, you want to involve yourself, and you almost do. Then you remember the rule. And then, a little bit later, you realize that jumping in probably would have been a bad idea anyway.\u201d\n\nIn a far separate domain, the National Hockey League penalizes both acts of aggression, such as head-butting, and also \u201cinciting an opponent into incurring a penalty.\u201d Now, hockey arenas are among America\u2019s temples of manliness and may not be the first place one would look for models of decorum. And certainly some players do not abide by those rules. But the fact that the rules address both sides could provide a useful starting point for a conversation, especially with boys who question whether provoking misbehavior constitutes misconduct.\n\nFinally, rules can be used to address power imbalances. The girls in Ms. Thomas\u2019s study felt they had little recourse for dealing with the often hostile barrage of solicitations for pictures. One study participant wrote:\n\n\u2026they want me to send naked pics of me and I don\u2019t want to send them\u2026.but like idk wat to do cuz they said if I don\u2019t send them tht their goinq to spreads roumors and help me out plzzz :((\n\nShifting the norms about soliciting images could helpfully shift the balance of power. If parents and schools have made clear that the requests are a violation, girls would feel that they had the option of taking screen shots of them and seeking help from adults.\n\nThat our focus has been so preponderantly on the sending, not requesting, of sexts underscores the exact problem we need to address. We accept and perpetuate the boys-play-offense and girls-play-defense framework because it is so atmospheric as to be almost invisible. Indeed, as someone who cares for adolescents for a living I can say that it was painful for me to realize that many of my early career conversations with teenage girls boiled down to: \u201cThe adults are asking you to regulate adolescent sexuality. Because we\u2019re not going to ask the boys.\u201d\n\nAs we re-examine the sexual power dynamics between adults, we owe it to our teenagers to include them in the progress we are making. Laying out high and equitable expectations for young people as they begin their own romantic lives can only be a step in the right direction.", "title": "Teenagers, Stop Asking for Nude Photos", "authors": ["Lisa Damour"]}

But perhaps even more remarkable were the lives of this country\u2019s first black millionaires, some of them born in the first half of the 19th century, decades before the Emancipation Proclamation. The journalist Shomari Wills\u2019s new book, \u201cBlack Fortunes,\u201d tells the story of six of those millionaires, including the landowner Robert Reed Church, born into slavery, and the self-taught scientist Annie Malone, the daughter of slaves. Below, Wills talks about how stories he heard as a child about his own family helped to inspire the book, the surprising connections he found between his subjects and more.\n\nWhen did you first get the idea to write this book?\n\nIt\u2019s kind of been with me since I was a kid, even though I didn\u2019t think of it as a book back then. My great-great uncle was John Drew, one of the first black millionaires in the Philadelphia area. I grew up hearing stories about him from my mother. He operated a bus line in Darby, Pa., in the mixed-race suburbs of Philly, in the early 1900s. He used the profits to invest in the stock market in the late 1920s. He rode the bull market pretty long, and pulled his money out right before the crash. He walked away with close to a million dollars.\n\nWhen I was first starting out as a reporter, in Jamaica in 2012, for a Caribbean newspaper in New York, I went to Devon House, which is a Victorian mansion that belonged to George Stiebel, the first Jamaican millionaire. He was a shipping merchant with an incredible story. He invested a lot of money back into Jamaica. His mansion was so beautiful and ornate that they had to build a road that didn\u2019t go past it, because the British nobles would get mad driving by it, seeing this black guy\u2019s great success. In 2013, when I was at Columbia Journalism School, I started researching the first black millionaires in this country.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?\n\nHow much of their money these first black millionaires devoted to helping advance racial equality in the United States. Throughout their lives, they put themselves at risk and exposed themselves, funneling the money they were able to make into abolition, civil rights, anti-lynching. They had very good lives with beautiful houses, with all sorts of luxuries, but they devoted an incredible amount of their money trying to help the African-American community. Mary Ellen Pleasant made her money during the gold rush in California. She took $45,000 and gave it to John Brown.\n\nThey all had different arcs with that. They all battled with the fact that they were rich but that they weren\u2019t treated as a full human being sometimes. When they arrived at that realization, they started giving money to causes.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\n\nTheir lives ended up intersecting so much. I picked out six characters I thought would be representative of different types of businesses, different parts of the country, but even if they all didn\u2019t necessarily cross paths, there was so much overlap in their lives. One of the main ways that occurred was through civil rights luminaries. Most of them knew Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and later W.E.B. Du Bois. When Washington started the National Negro Business League in 1900, an organization to boost black business and entrepreneurship in the United States, they would meet each other through that.\n\nMy plan was just to tell their stories chronologically. But the black business community was so tight-knit back then, so small, they all had connections with each other.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

But in every other way, he had traveled an incredible distance. Kerkorian was born into poverty in 1917. His father was a fruit merchant who had immigrated to the United States from Armenia. Kerkorian dropped out of school after eighth grade, but eventually made millions in the airlines industry, putting him on the path to becoming a billionaire. He bought and sold MGM Studios three times. He counted Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra among his good friends. By the time he died, at 98 in 2015, he owned many of the major hotels and casinos in Las Vegas. William C. Rempel, author of \u201cThe Gambler,\u201d a new biography of Kerkorian, spent 36 years at The Los Angeles Times, many of them as an investigative reporter. Below, he talks about how he identified with Kerkorian\u2019s background, the skills he drew on to learn about his deeply private subject and more.\n\nWhen did you first get the idea to write this book?\n\nI didn\u2019t get the idea. What I got was Julia Cheiffetz, my editor at HarperCollins, who read Kerkorian\u2019s obituary in The New York Times and called me. At that point, I only knew him as a name in the business pages. I had no knowledge of his background. Julia was so fascinated by the life that he lived, she asked if I would look at it to see if there was a book in it.\n\nI pulled up coverage of Kirk over the years, and right away I found some intriguing elements. What really appealed to me was how far he had come, how modest and humble his beginnings were. And I identified with it. Kirk and I both have immigrant fathers, and they started as entrepreneurs who weren\u2019t very successful financially. My father was from southern Ukraine; Kirk\u2019s family came over from Armenia in the early 20th century. The boat that my folks came over on was full of Armenians, too.\n\nKirk and I both moved all the time, were evicted from time to time. He became a billionaire and I didn\u2019t.

When one is blocked, then look for another one.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Paul J. Manafort Jr., the former campaign chairman for President Trump, against the Justice Department, deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein, and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III is an effort to find a backdoor way to block the criminal charges filed against him last October.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made it abundantly clear, most recently in 2014 in Kaley v. United States, that defendants cannot attack a grand jury indictment by claiming that they are innocent. That\u2019s what a trial is for, so once indicted the only alternative is to go to trial.\n\nBut that\u2019s a risky path, especially for Mr. Manafort who will face a jury from Washington, D.C., a venue that is not very hospitable to Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo avoid a trial, Mr. Manafort asked the court to stop the case because it is unrelated to any Russian interference with the 2016 election. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Mueller exceeded the limits of his appointment as special counsel, comparing the indictment to the discredited independent counsel law that led to drawn out investigations of President Bill Clinton and others in the 1990s.\n\nCan it work? Federal judges have a strong aversion to interfering with prosecutors, routinely refusing to second guess decisions about who to prosecute and what to charge.

First, economic theory suggests that higher returns should incentivize additional competition, which should have a negative impact on margins over time, especially with many traditional industries already facing increasing disruption.

Even if he were not to run again for president, a Senator Romney could prove a pivotal swing vote, impervious to the entreaties of a president he has scorned and able to rally other Trump skeptics in the chamber.\n\nHe\u2019s running, probably: While Mr. Romney didn\u2019t issue a statement on his potential candidacy, he did change his location on Twitter from \u201cMassachusetts\u201d to \u201cHolladay, Utah.\u201d\n\nAlso worth noting\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Washington flyaround\n\n\u2022 Republican and Democratic lawmakers will meet today with White House officials to try and reach a spending deal before Jan. 19 \u2014 or face a government shutdown.

But in the past three months, it has built only 2,425.\n\nOver all, Tesla had the most productive year in its history, delivering 101,312 vehicles, a 33 percent increase from 2016. But production of the Model 3 was slowed by manufacturing glitches at Tesla\u2019s giant battery plant in Nevada, known as the Gigafactory. The company has also said that welding processes and final assembly tasks at its car factory in Fremont, Calif., were moving more slowly than expected.\n\nOf the Model 3s assembled in the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 1,550 to customers, although many of the initial recipients were employees of the company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is par for the course for Tesla and Elon Musk, whose history of stating goals and forecasts and not meeting them is pretty well established,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior director at Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. \u201cThat the Model 3 is moving slowly isn\u2019t a surprise.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "Tesla has set a dozen targets, each $50 billion more than the next, starting at $100 billion, then $150 billion, then $200 billion and so on, all the way to a market value of $650 billion. In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.\n\nBut to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.\n\nIf Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.\n\nBut Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.\n\nThe way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.\n\n\u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)\n\nStill, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.\n\nMr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.\n\nEven though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.\n\nMr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d\n\nTo afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.\n\nIf Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.\n\nMr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?\n\n\u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "title": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk May Have Boldest Pay Plan in Corporate History", "authors": ["Andrew Ross Sorkin"]}

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge.\n\nIt involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.\n\nSecond, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.\n\nReaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.\n\nOne model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.", "title": "Tesla\u2019s Targets for Elon Musk Would Put His Pay in Orbit", "authors": ["Antony Currie"]}

The newspaper quoted dozens of teachers saying that the target had forced them to withhold services from students with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyslexia, mental illnesses, speech impairments or even blindness and deafness.\n\nIn the resulting outcry, Texas lawmakers ended the policy and passed several bills overhauling special education. Still, the federal review found that years of pressure from state officials to enroll fewer students in special education had created a culture of noncompliance with federal law that had outlasted the policy.\n\nAmong other issues, the federal regulators found that many Texas schools have trained teachers not to try to find out whether struggling students qualify for special education until regular classroom teaching techniques like Response to Intervention have been tried for years without success. That approach runs counter to federal law, which requires schools to evaluate students as soon as a disability is suspected.\n\nThe letter said regulators identified a statewide pattern of evaluations being \u201cdelayed or not conducted for children who were suspected of having a disability because these children were receiving supports for struggling learners in the general education environment.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for children with disabilities praised the federal government\u2019s action on Thursday, while cautioning that there was more work to do.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Education must immediately embrace the corrective actions required by the U.S. Department of Education and take additional steps, in collaboration with stakeholders, to ensure that all students who were previously denied special education services now rightfully receive compensatory services,\u201d said Dustin Rynders, the education director at Disability Rights Texas, an advocacy group based in Houston that receives federal funds.", "title": "Texas Illegally Excluded Thousands From Special Education, Federal Officials Say", "authors": []}

But by setting his production in the South, he can take his \u201cPetra\u201d into a new arena or, \u201cthe territory of brown, which is a world that I live in and love,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso for my viewer in New York, for the cosmopolitan who hasn\u2019t spent that much time there, it\u2019s a bit exotic.\u201d\n\nThe Rwandan actor and director Kaneza Schaal plays Petra, and Ms. Sinha, an Indian vocalist and composer, plays Petra\u2019s lover. Ms. Sinha also composed the score and is the audience-participation wrangler. At the beginning, she sits in the front of the audience and starts to vocalize as the houselights dim to black.\n\n\u201cAs the composer I actually open the whole piece,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I step into it as part of the story.\u201d\n\nFor her third role, she orchestrates a reading among audience members of a text about building diverse audiences, as Paz Tanjuaquio, another cast member, performs a solo. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sound meeting content meeting dance space,\u201d Ms. Sinha said. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex \u2014 I\u2019m not even sure if I call it a role. It feels like it\u2019s a world.\u201d\n\nThe other parts are just as vaporous. Mina Nishimura is Petra\u2019s sister; Sari Nordman is her daughter; and Ms. Tanjuaquio is her mother. Each performer also plays Marlene. These Marlenes, like the Marlene in the film, find a certain pleasure in Petra\u2019s mistreatment of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA similar suffering, Mr. Moss said, occurs in the performing-arts world, not only from the point of view of artists, but also administrators. \u201cPeople involved in dance and the arts \u2014 when they are paid as low as they often are \u2014 have to get that enjoyment from that abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in the job in an environment that\u2019s changing and devaluing so much of the arts.

In a fumbled response to Mr. Quayle\u2019s remarks, the White House \u201cfirst applauded, then dithered, then beat a befuddled retreat,\u201d The Times reported.\n\nA White House spokesman criticized the \u201cglorification of the life of an unwed mother\u201d on the morning after the speech. But shortly after that, he praised the show for its \u201cpro-life values.\u201d\n\nAnd that afternoon, President Bush, besieged by Murphy Brown questions at an appearance with the prime minister of Canada, threw up his hands in frustration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that much about the show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, I don\u2019t want any more questions about it.\u201d\n\nMurphy Brown was a divorced career woman in her 40s who had battled addictions to cigarettes and alcohol, decided to raise a child on her own and tried medical marijuana after learning she had breast cancer.

The character \u201creturns to a world of cable news, social media, fake news and a very different political and cultural climate,\u201d CBS said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThis week, Ms. Bergen did not immediately return a request for a comment, nor did Diane English, the show\u2019s creator and producer. But she had plenty to say at the time.\n\n\u201cIf the Vice President thinks it\u2019s disgraceful for an unmarried woman to bear a child,\u201d Ms. English said, \u201cand if he believes that a woman cannot adequately raise a child without a father, then he\u2019d better make sure abortion remains safe and legal.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He fired back the next day: \u201cThey said that I believe single mothers and their children are not families. That is a lie. Winning an Emmy is not a license to lie. Hollywood doesn\u2019t like our values.\u201d\n\nWhen a new season of Murphy Brown began in September 1992, Mr. Quayle was a good sport. He sent a card and a stuffed elephant to Ms. Bergen, and he sat down with a group of single mothers to watch an episode of the show. He said it was the first time he had seen it.\n\nIn the first episode of Season 5, the writers of Murphy Brown incorporated Mr. Quayle\u2019s comments into the plot and poked fun at the politician.\n\n\u201cWhat planet is he on?\u201d Ms. Brown, then a new mother, said to her friend Frank (Joe Regalbuto) after watching a video of the speech.\n\n\u201cTomorrow he\u2019s probably going to get his head stuck in his golf bag and you\u2019ll be old news,\u201d Frank said. \u201cMurph, it\u2019s Dan Quayle!

What do you think?\n\nBW: Refusing to give a factory worker a promotion unless she blows you? That is an abuse of power. Going on a date and hooking up \u2014 however boorishly \u2014 with another person? That is simply not an abuse of power. If we are going to weigh every relationship on the scales of power, well, then investment bankers won\u2019t be allowed to date baristas. We need to draw a bright line between what happens in the workplace and what happens in the privacy of our apartments (or kitchens). Right now they are getting conflated.\n\nSC: I think it\u2019s crucial to make distinctions, and Aziz\u2019s accuser fell far short because she didn\u2019t. Yes, he was more powerful than she was \u2014 not only as a man who often takes the role of aggressor in sex, but also because of his celebrity. But he held no institutional power over her career or advancement. And yet if he behaved boorishly or insensitively, if he failed to pick up cues she may have been too embarrassed to verbalize, he, like other men who\u2019ve behaved this way, should be reflecting on why this encounter went so awry.\n\nBari, you wrote this week that the only thing Aziz is guilty of is not being a mind reader. That\u2019s true, but Grace also describes expressing her discomfort in multiple places. Shouldn\u2019t we have a higher bar for men\u2019s emotional intelligence?\n\nBW: Absolutely. But that is not going to happen overnight. And until that blessed day of universal male emotional intelligence is upon us \u2014 or when someone figures out how to clone Jeff Goldblum \u2014 I want fewer women to be harassed, assaulted and raped. In part that means telling women to use their common sense.\n\nFH: Aziz Ansari did write a (very good) book on modern romance, but this just highlights that even the most sensitive, thoughtful \u2014 dare I say \u2018woke\u2019 \u2014 kind of man also has a lot to learn. We need to have a higher bar.\n\nDaphne Merkin, a critic and novelist, recently made the point in our Opinion section that we are treating women like frail Victorian-era housewives. I heard similar from a middle-aged friend, who wondered why Grace didn\u2019t \u201cjust get up and leave.\u201d Thoughts?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFH: The \u201cget up and leave\u201d theory is, in theory, a good one. But that just feels ugly and callous in practice. It paints some women as strong warriors and others as weak fools. I will always respect first- and second-wave feminists for taking those crucial first steps for women\u2019s rights, but to shun the new wave of women because their approach is different is divisive. We won\u2019t move forward. I get that Grace\u2019s actions are grating, because ideally she would have felt confident enough in herself to leave. But I remember that at 23 it can be daunting to be the one who says no.\n\nSC: Not sure this cuts generationally, though it may. That is, there are so many reasons women may be constrained from saying explicitly when they\u2019re uncomfortable, or they end up staying what turns out in hindsight to have been too long. Yes, it\u2019s important to learn to say no firmly. But we all know men don\u2019t always listen to that. And we also know that women themselves are often conflicted. Sex is always going to be messy and fumbling, to some degree. And I personally think we have to be tolerant of some uncertainty, some grayness. But if #MeToo is going to spur real changes, men have to curb their sense of entitlement.\n\nHere\u2019s a question we get often from readers: What about due process? Is it really fair to place Aziz Ansari\u2019s name on the same spectrum as Harvey Weinstein?\n\nBW: Our current situation \u2014 guilty because accused, as Margaret Atwood put it \u2014 is absolutely terrifying to me. And it should be to anyone that cares about justice and due process.\n\nFH: The #MeToo movement is the best part of social media. And trial by Twitter is the worst part of social media. But, most people aren\u2019t on Twitter exhaustively the way media folks are, so frankly while it\u2019s troubling that some bring out their 280-count pitchforks, I\u2019m just not too concerned that it\u2019s going to sideline the overall power and scope of such newfound, increased transparency.\n\nSC: What\u2019s extraordinary \u2014 and deeply unsettling \u2014 is that #MeToo gives women power that men have had for so long. Men could ruin reputations, undermine or destroy women\u2019s careers, act impulsively. I hope and believe that women can wield power more responsibly and more justly.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nMake a friend\u2019s day: Forward this email.\n\nGet this from a friend?

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "The research is here, and it\u2019s impressive. We learn about the Impressionists with whom Renoir traveled and the official Salon against which they sometimes rebelled. Manet, Monet, C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro all make appearances, as does the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who created a market for these painters.\n\nAlong the way, we also learn a great deal about 19th-century French society and mores. Renoir came from a poor background, which helped shape his work since he was paid to paint portraits. It also meant he had to give up the two children he had with his model Lise, since neither could afford to raise them (which, White speculates, may have resulted in the death of his firstborn).\n\nThe only problem with the meticulousness of White\u2019s every-statement-backed-up-with-evidence-approach is that the prose can get very wooden, like a police report. Renoir the man is \u201ca remarkable individual whose life story is heroic and inspiring,\u201d but what about his work? Famous paintings are mentioned, but not explained or elaborated upon.\n\nContrary to White\u2019s conclusion that Renoir\u2019s \u201coptimistic, joyful art brings happiness to people around the world,\u201d a small anti-Renoir movement started with an Instagram account in 2015, with the handle \u201cRenoir Sucks at Painting,\u201d and included protests outside museums. However funny and (presumably) ironic, the insurgency gained traction as Renoir\u2019s soft-focus, saccharine Impressionism came under fire. It would have been interesting to read a committed scholar and champion of Renoir\u2019s work rebut the Instagram activists \u2014 and add a contemporary chapter to the tale.\n\nA GENEROUS VISION\n\nThe Creative Life of Elaine de Kooning\n\nBy Cathy Curtis\n\n304 pp. Oxford University. $34.95.\n\nPhoto\n\nElaine de Kooning was a big personality. A minister she once met while traveling told her, \u201cBeing married to you must be like being married to 20 women.\u201d As a native Brooklynite who attended Erasmus Hall High School and was inspired by titanic women like the track Olympian Babe Didrikson, she painted, she wrote about art \u2014 and, although estranged from him for many years, was married to the famous gestural abstract painter Willem de Kooning.\n\nSeparating her life from this last fact is part of the work of Curtis\u2019s biography: How to show the \u201ccreative life\u201d of Elaine de Kooning, without making her a mere accessory to the company she kept? She was not as consistent a painter as some of her associates, but she possessed talent and boldness (some of it alcohol-fueled; she got sober in the 1970s with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDe Kooning\u2019s greatest achievements as an artist are her figurative paintings, including the \u201cfaceless men\u201d series from the 1950s and an official 1963 portrait of John F. Kennedy that was unveiled in 1965, a year and a half after he was assassinated. She was also a gifted writer, using expertise learned as a painter and personal knowledge of art and artists to analyze and explain the work of others.\n\nLike many prominent women of her generation, de Kooning didn\u2019t identify as a feminist, even pushing back against Linda Nochlin\u2019s famous feminist essay from 1971, \u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\u201d And yet de Kooning served as a role model for women by circulating within the elite New York art world and demanding access to institutions like the Club, the unofficial art school and salon.\n\nPerhaps most important in examining a creative life and career like this one is seeing how art is made in communities, rather than by isolated artists in garrets (or studios on 10th Street in Greenwich Village). Biographies like Curtis\u2019s offer a corrective to art history and the art market, which too often focus on mythical art stars and singular \u201cgeniuses.\u201d Friends, lovers and associates can contribute equally to making, explaining and preserving artists\u2019 work and their legacies.", "title": "The (Often Complicated) Lives of Artists", "authors": ["Martha Schwendener"]}

The entrance-floor atrium, designed by the French artist Daniel Buren, evoked the blockier shapes of early Pompeian wall paintings but its mirrors added a fun-house dimension announcing that here the ancient and the contemporary would be bouncing back and forth, the old would seem new and the new old.\n\nMr. Buren\u2019s atrium, commissioned by the museum in 2015 for its 10th anniversary, is a site-specific piece that has become part of the museum\u2019s permanent collection. Those rooms, mostly on the elegant museum\u2019s first floor, are now repurposed as a modern reimagining of a Pompeian Domus, or home. The galleries are furnished with first-century artifacts on loan from the archaeological park\u2019s storehouses.\n\nIn an airy room painted with Neapalitan and Pompeian themes by the Italian artist Francesco Clemente, an ancient phallus sculpture hangs from the ceiling, and tables and reclining chairs create an updated triclinium, or dining room.

It\u2019s hard to blame him. The man, doubled in agony, can do nothing as the child on his belly reaches for a final gulp of air.\n\nThe question of context and of a museum\u2019s role as a time machine is the theme of the second part of the show, which runs through November and is what organizers call an \u201cintellectual excavation\u201d of Pompeii\u2019s history. In the first archaeological mission in 1748, the area\u2019s Bourbon rulers had all the treasures sent to Naples, a plunder that damaged the integrity of the site but produced the wonderful collection in the city\u2019s grand National Archaeological Museum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Madre\u2019s top floor, the process of uncovering Pompeii is examined. Handwritten notes, detailing the treasures shipped to Naples, sit under vitrines with shovels and picks used in the digs. They surround a work, \u201cRebirth,\u201d by the Argentine sculptor Adri\u00e1n Villar Rojas, in which nests and briaded wool rise from felled tree trunks. The idea that antiquity arrives to us in fragments is hammered home by Maria Loboda\u2019s \u201cInterrupted Pillar,\u201d a column hanging from the ceiling and sprouting from the floor but empty in between.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe past and present will be further fused next summer, when Mr. Viliani and Massimo Osanna, the director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, will help choose artists to sculpt new works from stone and ceramic archaeological fragments that were irreparably damaged when Allied forces bombed Pompeii in 1943. For the moment, these shards and fragments sit in two crates in an exhibition room under Andy Warhol\u2019s vivid, bursting pop canvas of Vesuvius, on loan from the Museo di Capodimonte in Naples.\n\nNaples and Pompeii are themselves experiencing rebirths, adding an extra dimension to a show about the irrepressibility of Pompeian life. After decades of crime, Naples is moving forward as a home to film shoots, celebrity chefs and contemporary art. The city\u2019s streets brim with life and its metro system is a contemporary art museum, with top-notch works strewn under the city.\n\nAnd Pompeii, where discoveries continue and contemporary instillations arrive, is experiencing a renaissance after structural collapses in 2010 raised alarms and prompted the Italian government and the European Union to invest more than 100 million euros, or around $120 million today, into a restoration campaign.\n\nA short distance outside Naples, Mattia Buondonno, Pompeii\u2019s celebrated guide, stopped in front of a storefront facade and pointed out the faded etchings of letters from the Roman alphabet. As two young visitors inspected the walls where their ancient predecessors practiced their ancient ABCs, Mr. Buondonno said, \u201cThe walls talk. The walls whisper.\u201d\n\nAnd back at Madre, curators are making sure contemporary art listens and talks back. Sometimes the dialogue is clear and sometimes it is hard to understand.

The main problem with white women, as many alt-right Asian fetishists have noted, is they\u2019ve become too feminist. By contrast, Asian women are seen as naturally inclined to serve men sexually and are also thought of as slim, light-skinned and small, in adherence to Western norms of femininity.\n\nThese stereotypes have roots in America\u2019s postwar military incursions into Asia. In Japan, a network of brothels permitted by American officials opened as United States troops began arriving in August 1945. The brothels employed tens of thousands of women until Gen. Douglas MacArthur declared them off limits in 1946.\n\nIn South Korea, an estimated 300,000 women were working in the sex trade by 1958 (after the end of the Korean War), with more than half employed in the \u201ccamptowns\u201d around the American bases. Vietnam\u2019s sex industry, centered largely on American bars, thrived during the Vietnam War. And the stereotype of docile Asian women persists. Nowhere is this more explicit than in sex ads and online pornography.\n\nTila Tequila \u2014 Playboy model, reality show star, aspiring rapper and one of a handful of female Asian-American celebrities \u2014 is often seen through this trope. Does she resent being typecast as the hot, horny Asian as much as I resented being seen as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d?\n\nYet after I was called \u201cwhite\u201d at age 14, it felt, paradoxically, like a compliment to be nicknamed Geisha Girl by another friend, a well-meaning gay white boy. This was not because I was delicate. But the nickname became our inside joke, and it symbolized the kind of femininity that attracted the boys I liked, but that I have never really possessed. Being in on the joke meant I was accepted. Since then, I have acted out in all manner of ways to dispel the \u201cmodel minority\u201d image. Still, I have never fully extinguished the belief that racking up an impressive lineup of achievements is the only way to gain respect.\n\nThe stereotypes that feed the Asian-woman fetish are not exclusive to the far right. They exist across the political spectrum and infect every aspect of life \u2014 not just the bedroom \u2014 and manifest themselves in figures as distant from America as the blond-haired, blue-eyed heroes and hypersexualized heroines of Japanese anime.\n\nThis fun-house mirror asks me to be smarter, nicer, prettier and more accomplished than my white counterparts for the same amount of respect, then floods my dating app inbox with messages that reek of Asian fetish. Thankfully, I\u2019m not required to care or let it define me; for what it\u2019s worth, I am even entitled to play up the stereotypes if I see something to be gained. Maybe this is where the Asian girlfriends of alt-right men stand. But none of us can escape the truth that the fun-house was built to justify systematic exploitation of everyone in this country who isn\u2019t white. That\u2019s important context. Otherwise, Richard Spencer\u2019s comments could almost sound nice.\n\n\u201cThere is something about the Asian girls,\u201d he once said to Mother Jones. \u201cThey are cute. They are smart.

One of his men liberated a supply of bread from the Brinks Hotel, which was being used as American bachelor officers\u2019 quarters. Lansdale and his men visited their Vietnamese friends, trapped in their houses, to bring them the contraband bread.\n\nAmbassador Bunker, nicknamed Old Man Refrigerator by the Vietnamese for his cool demeanor, came to Lansdale\u2019s house with his security detail to spend a night after his own residence was deemed insecure. Lansdale noted that the ambassador, after taking a nap, \u201cbecame acquainted with our F.O.V. cognac from Hong Kong for the first time.\u201d Lansdale also took in some Vietnamese refugees rendered homeless by the fighting \u2014 a former cook and her young daughter and niece. To celebrate Lansdale\u2019s 60th birthday on Feb. 6, friends and family sent food as gifts, ranging from a salami to San Miguel beer. \u201cSo,\u201d Lansdale wrote, \u201csome of the meetings at Cong Ly lacked the usual Vietnamese spirit of grand tragedy, looking more like old-fashioned picnics.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Tet offensive did not succeed in igniting a general uprising, as Communist leaders had hoped. Official American statistics showed 58,373 enemy dead between Jan. 29 and March 1, 1968, compared with 3,895 American combat deaths, 4,954 South Vietnamese troops and 14,300 South Vietnamese civilians. American generals claimed this was a decisive defeat for the Vietcong. Lansdale, naturally, saw things differently.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

In the coming months, \u201cit promises to become the real pivot factor.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Lansdale perceived more than most of his rivals in Saigon and back in Washington, who wrote him off as a dreamer and a has-been. The shock of Tet persuaded President Johnson to refuse Westmoreland\u2019s pleas for 200,000 more troops and to bring Westmoreland home to become Army chief of staff. Then, in a dramatic TV address on March 31, Johnson announced that instead of seeking re-election, he would apply all his energy toward bringing the war to an end.\n\nThe American quest for victory in Vietnam was over; the only question now was the pace of disengagement. But there was still plenty of fighting to come \u2014 more Americans would die after Tet than before \u2014 and Lansdale witnessed his share of it during the final months of his deployment.\n\nOn May 4, 1968, the Vietcong struck again across the South in what came to be known as Mini-Tet. \u201cAs during the Tet attacks,\u201d Lansdale wrote, \u201call the flowering trees and shrubs are still in bloom. Somehow, their beauty just makes the rest of it more ugly than ever.\u201d This attack, too, was repelled with heavy losses. But Lansdale was appalled by the level of destruction inflicted by the American counteroffensive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis aide, Charlie Sweet, visited a working-class section of Saigon known as District Eight and was startled by \u201cthe deep anger against all Americans\u201d because of the heavy firepower that American forces were employing against the 200 or so Vietcong guerrillas who had infiltrated their neighborhood. \u201cTwo hundred houses were being destroyed for every Vietcong killed,\u201d one man complained. The fighting in District Eight would destroy more than 5,000 buildings, kill more than 200 civilians, wound 2,000 more and create 40,000 refugees. \u201cI hope we never use these tactics in riots in the U.S.,\u201d Lansdale wrote, \u201cor we will lose all of our cities.\u201d\n\nSweet\u2019s memo about District Eight \u201cresonated,\u201d Defense Secretary Clark Clifford later wrote, and it led Westmoreland\u2019s successor, Gen. Creighton Abrams, to curtail the use of air and artillery strikes. This was part of Abrams\u2019s attempt to wage what one historian has called a \u201cbetter war,\u201d but it was too late: The American public had already turned against the war.\n\nBy mid-June 1968, when Lansdale was due to leave Vietnam for the last time, Saigon remained a city under siege. He noted: \u201cMasses of barbed wire, now rusting under the rains that had come with May, clogged streets here and there about the town. Trash and garbage were being heaped on the pavements, as public services slowed.\u201d Vietcong rockets were crashing into the capital, killing and wounding hundreds. \u201cThe blind caprice of enemy gunners,\u201d he added, \u201cmade each inhabitant feel that he might be the next target.\u201d\n\nAs he departed from Tan Son Nhut Airport on June 16, 1968, Lansdale tried to put on a brave face, but he knew that the war was being lost. Years later, he expressed \u201ca deep-seated feeling of grief over my failure to accomplish enough in my 1965-1968 service in Vietnam to have helped the people there prevent the tragedy which eventually overcame them.\u201d\n\nLansdale lived until 1987, and he would believe to his dying day that if only his advice \u2014 to focus more on politics and less on firepower \u2014 had been followed, America might have avoided a quagmire. There is no way to know whether he was right, and certainly North Vietnam would have been a formidable foe under any circumstances, with greater will to win than the United States. But it\u2019s hard to imagine that the path America did take \u2014 a defeat involving 58,000 dead Americans and millions of dead Vietnamese \u2014 was a superior alternative.", "title": "The American Who Predicted Tet", "authors": ["Max Boot"]}

But what did you expect? Trump\u2019s whole business career has been a series of betrayals \u2014 failed business ventures from which he personally profited while others, whether they were Trump University students, vendors or creditors, ended up holding the bag. And he hasn\u2019t grown a bit in office, unless you count that mysterious extra inch.\n\nThere are two things you need to realize about Trump\u2019s utter unreliability. First, it has ramifications that go far beyond the recent shutdown. Second, it\u2019s made possible, or at least much worse, by his enablers in Congress.\n\nThink, for example, about the international consequences of a U.S. president whose word can\u2019t be trusted. Who can we count on to be a reliable ally, when no country knows whether America will stand by it if it needs help?\n\nSo far, at least, financial markets continue to regard the U.S. government as trustworthy, even though during the 2016 campaign Trump openly talked about forcing the nation\u2019s creditors \u2014 like creditors of some of his businesses \u2014 to accept less than they were owed. But does this government have any reserve of financial credibility if something should go wrong? Probably not.\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s unreliability is a big problem, over and above the substance of his policies. But here\u2019s the funny thing: While his instincts are clearly autocratic, the Constitution doesn\u2019t set him above the law. Congress has the power to constrain his actions, to force him to honor promises. His ability to keep betraying those who trust him depends entirely on the willingness of Republicans in Congress to go along.\n\nFor example, any two of the Republican senators currently wringing their hands over the betrayal of the Dreamers could have forced action by withholding their votes on the Trump tax cut. They didn\u2019t. Similar inaction explains why Trump has been able to violate all previous norms against exploiting his office for personal gain, and much more.\n\nThe result is that promises from the U.S. government are now as worthless as those from a tinpot dictator.

The United States has historically been the world\u2019s anchor of republican ideals, but President Trump has abandoned the role, openly admiring strongmen like Vladimir Putin of Russia. As the temptations of nationalist populism spread, Europe has responsibility for holding down the Western fort. The primary battle right now is over Poland, which is deepening its descent into illiberalism. The European Union needs to take a firm stand in defense of Western values.\n\nSince coming to power in 2015, Poland\u2019s populist government has sought to control the news media, purged and politicized the civil service, and intimidated intellectuals and civil society organizations. Three weeks ago, Poland\u2019s president signed into law legislation that compromises judicial independence, effectively clearing the way for the ruling Law and Justice party to stack the courts.\n\nIn response, Brussels has taken the right steps, warning Warsaw of punishment if it continues to pursue policies inconsistent with the European Union\u2019s founding principles, which include \u201cdemocracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.\u201d In late December, the European Commission for the first time in the union\u2019s history started a formal procedure that could lead to disciplinary sanctions, including the suspension of Poland\u2019s voting rights in the European Union\u2019s main decision-making body.\n\nThese measures have not gone unnoticed in Warsaw. This week, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki reshuffled his cabinet, replacing a number of ministers whose relationships with European leaders were particularly strained. And he flew to Brussels for dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission. But these moves have yet to be accompanied by any concrete steps to reverse Poland\u2019s illiberal turn. The European Union must keep the pressure on.", "title": "Opinion | The Battle Line for Western Values Runs Through Poland", "authors": []}

That might explain why Belichick respects and trusts him enough to collaborate.\n\nThe two men met in 1996, when Belichick joined the Patriots\u2019 staff as the assistant head coach to Bill Parcells, nominally responsible for the defensive backs. In that pre-dynastic iteration of the Patriots, Zolak was Drew Bledsoe\u2019s rowdy backup and the extra hand who ran the scout team for Belichick\u2019s defensive backs, impersonating the opposing quarterback in practices.\n\n\u201cI worked closer with him at that time than I did with Drew,\u201d Belichick said during a break in the taping of the show. \u201cHe was great at it. He knew the game, he\u2019s smart and he always had a great sense of humor. Everyone got along with him, plus he could throw the hell out of the ball.\u201d\n\nFrom the other side, Zolak witnessed Belichick\u2019s mind-boggling attention to detail.\n\n\u201cIf we were playing the Dolphins, I had to wear No. 13 just like Dan Marino,\u201d Zolak said. \u201cI had to have the sleeves cut off like Dan and wear the same face mask.

He wanted the exact same mannerisms.\u201d\n\nBefore a game against the Broncos that year, Belichick admonished Zolak for failing to accurately capture John Elway\u2019s cadence at the line of scrimmage. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s \u2018set HUT,\u2019\u201d Belichick instructed.

(\u201cIt definitely feels a little painful,\u201d von Mueffling concedes.) With regular sessions, devotees notice a slimmer, tighter silhouette. Or as von Mueffling explains, \u201cit\u2019s as if she puts your body in \u2018restart\u2019 mode.\u201d\n\nWhile this sounds like the stuff of French myth, the results are actually quite real. The New York-based dermatologist Dr. Ellen Marmur says that manual remodeling delivers \u201ca major circulation boost,\u201d adding that de Richeville\u2019s combination of massage and acupressure can \u201cimprove oxygenation, reduce pain, relax muscles and possibly allow for better realignment and rejuvenation of the body.\u201d In fact, Dr. Marmur describes the method as similar to one physical therapists use to help speed healing and increase tone.

In between visits, clients can see Fatima Zegrani, her trained therapist. But for those who live outside the areas de Richeville services, there are a growing number of at-home body-contouring devices hitting the market.\n\nThe Fascia Blaster ($89), for example, is a self-treatment tool first developed for professional athletes that\u2019s now being embraced by wellness enthusiasts. The baton-like stick is covered with nubs or claws that, when rolled over your body, help loosen the fascia \u2014 the connective tissue around muscles and organs \u2014 to ease stiffness and, as an added bonus, dimpling of the skin that can lead to cellulite.

Set in the sumptuously realized world of Seoul in the 1920s, the film follows a group of Korean resistance fighters as they gather explosives for an attack on Japanese targets, risking exposure by enemy agents.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Superbad\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nJan. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe screenwriting partners Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (\u201cPineapple Express,\u201d \u201cThis Is the End\u201d) dusted off a script they conceived as teenagers to create this 2007 revival of \u201980s high-school comedies. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera star in it as two high-school seniors who seek to end their virginity at a house party but get sidetracked along the way. (Their desperate reliance on their buddy\u2019s fake I.D., which states his name simply as \u201cMcLovin,\u201d is one of the film\u2019s most enduring gags.) Hill and Cera are a terrific comic team \u2014 one crude and aggressive, the other hopelessly put-upon \u2014 but \u201cSuperbad\u201d is distinguished most by the sincerity that underscores its humor.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Super Dark Times\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAmong the most promising debut features of 2017, \u201cSuper Dark Times\u201d treats the year 1995 with the attentiveness of a nostalgia piece like \u201cStand by Me,\u201d although the memories here are more traumatizing than bittersweet. Owen Campbell and Charlie Tahan star as teenage best friends from upstate New York who watch an idle afternoon go tragically awry when one of them accidentally slays a classmate with a samurai sword. The effort to cover up the killing drives a wedge between the friends, and as the film gets progressively grimmer, director Kevin Phillips swathes the small-town exteriors in a cold gray that effectively mirrors the action.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Babadook\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nJan. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn her auspicious debut feature, writer-director Jennifer Kent offers up a spooky nemesis in the form of the Babadook, a dark and malevolent creature sprung from the pages of a pop-up book. The film\u2019s nerviest element, though, might be maternal ambivalence: Essie Davis stars as a stressed-out mother who lost her husband in an accident en route to the delivery room, and her lingering resentment toward their 6-year-old son is part of what brings this storybook demon to life. Kent delivers the expected genre shocks, but it\u2019s the tortured family dynamic that makes the film special.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Rehearsal\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt took over 15 years for director Alison Maclean to follow up her excellent feature from 2000, \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d but \u201cThe Rehearsal\u201d is a welcome and confident return. Set at a prestigious New Zealand drama school, the film is notable mainly for Kerry Fox\u2019s performance as an instructor with standards as exacting as those of J.K. Simmons\u2019s character in \u201cWhiplash,\u201d and a moral turpitude that nearly brings down the entire program. The action builds toward an original performance in front of an audience that includes agents, and the pressure to deliver is so immense that a group of students turns to a questionable source for inspiration.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018A Ghost Story\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 3\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe ghost in this minimalist indie drama by David Lowery (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d) dons a white sheet with two eyeholes, like the world\u2019s least creative Halloween costume. But it isn\u2019t out to scare anybody and neither is the film. Instead, \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d is about a dead man (Casey Affleck) who sticks around his home after he dies to observe what happens as his wife (Rooney Mara) mourns and moves on, and as the house changes ownership over the years. Lowery pulls off the neat trick of crafting a somber haunted-house movie from the ghost\u2019s perspective, and his experiments with time are particularly revelatory.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Polka King\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 12\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix picked up the rights to this film starring Jack Black at Sundance, where it won some acclaim as a stranger-than-fiction biopic in the mold of Richard Linklater\u2019s dark comedy \u201cBernie,\u201d which also starred Black. In \u201cThe Polka King,\u201d Black plays Jan Lewan, a Polish polka singer who landed in prison after running a Ponzi scheme in Pennsylvania. \u201cThe Polka King\u201d chronicles his rise and fall, including his relationship with his wife (Jenny Slate), a former Miss Junior Pennsylvania, and his efforts to convince fans to invest in an expansion of his empire, which winds up taking the form of a sloppily conceived fraud.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Carol\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 14\n\nJan. 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nTodd Haynes\u2019s impeccable adaptation of Patricia Highsmith\u2019s novel \u201cThe Price of Salt\u201d (originally published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan) continues the theme of stifled female domesticity that he has visited time and again in films like \u201cSafe,\u201d \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d and \u201cMildred Pierce.\u201d Here, it\u2019s Cate Blanchett, who suffers beautifully as Carol, a wealthy, dissatisfied housewife in 1950s New York who finds herself romantically drawn to a department store clerk (Rooney Mara). But the times \u2014 and Carol\u2019s husband, played by Kyle Chandler \u2014 are unsympathetic, forcing the couple to make some difficult choices.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Dear White People\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 18\n\nJan. 18 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore it was a Netflix series, \u201cDear White People\u201d was this 2014 campus satire in the mode of Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cSchool Daze\u201d about a black student (Tessa Thompson) whose radio show sparks uproar on the mostly white campus of Winchester University. The film\u2019s writer and director, Justin Simien, uses his heroine\u2019s radio monologues and a fiercely contested student election to expose casual and not-so-casual instances of college racism. The tart one-liners and the bright, irreverent tone makes the politics go down easy, and Teyonah Parris makes a particularly vivid impression as an aspiring reality-show star whose brazenness masks a hidden vulnerability.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Kill the Messenger\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 18\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn 1996, the investigative reporter Gary Webb published an explosive three-part series of articles in the San Jose Mercury News claiming that the C.I.A. had brought crack cocaine into the United States in the 1980s and funneled millions of the dollars of profit to the war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Webb\u2019s reporting came under heavy scrutiny \u2014and Webb committed suicide in 2004 \u2014 but \u201cKill the Messenger,\u201d a biopic about the story and its aftermath, takes a sympathetic view of a journalist under fire. Jeremy Renner plays Webb as an intrepid truth-seeker who uncovers a conspiracy that\u2019s far more powerful than he can contain, a situation that aligns the film with paranoid post-Watergate thrillers like \u201cThe Parallax View\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Spotlight\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 18\n\nJan. 18 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThere\u2019s nothing showy about this meat-and-potatoes treatment of The Boston Globe\u2019s reporting on the child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, but its unadorned style suits the agenda of reporters who are trying to nail down some extraordinary facts. \u201cSpotlight\u201d doesn\u2019t have the rich atmosphere of its chief inspiration, \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d but it shares the same appreciation for good, tenacious journalism and the clear articulation of a sensitive and difficult story. Director Tom McCarthy also subtly depicts the shrinking fortunes of the news business in the early 2000s, when investigative units like the Globe\u2019s Spotlight team were becoming an expense few publications could afford.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Grace and Frankie\u2019 Season 4\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 19\n\nJan. 19 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis solid comedy-drama from Netflix has mostly moved past the heartbreak of its initial premise, which had the mismatched frenemies Grace and Frankie (Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin) moving in together after their husbands (Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen) announced their romantic relationship. The fourth season brings in another comedy veteran, Lisa Kudrow, as a manicurist whose friendship with Grace presents a new crisis in her relationship with Frankie. And presumably they\u2019ll have to continue managing the cutthroat vibrator business that kept them occupied in the previous season.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Force\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 29\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nStarting in 2014, the documentary filmmaker Peter Nicks embedded himself with the Oakland Police Department as it tried to reform and improve its reputation with the public. \u201cThe Force\u201d goes on ride-alongs through tense street-level confrontations and visits meetings in which officials discuss the finer points of \u201cconstitutional policing,\u201d often contentiously. Positioning himself on the fault line between the police and the activists who scrutinize them, Nicks adopts a fly-on-the-wall style that suggests the intractability of the problem without taking any one position on it.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Cars 3\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 31\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nPixar is stingy about the films it makes available on Netflix, so there\u2019s a take-what-you-can-get quality to seeing \u201cCars 3\u201d appear on the service instead of the studio\u2019s more original and inspired titles. But the film is a significant improvement on the noisy, globetrotting indulgence of \u201cCars 2,\u201d bringing the franchise back to a simpler treatment of friendship and aging that recalls the third \u201cToy Story\u201d movie. This time, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is a past-his-prime stock-car champion who faces a challenge from a jet-black newcomer named Jackson Storm, whom Armie Hammer voices with maximum arrogance and smarm.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201c13 Minutes\u201d (Jan. 1), \u201cGlac\u00e9\u201d Season 1 (Jan. 1), \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d (Jan. 2), \u201cRent\u201d (Jan. 2), \u201cShameless\u201d (American version) Season 7 (Jan. 2), \u201c6 Days\u201d (Jan. 3), \u201cDirk Gently\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency\u201d Season 2 (Jan. 5), \u201cThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 2\u201d (Jan. 5), \u201cHouse of Z\u201d (Jan. 6), \u201cThe Man Who Would Be Polka King\u201d (Jan. 12), \u201cMr. Holmes\u201d (Jan. 18) and \u201cIn the Deep\u201d (Jan. 19).", "title": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New on Netflix Canada in January", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"]}

Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin play the vengeful administrative assistants, who kidnap their creepy boss and then change their office policies in order to make them more friendly to women.

Philippe\u2019s documentary \u201c78/52,\u201d which is named for the number of camera angles and cuts used by Hitch to terrify motion picture audiences. Scholars and fans approach this single minute of film (which took seven days to shoot,) from multiple perspectives, talking about what it meant as a technical achievement, how it can be read symbolically and how it fits into cinematic history.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018John Mellencamp: Plain Spoken\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFans of John Mellencamp hits like \u201cJack and Diane\u201d and \u201cPink Houses\u201d should know that while this concert film features a lot of the singer-songwriter\u2019s best-known songs, it is not strictly a performance piece. Instead, the veteran roots-rocker takes an especially feisty set performance from his \u201cPlain Spoken\u201d tour and adds narration, talking over the tunes to share stories about his youth and early years in show business. The result is something uncommonly intimate, taking us inside Mellencamp\u2019s head as he and his band do their work.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Nightcrawler\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nFeb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThere\u2019s never been a shortage of movies, novels and television shows about the ratings-grabbing debasement of broadcast media, and yet in this \u201cfake news\u201d era, the 2014 thriller \u201cNightcrawler\u201d still seems eerily prescient. Writer-director Dan Gilroy and star Jake Gyllenhaal have created a timelessly unnerving character in the antihero Lou Bloom, an amoral freelance videographer whose facility with buzzwords and utter shamelessness helps him force his way into places no one else will go, in order to gather the kind of gory footage that makes TV producers light up. A twisty plot pulls viewers through what is ultimately a stinging commentary about sensationalism and trust.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Pianist\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 9\n\nFeb. 9 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn this drama directed by Roman Polanski and adapted by Ronald Harwood, Adrien Brody gives an Oscar-winning performance as the real-life Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adapted from Szpilman\u2019s memoir, the film shows how he evaded the Nazis for years by hiding amid Warsaw\u2019s bombed-out rubble. Largely dialogue-free, \u201cThe Pianist\u201d follows the usual beats of a Holocaust drama, then takes a sharp turn after the hero avoids being shipped off to a concentration camp, becoming a harrowing, masterfully constructed survivalist adventure.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 14\n\nFeb. 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAlthough it\u2019s remembered as one of the movies that helped steer 1970s Hollywood toward broad-appeal blockbusters, Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters\u201d is actually pretty arty by today\u2019s standards. This story of an alien visitation \u2014 which is less of an invasion than a \u201cHi, how are ya\u201d \u2014 sprawls out into a shaggy riff on post-Watergate paranoia, suburban family angst and human curiosity. As a husband and father who\u2019s practically itching to leave home, Richard Dreyfuss makes for an appealing and relatable everyman, who conveys a proper sense of wonder as he hits the road with fellow lost souls, searching for meaning by chasing UFOs.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018John Wick: Chapter 2\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 16\n\nFeb. 16 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt took a while for audiences to catch up to the first \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d which was advertised as a grubby Keanu Reeves revenge thriller and only later revealed to be something far more imaginative and odd. The action-packed sequel doesn\u2019t waste any time getting freaky: From the opening scene, we\u2019re transported back to the bizarro \u201cJohn Wick\u201d world, where dapper criminals brutalize each other in an elaborate underground society.

Supporters of the former president may find the prospect of watching his team\u2019s last days too depressing.

After spending over a decade trying to bring the character to the screen, the screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis has finally come through with \u201cAltered Carbon,\u201d based on the first book of the series. Joel Kinnaman (who was so good in \u201cThe Killing\u201d) stars as Kovacs, a long-shelved super soldier resurrected to investigate a death that was believed to be suicide, but may actually be murder.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Queer Eye\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 7\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn the early 2000s, when the L.G.B.T.Q. community was much less widely represented on TV, the Bravo series \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d was a revelation. Its diverse panel of gay style experts patrolled a hearteningly idealized New York City, where different groups of people interacted amiably. Given all the ways that culture and society have changed over the past decade, it will be interesting to see whether the revamped version of the show \u2014 with an entirely new \u201cFab Five\u201d doing the makeovers and a scope extended beyond New York \u2014 will still feel vital.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Everything Sucks!\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 16\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nHaving already hit the jackpot with shows about awkward kids, like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d Netflix is at it again with a comedy about the drama geeks and A/V Club nerds at a mid-1990s Oregon high school. The writing, directing and producing team includes the indie film stalwarts Ben York Jones (\u201cLike Crazy\u201d), Michael Mohan (\u201cSave the Date\u201d) and Ry Russo-Young (\u201cBefore I Fall\u201d), so expect the humor to be more gentle than broad, and interlaced with painful truths about how it feels to be an adolescent misfit with big creative dreams.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 18\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nEver since E! canceled its Friday night roundup show \u201cThe Soup,\u201d topical television has suffered from a Joel McHale-sized hole. This hole is about to be filled, however, with his new weekly Netflix show. Playing to his strengths, the puckishly cynical comedian will offer his take on what\u2019s happening in the world of news and entertainment, accompanied by clips, sketches and special guests. At its best, \u201cThe Soup\u201d could be more informative about the state of our culture than the nightly news, so the bar is pretty high for this 13-episode series.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Seven Seconds\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 23\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe writer and producer Veena Sud alternately captivated and frustrated TV viewers with her AMC-Netflix series \u201cThe Killing,\u201d which overstretched its mystery plots while developing a finely textured study of troubled people in a forbidding Seattle. Her new crime drama \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d (based on 2013 Russian film,) is also about a death: the accidental killing of a black Jersey City teen by a white cop. With the \u201cwhodunit\u201d aspect minimized, Sud should be in her element, using tragedy as a lens through which to view various social ills.

Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman\u2019s documentary \u201cSeeing Allred\u201d is a glowing portrait of the activist, combining her reflections on a tumultuous life with footage of her drumming up publicity for her clients and going after powerful men like Bill Cosby and Donald Trump. The film became unexpectedly relevant while it was in production, as the #MeToo movement erupted with the kinds of personal stories of injustice that Allred has spent her career trying to be heard.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Trader\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix has become a surprisingly welcoming home for foreign-language movies, documentaries and even short films. \u201cThe Trader\u201d is all three at once: a 22-minute Georgian doc about a man who collects old clothes and housewares and swaps them for food at a community market.

But before Howard took on that story from a galaxy far, far away, he directed a space drama situated much closer to home. This 1995 movie follows the events of the doomed Apollo 13 and its crew\u2019s desperate attempt to make it back to earth. Not even Tom Hanks\u2019s calming presence as one of the astronauts can soothe my stress when watching this movie.\n\n\u2014\n\nKirsten Dunst, left, and Gabrielle Union in \u201cBring It On.\u201d Ken Jacques/Universal Studios\n\n\u2018Bring It On\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nKirsten Dunst stars in this 2000 movie as a spunky cheerleading captain who thinks she\u2019s cursed. It\u2019s the only reason her character can think of when she discovers her champion squad has a problematic history of stealing routines from a poorer team in South Central Los Angeles (led by Gabrielle Union in one of her earliest films roles). \u201cBring It On\u201d isn\u2019t just the best cheerleading movie of all time. It\u2019s one of the best sports comedies. And now, I have the \u201cBrr, It\u2019s Cold in Here\u201d cheer stuck in my head.\n\n\u2014\n\nMarlon Brando in \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018The Godfather\u2019 trilogy\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nThe first and second entries of the \u201cGodfather\u201d trilogy are essential entries in the American movie canon. They have many unforgettable lines, shadowy cinematography that makes almost every character look ominous and great performances from Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, James Caan and Robert De Niro.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nKate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey in \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.\u201d Michael Gibson/Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nRemember when Matthew McConaughey was the \u201cit\u201d guy for almost every romantic comedy in the early 2000s? I sure do. And \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\u201d is likely one of the better ones of the bunch. Here, he\u2019s an ad exec who needs to prove that he understands romance when he comes across a magazine writer (Kate Hudson) who, unbeknown to him, is on assignment to get a guy to dump her within 10 days. Don\u2019t you just love it when two unlikely characters played by really attractive people are the ones who find love?\n\n\u2014\n\nKirsten Dunst, center, in \u201cMarie Antoinette.\u201d Leigh Johnson/Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018Marie Antoinette\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSofia Coppola delivers this imaginative spin on the story of the last pre-Revolution queen of France. As Marie Antoinette, Kirsten Dunst wears frilly dresses, prances through opulent rooms and luxuriates in riches in a na\u00efve girlish way. Anyone coming to this movie for a period-perfect recreation of Antoinette\u2019s story may be disappointed. The movie is more interested in the mood and inner life of the queen than in historical accuracy.\n\n\u2014\n\nTara Morice and Paul Mercurio in \u201cStrictly Ballroom.\u201d Miramax Films\n\n\u2018Strictly Ballroom\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about this ostentatiously silly Australian film. Underneath the ridiculous \u201990s hairdos, sparkly costumes and silly dance routines, there\u2019s a lovely story about two unlikely partners \u2014 one a champion dancer, the other an untested and clumsy newcomer \u2014 who upend the stuffy ballroom scene with their unorthodox style. This was the film that launched Baz Luhrmann\u2019s career, so take note, fans of \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d and \u201cMoulin Rouge.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nJim Carrey in \u201cThe Truman Show.\u201d Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018The Truman Show\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis 1998 movie features one of Jim Carrey\u2019s best performances. (I have a soft spot, though, for Carrey\u2019s role in the sappy \u201cThe Majestic.\u201d) In it, Carrey combines his manic energy with a sensitive side audiences hadn\u2019t really seen when it was released. But \u201cThe Truman Show\u201d is also an interesting look at the rise of reality TV and how people cannibalize one another\u2019s experiences for entertainment.\n\n\u2014\n\nVera Farmiga in \u201cThe Conjuring.\u201d Michael Tackett/Warner Bros.

So it makes sense that he would shift some of his production company\u2019s resources into a TV series, helping similarly passionate directors make a difference. The short documentaries presented under Gibney\u2019s \u201cDirty Money\u201d umbrella pursue blood-boiling tales of corporate malfeasance and corruption, with episodes tackling pharmaceutical price-gouging, the banking practices of drug cartels, Donald Trump\u2019s shady business history and more.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nA scene from \u201cOne Day at a Time.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018One Day at a Time\u2019 Season 2\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 26\n\nJan. 26 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis reimagined revival of the long-running sitcom from producer Norman Lear landed on multiple \u201cBest of 2017\u201d lists, making the prospect of new \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d episodes one of the year\u2019s most-anticipated TV events. Season 1 left off with the Alvarez family\u2019s embracing its eldest daughter, Elena, after she came out as gay, while Penelope was struggling to overcome her busy schedule as a single mother and nurse, along with the chronic injury she suffered in the military.

In it, Downey and Jake Gyllenhaal play two San Francisco newsmen trying to solve the case of the Zodiac killer. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the detectives on the case.

Starring Alfre Woodard, \u201cDown in the Delta\u201d follows an exasperated and struggling young mother whose own mother forces her to spend a summer with relatives in the Mississippi Delta, in hopes that it will straighten out the family\u2019s problems. Woodard is amazing in just about every movie I\u2019ve seen her in, and this one is no different.

In this 1998 remake, the mischievous twins are played by Lindsay Lohan, and they come up with a similar scheme. Now, you can watch both versions back to back as a double feature. Only one of them, however, has an adorably catchy song, and that\u2019s the original.\n\n\u2014\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal in \u201cSecretary.\u201d Lions Gate Films\n\n\u2018Secretary\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 1\n\nJan. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore her role in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Deuce\u201d as a porn industry pioneer, Maggie Gyllenhaal took on kink taboos in this cult favorite from 2002. In this role, she plays a submissive woman recovering from a breakdown who starts a sadomasochistic relationship with her boss (James Spader). Interestingly, Spader\u2019s character is named Mr. Grey, like the main love interest in the \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d series.

It\u2019s hard for me to pick a favorite joke from this movie, but the one that comes to mind first is the not-so-subtle jab at \u201cStar Wars\u201d merchandising, the \u201cSpaceballs\u201d version of which is peddled by Yogurt, Brooks\u2019s spoof of Yoda.\n\n\u2014\n\nMichael Fassbender as the title character in \u201cFrank.\u201d Magnolia Pictures\n\n\u2018Frank\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Jan. 8\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen Michael Fassbender in one of his many serious roles, but his performance in this 2014 dark comedy is odder than usual.

Within the first 10 seconds, Cardi B said she had \u201cbutterflies in my stomach and vagina,\u201d sending Ms. Rancic for a loop.\n\nMs. Rancic might have read up on Cardi B, but she was not prepared. There is a pat, practiced rhythm to red carpet interviews, a give and take of sycophantry and aw-shucks ego. Cardi B operates on a more instinctual level, meaning that at every turn, Ms. Rancic was flummoxed, befuddled and playing catch-up. It was three-plus minutes of old-style celebrity fluff getting crashed into and unmoored by new-style celebrity self-creation. JON CARAMANICA\n\nThe Best Would-Be Host\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the second year in a row, James Corden, a full-time employee of CBS, hosted the Grammys. It should have been Dave Chappelle. The comedian \u2014 who went on to take home an award for best comedy album (one of nine televised awards, for some reason) \u2014 first appeared with Mr. Lamar, cutting a six-and-a-half minute, show-opening performance that was pure adrenaline with a few chances to catch one\u2019s breath.\n\nHis commentary was pitch-perfect, acute in a way that much of the show failed to live up to. \u201cI just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America,\u201d Mr. Chappelle said, deadpan. \u201cSorry for the interruption. Please, continue.\u201d After another blistering segment by Mr. Lamar, Mr. Chappelle again played narrator. \u201cIs this on cable? This is CBS?\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s singing and dancing, but this brother\u2019s taking enormous chances. Rumble, young man, rumble!\u201d\n\nMr. Chappelle wasn\u2019t done. Before introducing the nominees for best rap album, he gave the Grammys another quick jab to the ribs, highlighting the career of A Tribe Called Quest, which was notably left out of the category, much to the dismay of its leader (and Mr. Chappelle\u2019s friend), Q-Tip. Mr. Chappelle did not quote the late Phife Dawg, but you could all but hear one of his classic rhymes between the lines: \u201cI never let a statue tell me how nice I am.\u201d JOE COSCARELLI\n\nKesha\u2019s #MeToo Moment\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the Grammys approached, it became increasingly clear that the burden of a #MeToo moment would fall on Kesha, the pop star who accused her longtime producer, Dr. Luke, of years of abuse in a 2014 lawsuit; Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, has denied the accusations. The Grammys, unlike the Golden Globes and the Oscars, are not known for speeches, which is why Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s introduction to Kesha\u2019s performance felt potent: \u201cWe say time\u2019s up for pay inequality, time\u2019s up for discrimination, time\u2019s up for harassment of any kind, and time\u2019s up for the abuse of power,\u201d she announced.\n\nKesha didn\u2019t stand alone \u2014 she came with backup, a chorus of women in white led by Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels, Andra Day and Bebe Rexha. Her performance of \u201cPraying,\u201d a ballad off \u201cRainbow,\u201d her first album since 2012, was an emotional exorcism. Singing directly to an antagonist \u2014 \u201cYou brought the flames and you put me through hell/I had to learn how to fight for myself\u201d \u2014 she trembled, she screeched, she slipped around the song\u2019s melody. And she fell into the women\u2019s arms as the audience rose to its feet. CARYN GANZ\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Newcomer Stands on Her Own\n\nPhoto\n\nAlthough none of her five nominations led to Grammy Awards, SZA still came out ahead in a way: She was the only nominee for best new artist who got to perform a full song on her own. In \u201cBroken Clocks,\u201d she sang about a frustratingly iffy relationship, topping a slow-swaying vamp with jazzy, asymmetrical vocal lines that could dart nervously ahead, pivot suddenly, linger over a quivering tone and declaim a chorus. She was too distinctive to shoehorn into some Grammy medley. JON PARELES\n\nThe Gutsiest Performance (by an Artist and a Child)\n\nPhoto\n\nChildish Gambino, the novelty rap-turned-soul rewind project of the polymath Donald Glover, was this year\u2019s left-field nominee for album and record of the year. But instead of playing it safe and using his performance slot to do \u201cRedbone,\u201d the nominated song and surprise hit from the nominated album, \u201cAwaken, My Love!,\u201d Mr. Glover did one of the only truly risky things that can be done to subvert this often overly reverential variety show: He played a song that pretty much no one has heard. And, with \u201cTerrified,\u201d backed by a band that did not appear to be miming to a prerecorded track, he stuck the landing.\n\nA cameo from the preteen child actor and musician J.D. McCrary, who nailed his notes, was an added bonus \u2014 not to mention great synergy for the forthcoming live-action remake of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d in which Mr. McCrary was cast as the young Simba to Mr. Glover\u2019s grown Simba. Then, immediately after, an Apple commercial used a big chunk of \u201cRedbone.\u201d That\u2019s called having it both ways. JOE COSCARELLI\n\nCamila Cabello Speaks for Dreamers\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Cabello, the former member of Fifth Harmony whose solo debut album just went to No. 1, stepped out of Kesha\u2019s backup choir to speak up for Dreamers. Born in Havana, Ms. Cabello was brought to the United States by her Cuban mother as a child and allowed in; her Mexican father later joined them. \u201cJust like the Dreamers,\u201d she said, \u201cmy parents brought me to this country with nothing in their pockets but hope. They showed me what it means to work twice as hard and never give up.\u201d\n\nShe quoted the Emma Lazarus poem on the Statue of Liberty and introduced U2, performing on a windblown barge with the statue behind the band. Every so often, Bono raised his arm the way the statue holds its torch. The song doesn\u2019t entirely add up \u2014 it veers between self-help and political resistance \u2014 but lines like \u201cThe face of liberty\u2019s starting to crack\u201d and \u201cThe promised land is there for those who need it most\u201d couldn\u2019t have had a better backdrop. JON PARELES\n\nThe Most Unexpected Shout-out\n\nAmong current artists least likely to ever be given a moment at the Grammys, Mozzy, the Sacramento street rapper who appears to operate a solar system away from the music industry (in a good way), would have seemed like a safe bet. So to hear Mr. Lamar invoke the budding cult favorite \u2014 \u201cAs my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time\u201d \u2014 in his acceptance speech for best rap album was a welcome gift for, probably, dozens, and not even ostentatious enough to be baffling for the millions who almost definitely missed it altogether. During a show that tends to work broad, to say the least, you\u2019ve got to take the Easter eggs where you can find them. JOE COSCARELLI\n\nRihanna Digs Deep\n\nPhoto\n\nOn a night where Lady Gaga, Pink and Miley Cyrus chose balladeering over strutting, the job of being a first-class pop star was left to Rihanna. The overarching aesthetic of this performance of DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d with Bryson Tiller may have been less than clear, but it was joyous, and Rihanna threw herself into the moment, delighting online observers by breaking into the South African dance called gwara gwara. She punched her choreography with extra oomph while singing live, throwing ferocious faces and showing the world that she was having the most fun of anyone in Madison Square Garden. CARYN GANZ\n\nThe Worst\n\nLimp Song Selection\n\nPhoto\n\nOn a night in which two of the most dynamic album of the year nominees, Jay-Z and Lorde, did not take the stage (with Jay-Z reportedly turning down his slot and Lorde having not been offered her own showcase), the static performances stuck out even more than usual. Aged songs with questionable or forced relevance \u2014 Sting\u2019s \u201cEnglishman in New York,\u201d Elton John\u2019s \u201cTiny Dancer,\u201d Patti LuPone\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Cry for Me Argentina\u201d \u2014 were well-executed but unnecessary, while ballads by a dressed-down, feet-on-the-ground Pink (\u201cWild Hearts Can\u2019t Be Broken\u201d), Broadway\u2019s Ben Platt (\u201cSomewhere,\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d) and a piano-bound Lady Gaga (\u201cJoanne,\u201d \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d) were limp or snoozy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven what should have been a guaranteed gut-punch \u2014 the country music tribute to the victims of the Las Vegas concert shooting \u2014 ended up a head-scratcher because of the choice to cover Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cTears in Heaven.\u201d As Bruno Mars put it when he won record of the year for \u201c24K Magic\u201d: \u201cCome on, turn it up one more time \u2014 too many ballads tonight!\u201d Untapped nominated acts like Migos, Lil Uzi Vert and even Cardi B, who was relegated to two quick guest verses, could only nod in agreement \u2014 that is, if they were still paying attention. JOE COSCARELLI\n\nShutouts\n\nPhoto\n\nForget winning Grammys, or even sweeping all the major categories: all the cool kids are getting shut out! Jay-Z was this year\u2019s most nominated artist, with eight nods for his album \u201c4:44\u201d and various songs and videos from it, but he went home empty-handed. Lorde was nominated for album of the year, but didn\u2019t win. (She was spotted in the audience clutching a flask, though.) Cardi B: two nominations and no awards. And SZA, nominated five times, won no trophies. What was it Phife Dawg said again? JON CARAMANICA\n\nNo Big Prize for \u2018Despacito\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDespacito\u201d conquered the world in 2017 with billions of views and streams, but it couldn\u2019t get a top Grammy as record of the year or song of the year. That would have been a milestone for Spanish-language pop (even though the version featuring Justin Bieber boosted the song\u2019s popularity in the United States). Instead, the Recording Academy retreated to the funk nostalgia of Bruno Mars\u2019s \u201c24K Magic.\u201d\n\nOnstage at Madison Square Garden, \u201cDespacito\u201d was back to its original Puerto Rican performers, the singer and songwriter Luis Fonsi and the reggaeton rapper and singer Daddy Yankee. They sang and declaimed its come-ons with lascivious enthusiasm, surrounded by flashing pastel lights and gyrating showgirls suggesting Las Vegas \u2014 or the Latin Grammys. The song\u2019s global spread isn\u2019t over; a Spanish/Mandarin version by Mr. Fonsi with the Singaporean pop star JJ Lin appeared in November. JON PARELES\n\nSubway Karaoke\n\nPhoto\n\nJames Corden\u2019s trademark \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d is usually a harmless bit of talk-show host self-promotion. But Mr. Corden\u2019s comedy also has another recurring shtick: self-humiliation. He carried Sting and Shaggy into it with a fake-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u201csubway karaoke\u201d bit, as they sang old hits and a new collaboration to a stereotypically hostile Noo Yawk reception that was predictable from the setup. The Grammys tried to atone to Sting and Shaggy; that new song got two more plugs, as a stage performance and as walk-on music for Sting, who presented song of the year. JON PARELES\n\nA Choir to Lean On\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Grammys rarely if ever showcase actual gospel music \u2014 and this would have been a great year to do so! \u2014 but choirs abound, providing sturdy ballast for unsteady performers. Generally, the choirs are black, the performers white. To wit: Sam Smith performed his new ballad \u201cPray\u201d on Sunday night, but it was dolorous until the backing choir arrived to uplift him at the first chorus. But no choir in the world could make Mr. Smith any warmer than temperate, any cooler than lukewarm.

Large birds with attitude, great black backs are adaptable, tough and smart. They are as likely to be eating the lobster they stole from your unattended picnic plate in Maine as they are to enjoy a kid\u2019s leftover pizza crust on a park bench in Brooklyn. They also know how to put the squeeze on their neighbors, pilfering fish and other hard-won prey items from any number of other species.\n\nIf it was not enough to have their catch stolen, the gulls\u2019 neighbors should watch out for themselves. Black backs have an unerring sense for distinguishing weakened, winter-starved birds from the rest of their flocks. Unfortunately for their victims, gulls lack the specialized killing tools of raptors. When black backs move in for the kill, it is not pretty.\n\nTo most New Yorkers, a gull is a gull is a gull. It is easy to overlook the differences among individual gulls loafing on a pier. One would never guess from his screen presence that the thuggish Mr. Robinson was actually a cultured philanthropist. Similarly, one might never suspect that gulls play key roles in our local ecosystem: acting as scavengers, and rubbing out the unfit and the infirm. Gulls demonstrate an eerily human intelligence, and their social behaviors are fascinating to watch. Great black backs are well adapted to life in an increasingly human-dominated world.\n\nIt is interesting to note that this familiar New York City bird is the largest gull in the world, with a wingspan that can reach about five feet and a weight of more than four pounds. Locally, you need only make your way to a fishing pier, a Dumpster or even a frozen shoreline to see one. These large birds can also be found foraging well inland, in a variety of urban, suburban and rural settings.

Would my husband decide to stay married to me? Would I ever have children? Would there be heat by Christmas?\n\nBridges are built to be flexible. They need to withstand the pervasive force of gravity, certainly, but also transient forces that work against them. The Manhattan Bridge, which is a suspension bridge, must cope with floods and lightning, traffic and age. Although the circumstances around the bridge may change, it must stand steady. To do this, a bridge must balance two opposing forces: compression (pushing inward) and tension (stretching outward). A balanced bridge is one that has been engineered to find the sweet spot in between.\n\nI know this to be true because, with time, the particulars of bridge engineering began to replace the rolling images of heartbreak in my mind while I balanced on my bike. Cycling was becoming easier. In the first month, grandmothers whizzed by me. By November I was the speed demon overtaking the casual riders. I got a better seat so my behind would stop hurting and gloves so I could keep biking as the weather turned cold.\n\nMy body was changing too. I hadn\u2019t dropped much weight, but I was stronger and my joints didn\u2019t ache. My cheeks were flush from the fresh air and exercise. My eyes, no longer filled with tears, were clear.\n\nOne evening, on my way home from work, I looked up and saw a giant harvest moon rising over the river.

There were the clumsy requests for voter data, in some cases partial Social Security numbers, that at least a dozen states, Republican and Democratic alike, rightly rejected. There were multiple lawsuits alleging that the commission was violating the Constitution by discriminating against voters of color or infringing on Americans\u2019 privacy rights. The commission was even sued by one of its own members, Matthew Dunlap, the Maine secretary of state and a Democrat, who said he was being kept in the dark about the commission\u2019s activities and called any claims of bipartisanship a \u201cfacade.\u201d\n\nThe commission\u2019s only real accomplishment was to give a national platform to the nation\u2019s most dogged vote deniers \u2014 men like J. Christian Adams, who has produced reports on noncitizen voting titled \u201cAlien Invasion,\u201d helpfully illustrated with pictures of U.F.O.s; Ken Blackwell, the former Ohio secretary of state who tried to toss out voter registrations for being printed on the wrong thickness of paper; and Hans von Spakovsky, who has been hawking phony tales of voter fraud at least since the George W. Bush administration, and who advocated staffing the commission with \u201creal experts on the conservative side on this issue,\u201d as opposed to Democrats or \u201cmainstream Republican officials\u201d \u2014 both of whom live in the reality-based world, where election administrators of both parties agree that fraud is rare to nonexistent.\n\nAnd then there is Kris Kobach, the commission\u2019s vice chairman and guiding light, the man more responsible than perhaps anyone else for keeping alive the bogus specter of voting fraud in America. Mr. Kobach is the secretary of state of Kansas, where he has worked tirelessly for years to smoke out illegal voting by noncitizens, dead voters and other malefactors. In place of actual evidence, he relies on an antifraud data collection program with a 99-percent error rate. His results? Nine convictions, mostly of older white Republican men who voted twice.\n\nMr. Kobach\u2019s failures have not induced in him any apparent humility. In September, he said it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that more than 5,000 fraudulent votes swung the 2016 Senate election in New Hampshire, which was narrowly won by a Democrat, Maggie Hassan, and suggested fraud was also responsible for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory in the state. Like almost all other claims of voter fraud, it wasn\u2019t true \u2014 most of those votes probably were cast by college students who legally registered and voted with out-of-state IDs. But that didn\u2019t stop Republican lawmakers in the state from passing a bill on Wednesday that would impose what is essentially a poll tax on students who want to exercise their right to vote.\n\nAll of this is laughable, but it would be a big mistake to assume that the collapse of the commission means the end of the voter-fraud inquisition. To the contrary, Mr. Kobach, who called Mr. Trump\u2019s lie about millions of illegal voters \u201cabsolutely correct,\u201d seems more than happy to continue his voter-suppression tactics in the dark. On Wednesday, Mr. Kobach told Politico, \u201cAnyone on the left needs to realize that by throwing the food in the air, they just lost a seat at the table.\u201d If you ask Mr. Dunlap, they never had a seat in the first place.", "title": "Opinion | The Bogus Voter-Fraud Commission Is Dead, but the Myths Aren\u2019t", "authors": []}

Decide how much you want to spend, but consider starting small to test the waters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNext, decide what you want your planner to do.\n\nMake a list of things you want to be able to do with a paper planner that you\u2019re already doing digitally. \u201cAsk yourself, \u2018what does this planner need to do for me?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Reeve suggested. \u201cAnd then see what checks off the boxes that you need.\u201d To give you a guideline, Ms. Reeve said that planners typically serve one of five functions:\n\n\u2022 Strict scheduling: Look for a simple business planner that comes in monthly, weekly, daily, or even hourly formats. (Example: The Muji Craft Note Book Monthly A5.)\n\n\u2022 Goal planning: Look for a planner that allows you to write down your to-do list and also map out and track your goals. (Example: the Panda Planner.)\n\n\u2022 Artistic planning: Along with space for scheduling your planner should include pages where you can sketch and keep a journal. (Example: the MochiThings Medium Ardium Planner.)\n\n\u2022 Memory keeping: You might to turn your planner into a memory book of sorts, where you can use it to schedule and to scrapbook. Find a planner that encourages you to doodle or add stickers or photos to your schedule. (Example: the Erin Condren LifePlanner.)\n\n\u2022 Bullet journaling: Look for grid-based paper planners that allow you to use the bullet journaling method. You can keep track of tasks, as well as your schedule, using shorthand. (Example: Leuchtturm1917\u2019s Bullet Journal.)\n\nBefore you actually buy your planner, think about what you want it to do and how you want to use it, considering these five functions. This will make it so much easier to find the right journal for the job.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

You can use it as a notebook, you can get grid paper for it, and you can add as few or as many notebook inserts as you want,\u201d she said. \u201cThat one is pretty great if you want to be able to control what is in your planner but not have it be too bulky.\u201d\n\nNarrow down your options.\n\nOnce you know the function of your planner, ask yourself some additional questions to narrow down your choices. For example, does your planner need to be portable? \u201cThere are some bigger planners that we really like,\u201d Ms Reeve said. \u201cThey\u2019re folio-type planners that sit on your desk, but they give you a lot more room for writing.\u201d If you have a small desk or you move around when you work, that might not be ideal. So decide how much space you want for your writing. Will you need to take your planner with you everywhere you go, or can it live on your desk?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConsider the material, too. \u201cOne of the best things you can do is go out to a store and touch the planner, feel it and really look at it,\u201d Ms. Reeve said. Rather than ordering online, shopping for your planner in-person will give you a better idea of the paper quality. Plus, you can also see if it will fit in your purse, laptop bag or backpack.\n\nTransition strategically\n\nFinally, come up with a plan for your planner. If you\u2019re like me, your entire life is digital, and you track your schedule with an online calendar and to-do list app. Before you ditch them completely, keep tabs on the events you track with these apps \u2014 birthdays, deadlines, random notes \u2014 then add them to your paper planner accordingly.\n\nThis sounds obvious, but if you have recurring tasks that your to-do list app adds automatically, the process can get confusing. Make a list of those recurring tasks, and don\u2019t forget to put them on your planner each week, month or quarter. It might even help to write down those tasks on a separate page in your planner. For example, if you have a meeting at 2 p.m. every other Wednesday, write that down on a \u201cRecurring Reminders\u201d page that you check each time you plan out your day, week or month.\n\nRather than jump ship completely, you might also gradually introduce paper planning back into your life. For example, I use Google Calendar to keep track of important dates. Rather than write down these many, many dates in my new paper planner, I decided to keep my monthly digital calendar and simply use my paper planner as a weekly scheduler. Every Friday, I plan my upcoming week, look at my digital monthly calendar, and write down any important due dates. As I get into the habit of writing everything down, perhaps I\u2019ll add my monthly schedule to the mix.\n\nAll this said, I did find one downside to using a paper planner. As portable as it may be, it will never match the accessibility of your phone, which can make scheduling difficult. For example, one night as I hopped into bed, my phone buzzed. \u201cCan you have this assignment done by next Wednesday?\u201d a client asked. I wanted to check my schedule and email her back, but I remembered I wasn\u2019t using my digital app anymore, and I didn\u2019t have my paper planner in bed with me. \u201cI guess this will have to wait until tomorrow,\u201d I thought. I put down my phone and went to bed.\n\nCome to think of it, though, maybe that\u2019s not a bad thing.", "title": "The Case for Using a Paper Planner", "authors": ["Kristin Wong"]}

But even tobacco taxes are still not high enough, as the economist Robert H. Frank explained recently.

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "II. WHY WE MUST SAVE THE SUBWAY\n\nThe subway has been saved before, and the man who saved it was Richard Ravitch. Stocky, white-haired and gruff, Ravitch, now 84, is the type of civic macher you don\u2019t see much anymore, an urban idealist who has spent his career moving back and forth between the public and private sectors. His grandfather fled the pogroms in Russia, and \u2014 classic New York story \u2014 created a successful construction business from nothing. He lost everything in the Depression, and then his son, Ravitch\u2019s father, made his name building apartment buildings on Central Park West.\n\nRavitch followed his father into the real estate business. In the 1960s, he served on President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s National Commission on Urban Problems, and in 1973, after 12 years of trying, he completed Waterside, a $78 million, 1,470-unit development for low-and-middle-income families on the East River, just south of the United Nations. A couple of years later, Ravitch played a critical role in rescuing New York City from its fiscal crisis, helping to persuade the teachers\u2019 union to invest $150 million of its pension fund in a new series of city bonds. And in 1979, he was named chairman of the M.T.A.\n\nRavitch didn\u2019t need the job or even really want it. He waived his salary and took to wearing a bulletproof vest in public after someone threatening to kill him shot an M.T.A. police officer at his office. But he was a child of the New Deal and a passionate believer in the subway, which at the time was in even worse shape than it is today.\n\nDuring the fiscal crisis, drastic funding cuts had spun the subway into a downward spiral of deteriorating tracks, malfunctioning cars, increasing crime and falling ridership, a steep decline that tracked the city\u2019s own postindustrial collapse. To reverse the trend, Ravitch prepared a detailed breakdown of the costs of repairing and replacing all of the system\u2019s outdated equipment and proposed a sweeping plan to help fund the work. He argued at the time: \u201cThe transit situation, though lacking the drama of imminent bankruptcy, represents an equally grave threat to our economy, the social equilibrium and the survival of the greatest city in the world.\u201d\n\nThe subway\u2019s importance to the city begins with a single, durable economic principle: Cities create density, and density creates growth. Economists call the phenomenon agglomeration. Not only does geographical proximity reduce costs, but it also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and spurs innovation. It\u2019s a principle that holds true for better and worse and regardless of the industry. The free-market economist Edward Glaeser has pointed out that the junk bonds and leveraged buyouts of \u201970s and \u201980s Wall Street were as much the product of human collaboration as they were of corporate greed. The urban-planning professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett coined the phrase \u201cthe Warhol economy\u201d to describe how this same sort of cross-fertilization and idea-sharing works in New York\u2019s art, fashion and music worlds. As industries grow, they attract and create new, connected ones: Book publishers beget book agents, tech start-ups beget venture-capital firms and so on. It all begins with the ability to pack large numbers of people into small spaces and then unpack them at the end of the day. Without the subway, this process breaks down, and the city dissipates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRavitch took his case to editorial boards and legislative leaders. But there was a problem. No one wanted new taxes. So Ravitch cold-called David Rockefeller, the longtime head of Chase Manhattan Bank. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. Rockefeller, this is an audacious request, but would you get up at 5 in the morning and let me show you the subway system?\u2019 \u201d he told me one afternoon in his office at Waterside. \u201cAnd he said yes.\u201d Ravitch then suggested that Rockefeller bring along the chairman of MetLife and the president of AT&T. All three went and saw the dirty, graffiti-scarred system firsthand. As Ravitch tells the story, that was all it took: Rockefeller called the majority leader of the State Senate and told him to \u201cgive Ravitch what he needs.\u201d The tax package passed, and Ravitch ultimately raised $7.7 billion \u2014 more than $17 billion in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 much of which was spent replacing cars, refurbishing stations and increasing maintenance.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe turnaround was not immediate. A year after Ravitch\u2019s tax plan was enacted, annual subway ridership dropped below one billion. But before long, as the system gradually became safer, more reliable and less unsavory, it started to trend up. By 2015, ridership had hit 1.7 billion, a level not seen since the late 1940s.\n\nThe rejuvenation of the subway has been intertwined with a protracted period of staggering economic prosperity \u2014 agglomeration at work. New York rebuilt the subway, and the subway rebuilt the city. It was one of the great urban renaissance stories of our modern era. But now that the city is thriving, it faces another challenge, perhaps an even greater one: how to spread this staggering wealth more evenly. The subway might again be a central part of the solution.\n\nIf the story of the subway is the story of density, it is also the story of land \u2014 and more to the point, the story of land value. Before the first tracks had even been laid, real estate speculators were gobbling up farmland and empty lots along the proposed route and then quickly flipping their parcels at huge premiums to builders. When the subway recovered from its last major crisis, it again began throwing off enormous returns for the owners of the land above it. From 1993 to 2013, the average price for a co-op or condo in TriBeCa rose from $182 per square foot to $1,569. In the process, prime real estate in Manhattan was transformed from a place where people lived and built businesses into a high-yield investment in which absentee owners parked their money and watched it grow.\n\nAs Manhattan\u2019s business-district centers became denser and its scarce real estate more expensive, the growth started to spill out, following the subway\u2019s snaking lines across the river, into Brooklyn and Queens. \u201cDevelopers build things where the subway works, and we build far fewer things where it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Jed Walentas, the 43-year-old principal of the real estate development company Two Trees Management, told me recently over lunch at a cafe in Dumbo, Brooklyn\u2019s answer to SoHo. \u201cWe put density where there\u2019s transit.\u201d Walentas, who was wearing the familiar Brooklyn uniform of jeans, New Balance sneakers and a blue hoodie, and his father, David, own a good chunk of Dumbo, an investment that has made them rich \u2014 house in the Hamptons, vacations heli-skiing \u2014 beyond the wildest dreams of most New Yorkers.\n\nI\u2019ve known Walentas since the early 2000s, when I rented a desk in one of his many buildings in the neighborhood, a turn-of-the-century factory that has since been converted into multimillion-dollar condominiums. This is pretty representative of Dumbo\u2019s overall trajectory over the last two decades. It\u2019s a stark transformation that would have been impossible to predict when his father first started buying up the neighborhood\u2019s underutilized properties in the early 1980s, before it was widely known as Dumbo. What enabled it to happen wasn\u2019t just the neighborhood\u2019s excellent subway access \u2014 it\u2019s sandwiched between the F line and the A line \u2014 or the city\u2019s economic recovery, or even the exodus of rich people priced out of Manhattan by even richer people. The transformation of Dumbo required something much simpler: a change in the zoning law. For years, the neighborhood had been restricted to only manufacturing uses, a legacy of the city\u2019s losing battle to retain industrial jobs in the 1960s. In the late \u201990s, Walentas and his father were able to persuade the city to jettison these old rules and allow them to completely remake the neighborhood, filling old factories with loft apartments, design-and-tech-centric offices, retail stores, artists\u2019 studios and new condo towers. In the subsequent 20 years, as the neighborhood changed, average condo prices rose from $200 per square foot to more than $1,500. More recently, Walentas has pushed north into Williamsburg, leveraging similar rezonings there to turn a former textile factory into the trendy Wythe Hotel (near the L train) and a 19th-century Domino sugar refinery (J, M and Z) into three million square feet of office space, retail stores, parks and apartments.\n\nLike most good-government tools, zoning sounds boring, but it is in fact a secret means by which cities are shaped and fortunes are made. If the subway delivers density, zoning determines where that density goes by doing things like placing limits on how tall buildings can rise or how many dwellings they can contain. New York\u2019s zoning codes are byzantine, the product of years of pushing and pulling between the desire to allow the city to evolve and grow and the impulse to keep development in check. These codes have helped preserve the city\u2019s historic buildings and neighborhoods while preventing its streets from being forever cast into darkness by endless rows of skyscrapers. But they have also had the effect of restricting the supply of housing, which has driven up prices, especially in neighborhoods with desirable buildings and good subway access. \u201cI rent studio apartments for $3,400 a month,\u201d Walentas told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d", "title": "The Case for the Subway", "authors": ["Jonathan Mahler"]}

The response she gave was preceded by a sound I would come to know well \u2014 a good-natured, contemptuous snort.\n\n\u201cWhere I can get prickly, Wray, is if I\u2019m just called a sci-fi writer,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m a novelist and a poet. Don\u2019t shove me into your pigeonhole, where I don\u2019t fit, because I\u2019m all over. My tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions.\u201d\n\nMy tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions. If there\u2019s ever been a better description of Ms. Le Guin\u2019s astonishingly diverse and adventurous body of work, I\u2019ve yet to come across it. She\u2019ll doubtlessly be remembered for her sophisticated, nuanced and profoundly humanistic speculative fiction, and of course for her series of magical coming-of-age novels, the Earthsea series, without which the Harry Potter megafranchise could scarcely be imagined. But she was more than a sci-fi or fantasy writer, much more. She was more than her identity as a trailblazer in the overwhelmingly male (and chauvinistic) field of 1960s and \u201970s science fiction, as well, and more than an iconoclastic thinker on gender, or on ethics, or on the material world. The much-discussed fluidity of gender in her most famous novel, \u201cThe Left Hand of Darkness,\u201d could serve as a metaphor for Ms. Le Guin\u2019s entire approach to living, thinking and creating: She reserved the right to think, and write, and react as she saw fit \u2014 and to inhabit a completely different role as the occasion, or the project, demanded.\n\nMs. Le Guin cared passionately about many things, as is clear to any reader of her books: the rights of indigenous peoples, the search for alternatives to our pitiless economic scheme, the myth of innate gender difference, our slow collective murder of the planet. But what she cared about above all, it seems to me, was the paramount freedom \u2014 if not obligation \u2014 of all thinking individuals to define their personal enterprise strictly for, and by, themselves. By the time I came to know her, Ms. Le Guin had made peace with the nature of her legacy, and with the reductive effects of the passage of time. But it was, to the end, an anarchist\u2019s peace.\n\nI learned many things from Ms. Le Guin in the course of that first day, which we spent drinking tea and chatting on her slightly vertiginous veranda, with its glorious view of the snowy cone of Mount St. Helens. We talked about the usefulness of whispering one\u2019s writing aloud when revising, and how it somehow functioned better than reading at a normal volume, when trying to get the music of a sentence right. We talked about the advantages an interest in ethnography can give to writers interested in imagining entire societies, if not whole worlds. We talked about the mysterious power of artists in the last stages of their creative lives, when they were writing to please no one but themselves.", "title": "Opinion | The Category-Defying Genius of Ursula K.

An analysis in the United States found about seven years of retirement can be as good for health as reducing the chance of getting a serious disease (like diabetes or heart conditions) by 20 percent. Positive health effects of retirement have also been found by studies using data from Israel, England, Germany and other European countries.\n\nThat retirement promotes health and prolongs life isn\u2019t obvious. After all, work provides income and, for some, health insurance \u2014 both helpful for maintenance of well-being. It also can provide purpose and camaraderie. Evidence is mounting that loneliness and social isolation are linked to illness, cognitive decline and death. One study of American retirees found them less likely to be lonely or depressed.\n\nSome work involves physical activity, which can help keep bodies healthy, too. One study found that those accustomed to getting exercise through physically strenuous jobs \u2014 like construction or landscaping \u2014 are more likely to become obese upon retirement than those who don\u2019t have such jobs.\n\nBut for many people, work can be stressful, take time away from exercise, and promote bad habits like excessive alcohol consumption. The Dutch study found that half of the mortality reduction associated with retirement is attributable to cardiovascular and digestive system diseases. Obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as reduced exercise and stress, can all contribute to these. If you drive to work, that\u2019s another life-threatening risk.\n\nTeasing out the causal effect of retirement on health isn\u2019t straightforward. After all, some people retire precisely because they are in declining health.

He might court headline investment from Amazon and Apple, but moneyed Saudis who should be first on board prefer to squirrel their savings away.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the Saudi economy dropped into recession more sharply than predicted in the last quarter. The gross domestic product dipped 0.7 percent in 2017, substantially down on pre-purge predictions of growth of 0.1 percent, and worryingly below population growth of 2 percent.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s ranking on the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business index has fallen from 26 in 2014 to 92 in 2017. Unemployment continues to increase, in part because of the influx of women into the job market. For decades the kingdom guaranteed public employment. No longer. Each year hundreds of thousands of young adults join the line for government jobs. The private sector is too undeveloped to pick up the slack. Prices are rising because of the reduced subsidies and new taxes. Economists expect the ranks of Saudis living in poverty \u2014 around 20 percent \u2014 to swell.\n\nFearing perhaps Iranian-style protests over economic anxieties, the prince has delayed key performance indicators in his transformation plan until 2023, including a balanced budget. His reductions in perks and allowances for state employees were reversed after almost seven months. Grumbling over the new taxes and fuel price increase prompted the hurried rollout of an extra $13 billion or more in handouts, particularly for students and soldiers.\n\nA fear of uncertainty, too, could dampen Prince Mohammed\u2019s hopes of raising finance. Capital flight, which averaged an estimated $8 billion per month when the purge began, has since fallen back, apparently because of worry of arousing the prince\u2019s notice. But foreign interest in buying into Aramco might have been dented by the mercurial reputation of its chairman, the crown prince. Increasingly Saudi insiders speak of floating shares in the state oil company on the Tadawul, Riyadh\u2019s stock exchange, rather than in London or New York, or of giving Saudi shareholders privileged access. A direct sale to Chinese state-owned oil companies is also being mentioned.\n\nTo revive investor confidence, Prince Mohammed should consider several safeguards. He should replace the family checks and balances he swept away with a due process and rule of law, which applies to royals and commoners alike. The corruption commission he unveiled on the eve of his purge should be a regulator, upholding international standards of corporate governance, not his personal star chamber skewing the rules for his cronies.\n\nInvestors and neighbors crave predictability, stability and the confidence that comes with a sound regulatory system. All three are what made Dubai. Properly carried out, such a system would please bankers who might welcome the chance to retrieve debts or land from princes that act like robber barons.\n\nHe also needs to be more transparent.

They find that Trump is not the raving madman they expected from his tweetstorms or the media coverage. They generally say that he is affable, if repetitive. He runs a normal, good meeting and seems well-informed enough to get by.\n\nSecond, people who work in the Trump administration have wildly divergent views about their boss. Some think he is a deranged child, as Michael Wolff reported. But some think he is merely a distraction they can work around. Some think he is strange, but not impossible. Some genuinely admire Trump. Many filter out his crazy stuff and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nMy impression is that the Trump administration is an unhappy place to work, because there is a lot of infighting and often no direction from the top. But this is not an administration full of people itching to invoke the 25th Amendment.\n\nThird, the White House is getting more professional. Imagine if Trump didn\u2019t tweet. The craziness of the past weeks would be out of the way, and we\u2019d see a White House that is briskly pursuing its goals: the shift in our Pakistan policy, the shift in our offshore drilling policy, the fruition of our ISIS policy, the nomination for judgeships and the formation of policies on infrastructure, DACA, North Korea and trade.", "title": "Opinion | The Decline of Anti-Trumpism", "authors": []}

It\u2019s no accident that many nature centers have live birds of prey, including owls, on display for visitors and that many birding organizations sponsor evening \u201cowl prowls.\u201d But as awesome as it is to see an owl up close in captivity or hear one hooting in the distant dark, there\u2019s nothing like seeing one in the wild on its own terms.\n\nIt\u2019s snowy owl season in the upper reaches of the United States. Though not entirely dependable, this species is a not-uncommon winter visitor from the Arctic, and during years of sudden upsurges in migration, these owls can show up in significant numbers, on piers and coastal dunes, in stubble fields \u2014 even at urban parks and airports.\n\nBecause they often rest on the ground and hunt by day (after all, it never gets dark for much of their time up north), they can be conspicuous, much to the delight of birders and amateur photographers. For the same reason, they seem to enjoy a less protected status from birders than their nocturnal kin. With a snowy owl, full location details are even likely to end up in a feel-good segment on the local newscast. (We may have Harry Potter to thank for that.)\n\nAll of this points to a basic wildlife watcher\u2019s conundrum: When you know the location of a charismatic but sensitive species, do you keep that information to yourself (or to a small network of trusted peers), or do you broadcast it far and wide? The first option reeks of a kind of proprietary elitism, but it is of immediate benefit to the animal. The second option seems recklessly harmful to the animal, but if it promotes the hobby and raises awareness, then it might lead to far greater long-term benefits to conservation.\n\nThough there are usually those easy-to-see ambassador owls around, many birders insist on keeping mum about those locations, too; perhaps, for the greater good, they shouldn\u2019t. And here\u2019s a more controversial thing to say: Perhaps when we find an owl that is not especially wary, outside of nesting season and in a publicly accessible place, we ought to freely share that information, especially with those uninitiated to birding. If you have the time, set up a scope and invite passers-by to take a look, and if you have school-age children, see whether a field trip is possible.\n\nSome of my birding friends will balk at this suggestion, and there was a time when I would have been skeptical, too. But in an era of deregulation, of species being removed from the Endangered Species Act and of stripped-away land protections, conservationists may need to try harder than ever to get fellow citizens to care about wildlife.

Even modern countries, within memory, have sought to rid themselves of entire populations. It tends neither to turn out well nor reflect well on the expelling country. Two hundred thousand people may not sound like a huge number on a historic scale. But the population of San Salvador, El Salvador\u2019s capital, is only 280,000. Money sent home by Salvadorans living abroad, most in the United States, where protected status conveys work authorization, amounts to 17 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the country\u2019s central bank. The destabilizing effect of cutting off this flow of capital is obvious.\n\nThe potential economic effects in this country are less obvious, but real. Contrary to what President Trump might think, the Salvadoran community is highly productive. According to the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank in New York affiliated with a Catholic group, the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Charles, 88 percent of Salvadorans participate in the labor force (the construction and food service industries are their biggest employers), compared with 63 percent of Americans as a whole. They pay taxes and own homes. Since individuals with protected status are ineligible for welfare and other social benefits, this is a group that contributes to the country while taking little.\n\nAnd the human cost of expelling them is nearly unbearable. More than half have been in this country for at least 20 years. During that time they have become parents of some 200,000 United States-born citizens. Ten percent of the protected-status Salvadorans are married to legal residents. What exactly does the Trump administration think should become of these families? \u201cNot even a dog would leave their babies behind,\u201d Elmer Pena, an Indianapolis homeowner who has worked for the same company there for 18 years, said to USA Today.

They will be forced underground, turned from a life of productive labor to a life in the shadows where, in the age of Trump, immigration agents \u2014 who chafed under the Obama administration\u2019s enforcement priorities and whose union supported and cheered Donald Trump\u2019s election \u2014 feel free to go so far as to stake out a hospital to pick up and detain an undocumented 10-year-old girl after emergency surgery. (It came to light last week that the anti-abortion zealots in charge of caring for unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally were refusing for a fourth time, despite court orders to the contrary in earlier cases, to permit a pregnant teenager to exercise her right to an abortion. They yielded only when faced with another lawsuit.)\n\nWhile temporary status is sometimes granted because of war or extreme political turmoil, the Bush administration added El Salvador to the list after a natural disaster, not a man-made one. But a man-made disaster did befall this unfortunate country not so long ago, in the form of United States support for a murderous right-wing dictatorship that the administration of President Ronald Reagan regarded as a bulwark against Communism. The 12-year-long civil war there, during which the United States-supported military killed hundreds in the village of El Mozote, was a bloody final front in the Cold War, outlasting the Berlin Wall before it ended in 1992. The scars have faded, but memories are still fresh; an investigation into what happened in El Mozote was reopened in 2016 by a court in El Salvador at the request of three human rights groups.\n\nRevisiting El Salvador\u2019s bloody history is outside the scope of this column. But in this #MeToo era of standing with one\u2019s fellow humans, it seems to me that we owe something to that country beyond the sundering of families and the expulsion of people who did exactly what they were supposed to do: make the best of the opportunity extended to them in grace nearly a generation ago.

For the most part, I\u2019ll go about my daily life the way I always have \u2014 and if I want to, I can put a safety pin on my shirt and congratulate myself for being so woke, for being one of the good ones.\u201d\n\nA few days ago, when I heard that several male actors were joining some actresses in their plans to wear all-black to the Golden Globes in solidarity with those who have experienced sexual misconduct, I felt the old flames of anger reignite. There is something unsettling about how little these celebrities have to lose by taking these stances. They aren\u2019t risking financial ruin, nor are they vulnerable to violence, as is the norm for most who take a bold position. It feels completely privileged, and a little complicit, to still participate in the larger system that has condoned sexual violence in their industry. Besides, don\u2019t they already wear lots of black on the red carpet anyway?!\n\nRecently, I was watching \u201cSighted Eyes/Feeling Heart,\u201d the forthcoming documentary about the life of Lorraine Hansberry, a writer best known for her play \u201cA Raisin in the Sun.\u201d On June 15, 1964, she spoke at a town hall of black artists and activists who had gathered to talk about the civil rights movement with folks like Ruby Dee and James Baldwin. A white author named Charles Silberman expressed frustration that the African-Americans were dissatisfied by the meager progress made. He urged them to \u201cgo along with the means,\u201d and be patient. Hansberry lashed out. \u201cTo be in Mississippi is to be in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is we have to find some way to show the white liberal to stop being a liberal and become an American radical.\u201d Hansberry knew how high the stakes were, and whose lives were in danger. She had seen buses and churches firebombed, children horribly beaten during nonviolent sit-ins. They were not people like Silberman.\n\nAs the Golden Globes approached, more people announced their plans to don all-black. I kept trying to imagine an entire sea of actors, lined up silently in black, women and men. Nonviolent, visual protests have a long history of forming images that can quickly go viral and set a powerful tone for a moment. There is a physicality to them, a choreography, that when done right, cannot be underestimated. My mind kept returning to the idea that they were still planning to attend the events altogether. Why not sit it out? Stay home? Boycott everything altogether?\n\nI remained unmoved until Mary J. Blige confirmed her plans to attend in all-black. \u201cI am one of those women, so, you know, I stand with those women. I champion them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many women that don\u2019t get a chance to speak in other industries that are not the film industry, the music industry. It\u2019s important for us to stand up for them so they can get a chance to speak.\u201d Ms. Blige was nominated for her stirring portrayal of Florence Jackson, the head of a sharecropping family in Mississippi, and she deserves to be there to accept the award if she wins. She deserves to be on television, in all-black, signaling to the women at home who were fans of her music for years that she recognizes and cares about them.

{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "As 1968 began, the United States and North Vietnam aspired to victory in the year ahead. Khe Sanh figured prominently in the plans of both. The anchor of the American stronghold at Khe Sanh was a Marine combat base perched on a plateau between an old French road, Route 9, and the Rao Quan River, about seven miles east of the border with Laos and 15 miles south of the demilitarized zone dividing North Vietnam from South. A fan-shaped array of outposts, including an American Army Special Forces camp, guarded approaches to the base from the north and west.\n\nIn January 1968, two North Vietnamese Army divisions \u2014 some 20,000 men \u2014 converged on Khe Sanh from the west. Another division moved to a position northeast of Khe Sanh.\n\nThe first phase of the North Vietnamese plan, \u201cGeneral Offensive and General Uprising,\u201d called for Communist troops to provoke a series of interior battles to lure American forces from the populous coast. One of those battles was to occur at Khe Sanh.\n\nBut the ruling Politburo in Hanoi had split over the next phase. A faction led by the ascendant Le Duan, the general secretary of the Central Committee, called for urban attacks aimed at igniting a popular uprising. In opposition to that risky approach were North Vietnam\u2019s aging revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh, and his military chief, Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, architect of the victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. Ultimately, Le Duan outflanked his opponents and the urban offensive was incorporated into the plan. The attacks on southern cities were to unfold as Vietnam celebrated the lunar new year \u2014 Tet \u2014 in late January 1968.\n\nIn Saigon, General Westmoreland welcomed the Communist move against Khe Sanh. He laid plans for an unprecedented artillery and air response to cripple his North Vietnamese adversaries in a rare conventional confrontation.\n\nThe drama at Khe Sanh got underway with a flurry of N.V.A. attacks in the early hours of Sunday, Jan. 21. An enemy ground assault penetrated a Marine outpost on Hill 861 before failing. Communist artillery bombarded Khe Sanh Combat Base, detonating the main ammunition dump. Other North Vietnamese troops attacked the district headquarters compound in nearby Khe Sanh village.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

At night, N.V.A. soldiers probed Khe Sanh\u2019s defenses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConcerns of a massive ground assault on Khe Sanh increased after the Communist urban attacks began on Jan. 31. The following day, President Johnson\u2019s chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Earle Wheeler, asked General Westmoreland whether tactical nuclear weapons might be required to save Khe Sanh. Westmoreland hedged his bets. In a worst-case scenario, he said in a secret cable, \u201cI visualize that either tactical nuclear weapons or chemical agents would be active candidates for employment.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 5, as fighting continued in Saigon, Hue and other cities, the North Vietnamese attacked a key Khe Sanh outpost on Hill 861 Alpha. Communist forces pierced the Marine perimeter, but the attack was finally broken by a massive artillery barrage aided by electronic sensors and punctuated with a ground counterattack. The following night, the Army Special Forces camp southwest of the base was overrun in a ground assault supported by 11 Russian-made PT-76 light tanks. On Feb. 8, N.V.A. soldiers attacked a small Marine outpost barely a mile southwest of the base.\n\nCommunist forces set to work encircling the base with trenches and concealed gun positions, imperiling the stronghold\u2019s aerial supply lifeline. In Washington, retired Gen. Maxwell Taylor, a respected World War II veteran and former ambassador to South Vietnam, advised President Johnson to abandon Khe Sanh. Food and water were rationed in the outposts, and wounded men sometimes died awaiting helicopter evacuation flights. The sense of crisis deepened on Feb. 10 when a Marine C-130 transport was hit by enemy fire and forced to crash-land at Khe Sanh, killing eight Americans.\n\nThat same week, unknown to General Westmoreland and the Marines, Communist commanders shifted a third of their siege force from Khe Sanh to the battle for Hue, 50 miles to the southeast. Years after the war, Westmoreland\u2019s intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Phillip B. Davidson Jr., remained baffled by the decision. The North Vietnamese \u201ckept too many troops at Khe Sanh just to threaten it, and too few to overrun it.\u201d It is one of many unsolved mysteries that still shroud the battle for Khe Sanh.\n\nThe siege reached its climax in the last week of February 1968, although this, too, became evident only much later.\n\nOn Feb. 24, American forces launched Operation Sierra, colloquially known as the Super Gaggle, for the large number of aircraft involved. It involved inundating enemy gun positions around Khe Sanh with tear gas, smoke, high explosives and napalm, allowing big Sea Knight helicopters to swoop in to the hilltop outposts and drop external nets packed with supplies. The resupply crisis eased.\n\nThe following day, fear of an imminent assault on the base peaked after the decimation of a Marine patrol and discovery of new Communist trenches extending to within a few yards of the southeastern perimeter wire. On the night of Feb. 29, N.V.A. forces undertook three waves of attacks on the eastern perimeter of Khe Sanh Combat Base. The Americans activated an elaborate plan to trap and slaughter Communist forces with coordinated B-52 strikes and other air and artillery missions. A few N.V.A. soldiers reached the perimeter wire before the final attack failed.\n\nNorth Vietnamese pressure on Khe Sanh eased in March as improved weather resulted in even heavier American air and artillery attacks. With the arrival of a joint Army-Marine relief force, American commanders declared an end to the siege on April 8.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the weeks ahead, the Army forces departed and fresh Marine battalions arrived, encountering even bloodier combat than during the siege. But by then the reporters had moved on, and General Westmoreland was on his way out, replaced by Gen. Creighton Abrams. In early July, Khe Sanh Combat Base was dismantled, and, in a scene that foreshadowed the events of April 1975, the last Americans left hurriedly by helicopter. North Vietnamese radio proclaimed victory at Khe Sanh.\n\nNearly 1,000 Americans died in the 1968 fighting around Khe Sanh (far more than the discredited official toll). Estimates of Communist losses ranged from 2,500 to 15,000 killed.\n\nThe full intentions of the North Vietnamese at Khe Sanh remain unclear. For decades, the Hanoi party line has held that Khe Sanh was solely a ruse to mask the urban attacks \u2014 a self-serving claim by ideologues who view history as a tool of the revolution rather than a search for objective truth. That claim has been amplified by respected Vietnam War correspondents such as Neil Sheehan and the late Stanley Karnow. Largely ignored is a competing analysis that contends the North Vietnamese intended to cap their 1968 offensive with the coup de gr\u00e2ce inflicted on the Americans at Khe Sanh. Until the Vietnamese government opens its wartime archives, we won\u2019t know for sure what Khe Sanh was about.", "title": "The Enduring Debate Over Khe Sanh", "authors": ["Gregg Jones"]}

When he was besieged by female fans at his hotel, the promoter Bill Graham let him stay at his houseboat in Sausalito.\n\nRedding spent his days quietly looking at the water; freed from the usual demands of travel, he could relax and write songs. His road manager, Earl Sims (known as Speedo), said he was the only witness the day Redding picked up his guitar and wrote a new song that began \u201cSittin\u2019 in the morning sun/I\u2019ll be sittin\u2019 when the evening comes.\u201d\n\nMr. Sims was used to tapping out a simple beat when his boss was writing songs, acting as a human metronome. The rhythm of this new one was totally different, he said in an interview. \u201cIt took me a minute to get into what he was doing. He was away, and he was on the water, and he was relaxed. That\u2019s why he started that song.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Redding returned home, he played the song for his wife. \u201cMy comment at the time was that it was very different, unusual for him,\u201d she said \u2014 meaning she didn\u2019t care for it. \u201cHe said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to change my style, going to be different.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat October, Redding had surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords; while recuperating, he couldn\u2019t speak, so he grew a beard and spent hours in silent contemplation. Five weeks later, his voice sounded better than ever, and he was eager to get some of his new ideas on wax.\n\nSteve Cropper, who regularly backed Redding up as the guitarist for Booker T. and the MG\u2019s (a.k.a. the Stax house band), remembered Redding calling him from the Memphis airport to make sure he was at the studio. When Redding arrived, the pair sat on beige folding chairs, hammering out the song. \u201cI helped him with the second verse a little bit, helped him with the bridge,\u201d Mr. Cropper said in a phone interview. \u201cAfter he sang, \u2018I watch the ships roll in, watch them roll out again,\u2019 I said, \u2018Have you thought that if a ship rolls, it\u2019s going to take on water and sink?\u2019\u201d Redding told him, \u201cThat\u2019s the way I want it, Crop.\u201d\n\nThe duo went into the studio in November, joined by Donald Dunn (known as Duck) on bass, Al Jackson on drums, Booker T. Jones on piano and three horn players. In an interview, Mr. Jones remembered the sessions as having \u201ckind of a hectic feeling \u2014 so much so that I remember a number of people sleeping over at the studio.\u201d Redding and Mr. Cropper planned to ask the Staple Singers to contribute backing vocals to \u201cDock of the Bay,\u201d which never happened. The whistling at the song\u2019s end came in a section earmarked for vocal ad-libbing; on one early take, Redding sputtered and the engineer Ron Capone told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make it as a whistler.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the sessions, Redding went back on the road. \u201cI\u2019ll see you on Monday,\u201d were his last words to Mr. Cropper. He had recently acquired a Beechcraft Model 18 airplane so he and his touring band, the Bar-Kays, could fly around the country to play shows on weekends, letting him regularly return to Memphis. But on Dec. 10, 1967, as he flew into Madison, Wis., the plane stalled and crashed into Lake Monona, killing seven people, including Redding. It fell to a shattered Mr. Cropper to finish \u201cDock of the Bay\u201d for a rush release. \u201cIf I had a week to work on it, it probably would have been overembellished,\u201d he said. (He finished the job in 24 hours.)\n\nDifferent lines of the song resonate with those who have covered it over the years. Michael Bolton recorded the second-most-successful version of the track (a No. 11 hit in 1988). In an email, he said he thinks the song\u2019s key lyric is \u201clook like nothing\u2019s gonna change, everything remains the same.\u201d \u201cIt states the obvious lack of our evolution as a society,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMr. Jones agreed that line has a special power. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those lyrics that has the capability of touching anyone who\u2019s been through changes, loneliness, trying to find a secure place in the world,\u201d he said.

In 2013, he and his colleagues reviewed death records of hundreds of thousands of Dutch people born in the mid-1940s.\n\nThey found that the people who had been in utero during the famine \u2014 known as the Dutch Hunger Winter cohort \u2014 died at a higher rate than people born before or afterward. \u201cWe found a 10 percent increase in mortality after 68 years,\u201d said Dr. Lumey.\n\nThe patterns that Dr. Lumey and his colleagues documented are not disputed, but scientists still are struggling to understand how they come about.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHow on earth can your body remember the environment it was exposed to in the womb \u2014 and remember that decades later?\u201d wondered Bas Heijmans, a geneticist at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands.\n\nDr. Heijmans, Dr. Lumey and their colleagues published a possible answer, or part of one, on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. Their study suggests that the Dutch Hunger Winter silenced certain genes in unborn children \u2014 and that they\u2019ve stayed quiet ever since.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile all cells in a person\u2019s body share the same genes, different ones are active or silent in different cells. That program largely is locked in place before birth.\n\nBut scientists have learned that later experiences \u2014 say, exposure to a virus \u2014 can cause cells to quiet a gene or boost its activity, sometimes permanently.\n\nThe study of this long-term gene control is called epigenetics. Researchers have identified molecules that cells use to program DNA, but how those tools work isn\u2019t entirely clear. One of the best studied is a molecular cap called a methyl group.\n\nAt millions of spots across our DNA, genes may carry a methyl group. They seem to silence genes \u2014 at least, researchers have found that silenced genes often have a collection of methyl groups lurking nearby.\n\nMany researchers have speculated that prenatal conditions can influence people\u2019s health across their lifetime, and some have speculated that methyl groups or other forms of epigenetics put this so-called fetal programming into action.\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to put that idea to a firm test. The Dutch Hunger Winter might offer an opportunity, Dr. Heijmans and Dr. Lumey realized.\n\nWhen Dr. Lumey first started studying the Dutch Hunger Winter cohort in the 1990s, he took blood samples from thousands of middle-aged subjects. He also took samples from their siblings, born before or after the famine.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They retrieved DNA from the samples and placed it in a device able to find methyl groups at nearly 350,000 spots on the genome.\n\nNext, the researchers looked for odd patterns. They searched for methyl groups that were common in the Dutch Hunger Winter cohort, for example, but missing from their siblings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen they turned their attention to the health of their subjects. They sorted people according to their body mass index, for example, and looked for methyl groups that were unusually common in overweight people.\n\nFinally, the researchers merged the results \u2014 and found a few methyl groups that were linked both to the famine and to health conditions later in life. \u201cWe were able to connect the three dots,\u201d said Dr. Lumey.\n\nDr. Lumey and his colleagues propose that these methyl groups disrupt how cells normally use genes. One methyl group that is linked to a higher body mass index may be able to quiet a gene called PIM3, which is involved in burning the body\u2019s fuel.\n\nSo here\u2019s the theory: Perhaps the Dutch Hunger Winter added a methyl group to fetuses born to starving mothers, which made the PIM3 gene less active \u2014 and continued to do so for life.\n\nThe result? \u201cMaybe your metabolism is in a lower gear,\u201d Dr. Heijmans said.\n\nDalton Conley, a biosociologist at Princeton University who was not involved in the new study, said that there might be other explanations for the results. Perhaps putting on extra weight as you age triggers an epigenetic change to PIM3, rather than the other way around.\n\nAnd the Dutch famine probably led to many miscarriages and early deaths. It\u2019s possible that the survivors had some genetic variant that made them resilient and gave them a distinctive epigenetic profile not captured in this study.\n\nJohn M. Greally, the director of the Center for Epigenomics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, noted that blood is made up of many different types of cells, each with its own epigenetic profile.\n\nMaybe the Dutch famine made some types of cells more common, he said, rather than altering the epigenetics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Heijmans and his colleagues studied the same methyl groups in muscle cells, fat cells and other tissues they got from cadavers. In any given person, the pattern was roughly the same.\n\nStill, Dr. Heijmans said that the new study would need to be followed up \u2014 for example, with carefully controlled experiments on animals that can shed more light on how a pregnant mother\u2019s food supply affects the epigenetics of her offspring.\n\nIf scientists can solve the Dutch Hunger Winter\u2019s lingering mysteries, they might also get some clues to how other kinds of stress can reprogram children\u2019s health even before they\u2019re born.\n\nDr. Lumey speculated that epigenetic profiles might someday allow doctors to detect changes that would lead to problems much later in life. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait for sixty years,\u201d he said.", "title": "The Famine Ended 70 Years Ago, but Dutch Genes Still Bear Scars", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

(The address is 1 Ikea Street.) I was writing a book about his closest friend, Otto Ullman \u2014 a Jewish refugee from Austria hired as a farmhand by the Kamprad family during the war \u2014 and had asked for a meeting. Once we\u2019d introduced ourselves Mr. Kamprad took hold of me by the waist, as if we were on the dance floor and he wanted to check out my figure. Then we sat down, my recorder went on, and an interview of two and a half hours began.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the size of Mr. Kamprad\u2019s empire. Stepping off the train at the Almhult station, you have two pedestrian bridges to choose from: One takes you into the town itself, with a population of around 10,000; the other takes you to Ikea \u2014 or, to be more precise, to the Ikea Hotel, Ikea Tillsammans (a cultural center), the Ikea Museum and the Ikea Test Lab, along with a sprawling complex of corporate departments. And while most of the world knows Ikea solely for its inexpensive furniture and giant blue stores, in Sweden its image is inextricable from the life of Ingvar Kamprad. In the museum, design history intermingles with family snapshots.\n\nAs with the bridges at Almhult, there are also two ways into the Ikea story. One is uplifting and inspirational: A young man from a modest background, but with more than the usual dose of business acumen, builds an empire. Although the hero of the story makes the occasional mistake, that is precisely what makes him human and such a treasured symbol of Swedishness.\n\nThe other story leads from Mr. Kamprad\u2019s childhood and adolescence in a Hitler-loving family, Germans who had immigrated from the Sudetenland, in Czechoslovakia, where both his paternal grandmother and his father were Nazis; his long-lasting commitment to the Swedish fascist movement; and his membership, during World War II, in Sweden\u2019s Nazi party, Swedish Socialist Unity.

It was always feekoosul (the ficus, in Romanian) or the feekoos in my parents\u2019 Romanian-tinted English. For a long time I thought ficus was a Romanian word and I had no idea how to refer to it in English. Now I have an abundance of words for the plant I have: ficus elastica, rubber fig, Indian rubber bush.\n\nHow did my grandmother get the ficus through customs? She\u2019d jumped tougher hurdles than that. She carried an infant through a war that started months after she gave birth. She negotiated with border guards. She breast-fed as bombs fell from the sky.\n\nAfter the war, Communism swallowed the country whole and in the 1960s its last dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, came to power. He ruled moderately at first, and then brutally through the 1980s. Conversations were whispered in corners, away from tapped phones; friends and neighbors were forced to turn on one another; food shortages left everyone hungry.\n\nMy grandmother came to New Jersey two years before the revolution that toppled the tyrant. She wrapped the ficus branch in a damp cloth and hid it in her black coat. She wore only black. When I suggested maroon she laughed: \u201cAt my age?\u201d She settled into my room. I was 17 and would be leaving for college in a year anyway, so I took the guest room. On the day she arrived she filled a glass with water and plunked the branch inside, just as my father had done more than half a century earlier. \u201cIf the ficus takes root here then I\u2019ll take root too,\u201d she said.\n\nAt first we argued. She wanted to take care of us; we didn\u2019t want to be taken care of. She insisted on shoveling the snow off the front steps of my parents\u2019 house and we couldn\u2019t seem to stop her.

And once, write what you think happiness is. My grandmother\u2019s answer: Happiness is when your life on the outside matches your life on the inside. Still the best definition I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nMy grandmother took root. And then she grew.\n\nAfter five years in New Jersey, at the age of 83, she became a United States citizen.

She watched concerts on PBS, baked beautiful strudels, gossiped about her neighbors, and was interested in every aspect of our lives and life in general. One month after her 100th birthday, she died in her sleep. She had been living on her own for 12 years.\n\nWhen I moved to Massachusetts in my mid-20s, my father broke off a small branch of the ficus, as he had done when he was 8 years old, and gave it to me to plant in my new home.\n\nMany years later, shortly after my grandmother passed, I moved to New York with my own branch, clipped from the plant that had hit the ceiling of my Cambridge apartment.

In the 1960s and 1970s, an array of new categories were added, including prizes in science, philosophy and religion, history and biography, arts and letters, contemporary thought, autobiography, first novel, original paperback and children\u2019s books, as well as a prize for translation. Then, in 1986, the organization scaled back drastically, to just two awards, for fiction and nonfiction. It later added poetry and young people\u2019s literature.\n\nThe new translation prize marks the first time the foundation has added a category in more than two decades.\n\nOther literary institutions have also made efforts to highlight works in translation. PEN America, formerly the PEN American Center, has given out a translation prize to highlight international works since the 1960s. In 2015, the Booker Prize Foundation recast its international prize, which was previously open to novelists writing in English, as an award dedicated to fiction in translation.\n\nWhen other major literary awards have expanded their geographic reach, there\u2019s occasionally been a backlash. In 2014, the Man Booker Prize, which was previously open only to writers from Britain, Ireland, Zimbabwe and the Commonwealth, began considering any novel written in English and published in Britain, prompting complaints that the prize was sacrificing its British character. Some expressed concern that American writers would dominate the award, and those fears have been heightened in recent years as Americans have made up a disproportionate share of writers who make the shortlist. (For the last two years, the Booker has gone to Paul Beatty and George Saunders, who are both from the United States).", "title": "The Globalization of the National Book Awards", "authors": []}

Calvin Klein and Tiffany wisely topped theirs by first noting their support for Time\u2019s Up, and only then releasing the details of the outfits, but they were in the minority.

Otherwise I would have agreed with everything you said and then where would we be conversation-wise?\n\nIt is true that the guy who killed eight innocent people with a truck in Manhattan was a product of the visa program, a program that was started to give more Irish and Italians a chance to legally immigrate.\n\nBut what drives me nuts is that the president constantly points to this one terrible crime as an argument that the visa program is bad, while every single day we have stories about innocent people blasted to smithereens by guns, and we never hear a peep. If we wanted to keep America safe, we would really, really crack down on gun purchases.\n\nHowever, I am not demanding we do that to keep the government open.\n\nBret: Please don\u2019t get me wrong. My objection is to the visa lottery, not what\u2019s invidiously called \u201cchain\u201d migration. As you and many others have reminded us, this is how many of our ancestors arrived in this country and worked their tails off so that they could afford to pay steerage for their wives and children. Republicans used to be the \u201cpro-family\u201d party, but that was in days of yore, when George W. Bush was president.\n\nI wrote a column last week pointing out that the same stereotypes and slanders applied today by people like Jeff Sessions against present-day immigrants were made over a century ago against my impoverished Jewish ancestors, who didn\u2019t speak English, didn\u2019t have Ph.D.s, and in a few cases held dangerous political views.

{"date": "2018-01-04 00:00:00", "text": "Five Japanese television networks covered Hanyu\u2019s performance at the Rostelecom Cup in Moscow. So did several dozen print journalists and photographers who recorded his every jump, spin and utterance. Last spring, the skating website icenetwork.com found Hanyu on the cover of 19 publications called mooks \u2014 a combination of magazine and book \u2014 at a Japanese bookstore.\n\nThe bookstore was not in Tokyo. It was in Midtown Manhattan.\n\n\u201cIt reminds me of when Michael Jackson was in his heyday, or meeting the Pope,\u201d said Jackie Wong, a prominent skating blogger and former skater who lives in New York. \u201cPeople see Hanyu for the first time and they become hysterical or they\u2019re moved to tears. It\u2019s like their lives are complete. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nAs Hanyu was introduced in Moscow for the short program at the Rostelecom Cup, Japanese fans waved small national flags. On one side of the rink alone, there were 16 banners proclaiming \u201cGo Yuzu\u201d and other exhortations. As Hanyu began to perform to Chopin, the crowd grew so quiet that the scrape of his blades could be heard in the upper reaches of Megasport Arena.\n\nA month earlier, Hanyu had set a world record for points for a short program. But in Moscow, he landed clumsily on a quadruple loop and put his hands to the ice after an awkward combination jump. The judges placed him second to Chen. Still, Hanyu\u2019s appreciative fans showered the ice with dozens of Pooh dolls.\n\n\u201cDid you see the Poohs?\u201d Yoshiko Kobayashi, the high-performance director of the Japanese Skating Federation, later asked an American reporter. \u201cThe ice turned yellow.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a news conference with international reporters, Hanyu was engulfed on a dais by Japanese reporters and photographers.\n\nKobayashi pulled a stopwatch from her purse.\n\n\u201cI control,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Japanese reporters would have five minutes, she said. She gave them almost seven, then freed Hanyu from the scrum.\n\nThe next day, Hanyu\u2019s fans again gathered to watch his free skate. Among them was Saori Kanayama, 30, a Japanese flight attendant who had traveled from Dubai for the competition. She had planned her vacation to attend the Olympics. All she needed was a ticket.\n\nHanyu\u2019s fans wrote thousands of letters to him, made dolls in his likeness and sent him origami, cookies and towels to wipe his face after training. Kanayama brought rock music CDs with her.\n\n\u201cHe has too many Poohs,\u201d she said.\n\nHer reasons for following Hanyu\u2019s career so closely were partly cultural. \u201cJapanese people are shy, we are not supposed to show our honest feelings,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a skater, Yuzuru doesn\u2019t hesitate to show how much he wants to be No. 1.\u201d\n\nWearing a white tunic and skating as a character out of Japanese folklore, Abe no Seimei, a kind of soothsayer and supernatural protector, Hanyu landed a quadruple lutz for the first time in competition. It is the most difficult of the four-revolution jumps currently being performed, requiring the jab of a toe pick, a liftoff from the back outside edge of one skate and a landing on the back outside edge of the other skate.\n\nBut the performance was not flawless. Hanyu finished second over all to Chen. Some of his fans cried in the stands, including one wearing a costume identical to Hanyu\u2019s.\n\nFrank Carroll, a renowned American coach who guided Evan Lysacek to a 2010 Olympic gold medal, attended the Rostelecom Cup. In his view, Hanyu seemed diminished.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what he had a few years ago,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know he does some beautiful things, but I don\u2019t see the inspiration.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference, Hanyu complimented Chen as \u201ca wonderfully talented person who does great jumps with a balletic expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to practice more and more,\u201d Hanyu said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe next evening, Hanyu\u2019s supporters were newly ebullient in filling the lobby of Moscow\u2019s Aerostar Hotel, where the skaters were feted at a banquet. The fans formed two lines through which skaters walked, some stopping briefly for photos and autographs.\n\nA kind of spirit seemed to overtake Hanyu when he skated, lending him endearing masculine and feminine qualities, said one fan, Junko Ino, 36, a teacher from Fukuoka, Japan.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s powerful and tender,\u201d Ino said. \u201cHis emotion will heal your heart.\u201d\n\nSayuri Arimoto, 50, a software engineer, had traveled from San Mateo, Calif., to see Hanyu, even if it left her co-workers puzzled. \u201cYou travel to Europe just for figure skating?\u201d they asked her.\n\nWhen Hanyu was home in Japan, he sometimes skated at midnight for peace and quiet, his coach said. And in Toronto, where he trained most of the time, he occasionally called his coach to ask for a ride, uncomfortable with some fans who knew his daily routine and waited to ride the bus with him.\n\nAt the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club, Hanyu\u2019s team makes a great effort to answer his fan mail and to keep fans, bloggers and other journalists from intruding to videotape his practices.\n\n\u201cYou can have a bad day and nobody\u2019s going to be writing about it,\u201d said Orser, Hanyu\u2019s coach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen he did not receive a desired result, Hanyu said, he felt a need to apologize to his fans, but did not consider the expectations of his supporters and the news media to be a burden.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHonestly,\u201d he said through an interpreter, \u201csometimes I\u2019m feeling like they treat me as a celebrity or an idol, but I\u2019m not quite that. But I understand they\u2019re all here to support me and I appreciate that passion.\u201d\n\nIn the lobby of the Aerostar Hotel, Hanyu emerged through a side door, wearing a black suit for the banquet. He almost reached the elevators before fans noticed him. They hurried to take photos and videos. Among them was Hiroko Sato, 49, a neighbor of Hanyu\u2019s in Sendai, Japan. Her family\u2019s construction company had sustained damage during the 2011 earthquake.\n\nHanyu was training at the Sendai rink and, terrified, ran outside in his skates when the ice began to rumble. He and his parents and his sister were left without electricity or drinking water. They spent three days at an emergency shelter at a gymnasium. The rink closed for several months, leaving him a skating vagabond.\n\nUpon winning a gold medal at the 2014 Olympics, Hanyu, then 19, worried aloud that his victory would be a frivolous gesture to those who had suffered in Sendai. That was not true, said Sato, his neighbor. Hanyu skated in a benefit for victims of the earthquake and donated royalties from his two autobiographies to the rink in Sendai.\n\nHanyu had called her after the earthquake, she said, asking, \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d and telling her, \u201cHang in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave hope for us,\u201d Sato said. She teared up as she recounted the destruction of the earthquake. \u201cHe got the gold medal at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThe second week of November, Hanyu was set to compete in his second major pre-Olympic event of the season, the NHK Trophy in Osaka, Japan. Orser, his coach, had described Hanyu as being \u201cso focused, so driven\u201d that he was \u201con the verge of manic\u201d in his determination to win a second Olympic gold medal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOrser tried to convince Hanyu that there should be a natural ebb and flow to a long skating season. Button, the 1948 and 1952 Olympic champion, cautioned Hanyu not to overtrain. And one of Hanyu\u2019s idols, Evgeni Plushenko of Russia, the 2006 Olympic champion, suggested that Hanyu would not need five quadruple jumps in his Olympic free skate as Chen of the United States aspired to.\n\nShoma Uno, a Japanese teenager who finished second to Hanyu at the 2017 world championships, was also a magnificent jumper. But Hanyu had a decided edge over other skaters in the completeness of his performance \u2014 spins, skating skills, transitions between jumps and musical interpretation, Plushenko said.\n\n\u201cIf he has three quads and skates clean, he can win the Olympics one more time,\u201d Plushenko said. \u201cIf he does all the things he can, he\u2019s going to win easily.\u201d\n\nThe biggest hurdle to his own failed attempt to repeat as Olympic champion, Plushenko said, was injury: \u201cIn my head I was ready to skate but my body is sometimes going, \u2018No, wait, please, please.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis words were prescient. On Nov. 9, a day before the NHK Trophy began, Hanyu attempted a quadruple lutz in practice, but his legs landed in a pretzled position. More than 100 Japanese journalists turned up at a news conference that evening to learn of Hanyu\u2019s condition.\n\nThe next day, it was announced that he had ligament damage in his right ankle but would try to compete. Instead, he withdrew. (Weeks later, it would be revealed that the ankle had also sustained tendon and bone damage.)\n\n\u201cI am very sorry to have everyone worried,\u201d Hanyu said in a statement.\n\nAt Osaka\u2019s Municipal Central Gymnasium, where the NHK Trophy went on without Hanyu, his fans were left dejected. Zeng Yuemeng, 28, an Osaka airport worker, said she had moved to Japan from China in July because of her favorite skater. She carried a Pooh keychain on her purse.\n\n\u201cBecause this is his country,\u201d Zeng said of Hanyu, \u201cmaybe I can see why he has become such a perfect human.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther fans took a half-hour train ride to pray for Hanyu at a Shinto shrine in Kobe, Japan. Because the shrine\u2019s name \u2014 Yuzuruha \u2014 resembled the first name of the skater, it had become a popular place for fans to write their well-wishes to Hanyu on round wooden plaques. Hundreds of plaques hung on racks at the shrine.", "title": "The Greatest Figure Skater Ever Is Michael Jackson on Ice, Surrounded by Winnie the Poohs", "authors": ["Jer\u00e9 Longman"]}

The challenges mirror many of the difficulties faced by legacy publications the world over as they attempt to transition to more digitally savvy operations.\n\nThe Guardian had long been a standard-bearer in Britain for that shift. The left-wing publication focused on courting vast numbers of readers around the world, and it hired dozens of reporters in the United States and Australia in particular. It has ardently refused to set up a paywall \u2014 the preferred strategy of many of its rivals, from The Times of London to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times \u2014 opting instead to ask its readers for donations, even setting up a nonprofit arm to help fund its journalism.\n\nFor a while, that strategy appeared to bear fruit. The Guardian shared a Pulitzer Prize with The Washington Post in 2014 for coverage of documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor.

President Lyndon B. Johnson said \u201cnigger\u201d nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.\n\nThis denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.\n\nI grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban \u201chell\u201d of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words \u201call men are created equal,\u201d which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people \u201care inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump\u2019s denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.\n\nFifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near \u201cdangerous\u201d black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted affirmative action policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture \u2014 all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.\n\nNixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to \u201cavoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by\u201d the \u201cracist appeal.\u201d\n\nA new vocabulary emerged, allowing users to evade admissions of racism.

Two weeks ago he promised to deliver them a \u201cbill of love.\u201d But two days later he rejected a bipartisan deal to that end. On Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, Mr. Trump reportedly reached an agreement with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, which would have protected Dreamers and increased border security, but he then reversed course at the urging of the anti-immigrant hawks who circle the Oval Office \u2014 mainly his chief of staff, John Kelly, and senior adviser, Stephen Miller.

First, it suffers from something of an identity crisis, since despite its name it\u2019s not really a rib. Second, it has an indeterminate composition, consisting of both light and dark meat. Finally, it has a tendency to slide into disreputable territory, since its name is sometimes appropriated for less desirable cuts.\n\nBut like any good antihero, the country-style rib has hidden virtues. It has rich, deep pork flavor; it is generally the most inexpensive cut of pork at the meat counter; and it is ideal for those slow-cooked dishes we crave in cool weather.\n\nTo understand this cut, you first need to know the blade pork chop. This chop is cut from the two ribs at the shoulder end of the pork loin.

But the size and urgency of the project were too much for the military\u2019s engineers (many of whom were in the reserves, and so were not called up in time). Therefore, the Pentagon decided to rely on civilian construction contractors. In 1962, the Navy, which oversaw most of the large construction efforts, signed a contract with a joint venture between two large firms, Raymond International and Morrison-Knudsen, to build jet-capable airfields at Saigon, Da Nang and Pleiku.\n\nBy mid-1965, it was clear that the construction program was growing beyond the joint venture\u2019s capacity, so the Navy broadened the construction consortium by adding Brown & Root, Inc. and J. A. Jones Construction Company. The consortium was then known as RMK-BRJ, and was managed by Morrison-Knudsen. By July 1966, the consortium had 51,000 employees, more than two-thirds of whom were Vietnamese. At its high point of activity, in March 1967, the consortium was spending $64 million a month, or $478 million in 2017 dollars.\n\nConstruction materials and equipment were provided to the contractor by the government. In 1966, the Navy put in an order for 196 million board-feet of lumber to build troop barracks \u2014 an order that, to be fulfilled, absorbed virtually all of the West Coast\u2019s timber capacity for the entire year. The Navy also ordered 10,000 doors and 750,000 tons of cement. To construct the various facilities, the government provided RMK-BRJ with 5,560 pieces of equipment; the consortium also leased or chartered 16 aircraft, two landing ships, 10 landing craft, 14 dredges, 30 barges and 10 tugboats.\n\nAlongside the contractors, at the peak of activity in 1968 more than 55,000 military engineers were in South Vietnam, including Navy Seabees, Army engineers, Air Force \u201cRed Horse\u201d squadrons and Marine combat engineers. In addition to building the forward combat bases, the military engineers constructed roads in operational areas as well as cantonment facilities \u2014 i.e., barracks, dining halls and training sites \u2014 at major bases. Later in the war, the Seabees and Army construction units participated in the largest single military construction effort, a network of highways strung around the country called the Lines of Communication, which cost about $500 million, or $3.7 billion today.\n\nThese units didn\u2019t just build big; they built fast. In 1966, Navy Seabees rebuilt the damaged airfield at Khe Sanh in four days, with 3,900 feet of 60-foot-wide aluminum matting to serve cargo planes. Westmoreland \u201ccalled it one of the most outstanding military engineering feats in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the war wound down, the construction program grew again to build up the ability of South Vietnam to prosecute the war and boost the economy. The Lines of Communication construction program was central to this effort in order to provide access for farmers to markets, comprising 1,750 miles of highways and bridges. The Americans also built housing for 450,000 Vietnamese servicemen and their families to improve the morale of the Vietnamese military, and thereby increase military capabilities.\n\nThe Navy closed out the RMK-BRJ construction contract in July 1972, for a grand total of $1.9 billion (equivalent to $14 billion today), not including government-furnished materials and equipment. While this contract allowed the combat mission of the Americans to proceed, it also left in place projects that continue to serve the Vietnamese people today, especially the seaports, airports, highways and bridges.\n\nIt also developed a Vietnamese construction industry, which allowed the Navy to award fixed-price construction contracts to Vietnamese contractors in 1971 and 1972. RMK-BRJ trained 200,000 Vietnamese employees in construction trades as well as administrative services, creating a skilled work force that remained long after the Americans had left.\n\nAt the July 3, 1972, closeout ceremony for the RMK-BRJ contract, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker stated: \u201cConstruction in the cause of war has also brought construction in the cause of peace and progress.\u201d Amid the terrible destruction of nearly a decade of conflict, he called the American military\u2019s construction blitz \u201cone of the finest episodes in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d", "title": "The Largest Military Construction Project in History", "authors": ["Mel Schenck"]}

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "Apart from chastening the cybersecurity experts in the Pentagon, the Strava debacle underscores a crucial misconception at the heart of the system of privacy protection in the United States. The privacy of data cannot be managed person-by-person through a system of individualized informed consent.\n\nData privacy is not like a consumer good, where you click \u201cI accept\u201d and all is well. Data privacy is more like air quality or safe drinking water, a public good that cannot be effectively regulated by trusting in the wisdom of millions of individual choices. A more collective response is needed.\n\nPart of the problem with the ideal of individualized informed consent is that it assumes companies have the ability to inform us about the risks we are consenting to. They don\u2019t. Strava surely did not intend to reveal the GPS coordinates of a possible Central Intelligence Agency annex in Mogadishu, Somalia \u2014 but it may have done just that. Even if all technology companies meant well and acted in good faith, they would not be in a position to let you know what exactly you were signing up for.\n\nAnother part of the problem is the increasingly powerful computational methods called machine learning, which can take seemingly inconsequential data about you and, combining them with other data, can discover facts about you that you never intended to reveal. For example, research shows that data as minor as your Facebook \u201clikes\u201d can be used to infer your sexual orientation, whether you use addictive substances, your race and your views on many political issues. This kind of computational statistical inference is not 100 percent accurate, but it can be fairly close \u2014 certainly close enough to be used to profile you for a variety of purposes.\n\nA challenging feature of machine learning is that exactly how a given system works is opaque. Nobody \u2014 not even those who have access to the code and data \u2014 can tell what piece of data came together with what other piece of data to result in the finding the program made. This further undermines the notion of informed consent, as we do not know which data results in what privacy consequences. What we do know is that these algorithms work better the more data they have. This creates an incentive for companies to collect and store as much data as possible, and to bury the privacy ramifications, either in legalese or by playing dumb and being vague.", "title": "Opinion | The Latest Data Privacy Debacle", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "Others, like @gleamingrazor, look ahead practically to how things can be done differently in the future. The Islamic State experience, he notes, has made it clear that \u201ca state cannot be declared amid the fog of war and uncertainty.\u201d Mr. Baghdadi demanded that millions emigrate to his \u201cstate\u201d but couldn\u2019t offer them security or employment. Next time, any leader presuming to declare statehood would need to control territory with industry and scientific research facilities; he would need an economic policy, the ability to conduct trade and commerce, and control over an electricity grid. Mr. Baghdadi\u2019s caliphate was a \u201cdisgrace,\u201d but it \u201cimbued in us a renewed sense of hope and longing.\u201d It also demonstrated that any feasible Islamic state would require the taking over of an existing state. \u201cMaybe, just maybe, a Muslim general somewhere would be inspired.\u201d\n\nPerhaps to be expected, the emotional commitment to a caliphate holds strong among those who joined the Islamic State, only to be devastated by the outcome. One woman from Tunisia I met in a refugee camp outside Raqqa this past summer, who fled with her children and was later detained by Syrian Defense Forces, said: \u201cIf the Islamic State was real, I would not have left it. I would prefer to have died there than leave it.\u201d Instead, she said, it turned out to be a band of vicious men intent on collecting cars and women. The Tunisian woman wanted to go home, but most of the Islamic State women detained alongside her didn\u2019t. They wanted to live in Turkey, the closest thing to an Islamic state they felt was on offer today.\n\nCaliphate intellectuals are united in reviling the Islamic State, but beyond that, their projections of the future vary widely. Would an idealized Muslim community be a conventional state, but governed by the Shariah? Would it be a federation of Muslim-majority countries under the banner of Islam, a proto-Islamic bloc like the European Union? Would it be a caliphate in the classical, historical form, a sort of empire in God\u2019s name with a modern commitment to Islamic banking? Would it be sectarian? There are no solid contours yet to what form all these inchoate yearnings would take, but the sentiments are there, as real and inescapable a part of the modern landscape of the Muslim world as celebrity imams and Nike hijabs.\n\nAs we survey the husks of the cities the Islamic State controlled and speculate about the future, it is worth remembering: The Islamic State caliphate grew out of Syria\u2019s civil war, but it was also made possible by thousands of Muslims from across the world \u2014 not just the Arab world, but Europe, the United States, Indonesia, Russia \u2014 boarding planes, leaving their countries behind, in pursuit of the dream of a Muslim homeland.\n\nThe discussion about the post-Islamic State world purports to be about security, but it fundamentally neglects the fact that what the Islamic State claimed to represent \u2014 the idea of a caliphate \u2014 remains squarely in the minds of Muslims, even if many forces conspire to keep those sentiments from the public view. The majority who long for an Islamic state are not jihadist-minded, nor do they advocate the murder of civilians. But these views are banned from the public sphere across most of the Arab Middle East; such thoughts are not permissible in civil society or on mainstream media platforms. You are much more likely to see a buffoon conservative on television (like the Egyptian figure who recently called the rape of women wearing skinny jeans a national duty) rather than the razor-sharp Islamist lawyer in Tunis.\n\nThe question that captivated Western audiences as the Islamic State gained ground was how Islamic it was. Perhaps a better query might have been why what it claimed to represent appealed to so many. As we struggle to formulate better questions looking forward, we should think about why the idea of a Muslim homeland bubbles up as needed \u2014 an old notion that has never had, in living memory, such depths beneath it.", "title": "Opinion | The Lingering Dream of an Islamic State", "authors": []}

I was exhausted by caregiving \u2014 by raising children and simultaneously tending needy elders \u2014 and I longed for an uninterrupted chance to read and write and walk in the woods.\n\nBy the time I left two days later, I\u2019d finished a draft of the first essay I published in this newspaper. That essay is also the centerpiece of an essay collection to be published next year, a book entirely written or revised at Rivendell over the last three years.

So I suggested it to Atherton, and he said, \u2018Why not?\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we went about things then. There was no policy, no business plan \u2014 we just went for what we thought interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Whale\u201d proved an overnight sensation, making Tavener\u2019s name and that of the Sinfonietta in a single strike. William Glock, the august controller of music at the BBC who believed in giving listeners not what they liked already but (as he insisted) \u201cwhat they will like tomorrow,\u201d immediately offered it a second performance in Royal Albert Hall during the Proms, one of the world\u2019s largest classical music festivals. The Beatles also took an interest, wanting to record it for their otherwise pop-oriented Apple label.\n\nMr. Snowman took an active role in the recording sessions. \u201cAmong the paraphernalia the piece required, like amplified metronomes and football rattles, was a phalanx of loudhailers,\u201d he said. \u201cI played one, my dad another. On a third was Ringo Starr.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter this racy start, the Sinfonietta found its true m\u00e9tier with the arrival of Pierre Boulez. Mr. Boulez was in conflict with the French Ministry of Culture and refusing to conduct any orchestras in his native France. Instead, he started working with the Sinfonietta, leading major European tours from 1971 that pulled in other stars of contemporary music, including the Italian composer Luciano Berio.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThen the penny dropped,\u201d Mr. Snowman said. \u201cI realized that with big names like that we could get engagements anywhere.

Most of them, like the Ensemble Intercomporain, Ensemble Modern or Klangforum Wien, were created in the Sinfonietta\u2019s image.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the only act in town any more,\u201d Mr. Burke said. \u201cWe have competition, but that\u2019s to be celebrated.

If they didn\u2019t exist, there would be serious questions about what our relevance has been.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThere may be other questions about the Sinfonietta\u2019s record of achievement in persuading audiences to love some of the tougher sounds that it has championed in the past. But its choice of repertoire has never been a hard-line one. The Boulez and Xenakis have always been tempered with the softer voices of John Adams or Steve Reich. Indeed, Henryk Gorecki\u2019s Symphony No. 3 became an easy-listening hit when the Sinfonietta recorded it in 1991.\n\nThe Sinfonietta\u2019s repertoire now reflects the anything-goes pluralism of a music scene that stretches beyond concert halls into the kind of clubs where rock, pop and experimental music freely coexist. The current season takes in improvisation workshops, a collaboration with the photographer Andreas Gursky, and a piece described as a \u201cpolitically charged multimedia game show\u201d in which the composer Philip Venables invites the audience to question their ideas about gender.\n\nMore conventional, although it takes place in a disused printing plant rather than a theater, is the premiere of \u201cThe Cave,\u201d an opera by the British composer Tansy Davies. She said in an interview that she loved the Sinfonietta for \u201ctheir fearlessness, their readiness to shred a piece, if that\u2019s what it requires, with heavy-metal energy.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s a conscious focus on the work of women, with premieres from Charlotte Bray, Unsuk Chin and Rebecca Saunders: three different voices ranging from the tuneful to the tough.\n\n\u201cOur sole criterion in programming,\u201d Mr. Burke said, \u201cis whether we believe a piece is good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s not for nothing is the Sinfonietta\u2019s anniversary season is running with the tag \u201cUnfinished business.\u201d", "title": "The London Sinfonietta, a Contemporary Music Trailblazer, Turns 50", "authors": ["Michael White"]}

What has remained unsaid, because it is so obvious, is what would make someone so shameless in the first place: These people believed they were invincible. They saw their own bodies as entirely theirs and other people\u2019s bodies as at their disposal; apparently nothing in their lives led them to believe otherwise.\n\nHistorically, this is a mistake that few women would make, because until very recently, the physical experience of being a woman entailed exactly the opposite \u2014 and not only because women have to hold their keys in self-defense while walking through parking lots at night. It\u2019s only very recently that women have widely participated in public life, but it\u2019s even more recently that men have been welcome, or even expected, to provide physical care for vulnerable people.\n\nOnly for a nanosecond of human history have men even slightly shared what was once exclusively a woman\u2019s burden: the relentless daily labor of caring for another person\u2019s body, the life-preserving work of cleaning feces and vomit, the constant cycle of cooking and feeding and blanketing and bathing, whether for the young, the ill or the old. For nearly as long as there have been humans, being a female human has meant a daily nonoptional immersion in the fragility of human life and the endless effort required to sustain it.\n\nObviously not everyone who provides care for others is a saint. But engaging in that daily devotion, or even living with its expectation, has enormous potential to change a person. It forces one to constantly imagine the world from someone else\u2019s point of view: Is he hungry? Maybe she\u2019s tired. Is his back hurting him? What is she trying to say?\n\nThe most obvious cure for today\u2019s gender inequities is to put more women in power. But if we really hope to create an equal society, we will also need more men to care for the powerless \u2014 more women in the boardroom, but also more men at the nurses\u2019 station and the changing table, immersed in daily physical empathy. If that sounds like an evolutionary impossibility, well, it doesn\u2019t violate the laws of physics, so we can achieve it. It is surely worth at least as much investment as defeating death.\n\nPerhaps it takes the promise of immortality to inspire the self-absorbed to invest in unsexy work like Alzheimer\u2019s research. If so, we may all one day bless the inane death-defiance as a means to a worthy end.\n\nBut men who hope to live forever might pause on their eternal journey to consider the frightening void at invincibility\u2019s core.

Can science and reason really unbundle tribal thinking?\n\nSP One of the biggest enemies of reason is tribalism. When people subscribe to an ideology, they suck up evidence that supports their preconceptions and filter out evidence that goes against them. Contrary to the belief of most scientists that denial of climate change is an effect of scientific illiteracy, it is not at all correlated with scientific literacy. People who believe in man-made climate change don\u2019t know any more about climate or science than those who deny it. It\u2019s almost perfectly correlated with left-wing versus right-wing orientation. And a move toward greater rationality would unbundle them and let evidence inform what the optimal policies ought to be.\n\nPG But breaking deadlock surely requires more than asking people to be rational.\n\nBG I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve come to the point yet where democracy and science is going to stop working to improve lives. I was at a climate conference in Paris, and, honestly, there were as many nonscientific things said there in a good cause as I imagine were said at the non-climate convention that I didn\u2019t happen to attend.

I do think awareness of how things have worked is important to recreate a conservative center \u2014 that is, make us careful about what we change.\n\nPG And here I thought you were going to say: Innovation drives progress, not Washington.\n\nBG But the problem now is that innovation is not viewed as an unalloyed way to improve the human condition. And that\u2019s fair, because it\u2019s not pure. Does social media split us into tribes in a way that\u2019s dangerous? Does it create, even in high school social circles, a channel for bullying, or a desire to look perfect in photos? Is A.I. going to proceed so quickly that work, which is something people worship, will suffer bad distributional effects, and people won\u2019t know what to do? This is an unfortunate time for saying, \u201cTake all your damn negative thoughts, and I\u2019ll innovate away from them.\u201d People are seeing difficulty with that argument.\n\nSP There\u2019s also a dichotomy between the roles of innovation and policy.

When Steve Green, the museum\u2019s founder and the president of the Hobby Lobby crafts chain, formed the museum\u2019s parent organization in 2010, he informed the I.R.S. that its purpose was \u201cto bring to life the living word of God, to tell its compelling story of preservation, and to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the Bible.\u201d In 2012, the language was changed to say that the aim was simply \u201cto invite people to engage with the Bible.\u201d\n\nMr. Green rose to fame by getting the conservative majority on the Supreme Court to confer on Hobby Lobby the right to withhold federally mandated reproductive health care coverage from its female employees. The Green family lent artifacts to the Creation Museum in Kentucky and offers support to a \u201creligious literacy\u201d program aimed at public school students detailing the consequences they face if they disobey God.\n\nJoining the Hobby Lobby stores on the donor wall that memorializes large gifts to the Museum of the Bible are a dozen-plus foundations that routinely back conservative Christian causes. There is also a lot of Amway money supporting the museum, including the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation and other foundations connected to the DeVos family.\n\nGiven the theologico-political goals of its founders and patrons, it isn\u2019t hard to see that the location of this museum was an act of symbolic and practical genius.

So, Guo claims, he opted to take no money and have no weaknesses.\n\nYet when Guo left China in 2014, he fled in anticipation of corruption charges. A former business partner had been detained just days before, and his political patron would be detained a few days afterward. In 2015, articles about corruption in Guo\u2019s business dealings \u2014 stories that he claims are largely fabrications \u2014 started appearing in the media. He was accused of defrauding business partners and colluding with corrupt officials. To hear Guo tell it, his political and business opponents used a national corruption campaign as a cover for a personal vendetta.\n\nWhatever prompted Guo to take action, his campaign came during an important year for China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping. In October, the Communist Party of China (C.P.C.) convened its 19th National Congress, a twice-a-decade event that sets the contours of political power for the next five years. The country is in the throes of a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign, and Xi has overseen a crackdown on dissidents and human rights activists while increasing investment in censorship and surveillance. Guo has become a thorn in China\u2019s side at the precise moment the country is working to expand its influence, and its censorship program, overseas.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn November 2017, the Tiananmen Square activist Wang Dan warned of the growing influence of the C.P.C. on university campuses in the United States. His own attempts to hold \u201cChina salons\u201d on college campuses had largely been blocked by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association \u2014 a group with ties to China\u2019s government. Around the same time, the academic publisher Springer Nature agreed to block access to hundreds of articles on its Chinese site, cutting off access to articles on Tibet, Taiwan and China\u2019s political elite. Reports emerged last year that China is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars quarterly to purchase ads on Facebook (a service that is blocked within China\u2019s borders). In Australia, concerns about China\u2019s growing influence led to a ban on foreign political donations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling the United States they should really be careful,\u201d Guo said. China\u2019s influence is spreading, he says, and he believes his own efforts to change China will have global consequences. \u201cLike in an American movie,\u201d he told me with unflinching self-confidence. \u201cIn the last minutes, we will save the world.\u201d\n\nPropaganda, censorship and rewritten histories have long been specialties of authoritarian nations. The aim, as famously explained by the political philosopher Hannah Arendt, is to confuse: to breed a combination of cynicism and gullibility. Propaganda can leave people in doubt of all news sources, suspicious of their neighbors, picking and choosing at random what pieces of information to believe. Without a political reality grounded in facts, people are left unmoored, building their world on whatever foundation \u2014 imaginary or otherwise \u2014 they might choose.\n\nThe tight grip that the C.P.C. keeps on information may be nothing new, but China\u2019s leadership has been working hard to update the way it censors and broadcasts. People in China distrusted print and television media long before U.S. politicians started throwing around accusations of \u201cfake news.\u201d In 2016, President Xi Jinping was explicit about the arrangement, informing the country\u2019s media that it should be \u201csurnamed Party.\u201d Likewise, while the West has only recently begun to grapple with government-sponsored commenters on social media, China\u2019s government has been manipulating online conversations for over a decade.\n\n\u201cThey create all kinds of confusion,\u201d said Ha Jin, the National Book Award-winning American novelist born in China\u2019s Liaoning Province, and a vocal supporter of Guo. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what information you have and whether it\u2019s right. You don\u2019t know who are the informers, who are the agents.\u201d\n\nOnline, the C.P.C. controls information by blocking websites, monitoring content and employing an army of commenters widely known as the 50-cent party. The name was used as early as 2004, when a municipal government in Hunan Province hired a number of online commenters, offering a stipend of 600 yuan, or about $72. Since then, the 50-cent party has spread. In 2016, researchers from Harvard, Stanford and the University of California-San Diego estimated that these paid commenters generated 448 million social-media comments annually. The posts, researchers found, were conflict averse, cheerleading for the party rather than defending it. Their aim seemed not to be engaging in argument but rather distracting the public and redirecting attention from sensitive issues.\n\nIn early 2017, Guo issued his first salvos against China\u2019s ruling elite through more traditional channels. He contacted a handful of Chinese-language media outlets based in the United States. He gave interviews to the Long Island-based publication Mingjing News and to Voice of America \u2014 a live event that was cut short by producers, leading to speculation that V.O.A. had caved to Chinese government pressure. He called The New York Times and spoke with reporters at The Wall Street Journal. It did not take long, however, before the billionaire turned to direct appeals through social media. The accusations he made were explosive \u2014 he attacked Wang Qishan, Xi Jinping\u2019s corruption czar, and Meng Jianzhu, the secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, another prominent player in Xi\u2019s anti-corruption campaign. He talked about Wang\u2019s mistresses, his business interests and conflicts within the party.\n\nIn one YouTube video, released on Aug. 4, Guo addressed the tension between Wang and another anti-corruption official named Zhang Huawei. He recounted having dinner with Zhang when \u201che called Wang Qishan\u2019s secretary and gave him orders,\u201d Guo said. \u201cThink about what Wang had to suffer in silence back then. They slept with the same women, and Zhang knew everything about Wang.\u201d In addition, Guo said, Zhang knew about Wang\u2019s corrupt business dealings. When Zhang Huawei was placed under official investigation in April, Guo claimed, it was a result of a grudge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEveryone in China is a slave,\u201d Guo said in the video. \u201cWith the exception of the nobility.\u201d\n\nTo those who believe Guo\u2019s claims, they expose a depth of corruption that would surprise even the most jaded opponent of the C.P.C. \u201cThe corruption is on such a scale,\u201d Ha Jin said. \u201cWho could imagine that the czar of anti-corruption would himself be corrupt? It is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nRetaliation came quickly. A barrage of counteraccusations began pouring out against Guo, most published in the pages of the state-run Chinese media. Warrants for his arrest were issued on charges of corruption, bribery and even rape. China asked Interpol to issue a red notice calling for Guo\u2019s arrest and extradition. He was running out of money, it was reported. In September, Guo recorded a video during which he received what he said was a phone call from his fifth brother: Two of Guo\u2019s former employees had been detained, and their family members were threatening suicide. \u201cMy Twitter followers are so important they are like heaven to me,\u201d Guo said. But, he declared, he could not ignore the well-being of his family and his employees. \u201cI cannot finish the show as I had planned,\u201d he said. Later, Guo told his followers in a video that he was planning to divorce his wife, in order to shield her from the backlash against him.\n\nGuo quickly resumed posting videos and encouraging his followers. His accusations continued to accumulate throughout 2017, and he recently started his own YouTube channel (and has yet to divorce his wife). His YouTube videos are released according to no particular schedule, sometimes several days in a row, some weeks not at all. He has developed a casual, talkative style. In some, Guo is running on a treadmill or still sweating after a workout. He has demonstrated cooking techniques and played with a tiny, fluffy dog, a gift from his daughter. He invites his viewers into a world of luxury and offers them a mix of secrets, gossip and insider knowledge.\n\nWang Qishan, Guo has claimed, is hiding the money he secretly earned in the Hainan-based conglomerate HNA Group, a company with an estimated $35 billion worth of investments in the United States. (HNA Group denies any ties to Wang and is suing Guo.) He accused Wang of carrying on an affair with the actress Fan Bingbing. (Fan is reportedly suing Guo for defamation.) He told stories of petty arguments among officials and claimed that Chinese officials sabotaged Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared in 2014 en route to Beijing, in order to cover up an organ-harvesting scheme. Most of Guo\u2019s accusations have proved nearly impossible to verify.\n\n\u201cThis guy is just covered in question marks,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna who specializes in Chinese governance.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe questions that cover Guo have posed a problem for both the United States government and the Western journalists who, in trying to write about him, have found themselves buffeted by the currents of propaganda, misinformation and the tight-lipped code of the C.P.C. elite. His claims have also divided a group of exiled dissidents and democracy activists \u2014 people who might seem like Guo\u2019s natural allies. For the most part, the democracy activists who flee China have been chased from their country for protesting the government or promoting human rights, not because of corruption charges. They tell stories of personal persecution, not insider tales of bribery, sex and money. And perhaps as a consequence, few exiled activists command as large an audience as Guo. \u201cI will believe him,\u201d Ha Jin said, \u201cuntil one of his serious accusations is proved to be false.\u201d\n\nPei, the professor, warns not to take any of Guo\u2019s accusations at face value. The reaction from the C.P.C. has been so extreme, however, that Pei believes Guo must know something. \u201cHe must mean something to the government,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be really bothered by this billionaire.\u201d In May, Chinese officials visited Guo on visas that did not allow them to conduct official business, causing a confrontation with the F.B.I. A few weeks later, according to The Washington Times, China\u2019s calls for Guo\u2019s extradition led to a White House showdown, during which Jeff Sessions threatened to resign if Guo was sent back to China.\n\nGuo has a history of cultivating relationships with the politically influential, and the trend has continued in New York. He famously bought 5,000 copies of a book by Cherie Blair, Tony Blair\u2019s wife. (\u201cIt was to give to my employees,\u201d Guo told me. \u201cI often gave my employees books to read.\u201d) Guo has also cultivated a special relationship with Steve Bannon, whom he says he has met with a handful of times, although the two have no financial relationship. Not long after one of their meetings, Bannon appeared on Breitbart Radio and called China \u201can enemy of incalculable power.\u201d\n\nDespite Guo\u2019s high-powered supporters and his army of online followers, one important mark of believability has continued to elude him. Western news organizations have struggled to find evidence that would corroborate Guo\u2019s claims. When his claims appear in print, they are carefully hedged \u2014 delivered with none of his signature charm and bombast. \u201cWhy do you need more evidence?\u201d Guo complained in his apartment. \u201cI can give them evidence, no problem. But while they\u2019re out spending time investigating, I\u2019m waiting around to get killed!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe details of Guo\u2019s life may be impossible to verify, but the broad strokes confirm a picture of a man whose fortunes have risen and fallen with the political climate in China. To hear Guo tell it, he was born in Jilin Province, in a mining town where his parents were sent during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cThere were foreigners there,\u201d Guo says in a video recorded on what he claims is his birthday. (Guo was born on Feb. 2, or May 10, or sometime in June.) \u201cThey had the most advanced machinery. People wore popular clothing.\u201d Guo, as a result, was not ignorant of the world. He was, however, extremely poor. \u201cSometimes we didn\u2019t even have firewood,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we burned the wet twigs from the mountains \u2014 the smoke was so thick.\u201d Guo emphasizes this history: He came from hardship. He pulled himself up.\n\nThe story continues into Guo\u2019s pre-teenage years, when he moved back to his hometown in Shandong Province. He met his wife and married her when he was only 15, she 14. They moved to Heilongjiang, where they started a small manufacturing operation, taking advantage of the early days of China\u2019s economic rise, and then to Henan. Guo got his start in real estate in a city called Zhengzhou, where he founded the Zhengzhou Yuda Property Company and built the tallest building the city had seen so far, the Yuda International Trade Center. According to Guo, he was only 25 when he made this first deal.\n\nThe string of businesses and properties that Guo developed provide some of the confirmable scaffolding of his life. No one disputes that Guo went on to start both the Beijing Morgan Investment Company and Beijing Zenith Holdings. Morgan Investment was responsible for building a cluster of office towers called the Pangu Plaza, the tallest of which has a wavy top that loosely resembles a dragon, or perhaps a precarious cone of soft-serve ice cream. Guo is in agreement with the Chinese media that in buying the property for Pangu Plaza, he clashed with the deputy mayor of Beijing. The dispute ended when Guo turned in a lengthy sex tape capturing the deputy mayor in bed with his mistress.\n\nThere are other details in Guo\u2019s biography, however, that vary from one source to the next. Guo says that he never took government loans; Caixin, a Beijing-based publication, quoted \u201csources close to the matter\u201d in a 2015 article claiming that Guo took out 28 loans totaling 588 million yuan, or about $89 million. Guo, according to Caixin, eventually defaulted. At some point in this story \u2014 the timeline varies \u2014 Guo became friends with the vice minister of China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, Ma Jian. The M.S.S. is China\u2019s answer to the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. combined. It spies on civilians and foreigners alike, conducting operations domestically and internationally, amassing information on diplomats, businessmen and even the members of the C.P.C. Describing Ma, Guo leans back in his chair and mimes smoking a cigarette. \u201cMa Jian! He was fat and his skin was tan.\u201d According to Guo, Ma sat like this during their first meeting, listening to Guo\u2019s side of a dispute. Then Ma told him to trust the country. \u201cTrust the law,\u201d he told Guo. \u201cWe will treat you fairly.\u201d The older master of spycraft and the young businessman struck up a friendship that would become a cornerstone in Guo\u2019s claims of insider knowledge, and also possibly the reason for the businessman\u2019s downfall in China.\n\nFollowing the construction of Pangu Plaza in Beijing, Guo\u2019s life story becomes increasingly hard to parse. He started a securities business with a man named Li You. After a falling-out, Li was detained by the authorities. Guo\u2019s company accused Li and his company of insider trading. According to the 2015 article in Caixin, Li then penned a letter to the authorities accusing Guo of \u201cwrongdoing.\u201d\n\nAs this dispute was going on, China\u2019s anti-\u200bcorruption operation was building a case against Ma Jian. In Guo\u2019s telling, Ma had long been rumored to be collecting intelligence on China\u2019s leaders. As the anti-corruption campaign gained speed and officials like Wang Qishan gained power, Ma\u2019s well of intelligence started to look like a threat. It was Guo\u2019s relationship with Ma, the tycoon maintains, that made officials nervous. Ma was detained by the authorities in January 2015, shortly after Guo fled the country. Soon after Ma\u2019s detention, accounts began appearing in China\u2019s state-run media claiming that Ma had six Beijing villas, six mistresses and at least two illegitimate sons. In a 2015 article that ran in the party-run newspaper The China Daily, the writer added another detail: \u201cThe investigation also found that Ma had acted as an umbrella for the business ventures of Guo Wengui, a tycoon from Henan Province.\u201d\n\nIn the mix of spies, corrupt business dealings, mistresses and sex scandals, Guo has one more unbelievable story to tell about his past. It is one reason, he says, that he was mentally prepared to confront the leaders of the Communist Party. It happened nearly 29 years ago, in the aftermath of the crackdown on Tiananmen Square. According to Guo, he had donated money to the students protesting in the square, and so a group of local police officers came to find him at his home. An overzealous officer fired off a shot at Guo\u2019s wife \u2014 at which point Guo\u2019s younger brother jumped in front of the bullet, suffering a fatal wound. \u201cThat was when I started my plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your brother had been killed in front of your eyes, would you just forget it?\u201d Never mind the fact that it would take 28 years for him to take any public stand against the party that caused his brother\u2019s death. Never mind that the leadership had changed. \u201cI\u2019m not saying everyone in the Communist Party is bad,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system is bad. So what I need to oppose is the system.\u201d\n\nOn an unusually warm Saturday afternoon in Flushing, Queens, a group of around 30 of Guo\u2019s supporters gathered for a barbecue in Kissena Park. They laid out a spread of vegetables and skewers of shrimp and squid. Some children toddled through the crowd, chewing on hot dogs and rolling around an unopened can of Coke. The adults fussed with a loudspeaker and a banner that featured the name that Guo goes by in English, Miles Kwok. \u201cMiles Kwok, NY loves U,\u201d it said, a heart standing in for the word \u201cloves.\u201d \u201cDemocracy, Justice, Liberty for China.\u201d Someone else had carried in a life-size cutout of the billionaire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe revelers decided to hold the event in the park partly for the available grills but also partly because the square in front of Guo\u2019s penthouse had turned dangerous. A few weeks earlier, some older women had been out supporting Guo when a group of Chinese men holding flags and banners showed up. At one point, the men wrapped the women in a protest banner and hit them. The park was a safer option. And the protesters had learned from Guo \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a live audience they were hoping for. The group would be filming the protest and posting it on social media. Halfway through, Guo would call in on someone\u2019s cellphone, and the crowd would cheer.\n\nDespite this show of support, Guo\u2019s claims have divided China\u2019s exiled dissidents to such an extent that on a single day near the end of September, two dueling meetings of pro-democracy activists were held in New York, one supporting Guo, the other casting doubt on his motivations. (\u201cThey are jealous of me,\u201d Guo said of his detractors. \u201cThey think: Why is he so handsome? Why are so many people listening to him?\u201d) Some of Guo\u2019s claims are verifiably untrue \u2014 he claimed in an interview with Vice that he paid $82 million for his apartment \u2014 and others seem comically aggrandized. (Guo says he never wears the same pair of underwear twice.) But the repercussions he is facing are real.\n\nIn December, Guo\u2019s brother was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for destroying accounting records. The lawsuits filed against Guo for defamation are piling up, and Guo has claimed to be amassing a \u201cwar chest\u201d of $150 million to cover his legal expenses. In September, a new set of claims against Guo were made in a 49-page document circulated by a former business rival. For Ha Jin, Guo\u2019s significance runs deeper than his soap-opera tales of scandal and corruption. \u201cThe grand propaganda scheme is to suppress and control all the voices,\u201d Jin said. \u201cNow everybody knows that you can create your own voice. You can have your own show. That fact alone is historical.\u201d In the future, Jin predicts, there will be more rebels like Guo. \u201cThere is something very primitive about this, realizing that this is a man, a regular citizen who can confront state power.\u201d\n\nHo Pin, the founder of Long Island\u2019s Mingjing News, echoed Jin. Mingjing\u2019s reporters felt that covering Guo was imperative, no matter the haziness of the information. \u201cIn China, the political elite that Guo was attacking had platforms of their own,\u201d Ho said. \u201cThey have the opportunity, the power and the ability to use all the government\u2019s apparatus to refute and oppose Guo Wengui. So our most important job is to allow Guo Wengui\u2019s insider knowledge reach the fair, open-minded people in China.\u201d Still, people like Pei urge caution when dealing with Guo\u2019s claims. Even Guo\u2019s escape raises questions. Few others have slipped through the net of China\u2019s anti-corruption drive. \u201cHow could he get so lucky?\u201d Pei asked. \u201cHe must have been tipped off long before.\u201d\n\nAt the barbecue, a supporter named Ye Rong tucked one of his children under his arm and acknowledged that Guo\u2019s past life is riddled with holes. There was always the possibility that Guo used to be a thug, but Ye didn\u2019t think it mattered. The rules of the conflict had been set by the Communist Party. \u201cYou need all kinds of people to oppose the Chinese government,\u201d Ye said. \u201cWe need intellectuals; we also need thugs.\u201d\n\nGuo, of course, has his own opinions about his legacy. He warned of dark times for Americans and for the world, if he doesn\u2019t succeed in his mission to change China. \u201cI am trying to help,\u201d he told me. \u201cI am not joking with you.\u201d He continued: \u201cI will change China within the next three years. If I don\u2019t change it, I won\u2019t be able to survive.\u201d", "title": "The Mystery of the Exiled Billionaire Whistle-Blower", "authors": ["Lauren Hilgers"]}

He is also an immigration restrictionist: He wants a policy that favors skills-based recruitment over extended families, and he wants a lower immigration rate overall. He says he\u2019s concerned about assimilation and crime and native wages; his critics say he just wants to keep America as white as possible, and that by even bringing him to meetings Trump is making a deal impossible to reach.\n\nThe critics are right about this much: Having someone like Miller involved is a change from the way prior immigration negotiations have proceeded. As Jim Antle points out in a column for The Week, those negotiations have been consistently bipartisan, bringing together John McCain and Ted Kennedy, Marco Rubio and Chuck Schumer, now Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin \u2014 but \u201cthey have mostly taken place between people who are fundamentally in agreement on immigration,\u201d who favor both amnesty for illegal immigrants and reforms that would probably increase immigration rates.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it doesn\u2019t represent the actual divisions in the country. Americans have become more pro-immigration since the 1990s, but there is still a consistent pattern when you ask about immigration rates: About a third of Americans favor the current trend, slightly fewer want higher rates, and about a third, like Miller, want immigration reduced.", "title": "Opinion | The Necessity of Stephen Miller", "authors": []}

And he liked the relative calm of the southern side of the Williamsburg waterfront.\n\nCalm, that is, if not exactly quiet.\n\nThey were among the first to move into their building, which is part of a site being developed by Two Trees (as well as the first building to open there). And now they are surrounded by construction. \u201cEvery day, they start with the jackhammers next door at 7 a.m. and they finish at 6 p.m.,\u201d Ms. Lebon said. \u201cBut we moved to New York to be amid the noise.

Still, that is quite a bit more than the $4,000 budget they had set. But as they plan to stay for only two years, they decided that splurging on a place they loved was worth it.\n\nNames: Vince and Kat Lebon Ages: 33 and 37Occupations: Mr. Lebon is a footwear designer and founder of the company Rollie Nation; he created its trademark Oxford for Ms. Lebon, who until recently was a flight attendant for Qantas. The couple has a retail store in Melbourne called Lost in Seasons, which Ms. Lebon manages. Rent: $5,450 a month, though a free month brought it down to just under $5,000 a month.Taking the ferry: The couple\u2019s 4-year-old son, Hugo, goes to school in Dumbo, Brooklyn, so Ms. Lebon catches the ferry four times a day (for pickup and drop-off) \u2013 \u201ca thing I would never do back in Melbourne; it\u2019s exciting.\u201d They are amazed by: The convenience of New York, specifically services like Instacart, Uber and Seamless. \u201cI can get my wine delivered in two hours,\u201d Mr. Lebon said. \u201cI\u2019ve downloaded more apps since I\u2019ve been here than in the last 10 years.\u201d Why they chose Brooklyn over Manhattan: \u201cThis feels much more at home,\u201d Mr. Lebon said. \u201cYou can get to the city, but also escape the city.\u201d Even so, his favorite neighborhood for walking is SoHo: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a sneakerhead,\u201d he said. \u201cI like NikeLab, Kith and Acne.

Any sanctions with real bite would only increase the already serious possibility of a major economic crisis in Turkey. Rather than leave Turkey more dependent on Washington, such a crisis could well empower those in Ankara who already believe that Turkey has less to lose and more to gain by breaking with the West completely.\n\nGiven the grip on power that he now enjoys, Mr. Erdogan is unlikely to be voted out, regardless of how bad the economy gets. If he decides to cling to power at all costs, even his fall would be more likely to unleash violence than facilitate a smooth return to some form of democracy. In these circumstances, pushing the country toward the brink would do little to advance America\u2019s ideals or interests, much less those of the Turkish people.\n\nFor all of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s anger at America, he now stands to benefit from the very American cynicism he regularly denounces. However infuriating and dangerous American policy makers find him, they will ultimately find the alternative \u2014 chaos in Turkey \u2014 scarier. Having missed the opportunity to apply pressure earlier in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tenure, when it might have been effective, Washington is likely to end up quietly hoping he maintains his hold over the country for the same reason it has supported many other authoritarian leaders: stability.\n\nWith this in mind, American policy should look toward helping Turkey emerge intact from an inevitable period of authoritarian rule as early as realistically possible. Congress should focus any future sanctions on concrete issues affecting bilateral relations, like the targeting of American government employees and citizens. American leaders should remain consistent in their public and private criticism of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s undemocratic behavior, rather than withholding or deploying it selectively as a diplomatic tool.\n\nFinally, it is important to prevent further escalation of Turkey\u2019s Kurdish conflict. The United States can use its military and diplomatic leverage in Syria to forestall both Turkish attacks on Kurdish forces there and renewed terrorist attacks by Kurdish groups in Turkey.\n\nBeyond this, though, Americans can do little but brace for what\u2019s next. Turkey\u2019s political turmoil, like its relationship with the United States, will almost certainly get worse before it gets better.

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "But within these conventions, Coetzee is as perspicacious and erudite a guide as one could hope for. His biographical sketches of the life and times of the authors he addresses are excellent, concretely informative while also marbled with interesting tidbits. (Robert Walser, I learned, developed \u201cpsychosomatic cramps\u201d in his right hand that he attributed to an unconscious enmity for the pen, leading him to adopt an alternative form of script he called his \u201cpencil system.\u201d) But the meat of Coetzee\u2019s overviews can be found in other good introductions by other critics. What can\u2019t be found anywhere else, where Coetzee is unparalleled, is his ability to capture the psychology of individual characters, to lay bare the inner working of their minds, and in so doing bring to light the source of their enduring interest to readers.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf Defoe\u2019s heroine Roxana, for example, Coetzee writes: \u201cRoxana does not pretend that the virtue whose loss she intermittently laments is something she deeply and sincerely believes in. On the contrary, she is happy to remain in a divided, ambivalent state in which she wants to resist seduction but equally wants her resistance to be swept away. She is well aware of this division or ambivalence within herself. \u2026 Implicitly she recognizes that she finds being seduced more interesting (more engaging, more thrilling, more erotic, more seductive in prospect) than giving herself in a direct, unambiguous way; that the prelude to the sexual act can be more desirable, more erotically fulfilling, than the act itself. Seduction, the thought of seduction, the approach of seduction, the imagined experience of seduction, turns out to be profoundly seductive, even irresistible.\u201d\n\nIf one is to appreciate Coetzee\u2019s essays, one must recognize how precisely, with what concentration, he lays bare a terrifically complex psychology, giving readers a handhold on which to build even more complex readings of their own. (Readings that would likely, in today\u2019s atmosphere, quickly point out that \u201cirresistible\u201d seduction isn\u2019t the fruit of effective persuasion but rape, a fact Coetzee draws attention to elsewhere in the chapter.) One must also admire the subtle brilliance of Coetzee\u2019s sentences, as in the last line of the passage quoted above, in which seduction is discussed in a manner that itself impersonates seduction, with the repetition of phrases (the thought of seduction, the approach of seduction and so on) heightening the thrill for the reader until the sentence succumbs to the seduction it has performed by landing upon \u201ceven irresistible.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLate Essays\u201d is filled with many moments of such perfect insight, moments when the reader is left enthralled by Coetzee\u2019s powers of perception. Another example is this gem, on the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert: \u201cWhat is wrong with systems, to Herbert, is that they are systems. What is wrong with laws is that they are laws. Beware of angels and other executives of perfection.\u201d\n\nAt certain points, \u201cLate Essays\u201d can suddenly become \u201cLast Essays.\u201d At this stage of Coetzee\u2019s career, one might of course expect reflections on matters of mortality and finality, or at least an interest in the late style of literary giants. But Coetzee doesn\u2019t dwell on such issues any more than a younger writer would. In one instance, however, he lets slip his admiration for a particular scene at the end of Philip Roth\u2019s \u201cEveryman,\u201d where the protagonist observes at his work, and then converses with, the aging gravedigger who dug his parents\u2019 graves and who will perform the same service for the protagonist when the time comes. After the gravedigger has carefully described the process by which a grave comes to be dug, Roth\u2019s unnamed Everyman says, \u201cI want to thank you. \u2026 You couldn\u2019t have made things more concrete. It\u2019s a good education for an older person.\u201d\n\nIn these essays, Coetzee is doing for the writers who came before him what I imagine he hopes will be done for him by the writers who will follow. He is gravedigging, with probity, with the greatest reverence for the craft they share, and in this way is saying thank you in the only way one writer can really say it to another, which is by writing about them well.", "title": "The Outlaw Novelist as Literary Critic", "authors": ["Benjamin Ogden", "J.M.

Among people living below the poverty line, the infection rate was 10 percent.\n\nThe odds of a positive test rise with age, but it\u2019s unknown whether this reflects recent infections or simply an accumulation of antibodies from past encounters.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, calls Toxocara both one of the most common parasites in the country and arguably the most neglected.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe know in some cases it is linked to lower intelligence and epilepsy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you were to look at disadvantaged kids living in poverty who are also doing lower on tests of school performance, what percentage of that can be attributed to this worm?\u201d\n\nWhile much is still unknown, \u201cthere\u2019s enough here to warrant doing a major study on a large number of children.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the moment, research into Toxocara among Americans is so lacking that the National Institutes of Health funding website lists no grants to study it. Even many of the most basic questions are unanswered, including how often ingested eggs progress to full-blown infection.\n\nAmong the country\u2019s overlooked parasitic infections, \u201cToxocara is probably the one that affects the broadest range of people,\u201d said Sue Montgomery, lead of the epidemiology team at the parasitic diseases branch of the C.D.C. \u201cDogs and cats are everywhere. Many of them may carry the parasites.\u201d\n\nStudies indicate that owned pets who receive regular veterinary care rarely carry Toxocara. Poorer neighborhoods bear a disproportionate share of strays. In one survey, 8,700 unowned dogs were said to be roaming parts of Dallas.\n\nA survey of New York City playgrounds, presented at a medical conference last year, sampled 21 parks across the city. Toxocara eggs were found in nine parks. Three quarters of samples taken in the Bronx contained eggs in the larval stage, which are more infectious. No parks in Manhattan had eggs with larvae.\n\n(The researchers declined to name the parks, saying the data were preliminary.)\n\nIn some cases, larvae from Toxocara enter the eyes and cause blindness. They can also infect the liver and lungs, leading to a potentially damaging inflammatory reaction.\n\nUsually, however, signs of infection are more subtle: a slight fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cough \u2014 symptoms that describe any number of illnesses. Few pediatricians think to test for Toxocara.\n\nPhoto\n\nUntreated, the infection may clear on its own after months or even years, \u201cbut we don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Dr. Hotez said.\n\nA C.D.C. survey published in October found that 85 percent of pediatricians admitted to only passing familiarity with the infection, called toxocariasis; given a description of symptoms, slightly less than half of the doctors correctly diagnosed it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen infection is recognized, it can be treated with the anti-parasitic drug albendazole, Dr. Hotez said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The scientific literature contains only scattered reports of Toxocara worms discovered in the central nervous system.\n\n\u201cWe know that larvae go to the brain in humans,\u201d said Celia Holland, a parasitology professor at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland. But beyond that fact, she says, \u201cwe know very little.\u201d\n\nDr. Holland has conducted experiments finding that mice with Toxocara larvae in the brain showed reduced learning ability and less inclination to explore.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe greater the degree of infection, the greater the impairment. In prolonged research on mice with extreme infections, \u201cwe had to terminate the experiments for ethical reasons because their locomotion started to be affected,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the few studies to examine whether cognitive achievement correlated with Toxocara infection in people was published in the International Journal for Parasitology by two researchers at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn.\n\nUsing a cross-section of national data, they found that the mean test scores were lower among children who tested positive for exposure to Toxocara, even after accounting for other known influences such as household income and lead levels in blood.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "For each lucky birder who saw the Cedar Beach corn crake, there are thousands of others who wish they had, myself included. Each of us has nurtured our own private dreams of someday encountering it. As a Connecticut birder, Paul Desjardins, put it, \u201cIt only took me 58 years to see this bird.\u201d\n\nWhere do birding dreams come from? Mostly, they come from books. Next to high-quality optics, the most important resources for a birder are books. Behind every birder is a library \u2014 a privately curated collection of dozens \u2014 even hundreds \u2014 of volumes, including field guides, bird-finding guides and specialized monographs on specific groups like warblers, sparrows or gulls. And, just as seed catalogs induce a gardener\u2019s visions of glorious future harvests, there are bird books whose goal is simply to inspire dreams about birds, the love of birds and plans for future birding trips.\n\nSimon Barnes\u2019s \u201cThe Meaning of Birds\u201d is a book of essays that explore the biology of birds and our abiding fascination with them. Barnes is the former chief sportswriter for The Times of London, and the author of more than a dozen books on sports, horses and horse racing, cricket and bird-watching.\n\nPhoto\n\nLoosely organized as a series of conceptual chapters, the book is passionate, inviting, even lyrical. In the opening passage, Barnes shows us that the angels carved into the ceiling of an ancient church in East Anglia fly on the wings of marsh harriers \u2014 the same charismatic raptor we can observe in American wetlands today. He compares the effortless buoyant flight of the harriers to the graceful presence of the angels, and brings us closer to the bird-loving artisans who carved them long ago. Having never imagined angel wings as coming in any variety other than generic swan white, I was grateful to Barnes for opening my eyes to the ornithological inspiration for angels.\n\nBarnes\u2019s book is like a lively, meandering pub conversation with a birdy companion \u2014 chatty, but often choppy and a little repetitive. Few topics are sustained for more than a page or two, and we never wade into the depths.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBarnes can also be a bit sloppy with biological details. For example, there is no evidence that the tubes in an albatross beak function like pitot tubes to measure their air speed; rather, these nasal channels are for the outflow from their salt glands and allow them to survive in a high-sodium, oceanic environment. Before one conjecture, Barnes suggests that the reader may \u201cmiss this bit if you have taste for scientific rigor.\u201d Although I felt that way at times about the whole book, Barnes provides a companionable view of why we love birds, their lives and futures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Much like Barnes\u2019s book, \u201cBirdmania\u201d is also a series of choppy vignettes organized into topical chapters. However, Brunner focuses more on the mania than the birds.\n\nTo Brunner, birdmaniacs are mostly an odd, selfish and even cruel bunch. The English bird illustrator and publisher John Gould is described as an \u201cunscrupulous profiteer.\u201d The travelogues of Hugo Weigold, a pioneer bird bander in the early 20th century, are described as \u201cfull of cold-blooded arrogance.\u201d The pioneering American bird-watcher Phoebe Snetsinger, who traveled the world to observe 8,674 bird species before being killed in a traffic accident during a birding trip in Madagascar, is presented as an example of \u201cwealthy people who cut themselves off almost completely from their partners, children and other family obligations \u2026just to add one entry or another to a fervently kept list of bird sightings.\u201d\n\nTo make sure his pessimistic message is right up front, a third of Brunner\u2019s 19 chapters focus on famous liars in ornithology. We meet the French ornithologist Fran\u00e7ois Levaillant, who cribbed some illustrations for his \u201cNatural History of the Birds of Africa (1805-08)\u201d from other sources, and incompetently (or deviously?) included numerous species not found on the continent. We are also introduced to the 20th-century aristocratic British ornithologist, spy and sociopath Richard Meinertzhagen, who switched tags among bird specimens to support his hypotheses and who might have shot his first wife to hide the deception before running off with his children\u2019s nanny.\n\nBrunner has a special gripe against the scientific collectors of birds. Yet he never acknowledges, or perhaps comprehends, the vital contributions that museum collections make to our understanding of the biology of birds.\n\nOf course, birdmaniacs are people, too, with human foibles and faults. But Brunner makes little attempt to understand the cultural or intellectual contexts in which these historical birdmaniacs lived and loved birds. Even if some of his harsh judgments are accurate, \u201cBirdmania\u201d does not portray birdmania as very attractive. Perhaps the censorious tone is exaggerated by the translation from the German original, but I was left wondering whether Brunner actually likes birds, bird people, or even people in general.\n\nNoah Strycker\u2019s \u201cBirding Without Borders\u201d is a firsthand account of a serious case of birdmania. In 2015, at age 28, Strycker set out to see as many bird species as he could in a single calendar year. This feat of extreme birding is called a Big Year, and it can be pursued on the local, state, continental or global scale. Strycker\u2019s goal was to be the first person to see more than half the world\u2019s roughly 10,100 species of birds in one year. Starting in Antarctica on Jan. 1, Strycker took 112 plane flights and traveled through 41 countries on all continents to observe 6,042 species of birds, smashing the previous record of 4,341.\n\nThe birding travelogue genre was invented in 1955 by Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher with the publication of \u201cWild America,\u201d a sort of ornithological \u201cOn the Road\u201d about their year bird-watching across North America. \u201cBirding Without Borders\u201d is an updated, global birding travelogue for the modern age. Strycker is a digital native, and his is a decidedly digitally enabled Big Year. Strycker used the internet to find local birders to guide him in every country he visited. Throughout the year, he tallied his observations on eBird, an electronic bird-sighting database, and posted daily descriptions of his adventures on a blog maintained by the Audubon Society. When Strycker finds himself on Christmas night in Western Australia just 30 birds shy of 6,000, he uses eBird to calculate which country he should visit last to maximize his remaining week. (The answer? Northern India!)\n\n\u201cBirding Without Borders\u201d is lighthearted and filled with stories of exotic birds, risky adventures and colorful birding companions. You don\u2019t get deep insights into why Strycker did this, but you get the sense that he would be fun to bird with. I would have liked deeper discussion about how to plan the best Big Year route. Of course, I would love to have heard Strycker\u2019s stories about what it was like to see specific birds that I have dreamed of, like the white-necked rockfowl in Ghana, and the sapayoa in Panama. To really appreciate Strycker\u2019s book, readers must have moved beyond merely enjoying local birds to dream about the dizzying diversity of the birds of the world, and have imagined how rewarding it may be to see them all. It\u2019s a beautiful dream.", "title": "The Passion and Peril of Birding", "authors": ["Richard O. Prum"]}

What struck me was how removed they were from the human realities behind the weapons they discussed. This distancing occurred in part through a professional discourse characterized by stunningly abstract and euphemistic language \u2014 and in part through a set of lively sexual metaphors.\n\nThe human bodies evoked were not those of the victims; instead, there were conversations about vertical erector launchers, thrust-to-weight ratios, soft lay downs, deep penetration and the comparative advantages of protracted versus spasm attacks \u2014 or what one military adviser to the National Security Council called \u201creleasing 70 to 80 percent of our megatonnage in one orgasmic whump.\u201d\n\nBut it quickly became clear that the role of gender in national security discourse went deeper than not-so-subtle metaphors. Even more disturbing was how it shaped what could be said, or even thought, within the confines of these male-dominated spaces. \u201cWhat are you, some kind of wimp?\u201d was an insult readily lobbed at anyone who urged restraint in responding to a provocation or attack. Discussion of whether political leaders \u201chad the stones for war\u201d suggested that the desire to solve a conflict through nonmilitary measures would mean you were less than fully manly. During the Cuban missile crisis, when Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze disparaged some of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s more cautious decisions by calling him a \u201cpantywaist,\u201d he made it clear that anyone who let himself be governed by fear of setting off a nuclear war was a sissy.\n\nOvert impugning of masculinity is still only the most surface level at which ideas about gender play out in strategic thinking. They work in deeper, more subtle ways too. The culturally pervasive associations of masculinity with dispassion, distance, abstraction, toughness and risk-taking, and of femininity with emotion, empathy, bodily vulnerability, fear and caution, are embedded within the professional discourse.\n\nAnd there they function to make some kinds of ideas seem self-evidently \u201crealist,\u201d hard-nosed and rational, and others patently inadmissible, self-evidently inappropriate.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s an unfortunate opening salvo, as one could surmise that Lipman\u2019s compassion for white men burdened by the demands of \u201coutsiders\u201d is the organizing principle for what\u2019s to come. It\u2019s not. Instead, she offers a persuasive examination of the innumerable institutionalized prejudices, roadblocks and often unconscious undermining that women face in nearly every aspect of public and private life. Some of her facts will be familiar to H.R. directors, women\u2019s studies scholars and reporters who cover gender equality. They will likely be revelatory to nearly everyone else. Lipman\u2019s not wrong that those with power are loath to give it up: One study by Catalyst, an organization devoted to working women, found that 74 percent of men surveyed on what undermines their support for gender equality said fear \u2014 of loss of status, of other men\u2019s disapproval and of making a mistake \u2014 all of which, Lipman writes, has men \u201cwalking around on eggshells.\u201d But she also believes that most men, certainly those in the upper echelons of management, \u201cdon\u2019t need beating up with a two-by-four. They\u2019d like to see an equitable workplace, they just can\u2019t figure out what they\u2019re supposed to do about it.\u201d She\u2019s here to tell them; here\u2019s hoping they\u2019re paying attention.\n\nPhoto\n\nLipman, a former journalist for The Wall Street Journal and the founding editor of the short-lived Cond\u00e9 Nast business magazine Portfolio, is a skilled assembler of data and a graceful storyteller. She starts with a sketch of just how male by default the universe is, from the standard office temperature (set to accommodate the higher metabolic rate of 40-year-old, 154-pound, suit-wearing men) and male-centric design at Apple (the iPhone 6 Plus was too big for many women\u2019s hands and pockets) to the potentially dangerous side effects for women of the original prescribed doses of Ambien, a drug that was tested only on men, a still-common practice. All due, in part, to the lack of women in decision-making roles across industries and sectors, which, the data clearly show, is a financial mistake.\n\nA lot of assertions in the book begin with \u201cstudies have shown\u201d\u2014 a suspicious tactic. (Was the study that found a new potion \u201celiminated every wrinkle in a week\u201d conducted with the 12 people who work at that beauty start-up? Or was it a double-blind, controlled trial by a credible research team?) Yet each fact here is carefully accounted for on the nearly 50 pages of notes at the end of the book. It\u2019s not necessarily persuasive to read that \u201cmultiple studies have found that adding women to all-male teams leads to greater financial success,\u201d but this claim is bolstered by data from several sources, including The Journal of Financial Economics (\u201cFemale executives make more profitable acquisitions and take on less debt than male executives\u201d), Catalyst (\u201cFirms with the most female board members outperform those with the least by almost every financial measure\u201d) and the Credit Suisse Research Institute (\u201cCompanies whose top management is at least half female post returns on equity that are 19 percent higher than average\u201d).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a chapter titled \u201cWe\u2019re All a Little Bit Sexist,\u201d Lipman walks us through the thicket of research on cultural biases against women, which start almost from birth: Mothers overestimate the crawling ability of sons and underestimate that of daughters. Parents are 2.5 times more likely to query Google about whether their 2-year-old is a genius if that 2-year-old is a boy. In one study, girls outscored boys on math tests when there were no names on the papers given to teachers to grade; on the same tests with names attached, the boys outscored the girls. Women are 33 percent more likely to earn a college degree than men, even though professors are more likely to call on the men. Women are also more likely to be interrupted, despite speaking less than their male classmates.\n\nIn the working world, well, it gets worse: A Carnegie Mellon University study found that when an equal number of job-seeking men and women visited 100 recruitment sites, men were shown the ad for the highest-paying job six times more often than women were. Lipman dismantles the so-called \u201cpipeline theory,\u201d which posits that when women enter the work force at the same rate as men, they will reach management positions in equal numbers. In the early 1990s, more than half of law-school students were women, so, according to the pipeline theory, by now 50 percent of partners at law firms should be women as well. But by 2013, women held just 17 percent of those jobs, a pattern that Lipman says holds steady across \u201cany\u201d industry.\n\nPhoto\n\nShe also debunks James Damore\u2019s argument that the lack of gender parity at Google (about 70 percent of its employees are male) is a failure of nature by citing the in-house experts the company assigned to fix the problem. She interviews Brian Welle, a Google data scientist, and Laszlo Bock, a former head of its People Operations, who began working on the issue in 2006 and who eventually determined that Google\u2019s employees \u201cclearly had blind spots about their own prejudices against women and minorities.\u201d (Google\u2019s famously elaborate hiring process, in which candidates are evaluated, primarily by men, for their \u201cGoogleyness\u201d \u2014 the qualities that made them likely to fit in at the company \u2014 presumably had something to do with this.)\n\nThe Google case study is among several Lipman uses to propel a narrative about the uncertain status of women in the workplace. She recounts how jealousy of the woman who built the Tupperware company into a household name in the 1950s drove its founder to fire her and write her out of the company\u2019s history, and she explains why Iceland is the only country in the world where men and women share power in almost equal numbers: After the global financial crisis of 2008, Icelanders embraced the idea that the bank failures were, as the female director of the country\u2019s Chamber of Commerce put it, the result of a \u201cpenis competition\u201d among bankers. Not only did Icelanders jail unscrupulous bankers but they also elected more women to government posts, including that of prime minister, and mandated that women make up 40 percent of corporate boards.\n\nLipman needs these stories to help give dimension to her statistics \u2014 though many women may find the statistics comforting all on their own, if only because they document an unease that many feel but can\u2019t name. For instance: Women are 15 percent less likely to get promoted than men, in part because men get promoted for \u201cpotential,\u201d while women get promoted for performance. And both men and women would rather work for a male boss \u2014 they\u2019d even take a lower salary to ensure it. The self-annihilating absurdity of this last fact underlies some of the more important insights in \u201cThat\u2019s What She Said,\u201d which have to do with the unconscious bias women seem to have against themselves. Women in academia spend more time than men revising papers, in part because they\u2019re reluctant to burden anyone with what they feel is subpar work but also because they\u2019re so much more sensitive to criticism and hope to eliminate the possibility of any. Women underestimate their abilities at the same rate that men overestimate theirs, and a woman\u2019s self-esteem is more closely tied to compliments and criticism from her boss, with praise being more meaningful to women than even a raise or a promotion.\n\nBut men have sensitivities too, and the shame of holding a lower-status job than a woman, particularly if that woman is a romantic partner, apparently runs deep. Lipman quotes two studies that hint at what men don\u2019t often admit, much less even know. One is a study of heterosexual, college-age couples, in which both parties were asked to take a test. When the women were told that their boyfriends had scored higher on the test than they had, the women were unfazed. When the men were told that their girlfriends had done better, their self-esteem plummeted. Yet it rose when they were told that their girlfriends had done poorly. The other study found that men who earned less money than their wives were more likely to cheat. And when Lipman quizzed male executives on what it was about working with women that flummoxed them most, the resounding consensus was a crying woman. When women cry, a man\u2019s testosterone drops, which makes him depressed. If he only knew that women typically don\u2019t cry at work because they\u2019re sad. According to the research Lipman cites, women cry in the office because they\u2019re angry.\n\nThere is much to recommend this book, especially now, when record numbers of women are organizing, preparing to run for office and demanding change. So it\u2019s a bit disheartening to get to the end with only a handful of paragraphs on sexual harassment. Lipman managed to fold in a reference to Harvey Weinstein, but if there\u2019s one thing missing, it\u2019s a consideration of how sexual harassment, and the perhaps less quantifiable issue of why men fear ascendant women, lead to the disparities that she documents so persuasively. She is optimistic that men are capable of acting not only out of self-interest \u2014 though it\u2019s true, more female colleagues will make them richer \u2014 but out of the same moral imperative that once led privileged white men to abolish slavery and to \u201cgive\u201d women the right to vote. Lipman offers 12 \u201ctips and takeaways\u201d for moving forward, one of which inspired her title. To address what we might call the \u201cacknowledgment gap,\u201d she exhorts those paying attention in a meeting to repeat a statement that a woman has already made, to ensure she\u2019s recognized for it. Like her other suggestions, it\u2019s a nice idea, one that\u2019s been circulating among working women for a while. It reinforces her conviction that we must be vigilant in matters large and small if we want to shift the culture.

Wilbur has long been praised for his formal accomplishments. Often there has been some condescension in the praise, since we live in a time that prizes innovation, and Wilbur is one of those artists who perfected rather than invented a style. The entire argument misses what is truly revolutionary in his work, though: the light.\n\n\u201cObscurely yet most surely called to praise / As sometimes summer calls us all,\u201d Wilbur wrote in his 20s. The wonder here is not simply the pure gift on display \u2014 the music and memorability of these two lines! \u2014 but the gift given over to wonder. It never flagged. Well into his 80s, Wilbur still attended to \u201cthe blind delight of being.\u201d\n\nBlind delight is not the same as willful blindness. Wilbur saw shocking combat in World War II, which was when he began to write in earnest. As his biographers Robert and Mary Bagg reveal, he experienced serious depression and addiction, and he suffered that private apocalypse known only by the very old, who lose everything they ever loved, slowly. That poem celebrating \u201cthe blind delight of being\u201d is in fact about the final years of his wife, Charlee, whose death would rock Wilbur as nothing ever had.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And how much does one\u2019s will have to do with one\u2019s imagination? Many artists claim not to choose their subjects. True enough, but they do choose the range and focus of attention through which those subjects may come. \u201cTry to remember,\u201d Wilbur writes in this regard, \u201cwhat you project / Is what you will perceive; what you perceive / With any passion, be it love or terror, / May take on whims and powers of its own.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis dynamic has obvious artistic implications. A poet who feeds on pathologies eventually becomes their food. But the issue is larger than that. A culture, too, is a work of imagination, or a failure of it. We are meant to be in a golden age of the television drama, and perhaps we are. But just consider how thoroughly so many of these shows equate misery with authenticity, and how many rely on violence and degradation (usually toward women) to establish character and intensity. And now consider the broader culture we have found ourselves in for the past year or so. Does it not seem as if reality has begun to take on whims and powers of its own?\n\nBut poetry can hardly be compared to television in this regard, I can hear someone arguing. Quite right. Poetry is much more important. Poetry is the deepest expression, and the best hope for survival, of a culture\u2019s very soul.\n\nI don\u2019t intend a strictly dichotomous argument. Lowell and Bidart are not only influential but also deeply affecting. Of course we need art to explore the darkest recesses of our lives and minds. But we also need art to tell us why this world is worth loving, and therefore saving. I was heartened when Ross Gay\u2019s \u201cCatalog of Unabashed Gratitude\u201d swept onto the scene a few years ago, since it seemed to have, though in utterly different form, something of Wilbur\u2019s vitality and vision. Praise, too, is part of any whole artistic and existential vision. Joy is one kind of courage.\n\nI met Wilbur only once, long after I had fled my cave of pain, both literally and figuratively, using his poems as a kind of torch. It was 2006, and Wilbur came to Chicago to receive the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Charlee was already too ill to travel, and it was obvious that, though he was gracious and kind, his heart was elsewhere. But he read beautifully, and though he didn\u2019t say a word to the audience about what he and his wife were undergoing, he made sure to end the evening with his famous poem \u201cFor C.,\u201d which links the mundane sustaining of a relationship with the blazing creation of a world. This life is worth its grief, both his words and his silence were saying that evening. They still are.", "title": "The Poet of Light", "authors": ["Christian Wiman"]}

None of this is new.\n\nThis last year has once and for all pulled back the facade of a genteel American politics, whose proclaimed values line up with those of the candidates we support.

If the Catholic Church is ever to lift the deep stain of child sex abuse, the pope must take every opportunity to reject not only clear violations but also the slightest appearance of tolerance for such behavior.\n\nHe missed that opportunity by attending the funeral last month for Cardinal Bernard Law, the powerful former archbishop of Boston who resigned after revelations that he protected abusive priests for years and became, in effect, the image of a hierarchy that concealed and thereby enabled sexual abuse.

Clinton\u2019s promiscuity, he argued, implicated his fitness for governing: \u201cChronic indiscipline, compulsion, exploitation, the easy betrayal of vows, all suggest something wrong at a deep level \u2014 something habitual and beyond control,\u201d he wrote.\n\nI was reminded of Bennett\u2019s words by David Friend\u2019s fascinating recent book, \u201cThe Naughty Nineties: The Triumph of the American Libido,\u201d about the sexual scandals and cultural upheavals of that decade.

The Daily Beast then reported that another porn actress, Jessica Drake, who had accused Trump of offering her $10,000 for sex, signed a nondisclosure agreement barring her from talking about the president.\n\nIn any other administration, evidence that the president paid hush money to the star of \u201cGood Will Humping\u201d during the election would be a scandal.

Nixon and not Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey would become president. It left nearly everything else unresolved. The course of the war in Vietnam, where more than half a million American servicemen were stationed and more than 30,000 had been killed; the fate of the poor in an affluent, but widely unequal, society; the ideological direction of both major political parties; the relationship between the generations and between black and white Americans \u2014 all these questions remained open and raw. An election that involved, by the cultural critic John Leonard\u2019s accounting, an \u201cimmense expenditure \u2026 of money, bombast, blood and cretinism\u201d ended, in effect, in a draw: a narrow victory by the candidate who had disclosed the least about his plans and beliefs, and a nation stuck somewhere along (or maybe off) the path from the old politics to the new. How that all happened is not an unfamiliar story, but it remains, nearly 50 years later, a gripping one.\n\nLawrence O\u2019Donnell, the host of a political talk show on MSNBC, tells that story with zeal in \u201cPlaying With Fire.\u201d O\u2019Donnell was a high school student in 1968, and well remembers the feeling among many young men of draft age that life was \u201ca short-term game.\u201d The presidential election, the young O\u2019Donnell believed, \u201ccould end all that.\u201d Viewers of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s show will recognize, in \u201cPlaying With Fire,\u201d his faith in the redemptive power of public service \u2014 for all its disappointments and foolishness. As a former Senate staffer, O\u2019Donnell takes a practitioner\u2019s delight in the machinations of politics: He finds, and manages to convey, excitement in things like the movement of delegates from one camp to another. As a former producer and writer of the television drama \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d he also knows how to pace a story, and could not have dreamed up a more compelling cast of characters. On the Democratic side, in addition to Humphrey, there were Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, as well as President Lyndon B. Johnson, who left the race in March but then stalked the sidelines, hoping to be called back in. For the Republicans, a trio of governors \u2014 Ronald Reagan, Nelson A. Rockefeller and George Romney \u2014 threatened Nixon\u2019s ascension. And George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, ran as an independent and a spoiler. Never in the past century have so many heavyweights contended, all at once, for the White House.\n\nImage\n\nO\u2019Donnell moves briskly and ably through these candidacies, their collisions and a dark bacchanal of events that still defies belief: McCarthy\u2019s messianic yet reluctant crusade to unseat Johnson; Kennedy\u2019s entry into the race; Johnson\u2019s sudden withdrawal, and Kennedy\u2019s assassination the night he won the California primary; Wallace\u2019s provocation of \u201cthe common folks\u201d against blacks, elites and \u201clittle pinkos\u201d; the frenzy of police batons and tear gas at the Democratic convention in Chicago; and Nixon\u2019s secret flirtation with treason, his effort to \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d the president\u2019s attempts to start peace talks, lest a breakthrough in Vietnam benefit Humphrey\u2019s campaign. But \u201cPlaying With Fire\u201d is a too-familiar retelling. Over the past decade or two, vast collections of the participants\u2019 papers have been opened, yet O\u2019Donnell has done virtually no original research.

The country\u2019s top environment official, acknowledging citizens\u2019 response to the film, compared it to \u201cSilent Spring,\u201d the 1962 book that helped ignite the environmental movement in the United States.\n\nLess visible yet equally threatening is Beijing\u2019s impending water crisis. Groundwater supplies have been depleted to dangerously low levels.\n\nWhen desperate, authorities turn toward those with the least power to resist. In recent years, on top of discriminative policies the government has been waging a war on the \u201clow-end population,\u201d as migrants are referred to in official documents. Regulations in the name of urban improvement \u2014 neighborhood gentrification, school and service-sector upgrades \u2014 have been tightening restrictions over migrant employment and residence, chipping away at their livelihood so that remaining in the city has become less viable.\n\nAs a result, the exodus of migrants has accelerated, and the population of Beijing\u2019s six core districts dropped by 353,000 in 2016, the first decline since urbanization began four decades ago. Those migrants who have built national stadiums, ferried lunches for office workers, and nursed the babies of middle-class families are making their final contribution to the city by leaving. In its most recent five-year plan, Beijing has set the goal to cap its population at 23 million by 2020; the current number is inching close.\n\nThe depopulation drive is mirrored by other policies to reduce environmental stress. This winter, authorities issued a ban on using coal to heat homes in some regions surrounding Beijing (though the ban was later rescinded in some of the areas). Generous subsidies and tax breaks are in place to encourage the purchase of electric vehicles.

It is to still grapple with grander questions that go beyond the artist himself. The place, of course, in which these questions might be dealt with, in which the viewer gets to contend with the many facets of the art and the artist, is in these very institutions.\n\nThat said, the National Gallery seems to have made the correct decision in canceling Mr. Close\u2019s exhibition while keeping his works in its permanent collection. Artists, even celebrated ones like Mr. Close, who are still alive should not live free of consequence for their actions. If he is indeed guilty of the kinds of exploitation and unacceptable comments he is alleged to have made, he should not be able to benefit from the prestige and increased value of his work that would come his way from a major exhibit like this one. (Likewise Mr. Roma, if the accusations against him are true.)\n\nBut if Mr. Close is no longer deserving of a prestigious exhibition, some might reasonably fear that we\u2019re riding a terribly slippery slope. Are we headed toward a world without exhibitions of other immoral, sometimes criminal artists like Paul Gauguin, Picasso or Schiele, to name a few of our most talented and most personally brutal artists?\n\nThe answer is no. These men are dead and no longer able to personally benefit from exhibitions of their work. They should remain in permanent collections, as their art \u2014 as Mr. Close\u2019s will likely be \u2014 is still deeply important to the timeline of art history. It cannot be so easily taken out.\n\nIf one were able to entirely dismiss the works of bad men from the history of art and music, unbridgeable gaps would still remain. Where would Henri Matisse have been, for instance, without Gauguin\u2019s revolutionary use of undiluted color? Where would the fractured, suspenseful phrasing structure that makes up so much of what is now considered \u201cepic\u201d music be without Richard Wagner? We should never accept Wagner\u2019s Nazi ties, but his technical and formal contributions to music are neither personal nor inherently evil and thus we must reckon with his genuine contribution to the history of music.\n\nFor the rest of his lifetime, if these allegations prove true, it seems unlikely that Mr. Close will get many further major, public exhibitions. But the most important reckoning \u2014 the question of Mr. Close\u2019s artistic legacy and his place in the history of art \u2014 will necessarily come only after he is gone, when only his work remains.", "title": "Opinion | The Problem With Chuck Close", "authors": []}

A caption reads, \u201cChinese spirit, Chinese image, Chinese culture, Chinese voice.\u201d\n\nOne Family\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, sees strife in areas that are home to large populations of ethnic minorities as one of the biggest threats to the party\u2019s dominance. That includes the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang, where conflict has broken out between security forces and residents who have protested severe limits on religion and free speech.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe government says it is stamping out separatism, but advocates say Mr. Xi is leading a campaign to undermine minority culture and to promote the dominance of the Han ethnicity and the Communist Party, which is officially atheist.\n\nIn public, the party often embraces the idea of ethnic harmony, broadcasting videos on prime-time television of minority groups performing traditional rites, for example.\n\nThis image above, which shows people from a variety of ethnic tribes, reiterates the party\u2019s position that China\u2019s more than 50 ethnicities are \u201cunited by one heart.\u201d It is a warning to any group in a faraway region that may consider challenging Mr. Xi\u2019s policies.\n\nLoyalty at Home\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s and \u201970s, the party was at the center of everyday life. Mao Zedong\u2019s image hung in homes as a symbol of the hopes of the people, and families studied his speeches and writings assiduously.\n\nMr. Xi has called for a return to the days when offices, schools and community groups were lively hubs of party worship and families united behind a singular leader. He has presented himself as a transformational figure in ways that recall the personality cult of the Mao era.\n\nIn this image above, which shows a woman sewing a Communist flag under the words \u201cheart toward the party,\u201d the government is reviving the idea of sacrifice for the party and suggesting that socialist ideals should inform daily decisions.\n\nA Clean Party\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Xi, who is general secretary of the Communist Party, has led a withering campaign against corruption that has ensnared thousands of officials, as well as many of his political rivals.\n\nThis poster highlights his campaign by quoting a Chinese proverb used to describe a person free of corruption: \u201cPure wind in two sleeves.\u201d The idea is that clean officials do not hide anything up their sleeves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Xi has said the party can survive only if it eliminates corruption, and he is preparing, as he begins his second five-year term, to expand the campaign to millions more people.\n\nWhile graft is still rampant in China, Mr. Xi\u2019s efforts to fight corruption have made him popular in many areas. Here, propagandists are reminding the public of the president\u2019s commitment to the issue. \u201cKeep the alarm bells ringing,\u201d the poster says.\n\nCommon Values\n\nPhoto\n\nIn China, criticizing Mr. Xi can land you in prison. The news media is under the constant watch of censors. Local elections, when they are held, are often a farce.\n\nBut the government sees things differently. Officially, the Communist Party embraces a dozen \u201ccore socialist values,\u201d including freedom, rule of law, justice and democracy. These values are memorized by schoolchildren and immortalized in song-and-dance routines.\n\nThe values, shown in the image above intertwining the hands of several people, are meant as a rebuttal to those in the West who criticize China\u2019s authoritarian system and human rights abuses.

Lyndon Johnson could be downright mean to his wife, Lady Bird, upbraiding her in public and comparing her with women he found more beautiful. But when he was upset about negative press coverage ahead of the Democratic National Convention in 1964, it was his wife who cheered him on. In a fawning letter, Mrs. Johnson wrote: \u201cBeloved \u2014 You are as brave a man as Harry Truman \u2014 or FDR \u2014 or Lincoln. You can go on to find some peace, some achievement amidst all the pain.

He\u2019s really as relaxed and hopeful as he appears.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton was the first first lady to run for office, but as progressive and groundbreaking as she was, she nonetheless made the decision to stand by her husband after he admitted his affair with the White House intern Monica Lewinsky, regardless of her own hurt and humiliation. The day after President Clinton testified before a grand jury and came clean to the country, Mrs. Clinton marched across the South Lawn together with Bill, their daughter, Chelsea, standing between them, holding both of her parents\u2019 hands, as they headed for Marine One to embark on their annual summer vacation on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. It was the photo-op the president needed.\n\nMaybe Mrs. Trump is more like Michelle Obama than people think.

And they are portraying a dossier written by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, which laid out unverified claims that Russia had compromised Mr. Trump and was conspiring with him, as the fountainhead of the Russia investigation. That assertion disregards unrelated evidence that Russia sought to influence the election and the pattern of contacts between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s associates.\n\nMr. Nunes\u2019s three-and-a-half page memo bolsters conservatives\u2019 story line. According to people who have read it, the memo centers on a fall 2016 application for a wiretap order targeting Carter Page, a onetime Trump campaign official who had visited Moscow that June and was preparing to return there in December. The memo is said to criticize law enforcement officials for including information provided by Mr. Steele in the application without adequately explaining to the judge that Democrats financed Mr. Steele\u2019s research.\n\nDemocrats have pushed back. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, who has seen the underlying classified materials on which the memo is based, has said the memo contains both inaccurate assertions and material omissions to misleadingly impugn law enforcement officials. Other people familiar with it say, for example, that Mr. Steele\u2019s information was only one thread in a tapestry of evidence from various sources that the memo ignored, exaggerating its relative importance.\n\nDemocrats on the committee produced their own classified memo that they said pointed out and explained inaccuracies in the Republican memo and filled in the missing context. But on Monday, the committee voted along party lines to make the Republican memo public and rejected a request to simultaneously make public the Democrats\u2019 rebuttal.\n\nAsked on Tuesday about why it would not be more appropriate to make both memos public at the same time, Mr. Ryan was evasive. He said the Democratic memo first had to go through a process in which House members outside the Intelligence Committee could read it. Pressed on why the Republican memo should not be held back until that process was done, he said a reporter had asked enough questions.\n\nMr. Ryan then began remarks he said he had prepared, stressing that he respected the F.B.I. and the Justice Department as important institutions for \u201ckeeping the rule of law intact.\u201d But on Monday, Intelligence Committee Republicans signaled a widening attack on both institutions \u2014 informing Democrats that the committee has opened an investigation into them, according to Mr. Schiff \u2014 as they voted to make their memo public.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf particular importance, the Republican memo is said to cite the role of Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general appointed by Mr. Trump last year, in signing off on an application to extend the surveillance of Mr. Page \u2014 meaning he approved the resubmission of Mr. Steele\u2019s information to the court. Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s role could provide critics of the inquiry ammunition to go after him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder Justice Department regulations, only Mr. Rosenstein can fire Mr. Mueller, and only if he finds that the special counsel has committed misconduct \u2014 something he has repeatedly said he has not seen any sign of. But if Mr. Trump were to fire Mr. Rosenstein, he could install a more accommodating replacement willing to say that he or she had spotted a reason to justify removing the special counsel and shutting down the investigation.\n\nOn Tuesday, when Mr. Ryan maintained there was no connection between the memo and Mr. Mueller\u2019s work, the speaker also portrayed Mr. Nunes\u2019s committee as trying to be transparent as it carried out oversight into whether the executive branch had violated civil liberties using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He and his allies turned back a push by reform-minded lawmakers to impose significant new safeguards to protect Americans\u2019 civil liberties against the potential for abuses.\n\nMr. Nunes also has earned a reputation of being a staunch Trump loyalist \u2014 or \u201cTrump\u2019s stooge,\u201d as his hometown newspaper, The Fresno Bee, called him last week. Last year, he dramatically announced that a whistle-blower had shown him materials revealing that Obama administration officials had improperly \u201cunmasked\u201d the identities of Mr. Trump\u2019s associates in intelligence reports based on surveillance, and that he intended to inform the White House about what he had learned. But it later emerged that Mr. Trump\u2019s aides at the White House had shown him those materials, and other Republicans who later examined them concluded no one had been improperly unmasked.\n\nThat Mr. Nunes\u2019s actions undermined his credibility does not mean, however, that law enforcement officials made no mistakes in the highly fraught political environment of the day. The Justice Department\u2019s independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, is finishing an inquiry into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email server investigation, and he is expected to deliver some harsh findings about senior Justice Department and F.B.I. officials in the Obama administration.\n\nAs part of its examination, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s team uncovered the texts between two F.B.I. officials who also worked on the Russia investigation in its early stages, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, expressing intense animus for Mr. Trump. Mr. Horowitz brought those messages to the attention of Mr. Mueller, who immediately removed Mr. Strzok from his team; Ms. Page had already left by then. The final inspector general report is expected to sharply criticize both.\n\nFor now, however, Mr. Nunes\u2019s memo is coming to define a political landscape already cratered by Mr. Trump\u2019s recurring calls to reinvestigate Mrs. Clinton; his firing of the former F.B.I. director James B.

Stars like Nomadic Fanatic (a full-time RVer who travels with his cat, Jax, and has 130,000 subscribers) provide inspiration and technical advice, along with a forum for a tribe that can feel isolated from each other and society. It is also a revenue model, albeit a modest one.\n\nThis is a community that has no relation to the social media phenomenon known collectively as #vanlife, for the Instagrammable adventures of attractive young white couples in their atmospheric vintage VW vans, doing yoga, surfing and accruing sponsorship from the makers of hipster products. (Though the odd festival fan will show up at the RTR, having seemingly confused Quartzsite with Coachella, only to be confounded by the lack of swag and services, like the guy who came two years ago and complained on an online forum that there was no sound stage or bathhouse.)\n\nThe Rubber Tramp Rendezvous is a different kind of van-dweller mecca, said Jessica Bruder, whose 2017 book, \u201cNomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d followed a small posse of retirement-age women forced into the van life through economic hardship, part of a new \u2014 and growing \u2014 labor force of older Americans working seasonally as campground hosts and Amazon stockers.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe world stigmatizes people who live differently,\u201d Ms. Bruder said. \u201cThe RTR is full of kindred spirits, like a non-blood family.

When they get to the RTR, it melts away.\u201d\n\nWhile van culture may be growing because more and more people are caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of flat wages and rising home prices, Ms. Bruder added, \u201cI also think people are frustrated by consumer culture and what they are supposed to want. People who are constrained by economics are also saying, \u2018I can opt out.\u2019 I think that can be tremendously liberating.\u201d\n\nFor her research, Ms. Bruder bought a white GMC Vandura, named it Halen, for the 1980s hair band, and learned to correct for its sideways drift on the highways.

Originally from Lithuania, she grew up in a small town in upstate New York and felt like \u201ckind of a freak.\u201d Her fairy tale was about two mother birds who adopt an odd-looking egg. \u201cIt was a bit of commentary on how people gossip and judge other people\u2019s choices,\u201d said Ms. Miniotas, 30, who has purple hair, partly shaved. \u201cI identify as a queer person and have friends in nontraditional family structures.

Around the same time, both of my sisters had a bunch of kids, and it was a moment to take some time off with my family. I spent most of that year off in the library and saw the flyer about the nanny workshop. I wasn\u2019t the target audience, but it\u2019s a profound opportunity to explain the world to the next generation.\u201d Ms. Razook wrote a poem about two dots and a spot. \u201cThe spot keeps trying to fit in, in these tortuous ways,\u201d she said. \u201cReally I was writing about power and greed, about trying to keep up with the bigger forces in life.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Abbas, the camaraderie that develops is the most important aspect of the workshop. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those beautiful experiences showing that groups of people are not a monolith,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had one woman who spoke no English and a twentysomething white woman from Texas.

And the library was a space that was not centered on religion or moralizing.\u201d When she moved to Brooklyn and discovered the workshop while looking after a 3-year-old, she wrote a story about the concept of home, about trying to live in a different place where everything is new and confusing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for a nanny to have a community,\u201d said Ms. Rennhack. \u201cYou work in somebody else\u2019s house, you don\u2019t have co-workers, and you feel like part of the family but you\u2019re really not. The workshop works because there\u2019s a lot of patience and wisdom and empathy in that room.

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "To prompt their thinking, you might start by asking:\n\n\u2022 What have you heard or learned about sexual harassment?\n\n\u2022 What do you know about the #MeToo movement?\n\n\u2022 How do you feel about the movement? You can represent your feelings with a word or an image.\n\n\u2022 What questions do you have about this movement and the many issues it has raised over the past several months?\n\n\u2022 Why might this be a difficult topic to discuss in class?\n\nAfter students have had time to reflect, discuss all but the last question as a class. If students wrote anonymously, you might read aloud from some of the submissions to get the discussion started. As the class talks, highlight patterns in their feelings and observations and write down student questions on a poster paper so you can continue to address them over the course of the unit.\n\nFinally, take on the last question: Why might this be a difficult topic to discuss in class? What barriers might there be to learning about this topic and discussing it as a group? Are there ground rules that should be developed? If so, what should they be? Over all, do they think this is an important topic to take on in school? Why or why not?\n\n_________\n\nBuild Background Knowledge on Sexual Harassment\n\nVideo\n\nFor students to understand the significance of the #MeToo movement, they must understand the events that led to this cultural reckoning. Start by watching the Retro Report video \u201cWhy Hasn\u2019t Sexual Harassment Disappeared?,\u201d which traces the evolution of sexual harassment in the workplace from the defining of the term in the mid-1970s, to Anita Hill\u2019s testimony in 1991, to the current deluge of allegations against powerful men in entertainment, media, politics and other industries.\n\nAgree on Definitions\n\nAs they watch, ask students to come up with a working definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d using a Frayer model or some other vocabulary tool. The definition of this term is part of the conversation that the #MeToo movement, and those before it, has sparked, so students can continue to add to and revise their definitions as they learn throughout the unit.\n\nThe Times defines sexual harassment in the workplace this way:\n\nSexual harassment in the workplace is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of unwanted behaviors. This includes nonphysical harassment, including suggestive remarks and gestures, or requests for sexual favors. Physical harassment includes touches, hugs, kisses and coerced sex acts. It can be perpetrated by anyone \u2014 a manager, a colleague, a client. The perpetrator or the recipient may be male or female. It does not need to occur inside the office.\n\nNote to teachers: Discussing sexual harassment often involves legal and technical language. The Times uses the terms \u201csexual harassment\u201d and \u201csexual misconduct\u201d to refer to a range of behaviors that are sexual in nature and nonconsensual. The term \u201csexual assault\u201d usually signifies a felony sexual offense, like rape.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor more information, see the legal definition of sexual harassment from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, these examples of sexual harassment from the United Nations and this definition of consent from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.\n\nYou might have students read these documents and add examples and non-examples of sexual harassment to their Frayer model. Depending on the reading level of your students, you may also want to prepare a vocabulary sheet to help them understand other words they may not know related to this topic. You might also ask them why it is so important to understand how all these terms are defined.\n\nAnnotate a Timeline\n\nAs students watch, read and research during this unit, they might take notes by creating an annotated timeline, plotting the events that have led up to the #MeToo moment and briefly explaining what makes them significant in the current context.\n\nAfter they have watched the Retro Report video, invite them to read \u201cThe \u2018Click\u2019 Moment: How the Weinstein Scandal Unleashed a Tsunami\u201d and add the information in it to their timelines.\n\nThe article begins:\n\nForty years ago this month, Ms. magazine put sexual harassment on its cover for the first time. Understanding the sensitivity of the topic, the editors used puppets for the cover image \u2014 a male hand reaching into a woman\u2019s blouse \u2014 rather than a photograph. It was banned from some supermarkets nonetheless. In 1977, the term sexual harassment had not been defined in the law and had barely entered the public lexicon. And yet, to read that Ms. article today, amid a profound shift in discourse, is to feel haunted by its familiarity. It describes an executive assistant who quit after her boss asked for oral sex; a student who dropped out after being assaulted by her adviser; a black medical administrator whose white supervisor asked if the women in her neighborhood were prostitutes \u2014 and, subsequently, if she would have group sex with him and several colleagues. Citing a survey in which 88 percent of women said they were harassed at work, the author said the problem permeated almost every profession, but was particularly pernicious \u201cin the supposedly glamorous profession of acting,\u201d in which Hollywood\u2019s casting couch remained a \u201cstrong convention.\u201d \u201cWhat we have so far seen,\u201d the article stated, \u201cis only the tip of a very large and very destructive iceberg.\u201d Four decades later, as allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others continue to metastasize, it feels as if we have crashed into the iceberg. Disaster metaphors \u2014 tsunami, hurricane, avalanche, landslide \u2014 seem to be in endless rotation to describe the moment, but the point is that a great many powerful men have seen their careers disintegrate, and with astonishing speed.\n\nReview the sexual harassment timelines that students have created and, if you would like to go deeper, compare them to this interactive sexual harassment timeline from KQED.\n\nHave a Class Discussion\n\nIn response to the video and article discuss as a class:\n\n\u2022 What has catalyzed the #MeToo moment? Why is this suddenly in the news?\n\n\u2022 What progress has been made since people first started talking about sexual harassment in the workplace in the 1970s? In your opinion, what still needs to be done and why?\n\n\u2022 What effects have sexual harassment and misconduct in general had on society? What examples can you give?\n\n\u2022 Do men and boys have a different role to play than women and girls in fighting sexual harassment? If so, how? If not, why not?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 In your opinion, is this a watershed moment or turning point in the conversation around sexual misconduct in the workplace and beyond? Why or why not?\n\nTo end this part of the unit, you might invite your students to weigh in with their answers on our Student Opinion question: \u201cWhat Is Your Reaction to the #MeToo Movement?\u201d (Our student questions are open for response indefinitely.)\n\n__________\n\nUnderstand the Impact of Sexual Harassment on Individuals and Society Today\n\nPhoto\n\nSince the allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein broke late in 2017, the conversation about sexual harassment has evolved, becoming more complex and nuanced. In an article for The Cut, Rebecca Traister writes about the impact of widespread sexual harassment not only on individual people, but also on our society as a whole:\n\nAll these variations, all these stories \u2026 I\u2019m so tired. Tired of getting \u2014 or hearing about other women getting \u2014 grabbed or pinched or demeaned, tired of having had to laugh. I\u2019m tired of feeling paralyzed, unable to confront friends and colleagues about what they just said or did, because we know being the scold is its own form of self-exile, of exposure and vulnerability, of risk. If this were a feminist mini-series, gorgeously shot, with a tidy narrative, this beat \u2014 the outpouring of stories and memories we didn\u2019t even know we\u2019d repressed \u2014 would be wrapping up, and we\u2019d be moving on to the denouement. But there is no sign of a pause; there are indications that it is just beginning. In hearing these individual tales, we\u2019re not only learning about individual trespasses but for the first time getting a view of the matrix in which we\u2019ve all been living: We see that the men who have had the power to abuse women\u2019s bodies and psyches throughout their careers are in many cases also the ones in charge of our political and cultural stories.\n\nAnd in \u201cThe #MeToo Moment: What\u2019s Next?\u201d Jessica Bennett writes for The Times:\n\nI hope we talk about culture as much as we talk about individuals, and recognize that while the Weinsteins of the world are extreme, the messages we learn about sex, and power, and courtship, and consent, are deeply ingrained and start young \u2014 and will take far more than a workplace sexual harassment training to unlearn.\n\nIn this section, students explore how the pervasiveness of sexual harassment affects all of us on personal, professional and societal levels. They also begin to address some of the many questions the #MeToo conversation has sparked on the nature of sexual misconduct: Why does it happen? Why has it persisted? Why do victims often not speak up against their abusers? Is it about sex, power, both or something else?\n\nJigsaw\n\nPhoto\n\nAssign, or allow students to choose, one of the following articles to read in small \u201cexpert\u201d groups for a jigsaw activity.\n\nRemind them that each of these articles provides just one opinion, with which they may agree or disagree. You might provide them with some guiding questions and ask them to annotate as they read:\n\n\u2022 What is the author\u2019s overall argument about the root causes of sexual harassment?\n\n\u2022 What points resonate with you? Which challenge your beliefs? Why?\n\n\u2022 What evidence does the author provide to support his or her argument? Is it credible and substantial?\n\n\u201cHow Wall Street Bro Talk Keeps Women Down\u201d critiques men\u2019s participation in the objectification of women:\n\nFor my entire life, I\u2019ve heard men talk about women. On baseball fields, in wrestling locker rooms, at frat parties and in private conversations, I\u2019ve listened to men dissect women into body parts. When I was younger, I did it, too. Casually objectifying women \u2014 speaking in an unguarded way, using language we never would in mixed company \u2014 brought us together.\n\n\u201cSexual Harassment: It\u2019s About Power, Not Lust\u201d was written in 1991, but its premise remains relevant:\n\nOne of a flood of tales that have surfaced in the wake of Anita F. Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment in hearings on Clarence Thomas\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, the story underscores a picture that is emerging from extensive research on such harassment: it has less to do with sex than with power. It is a way to keep women in their place; through harassment men devalue a woman\u2019s role in the work place by calling attention to her sexuality.\n\n\u201cThe Unexamined Brutality of the Male Libido\u201d offers a contentious counterpoint to that power argument:\n\nMen arrive at this moment of reckoning woefully unprepared. Most are shocked by the reality of women\u2019s lived experience. Almost all are uninterested or unwilling to grapple with the problem at the heart of all this: the often ugly and dangerous nature of the male libido.\n\n\u201cWhen Saying \u2018Yes\u2019 Is Easier Than Saying \u2018No\u2019\u201d examines the tricky subject of consent in intimate relationships:\n\nSometimes \u201cyes\u201d means \u201cno,\u201d simply because it is easier to go through with it than explain our way out of the situation. Sometimes \u201cno\u201d means \u201cyes,\u201d because you actually do want to do it, but you know you\u2019re not supposed to lest you be labeled a slut. And if you\u2019re a man, that \u201cno\u201d often means \u201cjust try harder\u201d \u2014 because, you know, persuasion is part of the game.\n\n\u201cShe Didn\u2019t Fight Back: 5 (Misguided) Reasons People Doubt Sexual Assault Survivors\u201d challenges myths about sexual assault:\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons women who report sexual misconduct, from unwanted advances by their bosses to groping or forced sex acts, are not believed, and with a steady drumbeat of new reports making headlines, the country is hearing a lot of them.\n\n\u201cMen and Women Say They\u2019re More Different Than Similar\u201d explores the traditional notions of gender that underlie a culture of sexual harassment:\n\nMen are tough; women are in touch with their feelings. Men are providers; women are nurturers. Men should punch back when provoked; women should be physically attractive. These stereotypical beliefs about gender differences remain strong, found a new survey from the Pew Research Center on Tuesday.\n\nThen, create \u201cteaching\u201d groups with one or two students from each \u201cexpert\u201d group. Allow each student to present his or her article and ask the other students to take notes on the different perspectives in a graphic organizer such as this one.\n\nClass Discussion\n\nAfter all students have presented their points, invite them to discuss in their small groups or as a whole class the factors that contribute to a culture of sexual harassment. Encourage them to respectfully agree or disagree by citing evidence from the articles or their own experiences. Some conversation starters might include:\n\n\u2022 Why does sexual harassment happen?\n\n\u2022 If this has been happening all along, why are we just hearing about it now?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Why is the problem of sexual misconduct so widespread?\n\n\u2022 What is the role of gender in sexual harassment?\n\n\u2022 What can we do as a society? What can we do as individuals?\n\n\u2022 Based on your reading, do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not?\n\nTwo Ways to Close This Section of the Unit: A Barometer Activity or a Gallery Walk\n\nBarometer\n\n\n\nIn a barometer activity, students listen to a statement and then stand up and move to a point between \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d and \u201cStrongly Disagree\u201d that reflects their opinion. Begin by stating the prompt, then allow students to find their place on the continuum. After all students have moved, ask a few to explain why they chose that position. If they feel so moved by the discussion, let them change their place on the barometer and explain why they did so. You may also want students to prepare their answers in writing before engaging in the discussion.\n\nSome possible prompts include:\n\n\u2022 Stereotypes about men and women are harmful.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s hard to tell the difference between sexual harassment and flirting.\n\n\u2022 Sexual harassment is natural.\n\n\u2022 If we wanted to end sexual harassment, it would be easy to do.\n\n\u2022 Sexual harassment is mostly a women\u2019s issue.\n\n\u2022 Sexual harassment is a problem at our school.\n\nGallery Walk\n\nOr, invite students to share the implications of what they learned with the rest of the class in a gallery walk. On a piece of poster paper, have each student create a \u201cone-pager\u201d about the article they read. In this format, students create a visual of some kind that captures a key aspect of the article, literally or symbolically, but they also include a quotation from the article that seems important, and pose a question for the journalist or for someone mentioned in the article. Here is an activity sheet that can guide them.\n\nAfter students have completed their work, post it on the walls or leave it at individual desks and invite the class to move around silently and respond to what they see on sticky notes with questions, comments or connections.\n\nFinally, as a class, discuss the larger patterns among the different articles. How does sexual harassment affect individuals? How does it affect society? What might our world look like without it?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n__________\n\nHas #MeToo Gone Too Far? Debate the Issue\n\nPhoto\n\nThe #MeToo movement has tried to hold sexual abusers accountable for their actions in the workplace and in broader society. As with any movement toward widespread social change, though, a backlash has been brewing, with some saying the movement has gone too far.\n\n\n\nIn \u201cPublicly, We Say #MeToo. Privately, We Have Misgivings.,\u201d Daphne Merkin writes:\n\nFor many weeks now, the conversation that has been going on in private about this reckoning is radically different from the public one. This is not a good sign, suggesting the sort of social intimidation that is the underside of a culture of political correctness, such as we are increasingly living in. The women I know \u2014 of all ages \u2014 have responded by and large with a mixture of slightly horrified excitement (bordering on titillation) as to who will be the next man accused and overt disbelief. Publicly, they say the right things, expressing approval and joining in the chorus of voices that applaud the takedown of maleficent characters who prey on vulnerable women in the workplace. In private it\u2019s a different story. \u201cGrow up, this is real life,\u201d I hear these same feminist friends say. \u201cWhat ever happened to flirting?\u201d and \u201cWhat about the women who are the predators?\u201d Some women, including random people I talk to in supermarket lines, have gone so far as to call it an outright witch hunt.\n\nWhere do your students stand within the debate? What do they really think about the conversations being had and the ways men are being held accountable for sexual misconduct? Do they think #MeToo has gone too far \u2014 or not far enough?\n\nEngage students in a structured discussion, such as a debate, a Fishbowl or a Four Corners activity, where they can voice their opinions honestly and listen to other perspectives respectfully.\n\nWe recommend the articles below for a wide variety of perspectives. You might choose to have half the class read one side of the issue and the other half read the other side. Or, have every student read at least one article from each point of view to get a well-rounded understanding of the debate.\n\nArticles generally in support of the #MeToo movement\n\nYes, This Is a Witch Hunt. I\u2019m a Witch and I\u2019m Hunting You.\n\nAmber Tamblyn: I\u2019m Not Ready for the Redemption of Men\n\nResponse to French Letter Denouncing #MeToo Shows a Sharp Divide\n\nHow the Myth of the Artistic Genius Excuses the Abuse of Women\n\nWhen Sexual Assault Victims Are Charged With Lying\n\nArticles that question the movement:\n\nPublicly, We Say #MeToo. Privately, We Have Misgivings.\n\nWhen #MeToo Goes Too Far\n\nCatherine Deneuve and Others Denounce the #MeToo Movement\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019m Not Convinced Franken Should Quit\n\nThe Limits of \u2018Believe All Women\u2019\n\nTo facilitate the discussion, you might ask:\n\n\u2022 Has the #MeToo movement gone too far? If so, what is the limit? If not, why not and is there a limit?\n\n\u2022 What should happen to people who are accused or guilty of sexual harassment and assault?\n\n\u2022 Should we always \u201cbelieve all women\u201d? What are the benefits and drawbacks of doing so?\n\n\u2022 Do these conversations around sexual harassment and assault make relations between men and women better or worse? Why do you think so?\n\n__________\n\nBring It Home: Sexual Harassment and Teenagers\n\nPhoto\n\nNote to teachers: Any discussion of sexual harassment in our society will quickly involve students\u2019 own experiences, in and out of school. Below are several ideas for how students might consider some of the questions raised by the activities above in terms of how they affect their own communities. This is obviously a sensitive thing to take on in a classroom, and we welcome your ideas. How have you addressed these issues with your students? Please post thoughts to our comments section.\n\n1. Research School Practices and Policies\n\nA recent survey by The Upshot reports:\n\nThe victims of sexual harassment who have recently come forward are far from alone: Nearly half of women say they have experienced some form of it at work at least once in their careers. But there has been little research about those responsible. In a new survey, about a third of men said they had done something at work within the past year that would qualify as objectionable behavior or sexual harassment.\n\nDo your students think peer-to-peer sexual harassment is a problem at your school? How do they know?\n\nInvite them to investigate the policies and protocols already in place school-wide, and perhaps even district- or statewide. Students might interview teachers, administrators and fellow students to learn the following:\n\n\u2022 How comprehensive, thoughtful and practical are the policies we have now?\n\n\u2022 How well do they seem to work?\n\n\u2022 How might they be improved?\n\nBased on their analysis, what recommendations might your students make about these policies? How can they communicate these recommendations? For example, might they write a piece for the school newspaper? Send a letter to administrators? Create an annotated reading list for their peers? Sponsor an awareness-raising campaign or \u201cteach-in\u201d around the issue for the school as a whole?\n\n2. Revise Your Sex Ed Curriculum\n\nHow much does your school\u2019s sex education curriculum address sexual harassment? Consent? Gender roles? Healthy relationships?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn California, lessons about sexual consent are now required:\n\nThe legislation requires school districts that already include health as a graduation requirement to teach about \u201cyes means yes\u201d and sexual violence prevention starting next year. It also asks state education officials to update curriculum guidelines for high school health classes with information about those topics. Under a \u201cyes means yes\u201d standard, sexual activity is considered consensual only when both partners clearly state their willingness to participate through \u201caffirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement\u201d at every stage.\n\nAsk your students to do an audit of their sex education curriculum, either by sharing experiences they have had in class or by analyzing learning materials like worksheets and textbooks. What do they learn about sexual harassment, consent and gender? What messages do boys get about these topics? What messages do girls get? In their opinions, is what they learn about sex helpful in combating the social norms that have allowed sexual misconduct to continue? Or does it perpetuate them?\n\nInvite students to do further research into how to address these issues with young people. In addition to the above resources on sexual harassment, they might also read some of these articles for a deeper look at sex education and consent:\n\nSex Ed Lesson: \u2018Yes Means Yes,\u2019 but It\u2019s Tricky\n\nTeaching Good Sex\n\nCampus Sex \u2026 With a Syllabus\n\nMaking Consent Cool: Students Advocate for Consensual Sex\n\nAffirmative Consent: Are Students Really Asking?\n\nTalking to Children About Consent\n\nTalking With Both Daughters and Sons About Sex\n\nAfter they complete the reading, assign them to groups and ask them to outline the sex education curriculum they would like schools to teach. Encourage them to consider gaps in learning about gender, consent and sexual harassment. How can their curriculum help students understand the many factors that contribute to sexual misconduct? How can it disrupt harmful stereotypes about boys and girls? How might the curriculum be balanced to encourage all students to share their voices? Students might even create a sample lesson plan for one of these issues and teach it to the class.\n\nTo increase the academic rigor of the exercise, have students compare what\u2019s taught in their school to the National Sexuality Education Standards.\n\n3. Examine the Role of Technology and Social Media in Sexual Harassment\n\n\n\nShould sexting be a crime? Invite your students to watch and respond to this video by our colleagues at KQED\u2019s Above the Noise.\n\nThen, have them read \u201cTeenagers, Stop Asking for Nude Photos.\u201d In the article, Lisa Damour writes:\n\nTeenagers are drafted into a sexual culture that rests on a harmful premise: On the heterosexual field, boys typically play offense and girls play defense. This problematic framework underlies the findings of a new study that documents, in alarming detail, girls\u2019 reports of the common coercive practices boys use to solicit nude digital photographs. An analysis of nearly 500 accounts from 12- to 18-year-old girls about their negative experiences with sexting found that over two-thirds had been asked for explicit images. \u2026 \u2026 In the wider culture, it appears we have suddenly come to the limit of our tolerance for the sexualized abuse of power by adult men. A logical next step is to recalibrate some of the toxic norms that have taken hold among teenagers. Most schools and many parents already tell teenagers not to send sexualized selfies. But why don\u2019t we also tell adolescents to stop asking for nude photos from one another?\n\nWe posed our own Student Opinion question about this article, asking What Advice Should Parents and Counselors Give Teenagers About Sexting? One student wrote:\n\nI find it concerning that the statistics proving males\u2019 higher likelihood of pressuring girls for photos of this nature is so distinct. In light of all that is going on regarding sexual misconduct, in particular the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement, it makes me think that \u2014 although it could not be entirely eliminated \u2014 the awareness of this issue could prevent this sexting issue, which is the \u201cnorm\u201d in today\u2019s world, from expanding into sexual harassment and assault such as molestation and rape. Both the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement and sexting stories provided in the article draw uncanny parallels which must be addressed and cured.\n\nHave your students participate in the conversation by reading other students\u2019 responses and then writing to us with their own ideas about the advice teenagers should get about sexting \u2014 and the kinds of support they need when dealing with this issue.\n\n4. Consider What One Individual Can Do\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat actions \u2014 big or small \u2014 can your students commit to as individuals to help create a safe and inclusive society for all people and prevent the continuation of a culture of sexual assault and harassment in their generation?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYou might invite your students to write down ideas \u2014 as many as they each can come up with \u2014 on sticky notes, and post those notes all over a wall of your classroom. Then, as students walk around and read what others wrote, they can think about which of the suggested actions they would be willing to take. They might then keep a private journal of their actions and thoughts around this issue, and report back to class in future days about the results.\n\nIf they need help coming up with ideas, you might have students read one or more of these articles and identify the strategies that the authors suggest men and women can use to stop sexual harassment:\n\nThis Is a Man Problem\n\nHow to Help Kids Disrupt \u2018Bro Culture\u2019\n\nThe #MeToo Moment: How to Be a (Good) Bystander\n\nSteinem, Sandberg and Judd on How to End Sex Harassment\n\n__________\n\nRespond to What You\u2019ve Learned by Creating Something\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the end of a unit on this topic, students can deepen their reflections and voice their opinions through creative responses like the following. They might work individually on the project of their choice, work together in small groups, or, as a class, choose one of these ideas to do together.\n\n1. Make Art Inspired by the Reckoning\n\nThe Times\u2019s gender editor, Jessica Bennett, writes:\n\nFrom Picasso\u2019s Guernica \u2014 observed as a cry against the atrocities of the Spanish War \u2014 to the graffiti of the Arab Spring, social movements and injustice have long inspired art of all forms. The #MeToo Moment is no exception.\n\nThe Times asked readers to submit work based on this theme and published it with comments from the artist. Let students view the artwork readers created and then ask them to create their own visual representations of the #MeToo moment.\n\nOr, they can design an editorial cartoon in response to an article on sexual harassment, as several students did in our 2017 Editorial Cartoon Contest.\n\n2. Weigh In Like a Late Night Talk Show Host\n\nLate night talk show hosts often use their platforms to respond to the news. Many, like Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah and Jimmy Fallon have been weighing in on the #MeToo movement with passion and humor. Let students watch one or more of the excerpts from the shows above, using it as a mentor text for their own late night talk show.\n\nWhich topics from the conversation around sexual harassment get your students most animated? Have them choose an article from The Times Topics Sexual Harassment page or another source and prepare a monologue in response to it. Just as late night hosts do, they should use specific evidence from the article, other resources and their own experiences to defend their position. They should also consider how they can effectively use humor, emotion, empathy and logic to communicate their message.\n\nNote to teacher: Some of the linked videos do use expletives.\n\n3. Remix Beauty Standards\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the Golden Globes this year, women and men wore black in solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct and effectively redefined the purpose of the red carpet. The Times followed suit, as Bonnie Wertheim writes:\n\nAt The Times, where I work on the Styles desk, red carpet slide shows are a mainstay of awards season. We watch, pick our personal bests and worsts, and publish images that millions of people then judge for themselves. The photographs, at best, reflect a desire for shiny distractions. But there is a complicity to scrutinizing and ranking these women, too. Their dresses are not a reflection of their own style or their professional achievements. They speak to the larger economy of Hollywood, whose corruption becomes clearer with each turn of the news cycle. Moreover, our habitual participation in the red carpet industrial complex underscores the widely held perception that women\u2019s bodies are available for public consumption. So we\u2019re switching things up this year. We\u2019re sending a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist, Damon Winter, to document the Golden Globes red carpet as a news event (you can see some of his coverage of Donald Trump here). We will have a slate of reporters watching and listening for smart, critical quotes from celebrities, not about what they\u2019re wearing, but about the future they envision for their industry \u2014 and the world.\n\nThe Times has also written about the ways that clothing and beauty companies are responding to the #MeToo moment by changing the way they represent women in their industry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHave students look at some of the examples above. Then ask them to do their own research in magazines, on social media or on other online platforms and collect images of women and men. Ask them to consider the following questions:\n\n\u2022 How are women generally portrayed?\n\n\u2022 How are men generally portrayed?\n\n\u2022 How might these portrayals contribute to a culture of sexual harassment and assault?\n\nThen, as The Times did on the red carpet this year, invite students to choose one of the images they found and \u201cremix\u201d it in a way that challenges \u201cthe widely held perception that women\u2019s bodies are available for public consumption.\u201d\n\n4. Record Oral Histories of #MeToo Experiences by Earlier Generations\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Times asked readers to share the conversations they have had with their families about unwanted sexual encounters. The Times received more that 140 responses, mostly from women, and interviewed members from seven of those families.\n\nHave students listen to one or more of these interviews. What do they notice about how different generations think about sexual harassment? Jessica Bennet parses the results in this piece, interviewing Times staffers of different generations and focusing in part on reactions to recent allegations against Aziz Ansari that raise the question, Is it possible for something to be nonconsensual but also not sexual assault?\n\nAfter students have listened to or read some of these pieces, invite them to prepare their own questions and interview someone of a different generation to understand their experiences on or thoughts about the #MeToo movement. They can record the interview on audio or video if they like.\n\nStudents can and should consider the topics about which they are personally curious, but they might use these questions as starting points:\n\n\u2022 Did you learn about sexual harassment when you were my age? If so, what advice did you get? If not, do you wish you had?\n\n\u2022 Have you ever had an experience with an unwanted sexual encounter that you want to share with me? What was that like for you?\n\n\u2022 What advice do you have for me when it comes to sexual harassment and assault?\n\n\u2022 Do you think progress has been made in addressing gender inequality and abuses of power since you were young?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 What do you think about the #MeToo movement? Is it necessary? Has it gone too far?\n\nIf students are comfortable, they can share what they learned from their interviews with the class. Discuss the commonalities and differences across generations. If they find differences, why do they think those generational differences exist? Do they think that progress has been made in the conversation around sexual harassment and assault? What do people in older generations have to teach your students on this issue? What does your students\u2019 generation have to teach older generations?\n\n5. Create an Anti-Harassment Campaign Aimed at Your Peers\n\nPhoto\n\nSince the Harvey Weinstein story broke, people across industries have been looking for ways to fight the problem in their own worlds. Earlier in this lesson we invited students to think about what their schools could do, but this activity goes further by asking them to actually create a campaign that will help educate their peers.\n\nThey might first study some examples of campaigns, such as the Time\u2019s Up anti-sexual harassment action plan:\n\nDriven by outrage and a resolve to correct a power imbalance that seemed intractable just months ago, 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors, producers and entertainment executives have formed an ambitious, sprawling initiative to fight systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood and in blue-collar workplaces nationwide. The initiative includes: \u2014 A legal defense fund, backed by $13 million in donations, to help less privileged women \u2014 like janitors, nurses and workers at farms, factories, restaurants and hotels \u2014 protect themselves from sexual misconduct and the fallout from reporting it. \u2014 Legislation to penalize companies that tolerate persistent harassment, and to discourage the use of nondisclosure agreements to silence victims. \u2014 A drive to reach gender parity at studios and talent agencies that has already begun making headway. \u2014 And a request that women walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes speak out and raise awareness by wearing black.\n\nStudents can view Time\u2019s Up\u2019s open letter and website as mentor texts. What are the plan\u2019s purpose and goals? What steps does it outline for achieving those goals?\n\nAs students begin to brainstorm about what kind of campaign they want to create and what issues they will address, they might borrow ideas from these Times articles:\n\nSexual Harassment Training Doesn\u2019t Work. But Some Things Do.\n\nIt\u2019s Not Just Fox: Why Women Don\u2019t Report Sexual Harassment\n\nHow to Stop the Predators Who Aren\u2019t Famous\n\nMen at Work Wonder if They Overstepped With Women, Too\n\nStepping Up to Stop Sexual Assault\n\n_________\n\nReflect on Your Learning\n\nAs your students finish their final projects, encourage them to return to some key questions we posed at the beginning of this unit:\n\n\u2022 How does sexual harassment affect individuals and society?\n\n\u2022 How do social and cultural norms contribute to sexual harassment?\n\n\u2022 What can individuals do to put an end to sexual misconduct?\n\n\u2022 Why is this such a difficult topic to address in class and in wider society?\n\n\u2022 Do you think discussing and learning about sexual harassment is important? Why or why not?\n\nHave their answers changed? Become more nuanced or informed? How? What advice might they have for future teachers and students of a class like this one?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n__________\n\nRelated Resources\n\nPhoto\n\nAdditional Times Resources\n\nThough our unit focuses on how this movement has played out in the United States, it is also surfacing in countries around the globe, from Indonesia and Afghanistan to Italy, Sweden, China and France.

{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "It\u2019s hard to pinpoint when the red carpet became an economy unto itself \u2014 somewhere back in the late 20th century \u2014 but it has been a carefully cultivated marketing tool for generations now, built on an illusion into which we all buy: the largely fabricated pretense that actresses (and actors) are choosing their own gowns, and that what we see is a pure expression of their personal style.\n\nFact is, what we are seeing is often a look that has been bought, and created, by a global brand, or group of brands, from clothes to shoes, bags, jewels, watches and hairstyles. And the individuals involved have been more than willing to secure their financial future by selling it: swirling in it, name-checking it and otherwise promoting it.\n\nFor any major awards show (and the Globes certainly qualifies) many boldface nominees will have contractual relationships with fashion brands \u2014 negotiated by managers and agents \u2014 that require them to wear a gown or a tuxedo by that brand to that event. They may have input into the final product. They may even, with the help of a stylist (who is also often paid by both actor and brand) have chosen it themselves. But the idea that they chose it from all the gowns on option? The idea they \u2014 gasp! \u2014 shopped for it? Utter hooey. They chose it under very specific guidelines from a very specific selection.\n\nIt began, as most sell-your-soul initiatives do, innocently enough. As the advent of the fashion police and the worst-dressed lists began to shine a light on the occasionally terrible taste of Hollywood (remember the Demi Moore bicycle shorts ball gown?), designers seemed to provide a safe harbor of expert advice. Giorgio Armani was, famously, the first to realize the potential benefits, and became the founding father of the fashion/Hollywood axis. Soon, however, most of his peers followed. It was, largely, a mutually beneficial relationship of like-minded individuals where everyone benefited: A celebrity got a great dress, and a brand got a great-looking famous person in their dress, and we all got to ogle them.\n\nAs movie receipts fell, however, fashion exploded, and money entered the picture. Soon talent (and their managers) realized that income lost in choosing, say, a small indie film to bolster acting cred, could be offset by agreeing to become an \u201cambassador\u201d for a runway brand, a job that could range from a single appearance to ad campaigns, show and party attendance, and sometimes even product collaborations. Sometimes the payments went straight to a charity. Sometimes they went to support artistic choices. And thus the slippery slope was oiled by the best intentions, and down everyone slid.", "title": "The Red Carpet Is Its Own Economy", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Welcome to the season of unauthorized public ice.\n\nWith extreme cold blanketing parts of the East Coast this winter, the slick allure of ice has been too tempting to pass up for some. There have been plenty of opportunities for sliding, slipping and skating \u2014 even in places where it is risky and not allowed \u2014 from Boston to New York to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIn the past week, parks authorities in Washington reminded visitors that where there is ice, there is usually water, after a number of people trying to skate or walk across the surface of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall broke through the ice.\n\nNo one was injured. But with temperatures dipping to the single digits on some days and winds bestowing a chill that makes the air feel below zero even if you\u2019re not wet, anyone who gets dipped into the water, even if just knee-deep, risks hypothermia, the National Mall and Memorial Parks said in a Facebook post over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIce skating can lead to a cold and dangerous swim,\u201d the post added.\n\nThe Reflecting Pool, more than a third of a mile long and over two feet deep in some parts, is a centerpiece of the capital\u2019s National Mall, hosting millions of visitors a year.

CBS is airing the latest spinoff, \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d only on CBS All Access, yet another paid video streaming service, in this case for $5.99 a month, or $9.99 without commercials. And I\u2019m not doing that.\n\nI\u2019ve got Netflix. I\u2019ve got Amazon. I\u2019ve got cable. I\u2019m done.\n\nLet\u2019s not pretend this was a decision made lightly. The only political offices I\u2019ve ever held were as vice president, and then president, of my high school Star Trek Club. These roles came with a lot of self-sacrifice and certainly a monkish devotion, since they effectively ended my dating prospects at the time, though a curly mullet didn\u2019t help either. But it was the path I chose. I have no regrets. Some of us view \u201cThe Wrath of Khan\u201d as a major work of American cinema. Others have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. That\u2019s fine. I just want my bona fides to be clear so you understand the principled stand that I\u2019m taking.\n\nThe point is, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to watch TV anymore.

Comcast lost another 125,000 residential cable subscribers in its most recent quarter, while DirecTV lost 90,000. ESPN\u2019s subscriber base has fallen by about 12 percent since 2010. Now we patch together hardware and software from different companies and make the best of it.\n\nFor consumers, this is not going to get any easier. Disney has two streaming services in development, one for entertainment and another for sports. If Disney\u2019s acquisition of much of Fox goes through, that would further alter the landscape.

Likewise, those deals don\u2019t seem to interest Congress.\n\nWe explained how, from our past journalistic work in Europe, we were deeply familiar with the political operative Paul Manafort\u2019s coziness with Moscow and his financial ties to Russian oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin.\n\nFinally, we debunked the biggest canard being pushed by the president\u2019s men \u2014 the notion that we somehow knew of the June 9, 2016, meeting in Trump Tower between some Russians and the Trump brain trust. We first learned of that meeting from news reports last year \u2014 and the committees know it. They also know that these Russians were unaware of the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele\u2019s work for us and were not sources for his reports.\n\nYes, we hired Mr. Steele, a highly respected Russia expert. But we did so without informing him whom we were working for and gave him no specific marching orders beyond this basic question: Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun?\n\nWhat came back shocked us. Mr. Steele\u2019s sources in Russia (who were not paid) reported on an extensive \u2014 and now confirmed \u2014 effort by the Kremlin to help elect Mr. Trump president. Mr. Steele saw this as a crime in progress and decided he needed to report it to the F.B.I.\n\nWe did not discuss that decision with our clients, or anyone else. Instead, we deferred to Mr. Steele, a trusted friend and intelligence professional with a long history of working with law enforcement. We did not speak to the F.B.I. and haven\u2019t since.\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Steele decided to share his intelligence with Senator John McCain via an emissary. We helped him do that.

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "During O. J. Simpson\u2019s trial for murder, his lawyers needed to throw the blame on someone besides their client. They settled on a vague story about drug dealers somehow tied to a close friend of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. The defense never even tried to explain why these malefactors \u201cwould have wanted to kill Nicole Brown Simpson (much less Ron Goldman),\u201d Jeffrey Toobin wrote in his book about the trial. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the point of the defense strategy.\u201d All the defense had to do was muddy the proverbial waters and gesture at an alternative theory of the crime.\n\nThe behavior of Republicans in Congress who are ostensibly investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election makes sense if you imagine them acting like Simpson\u2019s lawyers. Though pretending to examine a crime against America, they are instead working to cover one up. To do so, they are spinning wild alternative scenarios with just enough surface plausibility to persuade the easily persuadable.\n\nBecause Republicans don\u2019t have to prove their alternative theory, you rarely see it fully elaborated. But it goes something like this: Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign hired Fusion GPS to gather anti-Trump misinformation from Russia. Fusion GPS, working with the retired British spy Christopher Steele, then delivered the Russian smears to the F.B.I., which was determined to thwart Trump. So if anyone was guilty of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election, it was Clinton and her allies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, gave a speech on the Senate floor about all the rabbit holes into which Republicans have tried to divert the Russia investigation. His Republican colleagues, he said, \u201chave been repeating, in chorus with the White House and conservative media, the disproven claim that the Russians somehow commissioned the Steele dossier, or that Steele somehow got suckered by the Russians, or that some deep-state F.B.I. set up the whole thing to pressure Trump.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Republicans\u2019 Fantasy Investigation", "authors": []}

In the heat of the 2016 presidential race, the memo reportedly claims, the F.B.I. tricked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court into issuing a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.\n\nSounds pretty serious! One would assume Mr. Nunes, who has previously appeared very concerned about the improper handling of classified information, would do all he could to protect any potentially sensitive material from public exposure. Yet he is refusing to show the memo to the Justice Department or the F.B.I. \u2014 an \u201cextraordinarily reckless\u201d approach, as Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, a Trump appointee, wrote in a harsh rebuke to Mr. Nunes on Wednesday. \u201cWe do not understand why the committee would possibly seek to disclose classified and law enforcement sensitive information without first consulting with the relevant members of the intelligence community,\u201d Mr. Boyd wrote.\n\nHe added that neither Mr. Nunes nor most of the committee members had even seen the highly classified materials on which the memo appears to be based \u2014 and the release of which could be damaging to national security.\n\nDemocrats have called the memo \u201cprofoundly misleading\u201d and have said its factual allegations are taken out of context. They have prepared their own classified memo addressing the origins of the warrant, which they say was properly sought and approved.\n\nBut even if Mr. Nunes\u2019s memo never sees the light of day, it has done its job \u2014 spawning a new wave of conspiracy theories as well as suspiciously timed calls to #ReleasetheMemo amplified across social media, many coming from what a German Marshall Fund tracking project found to be part of Russian-linked influence networks.", "title": "Opinion | The Republicans\u2019 Real Fake Scandal", "authors": []}

Instead, many liberals eagerly watch award shows in hopes that high-profile performers will stick it to Mr. Trump. Even a speech from Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globes this month led to presidential speculation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this resurgence of political activism that goes back to the 1960s and Vietnam taking on a new type of involvement,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, a longtime former aide to Mrs. Clinton who now helps progressive causes connect with Hollywood. She likened the awards circuit to the Women\u2019s March, saying \u201cit seems like a necessary component in the resistance.\u201d\n\nWhether viewers of the Oscars want to listen to the resistance is another matter. Producers who specialize in awards telecasts have said that post-show research, compiled mainly from Nielsen, indicates that most viewers dislike it when celebrities turn a trip to the stage into a political bully pulpit. One recent producer of the Oscars said that minute-by-minute post-show ratings analysis indicated that \u201cvast swaths\u201d of people turned off their televisions when celebrities started to opine on politics. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential metrics.\n\nThe Grammys drew 19.8 million viewers on Sunday, a 24 percent decline from last year and the lowest ratings since 2009.

How Mr. Trump fits into that discussion has yet to be determined, though some actors have called him out for once bragging about groping women against their will. The producers and writers of the Oscars could feel pressure to tie Mr. Trump and #MeToo, which would energize liberals but risk upsetting viewers who support Mr. Trump and simply want to watch a movie awards show.\n\nThe pull of the Oscars toward smaller, independent movies rather than multiplex blockbusters has already hurt the show, said Marty Kaplan, the Norman Lear professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California.

During election years, networks must try to maintain balance, and the Oscars also come at a time of sensitivity for ABC\u2019s corporate owner; Disney needs the Justice Department\u2019s approval for its deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make a joke about one, you should about the other,\u201d said Bruce Vilanch, a comedy writer who has written material and jokes for the Academy Awards for some 25 years. As often as not, he said, whoever\u2019s being targeted \u201clet it slide, and won\u2019t dignify it with a reply.\u201d\n\nEven with dwindling viewership, Democrats see opportunity in awards season \u2014 and in the Oscars, in particular \u2014 as a way to reach critical constituencies of young, Latino and African-American voters, as candidates look to the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cWhen a famous person can use their celebrity to spread information about why someone should get off the sidelines and vote, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist from the party\u2019s progressive wing.\n\nBut, she added it\u2019s a fine line. \u201cYou never want a celebrity to make a voter feel like they\u2019re wrong or that opinion\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s unexpected skit \u2014 taped near her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Friday \u2014 thrilled many supporters who exalted on Twitter at the former Democratic nominee\u2019s giving a cheeky grin and trolling Mr. Trump.

The faster they run, the more centrifugal force there is tearing the chain apart. The tighter they grip, the more centripetal force there is holding the chain together. Eventually centrifugal force exceeds centripetal force and the chain breaks.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially what is happening in this country, N.Y.U.\u2019s Jonathan Haidt argued in a lecture delivered to the Manhattan Institute in November. He listed some of the reasons centrifugal forces may now exceed centripetal: the loss of the common enemies we had in World War II and the Cold War, an increasingly fragmented media, the radicalization of the Republican Party, and a new form of identity politics, especially on campus.\n\nHaidt made the interesting point that identity politics per se is not the problem. Identity politics is just political mobilization around group characteristics. The problem is that identity politics has dropped its centripetal elements and become entirely centrifugal.\n\nMartin Luther King described segregation and injustice as forces tearing us apart. He appealed to universal principles and our common humanity as ways to heal prejudice and unite the nation.

Nor does it work when Mr. Troughton hands a baby (not a real one) into the audience. The breaking of the fourth wall is a distraction from Titus\u2019s unraveling.\n\nThe happier news is that for much of its three-hour running time, the modern-dress production serves as a reminder of the glory days of high-definition acting that was once the R.S.C.\u2019s norm. For all the excesses of the writing, Mr. Troughton is able to calibrate the degrees by which Titus surrenders to the baseness around him. \u201cThou art a Roman, be not barbarous,\u201d Titus\u2019s brother Marcus (Patrick Drury, excellent) advises near the start, only to watch as barbarity becomes the societal benchmark.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAntony and Cleopatra\u201d is comparable in that it features a leading actor in assured control \u2014 in this case Josette Simon, who takes center stage as the Egyptian queen. Too long absent from the company where she began her career, Ms. Simon brings a lissome sensuality to one of Shakespeare\u2019s greatest female characters \u2014 a part that tends to overshadow its Antony, notwithstanding the clarity that a robust Antony Byrne brings to the grizzled Roman general. (The role will be taken by no less a presence than Ralph Fiennes when the National Theater here tackles this same play later in the year.)\n\nAdopting a playful, devil-may-care persona, Ms. Simon revels in the outsize posturing of a ruler who is also given some of Shakespeare\u2019s most luxuriant language. Elsewhere, one is aware of a falling-off in the supporting roles, as if to suggest that the R.S.C. isn\u2019t finding the strength in numbers in evidence when Mr. Fiennes was cutting his teeth at this company some years back. (Ben Allen\u2019s Octavius Caesar, for one, is too earnest by half.)\n\nThe director, Iqbal Khan, retains period trappings \u2014 which is to say, togas and sandals aplenty \u2014 that here come tethered to a lushly exotic score by the British singer-songwriter Laura Mvula. And in Ms. Simon, a variable production boasts an ennobling presence that Shakespeare goes to some lengths to describe \u2014 \u201cshe did make defect perfection,\u201d we are told \u2014 and that the audience can see right there before them.\n\nPhoto\n\nWomen play second fiddle in \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which also happens to be the least interesting of the triptych. It isn\u2019t quite the revelatory window on the past or the present that we might have hoped for. A prequel of sorts to \u201cAntony and Cleopatra,\u201d with which it shares the central character of Antony, \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d offers a mostly male study in realpolitik that, in Angus Jackson\u2019s becalmed production, leaves us wondering where the star equivalents to Ms. Simon and Mr. Troughton have got to this time.\n\nAndrew Woodall\u2019s Caesar is certainly a crisper, more commanding presence than is usual in a play whose title character gets bumped off fairly early on. But Alex Waldmann\u2019s little-boy-lost Brutus is at physical and temperamental odds with such a grandly conspiratorial role. The same play will resurface here in London in a matter of weeks, at the director Nicholas Hytner\u2019s Bridge Theater.

Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, Republicans talked about changing this. Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.\n\nThat Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence \u2014 if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation \u2014 shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what\u2019s known as a \u201cshell budget\u201d \u2014 essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone\u2019s conception of what a budget should be. But that\u2019s what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.\n\nIn other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus \u2014 or in some cases, a \u201cCRomnibus,\u201d combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It\u2019s kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.\n\nThe reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation\u2019s fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.\n\nThe stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities \u2014 immigration, say, or health care \u2014 to \u201cmust pass\u201d legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.\n\nFrom a purely tactical perspective, pursuing political objectives to the point of a shutdown is rarely an effective strategy. The last government shutdown, in 2013, grew out of Republican opposition to Obamacare, which at the time was an unpopular program. The shutdown started on the same day the health law\u2019s insurance exchanges opened, and crashed \u2014 but during the few weeks the government was closed, Obamacare actually grew more popular. I am highly sympathetic to the plight of the Dreamers who have become central to the current fight, but I would not be surprised if this shutdown goes for Democrats the way the last one did for Republicans.", "title": "Opinion | The Shutdown Shows the Twisted Rules of a Broken Congress", "authors": []}

What else explains Mr. Trump\u2019s talk about North Korea and nuclear weapons? Purging federal employees, while it may satisfy the president\u2019s need to punish his enemies, would mean, given his hiring record, that there would be fewer people in place to uphold our laws and carry out policies that help millions of Americans. The historic lows in African-American and Latino unemployment that he mentioned last night are partly a direct result of the productivity of hundreds of thousands of workers he wishes to deport.\n\nPresident Trump made tokens of his minority guests, which underscored the point that he doesn\u2019t quite consider nonwhite people to be on a par with white Americans. Corey Adams, a black welder, was brought out as cover for the tax cut his employers at Staub Manufacturing Solutions in Dayton, Ohio, received under the Republicans\u2019 tax plan.

And it includes a disavowal of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nBut you\u2019d also want to note that Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t been able to halt many of the most important trends around the country toward lower emissions. Plenty of states, like California and New York, are still pressing ahead with their own local climate policies. The coal industry, responsible for a quarter of the nation\u2019s emissions, continues to shrink, edged out of the energy market by less expensive natural gas despite Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to save it.\n\nOn top of that, the cost of wind and solar continues to drop rapidly as technology advances. Even after Mr. Trump\u2019s recent tariffs on solar imports, more utilities are turning to renewable energy as the lowest-cost source of new power. Electric vehicles are making inroads.

But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump will embrace the most traditional of presidential venues \u2014 appearing before a joint session of Congress for his first State of the Union address \u2014 to deliver what aides describe as an optimistic speech that will seek to reach beyond the people who voted for him in 2016. If he sticks to the script, the president is expected to call on Congress to spend at least $1 trillion to rebuild bridges, freeways, sewers and airports. And he will use the speech to lobby millions of viewers on behalf of his plan to make a series of conservative changes to the nation\u2019s immigration system while also granting citizenship to as many as 1.8 million young immigrants. But if his first year has proved anything, it is that there are no guarantees when Mr. Trump faces a television camera. Cabinet meetings have veered into presidential rants. Memorial speeches have turned into self-congratulatory moments. Short photo ops have become long news conferences. \u201cTeleprompter Trump sounds like a regular president,\u201d said Michael Waldman, who was director of speechwriting for President Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1999 and wrote four State of the Union speeches. \u201cOff-the-Teleprompter Trump sounds like a fill-in radio talk show host.\u201d When Mr. Trump delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress last February \u2014 not technically a State of the Union speech \u2014 he offered a mostly optimistic vision of America, speaking soberly and almost verbatim from a prepared text. But former speechwriters said traditional State of the Union speeches were a poor fit for Mr. Trump because they tended to be long lists of policy proposals, cobbled together over months in a process that involves agency employees across the federal government. During his first year, the president showed only a sporadic interest in the nuts and bolts of policymaking. Jonathan Horn, who was a speechwriter for President George W. Bush, said Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter habit could undermine the political benefits of the speech. Hovering over the address is an accelerating Russia investigation and a congressional stalemate over spending. \u201cThe next day there could be a tweet, and then the work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by 280 characters,\u201d said Mr. Horn, who was part of a team that drafted Mr. Bush\u2019s 2008 State of the Union address.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then post a comment.\n\nPredictions before the State of the Union address:\n\n\u2014 What predictions can you make about this address?

Unlike them, he already has a pedigree: he has shown his work alongside Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell while they were still alive and in their prime. In 1958, a large Bertschmann canvas was featured in the Carnegie International exhibition in Pittsburgh, a rarefied achievement for any artist, let alone one in his mid-20s. Since then, Mr. Bertschmann has painted or drawn nearly every day of his adult life, producing a body of work that has been praised by some of the art world\u2019s foremost tastemakers. Yet he has remained virtually unknown.\n\n\u201cI had to make money,\u201d Mr. Bertschmann, 86, said one morning in late November as he sat at the dining table of his light-filled, art-filled apartment-studio near the South Street Seaport. And he did, working as a freelance graphic designer creating logos, packaging and advertising for brands like Pond\u2019s cold cream and Bufferin. His success at his day job ensured that he wasn\u2019t hungry, and while he has produced thousands (he has no idea how many thousands) of fine-art paintings, drawings and collages in wildly varied styles, he never persistently sought gallery representation.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s never been a salesman,\u201d said Mary Bertschmann, his wife of more than 50 years. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get his art out there for them to see.\u201d Nor did he carouse with his more exhibitionistic contemporaries at Cedar Tavern, participate in splashy happenings or attract art-world gossip. \u201cAlso, we had started our own small press, and Harry was doing great designs for Harper & Row, like this wonderful thing,\u201d she said, pointing to a fetchingly illustrated poetry anthology published in the 1970s. \u201c We were so into our world, plus, of course, with a child.\u201d\n\nOver the years there were some exhibitions and acquisitions, notably a 140-work retrospective in 1997 of both his commercial and fine art in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Bertschmann was born and raised.

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "The governor\u2019s proposal has opened yet another front in his continuing war with Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat whose aides maintain that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s value capture plan would commandeer the process of setting property taxes, a paramount responsibility of the city. They said state officials never discussed the proposal with the city. \u201cThis is not the way to address the problems of the M.T.A.,\u201d the first deputy mayor, Dean Fuleihan, said.\n\nMichael Slattery, the senior vice president of research for the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents New York\u2019s developers, said the proposal \u201craises serious questions that need to be evaluated, especially when it deals with a property tax system that we know already has serious problems.\u201d\n\nThere is little dispute that access to public transit often results in higher real estate prices. Neighborhoods like trendy Williamsburg in Brooklyn would not have had a resurgence without the access provided by the L line, whose ridership grew at three times the rate of the system as a whole from 1998 to 2012 and which has benefited from an upgraded signal system that allows more trains to run.\n\nThe Cuomo proposal calls for before and after assessments in neighborhoods where a new transportation project, like the extension of a subway line, raises property values. Officials would determine the difference between the previous assessment and the new, higher one.\n\nVideo\n\nOf the tax on that difference, 75 percent would go to the transit agency and 25 percent to the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to pay in its entirety for the capital requirements for any one project,\u201d said Patrick J. Foye, the president of the transit authority, \u201cbut it could over years or decades provide significant new funding.\u201d\n\nWhether value capture could work, given the antagonism between City Hall and Albany, is an open question. Carl Weisbrod, who was named to the transit agency\u2019s board by Mr. de Blasio and was the chairman of the city\u2019s Planning Commission from 2014 until early last year, said value capture demanded \u201cclose cooperation between the M.T.A. and the city on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTo simply impose it on the city isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d he said.\n\nState officials said an existing four-person review panel would have the power to veto proposals the city opposed \u2014 and one member is appointed to represent the city. Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the transit agency, said that the panel \u201cworks under what I call U.N. Security Council rules,\u201d meaning that if one of the members is against a project, \u201cthe entire proposal goes down.\u201d\n\nSome public transportation advocates have been calling for special property taxes for years, and the M.T.A. raised the idea in December after a column by Jim Dwyer in The New York Times discussed the subway\u2019s impact on real estate values.\n\nAs proposed, the governor\u2019s value-capture plan would apply only to transit projects costing more than $100 million. It could not be used to pay for already completed projects, like the $4.4 billion segment of the Second Avenue subway. But it could raise money for future segments planned to extend that line north to 125th Street.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe proposal also listed other major projects that value capture could be applied to, including East Side Access, which will connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, as well as the existing Metro-North and subway stations along 125th Street in Manhattan.\n\nCity officials maintain that including railroad projects is unfair because they largely benefit suburban commuters who would not be charged under the governor\u2019s tax plan. Mr. Fuleihan, the first deputy mayor, said 70 percent of the revenue for the transit agency comes from the city through taxes and fares, but suburban commuters who use the subway once they arrive in the city pay nothing but the fare.\n\nThe governor\u2019s proposal would allow the transit agency to establish districts around new projects for value capture that could extend as far as a mile from a station. But city officials scoffed, arguing that living a mile from a stop is too far to consider it a convenience.\n\nWhat improved public transit can mean for a neighborhood is easy to see on the Upper East Side, which became a transit wasteland after elevated trains on Second and Third Avenues were demolished more than 60 years ago. Until the Second Avenue subway opened, residents on the eastern edge of the neighborhood had to trudge blocks to squeeze onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 trains on Lexington Avenue, the nation\u2019s most crowded subway line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all good, plus people love the way the stations look,\u201d said Lydia H. Sussek, a senior global real estate adviser with the Corcoran Group. \u201cI\u2019ve sold new condos as a result of it, and I had a couple who moved to East End Avenue knowing they\u2019d have transportation, whereas before people never would have looked east.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChristian Moulin, a co-op owner who has lived on East 85th Street between York Avenue and East End Avenue for 17 years, said the Upper East Side used to be \u201cthe less expensive place \u2014 rents were reasonable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s changing,\u201d he added, \u201cand it\u2019s all because of the subway.\u201d\n\nHe said one indication was that fliers from brokers seeking apartments now appear in his and his neighbors\u2019 mailboxes every couple of weeks. \u201cWe never had that before,\u201d he said.\n\nBeth Fisher, a senior managing director for the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales for three new apartment buildings north of East 86th Street, said the distance to the subway had long been \u201ca metric for how people live\u201d but that value capture put too much of an emphasis on the subway\u2019s influence.\n\n\u201cThe Second Avenue subway, sure, is the protagonist, the key driver of value,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is not the only driver. It ought not be singled out in that manner.\u201d\n\nValue capture is a familiar concept outside New York and has been used as a way to fund transit projects in other cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, London and Hong Kong. In New York, Mr. Wright, of the Regional Plan Association, called the Second Avenue subway \u201ca lost opportunity\u201d in terms of value capture.\n\nThe extension of the No. 7 line to the Far West Side of Manhattan was financed by what amounted to value capture on Hudson Yards, the megaproject near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Under Mr. de Blasio\u2019s predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the city took the unusual step of offering to pay the $1.8 billion cost of the extension based on anticipated tax revenues.\n\nBut Mr. Wright cautioned that value capture in already developed neighborhoods would be more modest.\n\n\u201cIn developed areas \u2014 say, the Upper East Side where you\u2019re not looking at new virgin development on a rail yard, what you\u2019re talking about is increased values of buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cThe New York property tax system is such that that\u2019s not going to generate short-term and immediate returns.\u201d", "title": "The Subway Is Next Door.

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "Those figures suggested to American planners that pacification could target more than a quarter of the population and over half of the country\u2019s land area. Pacification on such a scale, however, was infeasible for the Saigon government to undertake, so only so-called priority villages \u2014 those near military bases, air fields, transportation arteries, and towns and cities \u2014 were subjected to pacification. Those under the control of Viet Cong were designated as \u201cfree fire zones\u201d and bombed and shelled, under the assumption that anyone who lived there was Viet Cong by definition.\n\nThe bombing and shelling drove people to flee into areas under government control in greater numbers. Statistics published in January 1975 by the Subcommittee to Investigate Problems Connected With Refugees and Escapees, part of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, indicated that the number of refugees registered by the government in 1965 was 772,000. This number grew to 906,000 in 1966. By 1967, the government had registered 2.1 million refugees. In addition to those the government registered \u2014 those placed in squalid camps of dilapidated huts \u2014 there were an estimated two million who were not registered, including about one million in Saigon.\n\nIn mid-1967, Samuel Huntington of Harvard, working as a consultant to the State Department, visited Vietnam. On his return, he wrote an article in Foreign Affairs, \u201cThe Bases of Accommodation,\u201d in which he stated that \u201cthe most dramatic and far-reaching impact of the war in South Vietnam has been the tremendous shift in population from the countryside to the cities.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cIn an absent-minded way the United States in Vietnam may well have stumbled upon the answer\u201d to the insurgency. The answer lies in \u201cforced-draft urbanization and modernization,\u201d which would drive the rural population from the villages into urban areas and deprive the insurgency the support it needed \u201cto generate enough strength to come to power.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

The article shocked many people and turned Mr. Huntington into a controversial figure among those opposed to the war. Nevertheless, his piece significantly influenced the latter phases of pacification.\n\nAt first, pacification was left in the hands of the South Vietnamese armed forces. The policy changed in 1966 when the slow progress of pacification prompted an effort to speed it up, and the American Ninth Division was dispatched to Dinh Tuong, a province in the upper Mekong.\n\nThe division\u2019s mission was to act like a bulldozer, clearing the path for South Vietnamese officials and troops to move in and establish a government presence, and to keep the enemy\u2019s main force units from disrupting that effort. The ferocious operations by the Ninth Division and its enormous firepower inflicted heavy civilian casualties, culminating in operation Speedy Express in 1969, during which American forces counted 10,000 \u201cViet Cong\u201d killed but captured only 900 weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1968, the insurgents carried the war to the towns and cities up and down the length and breadth of the country in the Tet offensive. American and South Vietnamese armed forces launched a furious counteroffensive, which inflicted additional destruction and casualties. Another million people were estimated to be displaced during the Tet offensive and another offensive in May 1968. The losses incurred by the Viet Cong during those counterattacks opened the way for the American and South Vietnamese governments to push an accelerated pacification program. The few restraints that had been in place to prevent indiscriminate killing of civilians were lifted, and the extensive use of firepower in populated areas was applied with deadly results to \u201cdrain the pond to catch the fish.\u201d\n\nOver the next year, large areas of the countryside became depopulated. Besides registered and unregistered refugees who fled from their villages, the displaced included peasants who simply moved to another hamlet or area in a hamlet, or who moved to an open field, away from the clumps of trees and vegetation targeted by bombing and shelling. As an added precaution, they began to wear white clothing instead of the usual peasant \u201cblack pajamas\u201d that Americans had come to associate with the Viet Cong, to avoid getting killed. In addition, there were also temporary refugees who moved in or out of a village for a few weeks at a time, or who would come back to their land occasionally to salvage what they could from their orchards.\n\nAs part of accelerated pacification, the C.I.A. created the Phoenix Program to root out the Viet Cong infrastructure. Critics of Phoenix have called it an assassination program, aimed at Viet Cong cadres as well as innocent civilians. Besides killing guilty and innocent alike, Phoenix also provided local officials and policemen a sanctioned program to abuse power with false arrests, settling of scores and extortion. Phoenix did seriously damage the Viet Cong infrastructure, but the cost was high for the government as well, since the program sowed fear, resentment and distrust among the population.\n\nPacification worked, in a narrow sense: By 1970, the Saigon government had control over a larger area of the country than it did five years before. However, the South Vietnamese Army, reluctant to take on Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces, relied even more on bombing and shelling to retain and enlarge the gains made during the high tide of American military intervention. It also resorted to forced relocation of peasants remaining in the heavily contested and Viet Cong areas, destroying or burning the houses of those who refused to move closer to the military posts that had been erected so that they could be kept under close surveillance.\n\nIn the Central Highlands, Gen. Ngo Dzu, the regional commander, began an extensive program of forced relocation of the Montagnard ethnic minorities; given a few days\u2019 notice, thousands of villagers had to abandon their homes and belongings and move to dismal resettlement centers, where they lacked housing, water and health care. Hundreds died after being forced to relocate.\n\nThe cease-fire of 1973 did not bring peace to the battered rural area and its people. Before and after it went into effect, the government and the Communists each engaged in land-grabbing. The January 1975 report by the Senate subcommittee on refugees, issued a few months before the Communists defeated the South Vietnamese government and won the war, estimated that the total number of refugees had grown to 11.6 million.\n\nWhen the war ended, South Vietnam and its rural population had been profoundly transformed. Before fighting escalated, 80 percent of the people lived in the rural areas. By 1975, South Vietnam had gone through a \u201cforced-draft urbanization.\u201d The influx of refugees from the countryside into the urban areas had swelled their population, so that 65 percent of South Vietnamese were now living in towns and cities.\n\nThe war had taken from the peasants who had been driven into urban areas to find safety what they cherished most: the land that their forebears had walked and tilled, and the homes that had sheltered them for generations. It had also shattered the families that had sustained them from birth. These were the things that had made their life whole before they became victims of the Americans\u2019 \u201cforced-draft urbanization\u201d of their society, accomplished with bombing and shelling rather than with the industrialization that had \u201curbanized and modernized\u201d the United States and other Western countries.", "title": "The Terrible Violence of \u2018Pacification\u2019", "authors": ["Mai Elliott"]}

Beauty, too, is about fantasy, and an escape from the practicalities of everyday life. The spring/summer 2018 couture season proved to be a good one for makeup artists, as the trend of natural fresh faces was less prevalent than it has been during recent ready-to-wear seasons. Instead, many shows featured beautiful color on the face, especially in terms of blush. At Chanel, models\u2019 cheeks were rosy pink, and at Armani, a pastel pink blush was applied on the apples of the cheeks and extended up to the temple. The look became more extreme at RDVK; it could only be described as \u201980s, Kabuki-style rouge. \u2014 M.J.G.\n\nImage Hedi Slimane Credit Getty Images\n\n10.

Since he left Saint Laurent in 2016, rumors have circulated about where he would end up. Many speculated that he would return to LVMH, but Celine was a total surprise.

There Was a Tender Moment at Balmain\n\nBalmain shows are typically over-the-top productions to complement Olivier Rousteing\u2019s equally over-the-top designs. And this season was no different, but amid the bright lights, thumping music and beaded and chain mail clothing, there was a softer, more unexpected moment that occurred in the front row.\n\nWhile Cindy Crawford patiently sat in the front row, waiting for the show to begin, she shared with those around her (including the actor Orlando Bloom) that she was there to cheer on her son Presley Gerber, who was cast in the show. Crawford excitedly videotaped her son as soon as he appeared on the runway \u2014 and kept the shot rolling as he crossed the entire length of the catwalk. The moment, which can be seen in a video posted on the Instagram account of Anders Christian Madsen, the fashion critic of British Vogue, was a sweet reminder that no matter how rich and famous you may be, a proud mom will always embarrass you.\n\nImage The designer Martine Rose and her baby.

Martine Rose Hosted a Very Personal Dinner\n\nEvery season it\u2019s a tossup as to how the designer Martine Rose will showcase her latest collection. For the past two seasons, she has held fully-fledged runway shows on the outskirts of London, but in seasons past she has staged quieter presentations \u2014 in spring 2015, for example, she showed just one look. And sometimes she doesn\u2019t show at all, which was the case this season. Instead, Rose went to Paris for a buying appointment and quietly released her fall/winter 2018 look book, which featured oversized teddy coats, colorful jean jackets and silk shirts and snakeskin trousers.\n\nBut it was a dinner that Rose hosted to celebrate her continued collaboration with Slam Jam (a streetwear distributor) and Napapijri (an activewear brand) that kept her squarely in the center of men\u2019s fashion month. The dinner was held at L\u2019Epi D\u2019or, a small classic Parisian bistro that she closed down for the evening. Rose said she wanted the event to be an insight into her life, a peek inside an authentic \u201cMartine Rose\u201d atmosphere. She filled her guest list with friends and family (her parents and baby son were there), and just a few members of the press \u2014 and distributed Polaroid cameras for people to use.

{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "But in the administration and across the business community, there is a perception that years of increased environmental, financial and other regulatory oversight by the Obama administration dampened investment and job creation \u2014 and that Mr. Trump\u2019s more hands-off approach has unleashed the \u201canimal spirits\u201d of companies that had hoarded cash after the recession of 2008.\n\nSome businesses will essentially be able to get away with shortcuts that they could not have under a continuation of Obama-era policies. The coal industry, for instance, will not have to worry about a regulation, overturned by Congress and Mr. Trump, that would have protected streams from mining runoff.\n\nBrett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the Trump administration might avoid big-splash regulatory rollbacks this year and instead would make it harder for federal agencies to block business expansion.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be sexy things like \u2018We\u2019re killing the Clean Power Plan,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hartl said, referring to the Obama-era rule aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. \u201cBut you can make it systematically harder for an agency to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nOnly a handful of the federal government\u2019s reams of rules have actually been killed or slated for elimination since Mr. Trump took office. But the president has declared that rolling back regulations will be a defining theme of his presidency. On his 11th day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order \u201con reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs,\u201d including the stipulation that any new regulation must be offset by two regulations rolled back.\n\nThat intention and its rhetorical and regulatory follow-ons have executives at large and small companies celebrating. And with tax cuts coming and a generally improving economic outlook, both domestically and internationally, economists are revising growth forecasts upward for last year and this year.\n\nEven before it became clear that Republicans would pass a major tax cut, capital spending had risen significantly, climbing at an annualized rate of 6.2 percent during the first three quarters of last year. Surveys of planned spending also show increases.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump bragged in a news conference last month that he has rolled back 22 regulations for every new one \u2014 67 deregulatory actions, versus three new regulations. Often in conjunction with the Republican Congress, his administration has canceled several rules approved at the end of the President Barack Obama\u2019s term, including a regulation on limiting mining debris in streams, a requirement that broadband providers obtain permission from customers to collect and use online information, and a ban on plastic bottles in national parks.\n\nAdministration officials said last month that, since January 2017, federal agencies have delayed, withdrawn or made inactive nearly 1,600 planned regulatory actions. Further rollbacks will affect financial services as well as energy and labor rules, among others.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has appointed outspoken critics of regulation to lead several federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nThe evidence is weak that regulation actually reduces economic activity or that deregulation stimulates it. But business executives are largely convinced that the cost of complying with rules diverts money that could be invested elsewhere. And economists see a plausible connection between Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to prune the federal rule book and the willingness of businesses to crank open their vaults. Measures of business confidence have climbed to record heights during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year.\n\n\u201cThe notion that deregulation unleashes growth is virtually impossible to find in the data,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cWhat does matter is this idea that confidence matters. If their expectations about the future are positive, then it does make a difference.\u201d\n\nBusinesses acknowledge that the most important reason for their increased optimism is the simple fact that the domestic economy continues to expand, with few clouds on the horizon.\n\nBetter yet, the world\u2019s major economies all are growing for the first time since the financial crisis. Confidence among European manufacturers hit a high in more than a decade, according to European Commission data that goes back to 1985, even without tax cuts or less regulation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019re all moving in sync and that has everyone feeling good, not just here but across the globe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe low unemployment in the United States may also be prompting increased spending, just as it did in the 1990s, as corporations invest in technology to make workers more productive, or replace them entirely. Wendy\u2019s is adding self-service kiosks at 1,000 restaurants.\n\nBut business executives say the Trump administration deserves credit. Mr. MacDonald said home builders have benefited from the killing of regulations written by the Obama administration, including a rule that broadened the definition of wetlands, which could have restricted home building in certain areas. The National Labor Relations Board also reversed a decision that made builders more responsible for the working conditions of their contractors\u2019 employees.\n\nIn some industries, the administration\u2019s actions will allow companies to engage in activities they might not have been able to otherwise; electric utilities, for example, might be able to invest in upgrading power plants that run on fossil fuels, thanks to a promised rollback of Mr. Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan to fight climate change.\n\nThe Business Roundtable, a corporate lobbying group in Washington, reported last month that \u201cregulatory costs\u201d were no longer the top concern of American executives, for the first time in six years. Mr. Zandi said that regulation was still the top concern in Moody\u2019s survey of business confidence, but that it was rapidly losing ground to concerns about the availability of labor.\n\nThe National Association of Manufacturers\u2019 fourth-quarter member survey found that fewer than half of manufacturers cited an \u201cunfavorable business climate\u201d \u2014 including regulations and taxes \u2014 as a challenge to their business, down from nearly three-quarters a year ago.\n\nSome industries have seen particularly clear changes in fortune. The Trump administration has reversed a number of environmental protections that would have imposed significant costs on energy companies. Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the Federal Communications Commission voted last month to repeal so-called net neutrality rules, which treated internet services as a regulated industry, like power lines, and prohibited broadband providers from charging for faster internet service or from blocking or slowing some websites.\n\nThat decision helped prompt Comcast to announce that it would invest more than $50 billion in infrastructure over the next five years.\n\nThe banking industry, in particular, has been buoyed by a relaxed approach to financial regulation as the Trump administration moves to ease many of the postcrisis rules put in place to prevent another financial meltdown. The Treasury Department has issued a series of reports calling for sweeping changes to rules required under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, and a council set up to designate firms that pose risks to the financial system is in the process of removing those companies from heightened federal oversight.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump has also installed individuals who have publicly questioned the need for many of the postcrisis rules in major policy roles, including at the Federal Reserve and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank stocks have been on a winning streak and ended 2017 up more than 15 percent, according to the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.\n\n\u201cThere has been some regulatory fixes for a lot of industries, and they would tell you that matters a lot,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase, who also leads the Business Roundtable. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to do a direct correlation. It doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t real.\u201d\n\nThe confidence is translating to industries that have not, as of yet, seen any obvious benefit or policy changes.\n\n\u201cWe have spent the past dozen years or longer operating in environments that have had an increasing regulatory burden,\u201d said Michael S. Burke, the chairman and chief executive of Aecom, a Los Angeles-based multinational consulting firm that specializes in infrastructure projects. \u201cThat burden has slowed down economic growth, it\u2019s slowed down investment in infrastructure. And what we\u2019ve seen over the last year is a big deregulatory environment.\u201d\n\nMr. Burke said he expected the actions to speed future projects for his company, though he declined to offer details, citing competitive risks.\n\nThe White House sees its efforts as having their intended effect. Mr. Trump boasted about his deregulatory efforts last month at an event where he stood in front of a small mountain of printouts representing the nation\u2019s regulatory burden and ceremonially cut a large piece of \u201cred tape.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said in an interview that the administration\u2019s freeze on new regulations, in particular, appeared to have buoyed confidence. Though he cautioned that it could take years of research to pin down the magnitude of the effects, he said deregulation was \u201cthe most plausible story\u201d to explain why economic growth in 2017 had outstripped most forecasts.\n\n\u201cOur view is, the \u2018no new regulations\u2019 piece has to be more powerful than we thought,\u201d he said.", "title": "The Trump Effect: Business, Anticipating Less Regulation, Loosens Purse Strings", "authors": ["Binyamin Appelbaum", "Jim Tankersley"]}

About two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are either seniors, disabled people or children. Of the remaining one-third, nearly 80 percent are in families with at least one working person and 60 percent have full- or part-time jobs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. This policy change is merely a bureaucratic obstacle to keep poor people from obtaining Medicaid. Eligibility for the program varies from state to state, but the national median income limit for a single person to qualify for Medicaid is $16,642 a year.\n\nRepublican lawmakers who have demonized the program as welfare for \u201cable-bodied adults\u201d have long sought to require Medicaid beneficiaries to work. Those lawmakers have been particularly angry about the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which they have been trying to repeal since it was passed in 2010.\n\nTaking Medicaid away from people who are out of work would damage some of the most vulnerable people in the country. Among them are residents of rural areas who are struggling with opioid addictions and, as a result, cannot hold down permanent jobs. It will also hurt people who, through no fault of their own, lose their jobs and are not able to quickly find another one because they live in a depressed area or because economic changes have made their skills less valuable. Then there are people with chronic conditions like diabetes who do not qualify for disability, but are often unable to work.\n\n\u201cEven though sometimes I can get a job, you\u2019ve got to understand \u2014 sometimes I can\u2019t even walk,\u201d Jimmy Brunson, a diabetic in Arkansas, told The Times last year.\n\nIt is not clear that the Trump administration can legally allow states to impose a work requirement. Experts say federal law allows the government to grant waivers only if they help to advance the aims of Medicaid, which is to provide medical care to low-income people. It strains credulity for the administration to argue that denying health insurance to people on the basis of their employment status meets that test.

He soon befriended Vann, a distinguished veteran of the Korean War serving as an adviser to the South Vietnamese Army.\n\nAlthough he was a gung-ho warrior type and always believed the Vietnam War was winnable, Vann came to realize the attrition strategy was a failure, the constant bombing of the countryside was helping Vietcong recruitment, and the rampant corruption in the Saigon leadership, funded through American dollars, was devastating to the cause. He fought back through the news media, leaking information sometimes through Mr. Sheehan, who eventually was hired by The New York Times, some of which directly contradicted what was coming out Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo Mr. Sheehan and other reporters in Vietnam, Vann\u2019s version of what was going on rang truer than the sunny propaganda emanating from the White House. In April 1963, Vann left Vietnam, and it seemed to all the world that the Pentagon was punishing him for speaking out when he resigned from the Army that July. As the years went on, Mr. Sheehan increasingly regarded Vann as the personification of America\u2019s long, painful war effort. But it took his death for the book idea to coalesce.\n\n\u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d opens with an incredible scene, Vann\u2019s funeral, full of Washington power: Senator Edward Kennedy and the Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg were in the pews; pallbearers included the former commander of United States forces in Vietnam, William Westmoreland, and a future head of the C.I.A., William Colby. Seated up front were Vann\u2019s widow, Mary Jane, and his four sons. (Their lone daughter had just given birth.) Mr. Sheehan found himself standing in the back of the chapel. The bird\u2019s-eye view of the high-profile crowd gave him his opening line: \u201cIt was a funeral to which they all came.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was watching all these important people coming in one after another, like a class reunion,\u201d Mr. Sheehan told me. \u201cI talked to Susan that night and she said it sounds like this is a book.\u201d\n\n(\u201cHad I known how long the book was going to take, I would\u2019ve committed hara-kiri,\u201d Susan Sheehan said with a laugh. \u201cI ended up writing a piece for The New York Times Magazine, \u2018When Will the Book Be Done?\u2019\u201d )\n\nMr. Sheehan himself makes a smart tactical decision by letting readers get to know Vann as a soldier first. He\u2019s a compelling figure: tough, brash, energetic, hardheaded, and with enough charisma for a dozen Audie Murphy movies. His idealism and bravery shone through after he returned to Vietnam in 1965 as a civilian pacification officer for the Agency for International Development. In 1971, Vann was made a senior adviser for the Central Highlands in charge of all military personnel, effectively a major general in the Army.\n\nThe following spring, the North Vietnamese Army launched the Easter offensive, surrounding and attacking the provincial capital Kontum with three enemy divisions. Vann was instrumental in leading the ARVN\u2019s defense of Kontum, which prevented South Vietnam from being bisected, but as protests mounted back home, the feat barely made a ripple. The day after Kontum was secured, Vann perished in the mountains. A week later, at his Washington memorial service, Vann\u2019s family felt that he wasn\u2019t getting the respect he deserved.\n\n\u201cWe all felt a pride in dad for standing up for his beliefs, because he was having a wonderful military career that was cut short,\u201d says his eldest son, John Allen Vann, now 69.\n\nJohn Allen led the family in refusing to stand at the end of the service for several dignitaries, including Secretary of State William Rogers. However, there were limits to the Vann family rebellion. Following the burial in Arlington National Cemetery, other members of the family talked middle son Jess out of handing President Richard Nixon half of his draft card, which he\u2019d torn up in advance of an Oval Office photo op.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt Dad\u2019s funeral, I had long hair, but I was never a radical. I didn\u2019t march and always respected the military, but I think my father\u2019s career has an empty all-for-nothing feeling to it, like the Vietnam War itself,\u201d said Jess Vann, 67.\n\nIt was, indeed, a \u201cfuneral to which they all came,\u201d (credit Susan Sheehan for astutely changing \u201ceveryone\u201d to \u201cthey all\u201d), because of Vann\u2019s stature as a military strategist and a civilian warrior. What nobody knew at the time, Mr. Sheehan included, was how much more there was to the story. John Paul Vann had secrets, including the reason he left the military.\n\nVann was never going to be made a general not because of his rebellions against the Pentagon, but because in 1959 he\u2019d been charged with the statutory rape of a 15-year-old babysitter for the Vann children. As Mr. Sheehan notes, Vann \u201cturned himself into an amateur specialist on the polygraph,\u201d passed a lie-detector test, and beat the rap, but he went to Vietnam knowing his career was already lost.\n\nThe depths of Vann\u2019s sexual compulsions are thoroughly examined in \u201cA Bright Shining Lie,\u201d and they were overwhelming. Even in a world of macho libertine behavior, Vann stood out, bedding women everywhere he lived, traveled and worked, often multiple times a day. He had two longstanding mistresses in Vietnam; one he forced to get an abortion, the other had a child. Women were to be conquered. He certainly never took the feelings of his wife, Mary Jane, into consideration.\n\nAlthough they eventually separated, Mary Jane stood by her man for years, even though he didn\u2019t care if she suffered. After the statutory rape charges were dropped, she asked if he\u2019d learned his lesson. He replied that next time he\u2019d make \u201cgoddamn sure they\u2019re old enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the oldest, I knew a lot of what went on. Neil dug up a lot more and unfortunately, it\u2019s all true,\u201d John Allen Vann said. \u201cIn retrospect, Neil was actually kind to my father and didn\u2019t plumb the depths of what was there. When my father wasn\u2019t serving overseas, ours was a household of violent abuse.\u201d\n\nRemarkably, even with the rampant womanizing and misogyny, Mr. Sheehan is able to create empathy for John Paul Vann through his diligent reporting. He went to Vann\u2019s home of Norfolk, Va., and found out the boy was born out of wedlock to a prostitute whose clients were upper-class men who preferred not to visit the brothel. It wasn\u2019t out of desperation either \u2014 she was a hard-drinking partyer who kept all her earnings for herself. John Paul, his stepbrother and two stepsisters were raised by Frank Vann, a decent, passive man who was intermittently employed and took the brunt of her cruelty.\n\nThings would get worse for John Paul when he came under the wing of a young Methodist pastor, Garland Hopkins. At 14, Vann unburdened himself to Hopkins, who persuaded him to join his Boy Scout troop. Hopkins was a pedophile, and Mr. Sheehan writes there is no doubt he molested Vann. Years later, a few weeks before returning to Vietnam, Vann was staying with Hopkins. By now, the pastor had been left by his wife and child, dismissed by his church, and was facing prosecution for his continued pedophilia. Hopkins drank rat poison with strychnine, knowing Vann would find his body.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cA Bright Shining Lie,\u201d the pain John Paul suffered in childhood somewhat mitigates the pain he caused as an adult, but the relationship with Hopkins was more even more depraved. Dad allowed him to be around his sons unsupervised.\n\n\u201cHopkins is the genesis of our family\u2019s issues because he was an evil person who molested me and one of my brothers,\u201d John Allen says. \u201cWhen I tried to tell dad about it, he beat me. You can imagine what that does to a young boy. Hopkins caused both of us shame and dad took it out on me.\u201d\n\nA half-century later, the hurt Vann caused the family lingers. John Allen Vann, who went on to have a successful investment banking career, spent many years in therapy to break the cycle of violence. Yet the combination of the abuse at home and the absenteeism of a military father caused rifts. John Allen avoids contact with his sister and one of his brothers. Jess Vann talks to everyone now and again, and believes the family isn\u2019t close because of lack of proximity and the demands of modern existence, but he\u2019s also spent most of his life alone in the mountains, working as an ecologist in Colorado.\n\nThe Vann family realities are murky. What is clear is that both sons separate their father from the soldier.\n\n\u201cJohn Paul Vann had a horrific upbringing, but during wartime, he had focused energy and was a great strategist and tactician, which is rare in an officer. Usually the military teaches its officers strategy and its noncoms tactics,\u201d John Allen says. \u201cBack home, for my father, was close to being captured. He became a starved shark whose only goal was to trash and conquer blindly.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d forced the Vanns to publicly reckon with their father\u2019s failings, but at least for John Allen and Jess, there is no ill will for the author. Their mother, Mary Jane, 90, has never read it, but they both love the book and have warm memories of getting to know the Sheehans.\n\nMr. Sheehan took a leave from The Times to write his book, but he never returned. By 1988, the family was $295,000 in debt to his publisher, Random House, and The New Yorker, for which he wrote regularly and which had lent him money (as magazines did back in those days), keeping afloat through fellowships, teaching gigs and Susan Sheehan\u2019s freelance work. The longer the book took, the worse his anxiety, insomnia and stress became, but the passage of time gave his 861-page masterpiece the breathing room to become a hit.\n\nWhen it finally came out, the political climate in America surrounding the war had changed immensely. The reconciliation and reflection that started with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982, and helped \u201cPlatoon\u201d win the Academy Award for best picture in 1986, opened up the public conversation surrounding America\u2019s first losing war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d was published to great acclaim. It won the National Book Award, the Pulitzer, a special achievement award from the Vietnam Veterans of America, and in 1989, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Book Award. It sold 165,00 copies worldwide, which wiped out the debt and righted the family\u2019s financial ship.\n\nPerhaps the most appropriate tribute was detailed in a 1988 Washington Post profile by William Prochnau. He wrote that the Sheehans\u2019 21-year-old daughter, Maria, a Wellesley graduate by this point, wore a T-shirt saying, \u201cDaddy\u2019s Book Is Done.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d lives on as a lasting work of scholarship, and a staple of high school and college history and literature course syllabuses. Neil Sheehan has Parkinson\u2019s, and his career has slowed down, but he is still writing about Vietnam and was most recently seen in \u201cThe Vietnam War.\u201d His dapper appearance and the Irish lilt in his voice offered a fitting tribute to his writing life.\n\n\u201cThey filmed Neil in 2011 and he looks great,\u201d says Susan Sheehan, a Pulitzer Prize winner for her 1982 book about schizophrenia, \u201cIs There No Place on Earth for Me?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s lovely that our grandsons get to see him strong and healthy, not the man who needs a walker.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not follow through with his threat to never write another book after \u201cA Bright Shining Lie \u2014 he wrote two \u2014 Mr. Sheehan is most proud of the work for which he, and John Paul Vann, will always be remembered.\n\n\u201cI was enormously gratified to have written the book; it felt like I\u2019d truly accomplished something,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the splendid reviews came out, and even more when I heard from friends in the military who liked it, I was thrilled. I hope it endures as a piece of history to be read again and again. All I can say in my later days, I am deeply satisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Bright Shining Lie\u201d opens with a funeral to which they all came. It ends with \u201cJohn Vann was not meant to flee to a ship at sea, and he did not miss his exit. He died believing he had won his war.\u201d So too, will Neil Sheehan.", "title": "The Truth Behind \u2018A Bright Shining Lie\u2019", "authors": ["Patrick Sauer"]}

With only a few (and usually scandalous) exceptions, water is safe to drink, food is safe to eat, sanitation is universal, and some sort of medical care is available to everyone. Yet all these essentials of health are more likely to be lacking for poorer Americans. Even for the whole population, life expectancy in the United States is lower than we would expect given its national income, and there are places \u2014 the Mississippi Delta and much of Appalachia \u2014 where life expectancy is lower than in Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nBeyond that, many Americans, especially whites with no more than a high school education, have seen worsening health: As my research with my wife, the Princeton economist Anne Case, has demonstrated, for this group life expectancy is falling; mortality rates from drugs, alcohol and suicide are rising; and the long historical decline in mortality from heart disease has come to a halt.\n\nI believe, as do most people, that we have an obligation to assist the truly destitute. For those who believe that aid is effective, this is reflected in their own giving, or by supporting national and international organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank or Oxfam.\n\nFor years, in determining this spending, the needs of poor Americans (or poor Europeans) have received little priority relative to the needs of Africans or Asians. As an economist concerned with global poverty, I have long accepted this practical and ethical framework. In my own giving, I have prioritized the faraway poor over the poor at home.\n\nRecently, and especially with these insightful new data, I have come to doubt both the reasoning and the empirical support. There are millions of Americans whose suffering, through material poverty and poor health, is as bad or worse than that of the people in Africa or in Asia.\n\nPractical considerations reinforce the argument for recognizing America\u2019s poor in the global context. There is a better chance of monitoring the effects of domestic spending than of foreign spending. Money spent by and for fellow citizens, either individually or collectively, is subject to democratic evaluation by both donors and recipients, who can see the effects and who can show their approval or disapproval in the voting booth.

Research shows that policies like paid family leave and subsidized child care would make it possible for even more mothers to work.\n\nFertility data is more complicated than it might seem because there are many ways to measure fertility rates, and each gives a different snapshot. The general fertility rate measures the number of births for every 1,000 women of childbearing age in a given year, and the total fertility rate estimates how many children women will have based on current patterns.\n\nBoth have been declining.

That gave me a grounding to begin understanding this, but Bitcoin has turned into a very different kind of financial market. At the banks, I kept hearing about how they were taking this technology seriously as something that might change their business in the long run. That is because beneath the digital tokens, Bitcoin introduced a new kind of crowdsourced financial infrastructure, known as the blockchain, that allows for the creation of money and financial records that aren\u2019t maintained by any central authority like a bank or a government.\n\nClaims about Bitcoin\u2019s longevity differ dramatically. If you listen only to virtual currency aficionados, you would think that digital money is certain to dethrone the dollar as the global reserve currency and kill Wall Street, to boot. I get dozens of emails every day from entrepreneurs who tell me how they are going to use the technology introduced by Bitcoin to revolutionize the music industry, or shipping business, or even democracy itself. Meanwhile, very smart people like Warren Buffett and Joseph Stiglitz have continued to say that the whole thing is just a bubble waiting to burst.\n\nHow is a single journalist supposed to work through it all? It can feel a bit like being there at the invention of the stock market, but with no certainty that stocks would actually work as promised \u2014 and with everything hinging on software that few people understand.\n\nCertainly one part of this requires understanding the technical details of how Bitcoin and other digital tokens work. The time I\u2019ve spent grappling with the inner workings of virtual currencies has given me a sense of why so many computer scientists see the Bitcoin network as real technological innovation and not just a token that people buy and sell. I have a good stable of geeks who help walk me through the details when I get confused. And when I go to dinner parties it comes in handy \u2014 everyone these days wants to talk about how Bitcoin works and whether it is a bubble.\n\nBut from that first article about the Winklevoss twins, I have tried to focus, whenever possible, on the real people who are buying and using Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, and what is motivating them. That has taken me to Argentina, where I saw how people are using virtual currencies to escape the inflation their local currency is experiencing. It has also led me to the online black markets, where virtual currencies have made it easier for addicts to buy deadly drugs from China and for criminals to collect ransom payments.\n\nIt is also the real-world usage that tests whether Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are able to live up to the big promises that they are making. With most virtual currency projects, I\u2019ve found that there are relatively few real-world transactions to back up the big, speculative bets that investors are making.\n\nPerhaps most fascinating is how these new currencies draw communities around them. It\u2019s a potent reminder that all money is a social construct: The more people who believe a Bitcoin or dollar will retain its value in a week, the greater the value the currency will have.\n\nBut these are still early days. The death of Bitcoin has been wrongfully proclaimed many times already. For my part, The Times\u2019s rules against investing in what we write about has allowed me to be equally open to this going up or down.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond that, these virtual currencies are all living economics experiments, testing how different sorts of incentives create different behaviors. Bitcoin has an elaborate system of carrots and sticks designed to attract followers and to increase the cybersecurity of the Bitcoin network. But these incentives don\u2019t always work as expected.

{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "This proved to be the high point of Lansdale\u2019s influence in Saigon \u2014 and, for that matter, Washington. Diem grew tired of the American upbraiding him for undemocratic moves like closing opposition newspapers. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s the right thing for \u2018the father of his country\u2019 to do?\u201d Lansdale asked, to which Diem replied, \u201cStop calling me papa!\u201d\n\nEven as his clout diminished and his worries grew over the regime\u2019s coercive actions, Lansdale extolled Diem\u2019s achievements and urged continued American support. No other plausible leader existed who could take the fight to the Vietcong. For Lansdale, as for Boot, Diem\u2019s ouster and murder in a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in late 1963 backed by the United States was a watershed moment, a calamitous development from which the war effort never fully recovered.\n\nThere\u2019s something to this argument \u2014 it required about four years for the politics in South Vietnam to settle, and the Communists took advantage of the turmoil \u2014 but it misses how bleak and unsustainable the situation was with Diem. Communist forces were already gaining momentum in the countryside after 1962, which is partly why the South Vietnamese military had grown so disgruntled and why the Kennedy administration wanted a change. With his shallow conception of leadership and easy resort to repression, Diem, a Roman Catholic, had long since alienated powerful segments of South Vietnamese society, including the leaders of the Buddhist majority, and his regime enjoyed scant support among the peasantry. The coup against him was enormously popular. It\u2019s hard to see Diem surviving in power for long regardless of what John F. Kennedy did in the fall of 1963.\n\nTo his credit, Lansdale always emphasized the need to focus on developments within South Vietnam. More than many American officials, he understood that even if one somehow stopped the flow of men and mat\u00e9riel from the North, the southern insurgency would remain a formidable threat to the Saigon regime. Bombing North Vietnam was therefore no solution. Unshakable in his conviction that the American way was right for everyone, Lansdale nevertheless insisted on the need to show empathy for local values and practices, to spend time with villagers, and he perceived \u2014 to a degree at least \u2014 the dilemma at the heart of American strategy: What do you do when the destruction deemed necessary to defeat an insurgency alienates the very population you seek to bring over to the government\u2019s side?\n\nMany of Lansdale\u2019s ideas, however, were kooky: He advocated distributing counterfeit official documents in North Vietnam to sow confusion and fear, providing the Vietcong with booby-trapped ammunition intended to blow up in their faces and having Saigon leaders give \u201cfireside chats\u201d \u00e0 la Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 and he understood Vietnamese society and politics less well than this admiring book suggests. His well-founded concern about the problems posed by pervasive South Vietnamese official corruption (grasped, contrary to Boot\u2019s claim, by virtually every American intelligence analyst after 1965) did not keep him from championing the unscrupulous, impetuous and flamboyant Nguyen Cao Ky for Saigon\u2019s leadership \u2014 he of the aviator sunglasses, purple silk scarf and pearl-handled revolver. Ky\u2019s embrace of American largess made him the very symbol of corruption in the eyes of a great many Vietnamese (and he once told stunned journalists that his only hero was Adolf Hitler).\n\nThere is power in Boot\u2019s conclusion that Lansdale \u201cnever wanted to see half a million American troops thrashing around Vietnam, suffering and inflicting heavy casualties. His approach, successful or not, would have been more humane and less costly.\u201d In this sense, the Lansdale way was indeed \u201cthe road not taken.\u201d Whether that road would have led to the destination he so wanted to reach, however, is doubtful. As much as this irrepressible Cold Warrior might have thought otherwise, Vietnam for the United States was destined to be what it had always been: a riddle beyond American solution.", "title": "The War That Never Goes Away", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-31 00:00:00", "text": "The first is an absence of trust between Washington and Kabul. The longer the Americans stayed the more difficult it became to persuade Afghans that their presence was helpful and their purposes benign. Over time, Hamid Karzai, the West\u2019s chosen leader of \u201cliberated\u201d Afghanistan, came to see the United States as an occupying power \u2014 part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. Karzai believed, not without reason, that United States officials paid lip service to his concerns, were willing to cut deals behind his back and on occasion plotted to replace him with someone more accommodating.\n\nFor their part, Americans who dealt regularly with Karzai concluded that he was indecisive, unstable and given to bouts of paranoia. When he first became leader of Afghanistan in December 2001, Washington had celebrated Karzai as an Afghan Mandela. By the time he vacated the premises 13 years later, he had become in American eyes an Afghan Mugabe.\n\nOf even greater significance, in Coll\u2019s view, is Washington\u2019s dysfunctional relationship with the government of Pakistan, or more specifically with the Pakistani Army, which effectively calls the shots on all matters related to internal and external security. Pacifying Afghanistan was always going to pose a challenge. Absent full-throated Pakistani collaboration, it would become next to impossible. The United States needed two things from Pakistan: first, that it would permit supplies bound for coalition forces in landlocked Afghanistan to transit its territory; and second, that it would prevent Qaeda and Taliban remnants from using Pakistan as a sanctuary and operating base.\n\nFrom Washington\u2019s perspective, these expectations, premised on an assumption that Pakistan could be cajoled into complying with America\u2019s purposes in Afghanistan, seemed eminently reasonable. Yet that assumption proved wildly off the mark. While the generals commanding the Pakistani Army and directing the Inter-Services Intelligence made a show of cooperating, they were simultaneously working to undermine coalition military efforts. Imbued with the conviction that Afghanistan is vital to Pakistani national security, they had no intention of allowing the United States to determine its fate. So while accepting subsidies amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 Washington even elevated Pakistan to the status of \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d \u2014 the Pakistanis still actively supported the Taliban.\n\nPakistan\u2019s military leaders were playing a double game. United States officials knew they were being had, yet could do little about it. With its own well-established record of having broken promises to Pakistan, Washington was not exactly in a position to call in any markers.\n\nDespite being nominally the superior power, the United States found that it could exert minimal leverage. Officials could ask, but not demand, while Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arsenal limited its susceptibility to threats and sanctions. Although American officials went to almost comic lengths in attempting to befriend or flatter their Pakistani counterparts \u2014 Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called on Pakistan\u2019s army chief no fewer than 27 occasions \u2014 such efforts proved to no avail.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Pakistan has never ceased to support the very enemy that the United States and allied forces have been struggling to defeat. Its army and intelligence service remained throughout \u201can incubator and enabler of extremism.\u201d Coll concludes that Washington\u2019s inability \u201cto solve the riddle\u201d of Pakistan\u2019s Inter-Services Intelligence and \u201cto stop its covert interference in Afghanistan\u201d constituted the \u201cgreatest strategic failure of the American war.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe victory is closer than ever before.\u201d The words are Mike Pence\u2019s, uttered during his recent trip to Kabul, but the sentiment is one that any number of high-ranking American officials, civilian and military alike, have expressed over the years.

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "The businesses grew quickly. By the 1800s and the early 1900s, the owners of watch companies were living in elegant townhouses built of the region\u2019s distinctive pierre de Chailluz, a limestone in mottled tones of gray and beige. Ateliers, with extra-wide windows to let in the light so workers could see the tiny pieces they assembled, were tucked behind the homes.\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Temps reflects the city\u2019s role in timepieces \u201cfrom sundials to atomic clocks,\u201d according to its director, Laurence Reibel (and plays host in June each year to the Les 24H du Temps fair held in its courtyard).\n\nPhoto\n\nThe museum\u2019s displays include an example of a timepiece from Besan\u00e7on\u2019s glory days: the Leroy 01, completed in 1904. It has 24 complications, and for decades, Ms. Reibel said, was considered the world\u2019s most complicated watch.\n\nThe watch industry here, which now employs around 1,500 people, had 20,000 workers then.\n\nThe decline came to Besan\u00e7on in what locals call La Crise du Quartz, the sharp downturn in mechanical watch production and sales that followed the rise of quartz watches in the 1970s.\n\nLip, the timekeeper of the Tour de France in the 1950s, closed its doors in 1977. The change in the city was palpable. Afterward, when 5 p.m. rolled round \u2014 the time the Lip workers usually went home \u2014 \u201cthe streets of Besancon were silent; no one was driving their car home,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Coobar, the city\u2019s public relations manager, who grew up here. Over the years, other companies closed.\n\nThe watch school, \u00c9cole Nationale d\u2019Horlogerie de M\u00e9canique d\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9, closed. The company that made movements, France Ebauches, closed.\n\nPhoto\n\nBecause the city\u2019s residents were known for their precision work on watches, their skills soon were transferred to work on the microtechnologies required to manufacture medical devices and instruments for the defense and aeronautics industries. \u201cBesan\u00e7on became the capital of microtechnology,\u201d Mr. Laporte said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut since the 1990s, watch and clock making has been coming back.\n\nLong case clocks with a distinctive hourglass shape, called Comtoise clocks, have long been made in ateliers in the outskirts of the city and in the villages of the surrounding Jura mountains. Now, two men are keeping them alive: Philippe Vuillemin bought an old factory 12 years ago, and after making the necessary tools \u2014 \u201cThey were all gone during the war,\u201d he said \u2014 he began producing about 100 Comtoise clocks a year at his Manufacture Vuillemin business.\n\nIt would be safe to say the tall clocks that Mr. Lebru makes at Utinam were inspired by the Comtoise design, but their stainless steel cases bear little resemblance to the originals. Also, he patented his design for a suspended cage to hold the internal mechanism so the clocks no longer have to rest on flat surfaces.\n\nMr. Lebru was the designer of the clock, a six-ton wall installation, that greets visitors at the TGV train station in Besan\u00e7on. He said that a Swiss company has ordered one; \u201cThis means so much, that the Swiss should come to me, a Frenchman.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Lebru also makes watches with a twist, like the one with hands that circle counterclockwise, intended for left-handed wearers. His shop on Grande Rue sells the watches made in Besan\u00e7on by brands such as Humbert-Droz, Lornet, March LA.B and FOB Paris.\n\nIn the spring he plans to open a glass-fronted workshop in the mostly pedestrian Old Town so people can watch him work, and to sell online. \u201cThings are changing,\u201d he said. \u201cThree young French watchmakers are coming to Besan\u00e7on, because of its renown for horlogerie. Today, with the computer for knowledge and Kickstarter for funding, it\u2019s easier to design and make a watch.\u201d\n\nThe quartz crisis also led to the closure of many of Besan\u00e7on\u2019s repair shops, which serviced the mechanical watches made in the city. But gradually that sector has been reviving, too. In 2012 Breitling opened a new glass and blond wood service center in an industrial park; its director, Steve Napias, arrived in the region last year from Breitling\u2019s operations in Toronto. \u201cThere people would tell me, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve never met a watchmaker before,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cHere, everyone knows a watchmaker.\u201d\n\nOther watch service centers are in and around Besan\u00e7on, said Pierre Dieterle, the economic director for greater Besan\u00e7on: \u201cThere\u2019s Swatch, Festina from Spain, Seiko from Japan, Tissot and Longines.\u201d Audemars Piguet has a center, too.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to Mr. Dieterle, there are also companies producing watches or watch components for Zadig & Voltaire, Cerrutti, Christian Lacroix, Ted Lapidus, Mugler and what he described as \u201cles grandes marques de la Place Vend\u00f4me,\u201d the luxury jewelry and watch houses grouped around the famous square in Paris.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother Bisontin institution also has made a comeback. The Observatoire de Besan\u00e7on, opened in 1880 to certify the accuracy of timepieces using the stars, has worked its way back to certifying about 100 watches a year. It had shut down in 1970 but reopened in 2002 and now is operated by the university.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Vernotte, who ran the observatory for 10 years after its reopening, displayed the operation of the old meridian telescope, which looks like a cannon but is, in fact, accurate \u201cto one-tenth of a second,\u201d he said.\n\nNow atomic timekeepers are used to check watches for accuracy, and Jo\u00ebl Petetin, a technician at the Observatoire, said requests come from \u201cmostly independent watchmakers, like Kari Voutilainen and Laurent Ferrier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only certify chronometers now, and our requests have doubled every year,\u201d Mr. Petetin said. The process takes about two weeks and costs 400 euros ($480); watches that pass can be stamped with the city\u2019s emblem, the head of a viper, and receive a certificate.\n\nSo much history \u2014 yet, back at the Vuilleman workshop, the future is being trained.\n\nEmilien Theurot, 14, was sorting gears at a work desk as his \u201cstage,\u201d the one-week work experience required of all French students.\n\nLike all good Bisontins, horlogerie is in his blood; \u201cmy grandmother worked with watches,\u201d he explained.\n\nAnd why do his work experience here? \u201cBecause,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m passionate about movements.\u201d", "title": "The Watch Capital of France?

It has helped shape the look of the modern Far West Side.\n\nA pair of existing Moinian towers on West 42nd Street form a sort of bookend of the area. There is Atelier, a condo at No. 635 with 469 units, and Sky, a rental at No. 605. The developer believes Sky\u2019s 1,175 apartments to be the most packed into a single high-rise in the country.\n\nSoon joining Atelier and Sky around the corner will be Oskar, a rental building with a terra-cotta facade at 572 11th Avenue, at West 43rd Street. A far smaller undertaking, it has just 164 apartments, from studios to three-bedrooms, across 13 stories.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut what Oskar may lack in scale it makes up for in style. It was originally designed as a condo, a generally more luxurious property type, said Joseph Moinian, the firm\u2019s chief executive. Despite the change in use, which gives the developer more \u201clongevity\u201d at the site, the building\u2019s design was never downgraded, Mr. Moinian said. Finishes like Caesarstone kitchen counters were retained, he said, adding, \u201cthe quality is very, very high.\u201d\n\nAmenities will include an airy second-floor lounge with a 100-inch television over a wide fireplace and access to an adjacent landscaped terrace. For a fee, residents will also be allowed to use many of the amenities at the nearby and well-appointed Sky, including its basketball court, spa and pools.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe building is named for Oskar Brecher, the Moinian Group\u2019s former development director, who died in 2016. In mid-January, Oskar had not yet set specific rents, as it won\u2019t open until the spring. Mr. Moinian said that studios will likely be about $3,000 a month and one-bedrooms about $4,500.\n\nIn the broader Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood, west of Eighth Avenue, studios average $2,700 a month, according to StreetEasy.com data, while one-bedrooms average $3,400.\n\nOf Oskar\u2019s apartments, 46 will be available at below-market rents for those who are eligible based on their incomes. Those affordable units were required because the $180 million project is benefiting from state bond financing.\n\nMr. Moinian and other developers in the area have been helped by rezoning. In 2011, the city approved a plan to allow more apartments on the blocks between 10th and 11th Avenues, while permitting bigger industrial buildings between 11th and 12th Avenues. But because of lingering effects of the last recession, brokers say, residential development has been scattered until now.\n\nPhoto\n\nOskar\u2019s site previously held the Market Diner, which opened in 1962 and closed in 2015. It was one of a handful of diners that once sparkled amid the area\u2019s brick factories and warehouses. Most are now gone.\n\nOther projects in western Hell\u2019s Kitchen that are part of the recent surge include 535 West 43rd Street, a 280-unit dark-brick complex from a team that includes DHA Capital. This apartment house, which welcomed renters in 2016, was built on the site of parking lots. Studios at the building were listed this month for prices starting at $2,800. The building has a gym, a pet spa and two roof decks.\n\nAnd last year saw the opening of Frank 57 West, a 10-story, 65-unit rental at 600 West 58th Street, with one- to three-bedroom apartments, from the Durst Organization.\n\nFrank is clustered on the same block with earlier Durst rental projects like Helena 57 West and Via 57 West. Frank can also seem to represent an extension of the collection of apartment towers that have bloomed in recent years just to north, on West End Avenue, which is what 11th Avenue turns into north of West 59th Street.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut if West End enjoyed buzz before, 11th Avenue might be next. Standing tall on the skyline is the Max, a rental from TF Cornerstone that is under construction at 606 West 57th Street. Set to open this spring, the 1,028-unit complex will become New York\u2019s second largest residential building, the company said, second only to Sky. (Silver Towers, a rental complex on West 42nd Street, which opened in 2009, at the edge of the neighborhood, has 1,359 apartments, but in two connected high-rises.)\n\nThe Max is named for Max Elghanayan, son of the TF Cornerstone co-founder Frederick Elghanayan; Max Elghanayan died earlier this month. The Max will also have a school, a spokesman for TF Cornerstone said.\n\nPhoto\n\nContinuing south, there is 525 West 52nd Street, a two-towered complex from Taconic Investment Partners and Mitsui Fudosan America, with 392 apartments, including market-rate and affordable units. The building, which also has 35,000 square feet of amenities, opened last June.\n\nCondos, more rare in a somewhat untested market, are also going up; Charlie West, a 123-unit version from the Elad Group and Mi&Co, which has its main entrance on West 43rd Street.\n\nAlthough this project was unveiled in 2014, it is not expected to open until 2019, according to Michael Lorber, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, which is handling sales. It sits atop railroad tracks, on a platform, and next to a rental-car office. In early January, the least-expensive one-bedroom was $1.85 million. Affordable units are also part of the mix.\n\nIn comparison, in the entire Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighborhood, one-bedroom condos list for an average of $1.34 million, including existing units and those in new buildings, according to StreetEasy data.\n\nLess far along appears to be 615 10th Avenue. It is a block-wide project between West 44th and West 45th Streets, where there was once a gas station. Here, an 82-unit building is planned in a seven-story building, according to public filings. Target said that one of its stores will occupy the building\u2019s storefront, with about 29,000 square feet, and will open in 2019, a Target spokeswoman said.\n\nA Target store would be a major change for this area. Though 10th Avenue has many restaurants, there is just a smattering of retail offerings west of this busy thoroughfare. An exception is Gotham West Market, an enclosed food hall at 11th and West 44th Street that has Japanese, Mexican and Chinese food in a casual setting with industrial d\u00e9cor. It sits at the base of Gotham West, a nearly full-block apartment complex that opened in 2013.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

They were preparing to send her home for a third time when she miscarried at the hospital.\n\nCases like this, in which a provider\u2019s religious beliefs take precedence over a patient\u2019s needs, could become more common because of a series of recent White House decisions that please the anti-abortion movement. The decisions may make it more difficult for teenagers wanting to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases, for gay men looking to prevent HIV and even for women seeking breast exams or pap smears.\n\nEarlier this month, the Department of Health and Human Services announced the creation of a \u201cConscience and Religious Freedom Division\u201d to enforce laws protecting health care providers\u2019 right to opt out of certain procedures, including post-abortion care or gender-affirming surgery, because of religious objections.

In 1986, a woman was referred to them from an adoption agency. Her prior pregnancies had ended in abortion and in placement for adoption. She had planned to give up her current pregnancy for adoption, but it became clear that she wanted to keep this child. She needed help parenting, she needed housing, and she owed the adoption agency thousands of dollars when she withdrew from that process.\n\nBirth Choice responded by taking her in as the first resident of Rose Home, a shelter where the most vulnerable of its clients can live during and immediately after their pregnancies. At any given time, it houses five pregnant women and a maximum of 13 children.\n\nThe Rose Home shelter is a rarity among crisis pregnancy centers, a large majority of which, according to Ms. Chishko, follow \u201crigid rules: no shelters, no clinical services, just administer pregnancy tests and give out baby clothes. Just persuade the women not to abort their babies.\u201d And the dominant mode of persuasion, according to a congressional report on federally funded crisis pregnancy centers, involves providing either false or misleading information about the health effects of abortion.\n\nBy contrast, Rose Home\u2019s five residents get support to help them throughout pregnancy and beyond. They have weekly meetings with caseworkers to articulate goals and plan their futures. They receive counseling, drug abuse treatment and vocational training. They get help making court dates, permitting them to regain custody of their children currently in foster care.\n\nThe rhetoric of \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201clife\u201d encourages us to see a pregnant woman as if she\u2019s balancing a scale, with abortion on one side and motherhood on the other. Which will she choose? Tilt her one way and she might get to finish high school or college, gaining time to plan for the child she wants. Tipped another way, she might become a mother or allow a childless couple to adopt.\n\nThe women living at Rose Home reveal the shallowness of that metaphor.\n\nWomen face the surprise of an unplanned pregnancy as if on train tracks, with a locomotive barreling toward them. The only variation lies in how many other trains are coming from other directions. Homelessness, violence, addiction and the biggest of all: poverty.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to suggest money is the only factor that shapes many women\u2019s response to an unplanned pregnancy, but let\u2019s be clear about how much it matters.

Women took the lead, spurred by advocacy groups that married traditional community organizing tools with online templates.\n\nWith Congress poised to end Obamacare, women deluged their representatives with calls and letters, and confronted them at town halls. In one survey conduced by Celinda Lake, the veteran Democratic pollster, women placed 86 percent of 28,000 calls and texts to Congress on health care through Daily Action, another postelection resistance group. Planned Parenthood funneled more than 350,000 such calls, according to Kelley Robinson, its national organizing director.

And at town halls during congressional recesses, women offered vivid accounts of what would happen to them or their families without affordable health care.\n\nThe furor about health care crossed usual partisan lines, and along with internal fractures within the Republican Party, prompted enough Republican defections to thwart repeated attempts to end Obamacare through legislation.\n\nAs for #MeToo, the pink hats that became the emblem of the marches offered an early clue to the persistence of an issue many women believed was buried by Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The hats were a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, caught on an Access Hollywood tape, bragging about kissing women and grabbing their genitals without their consent. The emergence of the tape just before the election provoked an outpouring of women testifying about sexual harassment. It was not until this most recent wave, though, that men lost jobs \u2014 and in some cases, women are taking their places.\n\nThe broader cultural conversation that #MeToo is generating will lend the movement additional momentum, its organizers contend. \u201cThe words \u2018patriarchy\u2019 and \u2018misogyny\u2019 have probably been used more in the past two months than over the past two decades,\u201d said Kathy Bonk, long active in the women\u2019s movement.\n\nMs. Lake said an overview of current polling, as well as focus groups and polls her own firm has conducted, suggest that health care and sexual harassment are the issues that matter most to women, and give female candidates the most traction.\n\nGalvanized by the election, women are proclaiming their intent to run for office at record levels \u2014 a trend that began right after the election and has only intensified since.", "title": "The Women\u2019s March Became a Movement.

The argument was that growing investment flows into developing countries rendered World Bank lending mostly superfluous.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the report\u2019s critique remains pointed. Last year, the World Bank dispensed $61 billion in loans and investments.

The 1979 revolution had two contradictory ambitions: clerical Islamism and democracy. As theocracy has lost its appeal, the attraction of democracy, ever more secular in its expression, has spread from the college-educated to the working class.\n\nThe Obama administration, like so many well-intentioned Western journalists and scholars, locked onto this hope for gradual transformation from theocracy to democracy even though within Iran it had been shattered. The death of this dream was the electoral triumph in 2013 of Mr. Rouhani, a founding father of the regime\u2019s dreaded Intelligence Ministry. Iranians, who would surely down theocracy in a free vote, have a political system that gives them the option of voting for Mr. Rouhani or even more distasteful candidates.\n\nMany Americans still want to believe that the Islamic Republic can peacefully evolve into something less malign. After all, American foreign policy is much more difficult if Iran remains an aggressive theocracy. The nuclear deal seems less astute if, when the sunset clauses kick in and the atomic restrictions start coming off in six years, Iran has tens of thousands of loyal Shiite militiamen spread across the Middle East and has increased the capacity of its long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nBut as Misagh Parsa of Dartmouth has written in \u201cDemocracy in Iran: Why It Failed and How It Might Succeed,\u201d a depressing but essential read, gradual change isn\u2019t in the offing.

The capacities of autonomous weapons are designed by humans, programmers whose intentions are written into the system software. Let us remember, though, that the essence of computation needn\u2019t be restricted to a silicon substrate or to any metaphysically privileged medium.\n\nImagine that rather than having a programmer\u2019s intentions written into a robot\u2019s silicon substrate, we instead have a group of people physically carrying out the identical set of decisions and procedures. Given such a case, the decision-procedure being realized by the group of people would be functionally identical to the decision-procedure being realized on silicon. Supposing such a case, we might then ask, would an army realizing an institutional plan that was functionally identical to the algorithms of a killer robot be any less morally problematic? Would we want to then ban that particular army arrangement as well? If so, how?\n\nThe main point here is to emphasize the serious problem policymakers would face in isolating just what exactly it is that should be banned. Furthermore, such considerations highlight the fact that the deep moral issues raised by autonomous weapons are the very same ones raised by conventional warfare.\n\nWhen we start to look at killer robots this way, we see that they are the mechanical realizations of much larger sets of institutional intentions, involving the plans of designers and the decisions of people who follow such plans, individuals who accept certain jobs, develop certain software and put such software to military use.\n\nIndeed, there is the problem of determining who exactly within such a causal chain is morally responsible for potential harm and to what degree. However, the problem of determining where specifically within a given causal chain to assign moral responsibility to individual members is a problem endemic to any collective action whatsoever, from the Challenger disaster, to the BP oil spill, to global poverty.\n\nThe current language in the killer robot debate suggests that those weapons are capable of acting without meaningful human control, and that their creation and use is somehow distinct from other sorts of collective actions. It also suggests that potential harm arising from that creation and use may be morally unattributable to those who create and use them. This is not the sort of moral detachment we should foster in our technology and military communities, especially in relation to what is perhaps the gravest and most consequential of all human activities: war.\n\nOne common response to this view is that A.I. experts are particularly worried about learning machines, and that something about the complexity of these systems gives rise to emergent properties that are metaphysically irreducible to the sum of their parts. This would suggest that the robots possess an agency, and should then be subject to moral accountability, with the accompanying rights and interests.

Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the final years of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, wrote that Mr. Clinton had lost the biscuit for several months without informing anyone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d General Shelton wrote, \u201ca gargantuan deal.\u201d\n\nThe president does not need approval from anyone else, including Congress or the military, to authorize a strike \u2014 a decision that might have to be made at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nNevertheless, some politicians have called for more layers of approval.\n\n\u201cThe longer I\u2019m in the Senate, the more I fear for a major error that somebody makes,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said in 2016. \u201cOne man, the president, is responsible. He makes an error and, who knows, it\u2019s Armageddon.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHow would Kim Jong-un order a strike?\n\nMuch of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is shrouded in mystery.\n\nMr. Kim, however, is the undisputed ruler of his isolated country. Any decision to initiate an attack would most likely be his alone. In recent months, Mr. Kim has threatened to ignite an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d of missiles near the Pacific island of Guam, an American territory, and has warned that North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of reaching the mainland United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a speech on Monday. \u201cAll of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.\u201d\n\nIt is doubtful that there really is a button on his desk. Furthermore, an intercontinental attack from the North probably could not happen in minutes, let alone seconds.\n\nThe North\u2019s longest-range missiles are believed to be powered by liquid rocket fuel. That means the missiles cannot be stored and ready-to-fire at a moment\u2019s notice. They must be loaded with fuel before launch, a process than can take hours.\n\nNewer, shorter-range missiles, are loaded with solid fuel, however, making them easier to launch before the North\u2019s enemies detect an attack.", "title": "The \u2018Nuclear Button\u2019 Explained: For Starters, There\u2019s No Button", "authors": ["Russell Goldman"]}

Liz runs the front; I run the back.\n\nI\u2019ve learned there are things I\u2019m right about, and things Liz is right about. If she feels strongly about something, I don\u2019t debate her, and I\u2019ve learned not to doubt her and to trust her instincts in business and in this marriage.\n\nOur relationship history has taught me that we both have our strong points, to not fight the boundaries, that there are things I can\u2019t control, and that you need to give the other person room to try something they believe in. It\u2019s work to care for someone as much as you care for yourself \u2014 with marriage and with children.\n\nEarly in our marriage, I thought there\u2019s the wrong way, or my way. I\u2019m still like that about a lot of things, but not with Liz. I\u2019m used to being the one who says, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll fix it. I got it.\u2019 It\u2019s very comforting to know someone who stands by you can also fix it, regardless of what people might think of you. She\u2019s enjoyable to sit with and listen to. We have a heightened sense of connection, communication and passion. If you don\u2019t look at your wife as the most special person in the world, why are you with her?\n\nMrs. Symon: This is my second marriage, but this is the first time I\u2019ve been able to breathe. Michael is very chill and nonconfrontational. When you\u2019re around that, it gives you the ability to trust and gain confidence.\n\nWe had a great friendship first and that helps because you learn to like the person you\u2019re with. With Michael, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t always have to be right. I don\u2019t always have to be first. And to have the confidence to admit when I\u2019m wrong. That\u2019s very beneficial. If you\u2019re constantly combative, it doesn\u2019t bode well for a relationship. I can take a step back now and listen to what someone else is saying. I used to say anything, and that can be hurtful.\n\nI\u2019m also little O.C.D. \u2014 coffee handles to the right. Michael tries to live with it, but I\u2019ve learned to let go more. It\u2019s my weirdness, not his, though he still believes a toilet-paper fairy exists and changes the roll, so I\u2019ve also learned patience. Our marriage is intertwined in personal and business because we work together, which is how we started, and really, that\u2019s all we know. The business part is simple. We have defined roles in what we do. Marriage is harder. It\u2019s a world without rules. You have to make your own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe\u2019ve found our own strengths, and, in that, found each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.

She has described a bold new era in which Britain would look beyond the confines of Europe, striking trade deals and reclaiming its place as a global power.\n\nAll the while, an uncomfortable reality has been sinking in. Britain\u2019s stature on the world stage has diminished, and its economy has sagged. The former colonial empire has been reduced to a lesser actor, a reality that hit home on Thursday as Mrs. May delivered a sparsely attended speech before the World Economic Forum.\n\nMrs. May devoted part of her speech to declaring Britain\u2019s steadfast commitment to global trade and international engagement. But one of her primary examples of that commitment \u2014 highlighting Britain\u2019s role in a European bloc it is actively leaving \u2014 underscored the strange moment she inhabits.\n\n\u201cThe U.K. has been at the forefront of championing new trade deals including the E.U.\u2019s deals with Canada and Japan,\u201d Ms. May said. \u201cAnd as we leave the European Union, the U.K. will continue to be a global advocate of free trade.\u201d", "title": "Theresa May Arrives in Davos as U.K.\u2019s Post-\u2018Brexit\u2019 Slide Continues", "authors": []}

The accord was achieved without reawakening acute tensions in the Conservative Party over the extent of the post-Brexit ties between Britain and the bloc.\n\nBut the party\u2019s internal truce is fragile, and Mrs. May knows that her position remains vulnerable. Her cabinet has been carefully constructed to balance those, like Mr. Hammond, who want to keep a close economic relationship with the European Union, and those, like Mr. Johnson, who argue for a cleaner break.\n\nA desire to maintain that equilibrium partly explains why the two men remained in their posts, despite criticism of Mr. Johnson\u2019s performance as foreign secretary and calls from hard-line Brexit supporters for Mr. Hammond to be fired.\n\nMrs. May\u2019s reluctance to risk moving any senior colleagues, and the botched announcement of the new Conservative Party chairman, were described by some commentators in the British news media as the \u201cday of the blunt knives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe headline on the website of the right-leaning Daily Telegraph described the reshuffle as \u201cchaotic.\u201d The BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, noted the slow pace of announcements and made an ironic reference to Mrs. May\u2019s widely mocked statement, made after modifying plans for social care during last year\u2019s election campaign, that \u201cnothing has changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might almost say, almost \u2018nothing has changed\u2019 (so far),\u201d wrote Ms. Kuenssberg about the reshuffle on Twitter.\n\nOne minister who did leave the cabinet was James Brokenshire, who resigned as secretary of state for Northern Ireland for medical reasons, telling Mrs. May in a letter that he needed surgery to remove a small lesion in his right lung.\n\nA more problematic departure was that of Justine Greening, who resigned as education secretary after refusing to be moved to another job, according to British news media reports.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Green\u2019s position at the Cabinet Office was filled by David Lidington, who moved from his job as justice secretary.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lacking a parliamentary majority, Mrs. May must often rely on 10 lawmakers from the ultraconservative Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to push legislation through. That weakness was implicitly acknowledged on Sunday, when Mrs. May said that she had abandoned plans for a vote on whether to reverse a ban on the divisive issue of fox hunting.\n\nAnd, despite her intention to focus more on domestic matters, the next 12 months are likely to be dominated by negotiations with the European Union, leaving ministers with little time or energy to tackle issues like health, transportation and housing.\n\nThe withdrawal negotiations are likely to be tougher than those that took place in 2017, which focused on issues like Britain\u2019s outstanding financial commitments to the bloc, the rights of European Union citizens and the Irish border.\n\nThe next round of talks, involving efforts to secure a transition period after Britain leaves the bloc and to map future trade ties, could further destabilize Mrs. May\u2019s government.", "title": "Theresa May Reshuffles U.K. Cabinet, but Little Changes", "authors": ["Stephen Castle"]}
{"date": "2018-01-20 00:00:00", "text": "Pioneer Valley is one of 165 cohousing communities nationwide, with another 140 in the planning stages, according to the Cohousing Association of the United States. Most of these so-called intentional communities are multigenerational, while a growing number are either predominantly or exclusively occupied by senior residents. People own their own homes and can sell them on the open market. Residents pay into a fund to maintain facilities and collectively agree on how they should be used. Some, like Pioneer Valley, are rural. Others are suburban, and even urban.\n\n\u201cA lot of cohousing is out in rural areas, but we wanted to be in the city to be near things,\u201d said Janet Boys, 68, of Denver. She and her husband, Don McGuire, 73, left Philadelphia in August to move into the Aria Cohousing Community, a former convent close to parks and Regis University. The convent\u2019s dwindling community of seven nuns vacated the building when they could no longer maintain it, said Aria\u2019s developer, Susan Powers of Urban Ventures LLC in Denver. The initial group of residents, who in 2013 expressed interest in transforming the building into a cohousing community, had a bit in common with the previous tenants.\n\n\u201cThey were a group of single women, empty-nesters, who each lived in a single-family home and didn\u2019t want to live alone anymore,\u201d Ms. Powers said. Aria, which opened in August, now includes men and residents of every age.\n\nThe self-determination of Aria\u2019s founding residents is a hallmark of cohousing, along with clusters of houses or living spaces gathered around shared public areas. The heart of each community is the common house, or a space, where group meals are offered once or twice a week, together with activities and events. Houses are connected by pathways. Instead of a lawn mower in every garage, there often are no attached garages. Cars are exiled to peripheral parking areas, while a single, shared lawn mower suits the needs of everyone.\n\nThe common house is also where residents gather to make decisions about governance. Cohousing communities are most commonly set up as homeowners\u2019 associations, with residents adhering to legally binding bylaws. Yet with cohousing, there is one critical difference.\n\n\u201cWe are our own board, since most cohousing communities operate by consensus,\u201d said Karin Hoskin, executive director of the Cohousing Association of the United States and a resident of Wild Sage, a cohousing community in Boulder, Colo. Though typically not required, residents are expected, or at least encouraged, to attend the group dinners and pitch in where they feel most comfortable: maintaining the grounds, for example, or serving on committees. When it comes to finalizing decisions about maintaining common areas, or questions like noise levels in public spaces after certain hours, the entire community must agree. The objective, Ms. Hoskin said, was to regain a lost sense of community.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI know all of my neighbors. If I need to borrow some eggs, I know which houses I can go to where they\u2019ll probably have eggs,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re not home, there is a good chance I\u2019ll have a key to their house. It\u2019s really reminiscent of old-fashioned neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCohousing can be traced to Copenhagen, where the first \u201cliving communities,\u201d or bofaellesskaber, opened in 1970. A decade later two architecture students, Charles Durrett and Kathryn McCamant, were on a year abroad at the University of Copenhagen. During Mr. Durrett\u2019s daily commute through mundane suburbs, he noticed one complex that stood out.\n\n\u201cPeople in this one development were always out there talking to each other, sitting at picnic tables drinking tea. There were children running from house to house, and people coming and going to this building, the common house, where nobody lived and apparently everybody lived,\u201d he recalled.\n\nMr. Durrett and Ms. McCamant later married and, in 1984, returned to Denmark to learn more about the concept. In 1988, they self-published a book on the topic, and three years later built America\u2019s first cohousing community, Muir Commons, in Davis, Calif. Since then, their Nevada City, Calif., firm, McCamant & Durrett Architects/The Cohousing Company, has designed 55 cohousing communities across the United States, with more in development.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe momentum for cohousing had been growing. The National Building Museum in Washington noted the recent \u201cboom in cohousing communities nationwide\u201d in a current exhibition. One reason for the boom is that cohousing construction is seen as a good investment, said Robert Jenkens, director of social impact initiatives at the National Cooperative Bank, a Washington lender that finances cohousing projects.\n\nSixty-two percent of people polled in a Cohousing Research Network survey last spring said that sale prices of cohousing units in their communities have been rising, according to an analyst for the network, Angela Sanguinetti. But, substantial down payments are not always required for prospective residents. Many developments offer units eligible for F.H.A. loans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some terrific examples of cohousing developments that incorporate a number of low-income units, as many as 20 to 40 percent,\u201d Mr. Jenkens said.\n\nStill, there are those for whom cohousing might not work.\n\n\u201cSome people feel that cohousing is too much togetherness,\u201d said the social scientist Bella DePaulo, who wrote about cohousing in her book, \u201cHow We Live Now: Redefining Home and Family in the 21st Century.\u201d The model is also not for those who bristle at the self-governing element, she added. Then there is cohousing\u2019s association with hippies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cPeople immediately think communes, but cohousing is not a commune where everyone lives under one roof,\u201d Dr. DePaulo said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor aging hippies and baby boomers, however, dedicated senior cohousing offers an alternative to a retirement home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a good aging-in-place or downsizing model for people in their 50s and early 60s who still have quite a bit of life ahead of them, but want to move out of the old family house because they want less maintenance,\u201d said Jim Leach, 77, a founder of Silver Sage Village, a cohousing community of mostly seniors in Boulder.\n\nCommunity living can also be a balm for the documented isolation and loneliness plaguing older Americans, which researchers say threatens public health. According to a 2010 AARP survey, social networks ease the loneliness that can follow the loss of a spouse, or family members\u2019 moving, Ms. Hoskin said.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t staying where they grew up anymore, and a huge trend among seniors is that they don\u2019t have their siblings or their kids around them because they\u2019ve gone away to university or moved out of state for a job.

Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, but also a philanthropic foundation and a highly profitable terminal that sits on thousands of trading desks around the world.\n\nOr consider Donald J. Trump, who before he became president was the head of one of the country\u2019s best-known namesake brands. Nothing he owned, managed or marketed lacked the Trump name, from high-rises and golf courses to wine and water.\n\nMany other namesake companies have become so enmeshed in the business landscape that consumers forget they were once associated with a person: Procter & Gamble (a candle maker and a soap maker), Bose (an engineer), Duncan Hines (a restaurant critic), Doc Martens (a doctor who wanted comfortable shoes) and even institutions like the Mayo Clinic (not for mayonnaise but two brothers).\n\nMr. Donner said he had named his band after himself in the tradition of big-band leaders like Lester Lanin and Glenn Miller, whose orchestra still performs even though he died in 1944.\n\nPeter Thomas Roth, the founder and formulator of a cosmetics company that bears his name, said he had realized when he was starting his company in the early 1990s that it could take a week to come up with a name and two to three more weeks to check with the Patent Office to see if it had already been taken.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe remembered preparing for a trade show and needing a name, so he chose all three of his. He added the product\u2019s ingredients and intended purpose on the label.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, there were no disadvantages or advantages because no one cared,\u201d Mr. Roth said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOccasionally, buyers wanted to meet him. \u201cSometimes, they\u2019d want me there because I was the face of the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t always work. They\u2019d say, \u2018Can Peter come?\u2019 I\u2019d say, \u2018No, he can\u2019t come to Ohio for a $1,000 order because the airfare and hotel cost more.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarly on, Mr. Roth learned the extent and limits of having the company named for him. \u201cI can call the head of a company, and they actually take the call,\u201d he said. What he could not do, though, was call the same company\u2019s accounts payable department: \u201cYou can\u2019t call a customer to ask for money. You look like a loser.\u201d\n\nFor some entrepreneurs, their name is the only logical choice for a company.\n\nChris Kappler won gold and silver medals in equestrian events at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, which topped a career of some 100 horse-jumping victories on the Grand Prix circuit. He now runs Chris Kappler Inc., which helps people select and train horses and teaches riders of all levels in training facilities in New Jersey and Florida.\n\n\u201cIf you took myself out of it, there isn\u2019t much to it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a service business in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nWith a namesake business, problems arise with success and failure. If the company is successful, selling it with your name on it can be difficult \u2014 and changing the name can create problems with how consumers identify with the brand.\n\n\u201cAll the great things you\u2019ve done to build your brand reside with you,\u201d said Kevin Lane Keller, the E. B. Osborn professor of marketing at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business. \u201cIn technology, the chief executives and the founders are real important to the brands, the way Steve Jobs was to Apple. But they chose names that allow them to do many different things.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the more mundane problem of what happens after an eponymous owner departs. Anyone looking for a job this new year might think of Russell Reynolds or Spencer Stuart, two gigantic recruiting firms named for people who are no longer there. Mr. Stuart died in 2011, and Mr. Reynolds is running a smaller firm after he left the company that bears his name in 1993.\n\nMr. Keller said savvy entrepreneurs could pivot, even at the smallest level. His dentist, Roger McWilliams in Hanover, N.H., removed his name from the practice a few years ago, and it is now known as Lyme Road Dental, after the street it\u2019s on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sell the firm, otherwise,\u201d said Mr. Keller, who takes no credit for the marketing move. \u201cHe came up with it on his own. I applauded the move, and it made a lot of sense.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA name can also saddle others who share it with an association they might not want.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a brand like Steinway, that was originally a family name,\u201d Mr. Calkins said. \u201cToday, if your name is Joe Steinway, people will think you know a lot about classical music and have this association with you that isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nWhat a name can give a company is a story, which David Aaker, vice chairman of Prophet, a branding firm, said companies needed to get their brand noticed.\n\n\u201cFacts don\u2019t work,\u201d said Mr. Aaker, who is also an emeritus professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cPeople counterargue. They\u2019re skeptical. But if you tell them a story, that all goes away.\u201d\n\nMr. Kappler, the equestrian, used this approach to his advantage. He started riding when he was 9 years old and won Olympic gold at 37.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s helped because people who know me identify me as very methodical with my approach,\u201d he said. \u201cI take my time with the horses and riders. I develop them with confidence, so they\u2019re very prepared to any competition they go into. We\u2019re always thinking long term.\u201d\n\nOn the negative side, entrepreneurs can hurt their brand with personal mistakes.

As a result, Mr. Barbee said, \u201cPeople are now seeing this as a lumber company instead of a declining newsprint business.\u201d That translated into a fourth-quarter surge, when the stock rose more than 100 percent.\n\nThat jump contributed to an overall fourth-quarter gain for Aegis Value of 21.66 percent, compared to 6.64 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. The fund, whose retail shares have a net expense ratio of 1.75 percent, will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year. Over its life, it has returned an annualized average of more than 10 percent.\n\nResolute also helped propel the fourth-quarter gains of the Chou Opportunity Fund.

His biography is unusual. He didn\u2019t attend business school or toil at another investment company.

Residential construction has been sluggish since the financial crisis, but the market is providing pockets of promise, he said. People continue migrating to places with \u201clower taxes and better weather,\u201d like Tampa, Fla., Charleston, S.C., and Austin, Texas. So home building there is picking up, as are the stocks of builders that operate in the region, like LGI Homes, a recent top holding of the fund. Even in parts of the country where new construction remains slow, like the Northeast, people are increasingly renovating homes, he said.\n\nBy investing in American Woodmark, a cabinet manufacturer, Mr. Ely said, he aims to exploit both trends.

Even in this hypothetical, it would have taken more than a decade for Mr. Saipov to sponsor 22 to 24 relatives.\n\nBecause there are numerical limits for family-based immigration each year, there is a long queue for visas. (As of Nov. 1, more than 3.9 million people were waiting in line.) After a petition is filed and approved, would-be immigrants are essentially handed a ticket number called the \u201cpriority date\u201d and can only apply for a green card when the State Department calls their number.\n\nThe waiting period can last a few months to more than two decades, depending on the country of origin, the sponsor\u2019s immigration status and the applicant\u2019s relationship to their sponsor. In January, for example, Uzbek immigrants sponsored by American-citizen siblings could begin to apply for a green card if their priority date was before June 22, 2004, a waiting period of 13.5 years.\n\nSome Republican claims about DACA exacerbating \u201cchain migration\u201d have been overstated.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton of Arkansas argued on the Senate floor on Monday that immigrants who came to the United States as children could petition their relatives for green cards, including \u201cthe very parents who brought them here, in violation of the law, in the first place.\u201d Representative Dave Brat of Virginia, in an interview this month on Bloomberg, estimated that giving legal status to some 800,000 people who entered the country as part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy could lead to an influx of \u201cthree to four million\u201d\n\npotential relatives when \u201cmultiplied by chain migration.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Brat said the congressman based his estimate on research showing one immigrant could lead to an average of an additional 4.2 people coming to the United States, with higher numbers from South and Central America. That figure comes from a 2008 book on chain migration by Bin Yu, a professor at Rhode Island College.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

It should be noted, however, that people who are born in the United States are generally given American citizenship. By confining so-called chain migration to foreign relatives, Mr. Yu\u2019s research shows that one immigrant could result in the sponsorship of an average of 2.1 additional people.\n\nMarta Tienda, a Princeton University professor and an author of a 2013 study that updates Mr. Yu\u2019s work, said it was inaccurate to just apply the estimated multiplier to the Dreamer population. Her study estimated that each immigrant sponsors an even higher average of relatives \u2014 3.45 \u2014 but she emphasized that included all immigrant groups and was driven by employment visas holders, who are much likelier to be naturalized and sponsor foreign relatives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just multiply by 800,000. That\u2019s crazy,\u201d Ms. Tienda said, adding the average number of relatives sponsored by Dreamers would \u201cabsolutely be much lower\u201d than 3.45.\n\nTo apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, immigrants had to be younger than 31 on June 15, 2012, and must have proof of having arrived in the United States before 16. So their children are likelier to be American citizens, and their spouses also legal residents, citizens or Dreamers themselves.\n\nIf Dreamers are given a pathway to citizenship through legislation, their parents could indeed eventually obtain legal status. But those who entered the United States illegally are required to leave the country and wait three or 10 years before applying for an immigration visa. That\u2019s \u201ca significant barrier most would be unlikely to contemplate,\u201d according to the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nBecause these factors, the Dreamers would sponsor, on average, about one family member over their lifetime, the institute estimated.\n\nSome Democrats have misrepresented the Republicans\u2019 position on family-based immigration.\n\nRepresentative Adriano Espaillat of New York characterized chain migration as parents who want to \u201creunite with their children.\u201d Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez of Illinois defined it as immigrations petitioning for their spouses.\n\nRepublicans are not suggesting the elimination of family-based immigration, but rather limiting it to a so-called nuclear family \u2014 that is, a set of parents and their children.\n\nOver the summer, Mr. Trump endorsed a bill sponsored by Mr. Cotton that eliminates family-based immigration for parents, siblings and adult children. But the bill would still allow American citizens and green card holders to sponsor their spouses and children under 21.\n\nIt also establishes a visa class for foreign parents to visit their children who are American citizens. House Republicans introduced a similar bill on Wednesday that limits family-based green card programs to spouses and children who are minors.\n\nIn 2013, the Senate passed a bill that also eliminated visas for siblings and married sons and daughters over 31, and instead established a point-based system for their immigration. No Democrat voted against it. Though the House did not consider that legislation, Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez was a sponsor of a bill with similar provisions that year, despite characterizing Mr. Trump\u2019s demands to end chain migration and to build a border wall to limit immigration as \u201cransom.\u201d", "title": "These Claims About \u2018Chain Migration\u2019 Are Not Accurate", "authors": ["Linda Qiu"]}

The wood grain seems to be of a higher order of reality than either the collaged-on snippets of newspaper or the human figure who is represented. The man lacks the sharpness, the physical thereness, of the objects around him.\n\nCornell, too, was a shadow of a man who read voraciously and disappeared into his books. As the writer Susan Sontag, a friend of his, once observed, \u201cCornell seemed to be a person who lived in his head rather than in his body.\u201d He no doubt felt a temperamental affinity with Gris\u2019s idiosyncratic version of Cubism, which was more cerebral than Picasso\u2019s, more measured, less an evocation of omnivorous appetite than of calm and patient craftsmanship.\n\nMuch about Gris\u2019s life appealed to the part of Cornell that valorized the marginal. A Spaniard who settled in Paris, Gris was the overshadowed, tag-along third in the Cubist triumvirate that featured Picasso and Braque. By the 1950s, Picasso was an international celebrity posing bare-chested for photographers at his villa in Cannes, but Gris didn\u2019t live long enough to garner worldly perks. He died of uremia in 1927, at the age of 40.\n\nCornell always worked in series, and his Juan Gris boxes, of which there are more than a dozen, would consume him intermittently from 1953 into the \u201960s. They\u2019re easy to recognize. They stand about 18-inches tall and feature the same attractive bird \u2014 a paper cutout of a great white-crested cockatoo that the artist lifted from a 19th-century British book on ornithology. Gris\u2019s influence at times asserted itself with remarkable specificity. For starters, Cornell adapted the telltale human shadow that appears in the upper right of the Gris painting. Cutting out silhouettes and reverse silhouettes from black paper, and pasting them to the back wall of his boxes, Cornell equipped each bird with an inseparable companion.\n\nAt other moments, the Gris influence feels more generalized, especially in the Philadelphia Museum of Art\u2019s magnificent \u201cHomage to Juan Gris\u201d (1953-54). The interior is wallpapered with pages from a French history book, as if to lend the bird never-ending hours of reading pleasure. The lesser boxes, by contrast, lack such unity. In \u201cUntitled (Juan Gris Series),\u201d circa 1953-54, the familiar cockatoo rests amid bare white walls, and assorted paper cutouts \u2014 including the bird\u2019s shadow \u2014 lie in loose disarray on the bottom of the box, as if the artist became distracted and forgot to finish what he had started.", "title": "These Shadow Boxes Are Striking.

Then Alan Yaffe, a Toronto picture framer, stepped in, selling his business in downtown Toronto and mortgaging his house to buy the company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince then, Peterboro has become something of a trade success story. Mr. Yaffe invested in the plant and expanded the market for its products not just in the United States, but also in Australia and Europe, particularly Russia.

They also took tiny muscle biopsies from each animal.\n\n[READ: In DNA, Clues to the Cheetah\u2019s Speed and Hurdles]\n\nThough cheetahs and impalas were universally more athletic than lions and zebras, both cheetahs and lions had a similar advantage over their prey \u2014 they were 38 percent faster, 37 percent better at accelerating, 72 percent better at decelerating and their muscles were 20 percent more powerful.\n\nThis makes sense because the predators are always a step behind, Dr. Wilson said. They have to run faster to catch up, but they must also be able to decelerate quickly in case their targets decide to suddenly slow down and turn.\n\nThe data also showed that impalas and zebras were typically moving at only half their maximum speed when running from their pursuers. To confirm why, the scientists created a computer model that simulated the last moments of a hunt, after a predator has closed in enough to capture its prey within two strides.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe model showed that impalas and zebras have the best chance of making a getaway if they run at moderate speeds, because that leaves more options for maneuvering away at the last second.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running flat out, there\u2019s not much you can do to stop a lion from anticipating exactly where you\u2019re going to be in two strides\u2019 time,\u201d Dr. Wilson said.\n\nRunning at a lower speed, however, means an animal can speed up or slow down.

His father, Walter, was a factory worker; his mother, the former Minnie Kisbert, was a homemaker. After graduating from Xavier University and the Salmon P. Chase Law School, both in Cincinnati, he served in the Marines. (The law school later moved across the Ohio River to become part of Northern Kentucky University.)\n\nHe was elected city solicitor of Deer Park, a suburb of Cincinnati, before being named first assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. That appointment was helped by his brother Jim, a labor leader whose friendship with Attorney General Robert F.

It changed their mentality.\u201d\n\nTwo years of missionary work abroad or in the United States are a rite of passage and a duty for able Mormon men, a preparation for service in a church operated by its male laity. Women\u2019s missionary service is 18 months and optional. The surge of female volunteers after the age limits were lowered suggested that many had long been eager to go.\n\n\u201cSisters always had that little thought of serving a mission, but by the time 21 comes, you\u2019re married or onto something else,\u201d Shoushig Tenguerian, a student at Southern Virginia University, a private Mormon college, told The Times in 2012. \u201cThis age change changes everything.\u201d\n\nDespite persistent demands for change on another feminist issue, Mr. Monson \u2014 who as president was considered by adherents to be God\u2019s \u201cprophet, seer and revelator\u201d \u2014 did not open the door to women in the priesthood, which, like the Mormon hierarchy, has been male since the church was founded in the early 19th century. Critics say the ban on female priests has no explicit basis in church Scripture, but efforts to overturn it were sometimes dealt with harshly.\n\nSome Mormons faced sanctions for questioning church positions on women\u2019s roles. Kate Kelly, a feminist Mormon lawyer, was excommunicated on a charge of apostasy in 2014 after founding the organization Ordain Women.\n\nAs the 16th president of the Latter-day Saints, succeeding Gordon B. Hinckley, Mr. Monson faced another test when church members, increasingly scouring online sources, found apparent contradictions between historical records and church teachings.\n\nAlthough the church officially abandoned plural marriages in 1890, it was a defiantly polygamous theocracy in the mid-19th century. In a 2014 teaching, \u201cPlural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,\u201d the church said that Joseph Smith, the church founder, had married as many as 40 women, some of them already married. It said that Smith was a reluctant polygamist, agreeing to multiple marriages only after an angel threatened him with a sword.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome critics said that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had previously contended that Smith had been happily married to only one woman, and that the new teaching \u2014 in the words of the website OnceDelivered.net, which identified itself as an expression of the Baptist faith \u2014 had used Scripture to \u201caddress the inconvenient truth of Smith\u2019s polygamy.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the church allowed historians access to church documents and records to a remarkable degree. Some published their findings online and in printed volumes, although they were usually vetted by church leaders. In allowing such access, students of church policy said, Mr. Monson presided over an unprecedented era of openness about church history, while reassuring the faithful that theirs was the one true, unerring faith.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe church\u2019s historic partnership with the Boy Scouts of America, which dated from 1913 and prepared Mormon boys for missionary work and adulthood as lay priests, was threatened late in Mr. Monson\u2019s tenure. For a century, nearly all Mormon boys became scouts, and the church became scouting\u2019s largest sponsor. By 2011, Mormon-sponsored packs and troops represented one-third of the nation\u2019s 421,000 scouts.\n\nBut the church and the Boy Scouts found themselves at loggerheads in 2014, when scouting admitted gays for the first time, and a year later, when it accepted gay adults as scout leaders. Mr. Monson said nothing publicly, and the church did not withdraw its support for scouting, as a church lawyer had threatened to do in a 2000 Supreme Court hearing on exclusionary scouting practices. While calling homosexuality immoral, church policy said \u201cnonpracticing\u201d gays could have the same rights and privileges as other church members.\n\nIt was clear, however, that a rift over sexual orientation had been laid bare. For years, the church treaded lightly on the subject. In 2009, it supported a Salt Lake City ordinance banning discrimination against gays in jobs and housing.\n\nBut in 2015, Mr. Monson responded to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage with a letter read in Mormon churches saying that sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage were \u201ccontrary to the laws of God.\u201d And, further drawing the line, the church declared same-sex couples to be apostates and restricted their children from baptisms and other rites.\n\n\u201cRestrictions on the children of gay parents who are faithful church members struck some Mormons as severe,\u201d Professor Bushman said. \u201cThat was a tough one. It\u2019s not just an abstraction \u2014 it affects people\u2019s lives. It bothered a lot of Mormons.\u201d\n\nAfter the declaration, more than 1,000 people, many of them with deep ties to Mormonism, staged a rare public protest against the restrictions outside the church\u2019s spired temple in Salt Lake City, and demanded that their names be stricken from the membership rolls. A church spokesman said later that 1,500 resignations had been received.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Monson posted a message for the wavering faithful on Twitter: \u201cI plead with you to avoid anything that will deprive you of your happiness here in mortality and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d\n\nThomas Spencer Monson was born in Salt Lake City on Aug. 21, 1927, the second of six children of George Spencer Monson and the former Gladys Condie. He grew up in a tight-knit extended Mormon family that lived in proximity and that often worked, vacationed and worshiped together. At 12, he began working in a printing business his father managed.\n\nHe graduated from West High School in Salt Lake City in 1944. After starting at the University of Utah, he joined the Naval Reserve in 1945. World War II ended months later, and after stateside training, his tour of duty ended in 1946. He re-entered the University of Utah, graduating in 1948 with honors and a bachelor\u2019s degree in marketing, and earned a Master of Business Administration degree from Brigham Young University in 1974.\n\nIn 1948, he married Frances Beverly Johnson. She died in 2013. Survivors include their three children, Thomas and Clark Monson and Ann Dibb; eight grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nAs is common in Mormonism, Mr. Monson\u2019s life straddled the worlds of business and religion. A printer by trade, he was an advertising executive with The Deseret News in the 1940s, and rose in the 1960s to general manager of the Deseret News Press, a church-affiliated printing firm. He was a longtime director and board chairman of the Deseret News Publishing Company.\n\nHe rose steadily in the church, too. In the 1950s, he was the bishop of a ward, akin to a parish, of 1,000 Mormons, including 85 widows whom he visited regularly and 23 men serving in the Korean War to whom he wrote personal letters weekly. From 1959 to 1962, he was president of the church\u2019s Canada mission, covering Ontario and Quebec.\n\nIn 1963 he became a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, the church\u2019s second-highest governing body. The highest authority is the church president, followed by two counselors, positions based on seniority, which makes transitions free of politics but puts a mantle of age at the top.\n\nAwaiting his turn for the presidency, he embraced humanitarian causes with Christian, Jewish and Muslim groups supporting homeless shelters, food banks, nursing homes and disaster relief efforts in the United States and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ever meet on doctrinal matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s strictly on the social side.\u201d", "title": "Thomas Monson, President of the Mormon Church, Dies at 90", "authors": ["Robert D.

He is married to a daughter of Lee Friedlander, a giant in the world of documentary photography, and has published 15 monographs with introductions by writers like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Norman Mailer. His teaching career includes stints at Fordham, Cooper Union and Yale, according to his website.\n\nThe five women described Mr. Roma as a charming and charismatic teacher who cultivated a streetwise persona and emphasized perseverance, sacrifice and dedication to craft. The women, as well as some former students who posted anonymously online about Mr. Roma\u2019s teaching, said that he could be an unsparing critic, but also had the ability to instill confidence and inspire.\n\nOne of the women, Ash Thayer, a filmmaker and artist in Los Angeles, said she studied with Mr. Roma in the mid-1990s at S.V.A., then in the graduate program at Columbia, where she was also his teaching assistant. In 1999, Ms. Thayer said, she was working in Mr. Roma\u2019s office at Columbia shortly after a mutual friend, the photographer Raghubir Singh, had died. Ms. Thayer said that she was sitting at a desk when Mr. Roma asked her to turn around. His penis was erect, she said, and he moved toward her. She repeatedly said \u201cno,\u201d but Mr. Roma placed his penis in her mouth before she pushed him away and left, Ms. Thayer said, estimating that the encounter lasted perhaps 30 seconds.\n\n\u201cI froze,\u201d she said. \u201cHe committed oral rape against me.\u201d\n\nAllison Ward, a student at S.V.A. in the mid-1990s, said she had several sexual encounters with Mr. Roma. One occurred in a classroom, she said, recalling that she \u201cwas mortified and embarrassed but went along with it.\u201d Ms. Ward said that she had wanted to please Mr. Roma and gain his acceptance, adding \u201che was the first person in my life who had connected my passion for photography with a path forward.\u201d Mr. Roma did not force any contact, she said, but had been \u201cpredatory\u201d and had \u201ccrossed a line\u201d by seeking a sexual relationship.\n\n\u201cHe was coercive and would keep trying,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a little relentless.\u201d\n\nAnother S.V.A. student in the mid-90s, Angela Cappetta, said that after repeated requests she allowed Mr. Roma to photograph her in her apartment. There, she said, Mr. Roma asked to touch her breast and put her hand on his crotch. \u201cI thought I\u2019d have to go along with it or it would be detrimental,\u201d she said. She drew the line when he asked to have sex, she added.\n\nOn campus, Mr. Roma often surrounded himself with a coterie of male and female students who would sort his negatives and act as teaching assistants, the five women said, adding that Mr. Roma would regularly invite students on outings or to gatherings at his house in Park Slope.\n\nIn 1997, Ilana Rein, a graduate student at S.V.A., said that Mr. Roma, who was then her thesis adviser, invited her to a backyard gathering. He asked her into his photo studio, then bluntly stated that he needed something from her and placed her hand on his crotch, Ms. Rein said. Taken aback, she did not object, but soon began feeling ill, removed her hand and left.\n\n\u201cI was blindsided because I thought we were going to look at photographs,\u201d Ms. Rein, now a filmmaker in Los Angeles, said. \u201cThis is someone who I trusted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of the former students stayed in touch with Mr. Roma after these encounters, saying that they were intimidated, sought his help or wanted to believe that his behavior had been out of character. But, some added, Mr. Roma could be dismissive or even cruel to those who had rebuffed him.\n\nMs. Rein said that during a trip to Coney Island with students after her encounter with Mr. Roma, he repeatedly singled her out for mockery, while others laughed. \u201cThere was a kind of violence to it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had such a vise grip on us back then.\u201d\n\nMs. Thayer said she blocked out memories of the office incident and, after graduating, remained in sporadic touch with Mr. Roma, exchanging emails and sometimes asking for recommendations or advice. In 2014, she said, she met Mr. Roma in Brooklyn and let him know that a book of her photographs was about to be published. He told her he might be able to help her get a teaching job at Columbia, Ms. Thayer said, but then implied that he would expect intimate contact in return. She has not seen or spoken with Mr. Roma since.\n\n\u201cI just kept wanting him to be the mentor that he was supposed to be,\u201d Ms. Thayer said. \u201cBut I realized that there was not going to be a time when he was not inappropriate with me and asking for a sexual relationship.\u201d", "title": "Thomas Roma, Photographer and Professor, Accused of Sexual Misconduct", "authors": ["Colin Moynihan"]}

As the fighting moved up and down the peaks, lush jungle landscape was ripped apart by airstrikes and artillery fire and reduced to craters and shattered tree stumps, with body parts protruding from the pulverized earth.\n\nMarine patrols battled an often elusive enemy and the equally challenging jungle. Grunts wore condoms to protect themselves from leeches that could burrow inside genitals. Once, when I was sprawled on the jungle floor during one halt, a huge snake slithered across my hand, and to this day I am convinced I levitated several feet in shock.\n\nWe\u2019d be submerged for days by monsoon rains, wading through rice paddies and shivering at night in sodden jungle fatigues until our feet began to rot and we felt as cold as being naked on winter\u2019s day in Chicago. The cold wetness was often followed, within hours, by tropical heat so stifling that Marines fell like ninepins from dehydration despite gulping handfuls of salt tablets.\n\nWe lived in terror of a night ambush \u2014 every sound and movement was undoubtedly an enemy soldier. It took hours to \u201ccome down\u201d from that experience even when there was no contact. Marines doused themselves with mosquito repellent so evil-smelling that experts said the North Vietnamese and Vietcong soldiers could identify us over long distances and avoid contact. Eventually a less toxic mosquito formula was introduced.\n\nAs the North Vietnamese stranglehold tightened around the Khe Sanh combat base itself, Marines burrowed into often shallow trenches, reminiscent of those of World War I, that offered only modest protection against incoming fire. Streams of visiting civilian journalists refused shelter in the public information trench and bribed Navy Seabees with liquor to share their impressively constructed bunker.\n\nMy commander was bitten by rats. Despite his violent protests, he was medevaced \u201cto the rear\u201d for rabies treatment, which meant taking two helicopter or fixed-wing trips on the \u201cdeath run\u201d from the Khe Sanh airfield as North Vietnamese gunners bracketed aircraft and the airstrip with nonstop shelling.\n\nWhat became known as the siege of Khe Sanh \u2014 probably the most reported fight of the entire war \u2014 began in late January 1968 and stretched into a protracted artillery slugfest, a grim daily struggle for survival dominated by a virtual curtain of death rained down by high-flying bombers we rarely saw but constantly blessed in our prayers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

In an awesome fleet of gunships (yes, war can look beautiful at times) and clean jungle fatigues, the Army\u2019s First Air Cavalry Division hopscotched from hilltop to hilltop into Khe Sanh base and planted a sign declaring, \u201cUnder New Management.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI accompanied a sullen unit of Marines who had not changed their fatigues, taken a proper shower or eaten a good meal for weeks or months, as they left by battered trucks or on foot, some muttering their admiration for the North Vietnamese Army rather than any gratitude to the Air Cav.\n\nI had first become aware of this Army-Marine animosity during a stopover in Japan en route to war, when frustrated Marines confined aboard a troop ship had tossed overboard dozens of inebriated soldiers returning from shore leave. And now it had resurfaced in Khe Sanh, and I feared an all-American shootout.\n\nThe base was abandoned shortly after the siege itself was lifted, but controversy swirls around Khe Sanh even today. Why were the Marines there in the first place, and why were so many lives sacrificed, seemingly in vain?\n\nWere the North Vietnamese determined to seize Khe Sanh, or was the siege a feint to camouflage the forthcoming nationwide Communist 1968 Tet offensive? Common sense suggests that it was a combination of both. Had the North Vietnamese overrun the base it would have been their biggest victory of the war, affecting the outcome even more decisively than the Tet offensive.\n\nAnd though the North Vietnamese were not successful in that aim, the battle did distract Gen. William Westmoreland and the Americans from developments in other parts of South Vietnam. Under pressure from Saigon, the Marines had also abandoned their promising hearts and minds campaign in the northern operational area, known as I Corps.\n\nI arrived at Khe Sanh and the surrounding Quang Tri Province as a Marine with a rifle, but returned a half-century later with a piece of chalk as a full-time volunteer English teacher in a Vietnamese high school.\n\nToday, the region, which was subject to possibly the heaviest aerial bombing and defoliation campaign in history, is still dotted with unexploded ordnance despite years of mine clearance and more than 7,000 postwar casualties. Farmers, children and mine clearers themselves continue to be victims. Families suffer the lingering effects of Agent Orange and babies continue to be born deformed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome 100,000 tons of ordnance were dropped around Khe Sanh itself, turning the region into a wild moonscape of pulverized red soil. But the mountains are again cloaked in green. Bomb craters have been transformed into duck ponds. The ghostly armies of camouflaged North Vietnamese soldiers slipping down the nearby Ho Chi Minh Trail have been replaced by commercial traders traveling to and from neighboring Laos and Cambodia.\n\nCoffee plantations and split-level homes steadily encroach on the former Marine base, A Vietnamese victory museum there bizarrely claims \u201c80 ships were destroyed\u201d during the climactic battle, even though the base is 70 miles from the sea or other navigable waterways.\n\nThe Vietnamese are remarkably generous in their forgiveness of a war that devastated their country and killed one million to three million people (estimates depend on the source), or as high as 10 percent of the population. American deaths were slightly more than 58,000. Despite this carnage, locals have overcome the trauma of the war more quickly than Americans, and I am warmly welcomed into homes and classrooms everywhere, including Khe Sanh.\n\nOne skinny kid who begged candy from passing Marines in 1967 is now a friend and a successful businessman. A farmer friend was a South Vietnamese soldier. His wife was a Vietcong antiaircraft gunner. Their daughter, Nhung, attempts to teach me Vietnamese, a language most Marines did not need because we were not allowed to fraternize with locals, only shoot at them.\n\nI recently met Lan, who had been at Khe Sanh as a N.V.A. nurse at the same time I was. She survived by snuggling close to the Marine wire in a strip of land around the base that American bombers avoided to prevent friendly casualties. Thousands of her fellow soldiers were \u201csimply blown apart \u2014 we could do nothing for them,\u201d she recalled.\n\nUntil our meeting, Lan said she had never talked about Khe Sanh except with her husband, though a picture of a beautiful young woman in uniform sits proudly on the wall of her home. After forging that deepest bond, possible only amid the horror and memories of war, sometimes even with former enemies, we agreed to revisit Khe Sanh \u2014 this time together as friends.", "title": "Three Journeys to Khe Sanh", "authors": ["Ray Wilkinson"]}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "Waste not\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t care about food-related emissions. Worldwide, agriculture accounts for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Luckily, we can help slash emissions \u2014 and save money \u2014 without drastically altering our diets.\n\nOne way is to waste less food. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, about a third of the food produced worldwide never gets eaten. Throughout the world, some of that waste happens during production and distribution. But consumers and restaurants in North America throw away almost 40 percent of available food.\n\nGeremy Farr-Wharton, a researcher at the Queensland University of Technology, found that color-coding our refrigerator contents (green for fresh produce, red for meat) can reduce food waste. There are even refrigerator management apps like FridgePal and Best Before that track the food in your fridge and when it will spoil. If apps aren\u2019t your thing, a weekly refrigerator check \u2014 preferably before grocery shopping \u2014 can also help, as can monthly fridge eat-downs where you spend the last few days of the month using up everything that\u2019s left in your fridge.\n\nA number of businesses are also stepping up to cut waste on the production side by selling ugly produce. Producers toss about half of all fruits and vegetables in the United States, in part because they think we won\u2019t buy \u201cimperfect\u201d produce that fails to meet aesthetic standards. Businesses like Imperfect Produce hope to bridge that gap by selling ugly but otherwise normal produce at a discount of 30 to 50 percent.\n\nMeasure up\n\nThere\u2019s some truth to the saying \u201cWhat gets measured gets managed,\u201d and quantification has become something of a cultural obsession. Oroeco, an app available on both Android and iOS, takes that zeal and applies it to tracking personal carbon emissions.\n\nOroeco helps quantify the carbon emissions associated with purchases, investments, dietary choices and preferred modes of transport. It allows users to set goals, track performance and even compare their performance with friends. The app is still relatively new, and it isn\u2019t perfect, but it can be a useful tool to get you moving in the right direction.\n\nOther apps can help you lower your carbon footprint, too. My colleague Hiroko Tabuchi recently detailed the apps that she uses to stay aware of her personal contribution to global warming. The list includes the CO2 app from the International Civil Aviation Organization that she uses to track her greenhouse-gas emissions when she flies so she can invest in carbon offset credits.

It has been 50 years since Hoffman, Bancroft and the incandescently creative team of the director Mike Nichols and the screenwriter Buck Henry took Charles Webb\u2019s small 1963 novel of domestic discontents and turned it into a movie that epitomized huge shifts in both popular culture and Hollywood commerce.\n\nThen again, all this has been recounted before, with nuanced and perceptive synthesis, by Mark Harris in his popular 2008 history, \u201cPictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood,\u201d now a classic of cultural reporting and analysis.

The author\u2019s interview with Hoffman took place in 2008 \u2014 and here we come to a clue to understanding the book\u2019s tortured structure, its pained search for an angle: Most of the research seems to have taken place a decade ago. The majority of Gray\u2019s direct reporting comes from two long interviews with Turman, now 91, who, as a Hollywood novice, was canny enough to obtain the rights to Webb\u2019s novel.

The authors he selected were challenging and included Shakespeare, Daniel Defoe, Lewis Carroll and Malcolm X. Digesting their writings could take weeks, and arriving at a a suitable motif, a process they called jammin\u2019, could take months. Some books were put aside for years and returned to later. The individual variations that the students made had to pass muster with the group as a whole before being added to the large paper-covered canvases.\n\nTheir first series remained their best known: densely wrought compositions of convoluted golden horns whose intricacies could evoke lattices, weapons or bodies. They were inspired by the trumpets played by angels in the final chapter of Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cAmerika.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEqually distinctive, and almost as popular with museums, were the gold-trimmed red capital A\u2019s inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s \u201cThe Scarlet Letter.\u201d\n\nThe group covered pages of \u201cThe Red Badge of Courage\u201d with widely spaced images of wounds, and of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d with densely arranged petal-like blurs of color.\n\nFor George Orwell\u2019s \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d they painted farm animals with the heads of world leaders.\n\nTheir texts often had contemporary relevance: Their interpretation of Gustave Flaubert\u2019s \u201cThe Temptation of Saint Anthony,\u201d for example, with red-soaked suggestions of diseased cells, resonated with the AIDS crisis.\n\nTheir work was part of the widespread experimentation in the 1980s in combining form and narrative, usually using aspects of Conceptual and Minimal art. The alluring grid and hazy textures of the book-page surfaces paralleled the painting-collages of painters like Philip Taaffe, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Julian Schnabel. And the collective structure of the group presaged the growing interest in combining art and social activism.\n\nTimothy William Rollins, a loquacious man whose speech sometimes assumed the evangelical cadences of the preachers he listened to while growing up in Maine, and later in Harlem, was born on June 10, 1955, in Pittsfield, Me. He was the oldest of four children of Carlton Rollins, who worked in shoe and furniture factories, and the former Charlotte Imogen Hussey, a hospital ward clerk.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Rollins, who once said he considered himself \u201ca city kid in a country body,\u201d drew and read voraciously as a child. (Emerson, Thoreau and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were heroes.) With money from part-time jobs, he amassed a comic-book collection that he would sell to attend art school in New York.\n\nIn 1973, Mr. Rollins entered a new art program at the University of Maine at Augusta, where he read everything he could find about the New York art world, including an essay by the prominent Conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth, who was teaching at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. In 1975, after Mr. Rollins earned an associate\u2019s degree in art, his application to that school was accepted, and he moved to New York.\n\nIn short order he was studying with Mr. Kosuth, who was then at the height of his Marxist fervor and teaching the merits of collective politicized action. He was also working as Mr. Kosuth\u2019s assistant, a job he called \u201cmy real education.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1979, Mr. Rollins and Julie Ault, a classmate from the University of Maine, along with several others, among them Marybeth Nelson, Patrick Brennan and Beth Jaker, founded Group Material, which operated a small gallery in the East Village. He also studied art education at New York University.\n\nMr. Rollins and his students started exhibiting in 1981 in Group Material\u2019s gallery, initially identifying themselves as \u201cTim Rollins and 15 Kids From the South Bronx.\u201d (The number would vary.) The students chose the name Kids of Survival in 1982 as invitations to exhibit began to increase. In 1985, the cohort unveiled the first \u201cAmerika\u201d painting in a group show at the Gladstone Gallery in SoHo. Grace Glueck, writing in The New York Times, called it the \u201ccoup\u201d of the exhibition.\n\nIn 1985 and 1986, the group had solo shows at Hostos Community College and Fashion Moda in the Bronx and at Jay Gorney Modern Art, which was then in the East Village. Within a few short years, Tim Rollins + K.O.S. exhibited in the Venice Biennale, at Documenta 8 in Kassel, Germany, and at two Whitney Biennials. The \u201cAmerika\u201d paintings had their own show at the Dia Art Foundation in Chelsea.\n\nIn 1984, Mr. Rollins received grants to establish the Art and Knowledge workshop, an after-school project in a community center near I.S. 52, with students from other schools sometimes participating; attendance was predicated on maintaining a C average.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe gave up his teaching job in 1987, and the group moved to its first rented studio in 1989. A documentary, \u201cKids of Survival: The Art and Life of Tim Rollins + K.O.S.,\u201d directed by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine, was released in 1996 and won an Emmy.\n\nIn later years the group consisted of six longtime members: Mr. Abreu, his brother Jorge, Robert Branch, Ala Ebtekar, Ricardo Nelson Savinon and Benjamin Volta. They conducted workshops in schools across the country and around the world, with Mr. Rollins, collaborating with students to make paintings for exhibitions in local museums.\n\nMr. Rollins and K.O.S. were not without controversy. Some people in the art world accused him of being a white interloper using Hispanic and African-American youths as a publicity vehicle. When they left Mr. Gorney in 1991 for the Mary Boone Gallery in SoHo, the epicenter of hot \u201980s art stars, Mr. Rollins\u2019s more collectively minded friends accused him of selling out.\n\nIndeed, the group occupied a strange position: Their collaborative working method opposed the idea of art stardom and individual authorship, yet they were embraced by the art market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSometimes the issues were more personal. In an article in New York magazine in 1991, several former members of K.O.S. accused Mr. Rollins of being emotionally abusive, and of spending too much money on himself. Mr. Rollins said they were retaliating for being kicked out of K.O.S., and several current members defended him.\n\nMr. Rollins never married, although he had a long-term relationship with the singer Kate Pierson of the rock group the B-52\u2019s. He is survived by his mother; his brother, Ronny; and his sisters, Carlene and Cindy Rollins.\n\nMr. Rollins was highly motivated from an early age. He said that when he was about 5 he wrote a note to his parents: \u201cDear Mom and Dad, when I grow up I\u2019m going to be an artist, a teacher and a scientist.

Its people were desperately poor, typically diving for pearls in the summer and herding camels in the winter. For decades they lagged far behind their Saudi neighbors, who were in the midst of a heady oil boom. The ruling al-Thani family was riven by vicious internecine squabbles and periodic coups.\n\nThen, in 1971, Qatar struck gas.\n\nThe discovery of the world\u2019s largest gas field was initially a source of bitter disappointment. \u201cPeople hoped for oil,\u201d said Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah, a former energy minister. But by the 1990s, new technology allowed gas to be liquefied and exported in tanker ships.\n\nThe emir, Tamim\u2019s father, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, took a huge gamble. Ignoring naysayers, he poured $20 billion into a sprawling liquefaction plant at Ras Laffan, on Qatar\u2019s north coast, with help from the energy giant Exxon Mobil. Among the Exxon Mobil executives who helped develop the plant was Rex W. Tillerson, who is now secretary of state.\n\nThe bet paid off spectacularly. Gas boomed, and by 2010 Qatar accounted for 30 percent of the global market.\n\nSince then, Qatar\u2019s citizens, today numbering 300,000, have become very rich, very fast. Their average income of $125,000 is the highest in the world, over twice that of the United States or Saudi Arabia. The state cocoons them with free land, cushy jobs and American universities. Gleaming supercars and limousines cruise along Doha\u2019s palm-lined corniche. Poor Qataris are hard to find.\n\nThe metamorphosis was equally dramatic for the Thanis. Once the lords of a desolate peninsula of sand dunes and salt flats, they have become strutting sophisticates on the global stage: style icons who are celebrated in Vanity Fair and Vogue; art titans who splurge hundreds of millions on a C\u00e9zanne or a Gauguin; and media moguls who built Al Jazeera, the groundbreaking television network that helped fan the Arab Spring in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn June, Qatar\u2019s national colors lit up the Empire State Building, in which it owns a stake, a mark of its punchy ambition.\n\nBut Qatar\u2019s swagger is deeply contentious among its neighbors. In their reach for global influence, the Thanis have pursued ambidextrous, sometimes contradictory policies \u2014 preaching the virtues of peace, education and women\u2019s rights while bankrolling Islamist extremists in Syria and hosting the biggest United States military base in the Middle East.\n\nTo Saudi Arabia and the Emirates \u2014 and Bahrain and Egypt, who have joined them in the boycott \u2014 Qatar is a nation of vexatious meddlers, intoxicated by its own wealth, that needs to be cut down to size.\n\nThree dueling, headstrong royals are at the center of the dispute.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Mohammed, 32, is leading a campaign to overhaul and energize his stultified society, including with outlandish proposals such as a $500 billion city on the Red Sea run by robots. He has a staunch ally in Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, 56, the hawkish crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective ruler of the Emirates, who has built a formidable military and shares his Saudi counterpart\u2019s deep hostility toward Iran.\n\nBoth princes are arrayed against Tamim, the emir of Qatar. A towering man with a diplomatic mien, Tamim is in many respects a classic Gulf potentate: educated like his father at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in England, he has three wives and 10 children, and lives in several luxurious palaces in Doha, a futuristic city of glass towers and curling highways.\n\nHis rise to power in 2013, at the age of 33, offered a stark contrast with the gerontocracy of Saudi Arabia, where rulers clung to their thrones till reaching their deathbeds. And his easy manner belies a stubborn streak that his neighbors see as the mark of a dangerous gadfly.\n\nThe baroque feuding among the three leaders \u2014 a twisting tale of cyberespionage, propaganda salvos, palace intrigue and high-stakes desert hunts \u2014 is worthy of an ancient Gulf power drama. Played by rich men in flowing white robes known as thobes, it has been called the \u201cGame of Thobes.\u201d But it also represents a profound moment of reckoning for the glimmering city-states of the Gulf.\n\nHaving largely avoided the turmoil of the Arab Spring in 2011, they find themselves hurtling toward an uncertain new economic and political order. At the center of the tumult is Qatar, the Lilliputian contender that for years punched above its weight and is now thrust into the fight of its life.", "title": "Tiny, Wealthy Qatar Goes Its Own Way, and Pays for It", "authors": ["Declan Walsh"]}

As the 28-year-old woman said, \u201cI took my scarf off because I\u2019m tired of our government telling me what to do with my body.\u201d\n\nAnd some said this might just be the beginning. \u201cMy guess is that more of these protests will follow,\u201d said Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human rights activist. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that some women want to decide for themselves what to wear.\u201d\n\nThat remains to be seen, but the protests have already gained enough attention to provoke angry reactions in some quarters.\n\n\u201cThese protests are done by instigators, saboteurs and vandalists and anarchists,\u201d said one critic, Kazem Anbarlooie, the editor in chief of the hard-line newspaper Resalat. \u201cRecently our enemies were communists and liberals, now Americans are provoking masochists against us.\u201d\n\nThe first protest in December took place on a Wednesday and seemed connected to the White Wednesday campaign, an initiative by Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist and activist living in the United States. Ms. Alinejad has reached out to Iranian women on Persian-language satellite television and through social media, and via a website she runs called My Stealthy Freedom. On the website, women post images of themselves without head scarves, demanding an end to the compulsory head scarf law.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s protests some women waved white scarves, the symbol of Mrs. Alinejad\u2019s campaign.\n\nHard-liners say that foreign intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, have been nurturing protests in Iran, like those that broke out in 80 cities at the end of last year. Nearly 4,000 people were arrested and 25 died, according to official statistics. The hard-liners have not provided proof to back up their claims.\n\nThe Islamic head scarf, or hijab, is seen by Iranian ideologues as a pillar of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The law regarding the scarf has been enforced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a head scarf is obligatory for every woman in the country, even tourists and visiting foreign dignitaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile discriminatory Islamic divorce and inheritance laws pose problems for individual women, the head scarf is a highly public symbol of a set of personal rules imposed by Iran\u2019s clerical leaders, who decide what people can wear, what music they can listen to and what television programs and movies they get to see. Men are also the subject of clothing laws: They are forbidden to wear shorts in public.\n\nDuring the past decade, influenced by the rise of the internet, satellite television and cheap foreign travel, many Iranians have grown deeply resentful of rules that they can see for themselves are out of step with most of the rest of the world. Many have become relatively secular and feel increasingly unwelcome in the fixed-in-stone state version of Shiite Islam, and many have taken to flouting the rules whenever and wherever they feel free enough to do so.\n\nIn past years, the morality police zealously enforced the rules, arresting women and men who violated them. But under the current president, Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, those officers have largely been taken off the streets.\n\nTheir removal was a gesture to a radically changed society, but it was also a recognition that there were not enough enforcers available to control a society that resents and rejects the rules. Women without head scarves can be seen everywhere in Tehran, in their cars, in shopping centers and even on the street, but always with the scarves draped over their shoulders, as if they have only just slipped off.\n\nBut the public protests are different because they are a symbolic rejection of authority and a statement that some young women are apparently ready to emulate. \u201cI was working when I saw the image of another woman protesting on social media,\u201d the 28-year-old said in a telephone interview. She said she informed some friends and co-workers about her intentions.\n\n\u201cIf a lot of people do this, it will have more influence, I thought, so I went,\u201d she said. At Ferdowsi Square, one of the busiest places in Tehran, she used a tree branch to clamber on top of the utility box next to a traffic light.\n\n\u201c \u2018Good going,\u2019 \u201d she said many people shouted. \u201cAfter five or six minutes people urged me to step down.\u201d They did not have a problem with her protest, she said, but they had what they wanted. \u201cThey had taken enough pictures to put on social media,\u201d she said.", "title": "Tired of Their Veils, Some Iranian Women Stage Rare Protests", "authors": ["Thomas Erdbrink"]}

In a particularly bad time, Ms. Laurio used the Pinoy Ako Blog to come to her defense.\n\nA wave of online harassers, many of them openly from the armed forces, were attacking Ms. Ressa. Ms. Laurio publicly called on the military chief to rein in his troops, and published several posts about soldiers discussing Ms. Ressa\u2019s looks and whether they would have sex with her.\n\nThe military later apologized, and Ms. Ressa credited Ms. Laurio\u2019s blog for giving her \u201ca sense of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI realized that I had stopped defending myself, and here was someone I didn\u2019t know pointing out the horrors of what social media had become and the values it was rewarding,\u201d said Ms. Ressa, who has documented the weaponization of social media by Duterte loyalists.\n\nLong before she was dragged into the public eye, Ms. Laurio experienced one struggle after another.\n\nShe was orphaned at an early age: She was 10 when her mother died of appendicitis, she said, and her inconsolable father turned to alcohol and quickly followed suit. She was passed among a series of relatives, mostly on the central Philippine island of Masbate, until she turned 16, when she was officially adopted by an aunt.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many have also been struck by her courage since government officials identified her. In naming her one of its Filipinos of the Year, the Philippine Daily Inquirer said that Ms. Laurio \u201cstood out for her patriotic daring.\u201d\n\nIt has been difficult, though.

The Blackhawks\u2019 top goalie, the veteran All-Star Corey Crawford, remains sidelined and on injured reserve with an upper-body injury. The Blackhawks have declined to comment on Crawford\u2019s injury or a timetable for him to return. Several published reports this week indicated that Crawford could miss the remainder of the season, which could keep Glass in a N.H.L. uniform for the foreseeable future.\n\nSince being called up, Glass has maintained a day-to-day, businesslike approach and has avoided becoming awe-struck in a room full of superstars. The Blackhawks (22-17-6) have struggled in ways that predate their three Stanley Cup championships since 2010. They are currently not in playoff position.\n\nBut Glass\u2019s feel-good story has resonated around the N.H.L. and even more so within the confines of the Blackhawks\u2019 dressing room, where stars like Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews have become big-time Glass supporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty cool to have a front-row seat for it,\u201d Kane said.\n\nGlass was playing in Canada\u2019s Western Hockey League when the Ottawa Senators drafted him in 2004 with the 89th pick. From there he went to Charlotte of the East Coast Hockey League, then moved to Binghamton of the American Hockey League. In 2009 he signed with Barys Astana in Kazakhstan and headed to the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\nA world away from the N.H.L. rinks he aspired to play on, Glass discovered a passionate fan base and the opportunity to grow and develop in a place he could not even imagine living with his wife, Allie. Then his agent mentioned the possibility of continuing his career there. Glass\u2019s K.H.L. journey took him to Spartak Moscow, CSKA Moscow, Lada Togliatti, Novosibirsk Sibir and Dinamo Minsk.\n\nPhoto\n\nGlass landed on the Blackhawks\u2019 radar in 2014, when team officials were seeking a third goaltender to round out their system.

Glass later signed with the Blackhawks and was assigned to their A.H.L. team in Rockford, Ill., just 90 minutes outside Chicago.

Mr. Mnuchin on Thursday singled out wage increases at Walmart as a sign that Mr. Trump\u2019s policies were working. However, he declined to accept any blame for the store closings and expected layoffs that Walmart announced at its Sam\u2019s Club chain.\n\nMr. Mnuchin also dismissed questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns, which he has refused to release.

But the price of panels and batteries has continued to plummet. In the past few months, bids for new solar farms in Mexico and Saudi Arabia have produced the cheapest electrons ever generated on the planet, and Elon Musk (who seems an unbreakable alloy of Borlaugish wizardliness and Vogtian alarmism) has built (in less than 100 days) the world\u2019s largest battery, turning South Australia\u2019s abundant sun into a 24/7 source of power.\n\nThis analytical muddle doesn\u2019t matter greatly because Mann refuses to say which set of solutions he thinks holds most promise for the future. \u201cIn our internet era, there are entirely too many pundits shouting out advice,\u201d he writes, which seems inarguable. \u201cI believe I stand on firmer ground when I try to describe what I see around me than when I try to tell people what to do.\u201d Safer ground, anyway.\n\nHe confines what may be his most controversial points to a pair of appendixes, one on just how bad we can expect global warming to be, and the other in which he explains that the most reputable scientific bodies have by now agreed that genetically modified food is safe to eat. That\u2019s an important fact, but as he acknowledges, it doesn\u2019t satisfy critics\u2019 main objections to the technology: \u201cWhether the current version of industrial agriculture can, with the addition of new technologies, provide for a world of 10 billion in a long-lasting way \u2014 or if the perils involved (ecological, economic, spiritual) are large enough to require it to be radically revamped.\u201d\n\nThe great virtue of Mann\u2019s book \u2014 and much of his journalism over many years \u2014 is that it raises very large questions like these that are usually either ignored or answered in slogans.

And though some animals sleep through the worst of winter, some simply have no choice but to live through the frigid weather.\n\nWinter is not an easy time for most plants and animals; even in the best circumstances, it often means the grinding, slowing-down of existence. It often spells the end of weak or incapacitated individuals. So it may seem odd for winter\u2019s symbol, snow, to be a force of moderation. In the northeast, snow can be a surprising game changer for its smallest residents.\n\nOne of the miraculous, tiny creatures that remain active below the snow is a small, warm gray mammal, the meadow vole. Chief among its attributes, Microtus pennsylvanicus is cute. Measuring five to eight inches from the snout to the tip of a tail just a bit longer than a hamster\u2019s, they are pudgy, with short rounded ears, a rounded head, and though perpetually active, they\u2019re somehow not very mousy. They forage throughout the four seasons, and during warmer months can even be observed in broad daylight, scurrying through the matted vegetation in damp meadows and fields. Active night or day, they are driven by an enormous appetite and the ever-present need to feed their young. Locally, meadow voles may produce six or seven broods a year, which is handy for an animal at the bottom of the food chain.\n\nAlso handy for the meadow vole are the mysterious and contradictory insulating qualities of snow.\n\nThe white blanket that winter throws over the northeast is actually a fluffy, air-filled barrier between worse weather, and many plants and animals have learned to use it as a tool for survival. Though hardly balmy, temperatures beneath the snow rarely dip much below freezing. Just a few inches of powder is all the insulation necessary between brutal and tolerable.

There were a surprising number of free openings at Mar-a-Lago given all the cancellations by foundations and charities, but ever since an artist projected \u201cPay Trump Bribes Here\u201d on the Trump International Hotel in Washington, our conflicts committee suggested that hosting the dinner at Mar-a-Lago would be a bad idea.\n\nWe also figured holding the dinner in Florida would be convenient for so many of you moguls and machers already down here looking for real estate since the tax bill was signed into law. The other bonus of buying here, of course, is that your home is protected even if you file for bankruptcy.\n\nSitting at the dais are Mr. Trump along with the first lady. (Ivanka, Jared and the rest of the family were away on vacation.) Next to him are Rupert Murdoch and his new B.F.F., Robert Iger of the Walt Disney Company, who just gave up any hope of running for president in 2020, a condition of his deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox\u2019s assets. To their right are the chief negotiators for the tax plan: Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin (and Ms. Mnuchin\u2019s wife, Louise Linton, who I should mention \u2014 and I\u2019ll be sure to hashtag this on Instagram \u2014 is wearing a beautiful scarf from Hermes and gown by Valentino).", "title": "Toasts to the Deals (and Other Winners) of 2017", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-09 00:00:00", "text": "Filmmaker Gotham Chopra was granted sweeping access to Brady in an array of intimate settings that the inscrutable signal-caller would normally be loath to allow. There is extensive footage of Brady at his Brookline, Mass., home, with his children, with his wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, on family retreats to Costa Rica, on a bro-trip to Montana (with teammates Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola), on a summer tour of China with his son Jack, and in the car during Brady\u2019s commute to and from work in Foxborough, Mass.\n\nThe sequence of the Brady children singing along to Vance Joy\u2019s \u201cRiptide\u201d while dad drives home from the stadium after a November win over Miami is, to use the artistic term, rather precious.\n\nOne venue where Brady is barely seen: Gillette Stadium, or pretty much anywhere in the Patriots\u2019 facilities. For a player who has been the epitome of the Patriots team-first philosophy, Brady would seem an unlikely candidate to open such a close-up lens upon his off-field self, especially during the season \u2014 and especially for a project set to drop during the playoffs. A player not placing undue attention upon himself would constitute a first principle of Coach Bill Belichick\u2019s colorless \u201cDo Your Job\u201d collectivism. That is one of the many remarkable aspects of \u201cTom vs. Time.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if Brady has even told his coach about the project. The Patriots spokesman Stacey James said the team was nominally aware that a Brady documentary was in the works, and tried to be helpful in providing credentials on the few occasions Chopra sought access to home games. Beyond that, the answer of how much Brady\u2019s bosses were informed about \u201cTom vs. Time\u201d remains shrouded in some Patriot-esque mystery.\n\nThis takes on some added resonance in light of an ESPN report last week describing deep tensions between Brady and Belichick, the twin pillars of the N.F.L.\u2019s 21st Century dynasty. No doubt \u201cTom vs. Time\u201d could provide more grist for the distraction mill that N.F.L. teams avoid so strenuously, nowhere more so than Bunker Bill, this famously locked-down football enclave between Boston and Providence.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition, Belichick is almost completely absent in the series. His offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels, rather, is portrayed as Brady\u2019s ever-present coaching foil, making cameos via speakerphone (or video chat) as Brady pores through game film and brainstorms ideas for new plays for upcoming games.\n\nChopra, son of the prolific New Age author Deepak Chopra, grew up a Patriots fan in Lincoln, Mass. He spent several years working as a television journalist around the world before settling in Los Angeles, where he met Brady though mutual friends nearly a decade ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChopra had become interested in exploring the spiritual side of sports and competition, the deep connections drawn and emotions elicited around the games we play and watch. He had spoken from time to time with Brady about this, and for years had been trying to get him interested in some kind of film treatment around his obsessive relationship to football.\n\nAfter the odyssey of last season \u2014 with Brady\u2019s Deflategate suspension, his mother\u2019s battle with cancer and the Patriots\u2019 surreal comeback win in the Super Bowl \u2014 Brady finally agreed to participate in a film about his off-season training regimen.\n\n\u201cWe thought it would be fun to record what an off-season of training looks like for a 40-year-old athlete,\u201d said Brady, reached by email Monday night.\n\nThe off-season ended, but Chopra and his camera stuck around into the season. \u201cTom is not a sentimental guy, necessarily,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cBut I do think, as we talked, he was sort of discovering parts of himself. It\u2019s like therapy. It\u2019s the process of saying it and giving voice to it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the fifth installment (\u201cThe Spiritual Game\u201d), Brady ruminates on the karmic satisfactions he derives through sports.\n\n\u201cI do want to know the whys in life,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI do want to know why we\u2019re here, where we\u2019re going; trying to find that deeper purpose. To live it, through sports in a very authentic way, makes so much sense to me.\u201d\n\nLater in the fifth episode, Brady and B\u00fcndchen sit for a joint interview in which B\u00fcndchen, a Brazilian model, describes what it\u2019s like to have to share her husband with his \u201cfirst love,\u201d football. \u201cIt really is his main love,\u201d B\u00fcndchen says, going further. \u201cFrankly it\u2019s true.\u201d She mentions that when she and Brady first met, he said he only wanted to play 10 years and would have been happy to win one more Super Bowl. But of course, love dies hard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effortless because it\u2019s so synonymous with my being,\u201d Brady says of football. \u201cIn front of 70,000 people, I can be who I am. If I want to scream at somebody I can scream at somebody. I can be who I am in a very authentic way.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Brady says this, it\u2019s impossible not to extend the thought a beat further \u2014 and then he does so himself: \u201cThat is hard for me when I walk off the field.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the more fascinating scenes involves Brady\u2019s staring like a zombie at a computer screen, intense and serene. It is as if he is linked to the game film he is watching.\n\n\u201cI could literally watch football all day,\u201d Brady says. \u201cI could go four or five hours without getting up from this chair.\u201d He begins watching plays from what might be the most difficult loss of his career, the Giants\u2019 victory over the Patriots in the Super Bowl in 2008, New England\u2019s only loss that season.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re becoming a failure in front of everybody else,\u201d Brady says, using an odd second-person construction while reliving the dormant nightmare in real time. \u201cIt\u2019s a talent show you did when you were a kid. And you\u2019re a failure.\u201d\n\nGiven some of the events of this season \u2014 both around the league and with the Patriots \u2014 the first four and a half installments that were available for viewing by The New York Times contained some big elephants that go unmentioned to this point.\n\nThere is no discussion, for instance, of the player protests around the national anthem that dominated much of the early season. (President Trump, who ignited much of the discord around the protests, took every opportunity during the 2016 campaign to mention his close friendship with Brady.) Nor is there any mention of the midseason trade that sent Brady\u2019s backup and possible heir apparent Jimmy Garoppolo to the 49ers; or, for that matter, of Brady\u2019s polarizing \u201cbody coach,\u201d business partner and best friend, Alex Guerrero, who was reportedly told by Belichick that he was no longer permitted to work at the stadium.\n\n(There is no discussion of this friction surrounding Guerrero, though he appears several times in the film, mostly as we watch him put Brady through the so-called \u201cpliability\u201d treatments that the two men developed as the cornerstone of their sports training and lifestyle business, \u201cTB12\u201d.)\n\nChopra said he most likely would cover some of that material in the final installments, though much of it depends on the Patriots\u2019 playoff trajectory. \u201cThere\u2019s still some ground to cover and a lot of the story left to unfold,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook said the release date for the series is uncertain; it depends on when the Patriots\u2019 season ends. The team hosts Tennessee in a playoff game this weekend.\n\nAnother N.F.L. quarterback no longer alive in the playoffs steals one scene. Brady is at home being put through some massage by Guerrero when his oldest son, Jack, walks into the room. Jack tells his father about some N.F.L. fantasy or simulation game that he and a friend are engaged in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your quarterback,\u201d Brady asks.

Most of us get to grapple with that milestone before a limited and understanding audience.

He has been the most valuable player in four of them, and recently he was selected to his 13th Pro Bowl. But throughout another dominant N.F.L. season, which continues Saturday night with a divisional round playoff game against the Tennessee Titans, Brady has taken the poet Dylan Thomas to heart and refused to go gentle into that good night.\n\nWith the help of a book, a controversial side business and a new documentary series \u2014 coming soon to a smartphone near you \u2014 his midlife crisis is unfolding before packed stadiums, millions of television viewers and social media followers, and an eager news media horde.\n\nBrady\u2019s book, \u201cThe TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance,\u201d and his lifestyle website, tb12sports.com, purportedly offer inside looks at how Brady has done what he has done \u2014 a blend of so-called \u201cpliability\u201d exercises, nutritional bars, supplements and lots of water.

Tom has stayed in the background and let him Doug do what he needs to do.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCoughlin\u2019s penchant for precision and discipline are everywhere, including the focus on getting to meetings early and the way uniforms are worn. For a team that has had a reputation as one of the league\u2019s most undisciplined organizations, little things like that matter.\n\nAlthough Coughlin remains intense, he has also softened, particularly when it comes to trying to understand his players.\n\nThis was evident during the most crucial weekend of the 2017 N.F.L. season in late September. The crisis began on a Friday night, when President Donald J. Trump urged owners to fire players who refused to stand for the national anthem. The Jaguars were in London to play their annual game there. Waking up to the news overseas on Saturday, many players were aghast and eager to protest. Because of the time difference, the Jaguars and the Baltimore Ravens were going to be the first teams to play that weekend.\n\nShahid Khan, the Jacksonville owner, and his staff spent Saturday night discussing what to do but reached no conclusion. When they arrived at Wembley Stadium before the game, Khan met with Marrone and Coughlin. Coughlin, a big supporter of the military, might have had his own feelings on the matter, but he knew that whatever was decided, the players had to be on board.\n\n\u201cHe said that you have to understand where these players came from, their upbringing, and if you don\u2019t, the team will fall apart,\u201d Khan said of Coughlin.\n\nCoughlin wanted to go with Marrone to the locker room to meet with the players. But Marrone realized that would be unwieldy, so they invited the captains to speak with them in a small meeting room at the stadium. They ultimately decided that the entire team should lock arms on the sideline, and Khan joined them, a sight that set the tone for the rest of the league.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCoughlin and Marrone were too busy preparing for the Steelers to be interviewed for this article. But friends describe Coughlin\u2019s return to the city and the team that he built and, in some ways, never left \u2014 as a happy one. He never sold his house in Jacksonville, and continued to run his local charity, the Jay Fund, which helps families of cancer patients. (It is named for the former Boston College safety Jay McGillis, who played for Coughlin there and died of leukemia.)\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Coughlin left Jacksonville after the 2002 season, supporters said he was a scapegoat, and critics said he had worn out his welcome.\n\nSo it was after the 2015 season with his rocky exit from the Giants, with whom he won two titles but posted losing seasons the last three of his dozen years there. Nearing 70, he was eager to keep coaching, and his name surfaced as a candidate for some jobs. But he ended up spending the 2016 season behind a desk at N.F.L. headquarters working as an adviser, with an eye toward returning to a club.\n\n\u201cIt was more than an itch,\u201d Commissioner Roger Goodell said before the Jaguars\u2019 game against the Bills. \u201cI always knew he wanted to get back and help build a team and help build a championship team.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During the five full seasons after he bought the team for $760 million in 2011, the Jaguars won just 17 games, three fewer than the lowly Cleveland Browns. He fired Coach Gus Bradley in the final month of the season and wanted to keep Marrone, the interim coach. But Khan felt the team needed what he called \u201ca veteran presence\u201d to guide both the coach and general manager to lift the franchise out of the doldrums.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be someone random, but someone who had the passion and had the Jaguars blood that went through their veins,\u201d Khan said. \u201cTom Coughlin was the ideal candidate, and he was available and he was looking for a position.\u201d\n\nCoughlin, he said, wanted to coach, so he took his time considering the offer before taking it. Although one can imagine that Coughlin wanted to prove to the Giants that he could still win, friends of his say that he was not driven by spite.\n\n\u201cHe left the Giants reluctantly; I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a secret,\u201d said Ernie Bono Sr., a close friend who helped Coughlin establish the Jay Fund. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the retiring type. He doesn\u2019t care about showing anyone up. He told me he felt for the Giants when they were losing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, having a former coach oversee a current coach and general manager can be tricky. If he takes too heavy a hand and creates tension, an insecure coach may feel the boss is trying to undermine him and take over. Some recent examples \u2014 Mike Holmgren in Cleveland and Bill Parcells in Miami \u2014 did not last long.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKhan was aware of these potential pitfalls, so he asked Coughlin which coaches he would want to work with. Coughlin named two, the first being Marrone. Khan, who did not tell Coughlin beforehand that he intended to keep Marrone, had his man.\n\nCoughlin and Marrone have a long history that centers on Syracuse, where they each played and coached. Nearly 20 years younger than his boss, Marrone sees Coughlin as a mentor, not a threat. He shares his game plans with Coughlin, who attends practices and will pull players aside to deliver instruction.\n\nCommenting on Coughlin after the regular-season finale, Marrone said he had learned more in the past year from his boss than ever, on topics including running a practice, scheduling and dealing with players.\n\n\u201cI talk to him more than I talk to my wife,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can see his fingerprints all over the team,\u201d said Jay Feely, a former kicker for Coughlin\u2019s Giants and who is now an analyst for CBS Sports. \u201cHe deflects all credit from himself. But if you\u2019re truthful, you\u2019d say he deserves a lot of credit\u201d for turning the team around.\n\nIn Week 5, the Jaguars beat the Steelers, 30-9, in Pittsburgh. They intercepted quarterback Ben Roethlisberger five times, returning two of the picks for touchdowns. The rookie running back Leonard Fournette, a big, physical presence, ran for 181 yards and two scores. Fournette has become an emblem of Jacksonville\u2019s bruising offense, a Coughlin trademark.\n\nThe temperature will be a lot colder this Sunday, something that could favor the home team. But if the Jaguars upset the Steelers, Coughlin will no doubt celebrate, but quietly \u2014 again.\n\nFor at least another weekend, the Jaguars, too.", "title": "Tom Coughlin\u2019s Return Coincides With Jacksonville\u2019s Revival", "authors": ["Ken Belson"]}

Just to avoid confusion. She put her hands on mine. Her nails are unicorn purple with glitter particles that she swears are not fake (which, I don\u2019t know) and they are unchipped the way they need to be when you are chopping wood one day and promoting a movie the next. \u201cYou have to say Tonya Harding,\u201d she said.

We had met earlier in the day at an ice rink in Vancouver that shares a building with a megachurch.

Ms. Manary liked her instantly when they met in 2010, and made a conscious decision not to Google her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to refresh myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to learn from her perspective.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Harding swiped on her lipstick perfectly without a mirror: one coat of Wet n Wild 523B (Light Berry Frost) covered by a layer of Wet n Wild 530D (Dark Pink Frost). She laced up her tiny Harlick skate boots that she had painted pantyhose beige, which were attached to gold-plated MK Vantage blades, and put stirrups over her leggings and beneath the blades so that her lines would look longer and she would look taller.

Has anyone ever said screw it all and flipped on the Tone L\u014dc and just gone for it like she did? Has anyone ever made skating look so fun?\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Harding skates sometimes, but not as much as she used to. What would be the point? Her ban by the U.S.F.S.A. as a skater and a coach should leave her open to professional skating \u2014 say like in an exhibition or the Ice Capades \u2014 but \u201cbecause everything is owned by the association,\u201d she said, there are very few corners of it in which she can still meaningfully participate. Say she taught young skaters for $50 an hour at the rink, she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to bring them to competition, so, again, what\u2019s the point?\n\nWhen she got the call from Mr. Rogers, she\u2019d been doing fine. She could take care of herself. She had other skills. She\u2019d worked as a welder, a painter at a metal fabrication company, a hardware sales clerk at Sears, where every day some guy would ask if there was a man who could help him, and every day she\u2019d school that guy on how much more she knows about tools than just about anyone. She faced Paula Jones in a celebrity boxing bout in 2002, and started an unremarkable boxing career in earnest in 2003. But she wasn\u2019t a great fighter, and she didn\u2019t like it very much, either. She never bought the idea that hitting something could help you work out aggression. They told her, \u201cPretend it\u2019s someone else\u2019s face.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t, so what\u2019s the point?\n\nShe married and had her boy, who changed her life by refocusing her attention on someone who wasn\u2019t her. She and her husband would spend hours hunting together, just as she used to do with her beloved father \u2014 Mr. Price with a muzzleloader and Ms. Harding with a bow and arrow because she wanted \u201cto give the animal a 50-50 chance to make it interesting and fair\u201d (and also because felons aren\u2019t technically supposed to possess guns in Washington State). Do you know how good of an archer she is? She says she has successfully done no fewer than eight Robin Hoods \u2014 shooting an arrow that splits another arrow, which itself was already in a bull\u2019s-eye, 30 yards away \u2014 and that\u2019s nothing compared to her fishing skills. (But she doesn\u2019t want to elaborate. \u201cSome people,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you eat a carrot you\u2019re killing it.\u201d) Also, she can build anything. She can fix anything. She had a life. It was going fine. She had made some kind of peace with the idea that she\u2019d never really be understood.\n\n\u201cI, TONYA,\u201d which is based on hours of interviews with Ms. Harding and her ex-husband, honors its feisty subject by showing not just the abuse she endured, but how she fought back. It gives added context to the scandal for which she is now principally known. It even posits new information: The paper that the F.B.I. found in a Dumpster that showed Ms. Kerrigan\u2019s practice location and schedule in Ms. Harding\u2019s handwriting supposedly existed in order to help her co-conspirators locate where to send threatening letters. (Ms. Harding has maintained that she did not help plan the physical attack on Ms. Kerrigan; no word on why you\u2019d need practice times in order to send letters.)\n\nVideo\n\nThe story is told in the tone in which Ms. Harding speaks, and there are scenes in it you\u2019ve seen a hundred times before in Lifetime movies: a young girl being hit by her mother, a young wife being hit by her husband \u2014 that aren\u2019t portrayed as tragic as much as a particular kind of wide-eyed Oregon gothic. The film has been generally well-received and on Sunday Allison Janney won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Ms. Harding\u2019s mother. But there have also been reviews (including in this paper) that wonder if the protagonist is a punching bag for cheap laughs and classism.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the record, Ms. Harding loved the movie. \u201cMagnificent,\u201d was her word, especially after she\u2019d seen it a few times. You have to remember, that was her life. That those beatings were very specifically hers, not composite beatings. And that they weren\u2019t even shown in full: \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand that what you guys see in the movie is nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the smallest little bits and pieces. I mean, my face was bruised. My face was put through a mirror, not just broken onto it. Through it. I was shot. That was true.\u201d Mr. Gillooly, er, Stone shot at the ground, she said, and it ricocheted onto her face. (He has denied this and other abuse.) She said her mother threw a knife at her. (Her mother has also denied allegations made by Ms. Harding.) But \u201cthat\u2019s all true,\u201d she said. The people charged with taking care of her didn\u2019t.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo she watched it a few times, and the shock wore off, and there from the comfort of her living room, sitting beside the only romantic partner she has ever felt loved by and safe with, she watched what had happened in her life and realized that she never really stood a chance.\n\nWhich is not to say that the movie is totally accurate. As I said, there are some things she would like to clear up. Such as:\n\nFirst, because of the way it\u2019s edited, it makes it look as though she hunted for rabbits and that is how she got her fur coat. Not true. She bought that coat. She loves fur coats and has two now, one of them a mink that she would like to wear to the premieres but the last thing she needs is those carrot-rights people telling her she\u2019s a monster for wearing mink.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She wants you to know she does not. \u201cTrust me I don\u2019t say the word [expletive] 120 times a day. That might come out once in a while when something really bad happens or I hurt myself. I mean, the movie portrayed me as this person who cussed every 10 seconds and I don\u2019t cuss like that.\u201d There\u2019s a scene in the movie in which she confronts a table of judges about her low scores despite a stellar performance. In it, she gets frustrated and gives them an obscene directive involving male anatomy. Never happened, she said. \u201cI would never say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not go to the judges on the ice and talk to them like that in front of everyone. When I spoke to the judges they were in the back hallway room telling me you need to have better dresses. I go, \u2018Well if you can find me $5,000 to make me a dress then I\u2019ll wear it and I won\u2019t have to sew these anymore.\u2019 I go, \u2018You know what? Out of my face!\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it? I asked. That\u2019s it, she confirmed. Those are her only objections. Which was confusing, because the movie doesn\u2019t vindicate her by a long shot. It presents both sides of the story, both her and her ex-husband\u2019s, and neither comes across looking particularly innocent. Nothing else you want to clear up? I asked.\n\nOn a couch at 38 Below, she leaned back, frustrated, made her hands into fists and rubbed her eyes. It\u2019s exhausting. Nobody ever gets it. She\u2019s been waiting for a way to tell the world that the abuse she endured was so much worse than they thought, that she was so much poorer than people could imagine. And then all people want to know is whether or not there\u2019s something she\u2019s not admitting to.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe reason she loves the movie is because it conveys something she doesn\u2019t feel was ever conveyed before. There were mitigating circumstances. Her life was terrible. She was beaten. She was threatened. You don\u2019t get this way unless you were counted out completely. Her own mother didn\u2019t seem to love her. The only time in her life she ever got anywhere was when she circumvented the rules and took for herself what appeared to be given to the Nancy Kerrigans of the world. Ms. Kerrigan was from a working-class family too, but she was loved. Her parents drove her to practices and cheered for her and cried with joy. She had Vera Wang skating outfits! Tonya had nothing. She had costumes that her mother made with sequins everywhere so that her thighs got cut up; then she had to make them herself, earning point deductions for the quality. She danced to ZZ Top while the others were dancing to Mozart. They had trainers and dietitians and Tonya was eating broccoli and cheese from the Spud City where she worked at the mall. She had asthma. She had muscles.\n\n\u201cI was always told I was fat. I was ugly. I wouldn\u2019t amount to anything. \u2018If you don\u2019t smile and follow through they\u2019re not going to give you the marks. If you wear that ribbon they\u2019re not going to give you the marks. If you wear that dress they\u2019re not going to give you the marks.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis has nothing to do with exoneration; it hasn\u2019t for a long time. Her side of the story is not about guilt or innocence \u2014 the discussion over guilt and innocence ended right about the time she completed her community service, as far as she\u2019s concerned \u2014 but about the finer points of being Tonya Harding: respect, mitigating circumstances, how we treat people and what we expect from them in the first place.", "title": "Tonya Harding Would Like Her Apology Now", "authors": ["Taffy Brodesser-Akner"]}

The competition may be more or less open, the candidates more or less exciting, the outcome more or less uncertain, but electing a head of state usually captures a nation\u2019s attention. These days in Moscow, though, with glitzy \u201c2018\u201d signs illuminating the city center, you would be forgiven for thinking that the soccer World Cup, hosted by Russia, is the event to watch this year.\n\nVladimir V. Putin is so used to presidential elections that he almost forgot to announce his candidacy for the next one. On Dec. 6, he finally confirmed that he would run for a fourth term on March 18 \u2014 incidentally, the fourth anniversary of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. Since his approval ratings hover around 80 percent, that puts him on course to be in office until 2024. By then, he will have been in power for 24 years. No wonder he is running as an independent candidate this time: President Putin does not need a party to support him \u2014 he just needs to run as President Putin. His legitimacy stems from holding power since the day the millennium was born.\n\nAmong pollsters, \u201capathy\u201d is the word that best describes voter sentiment. Journalists noted that the president himself looked slightly bored during his annual news conference on Dec. 15, even though he kept it going for 3 hours 40 minutes. His first term was dedicated to restoring order in Russia\u2019s post-Yeltsin chaos. The second term focused on the economy. During his third term, Mr. Putin made Russia great again \u2014 abroad. So far, mystery surrounds his next goal. No electoral slogans, no major campaign theme. If the candidate has a big idea for his fourth term, he is keeping it to himself.\n\nThat makes the real question what will happen not on March 19 but in 2024. The idea of post-Putinism is emerging slowly as an object of political study. The Constitution does not allow a president to run for more than two consecutive terms, and Mr. Putin has already used the stratagem of switching with his prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, from 2008 to 2012. He is on record saying that he will not change the Constitution to stay indefinitely in power.", "title": "Opinion | Training Early for Post-Putin Politics", "authors": []}

But perhaps my favorite \u201csubway read\u201d to date is James Ellroy\u2019s \u201cL.A. Confidential,\u201d which is even more sprawling, sordid and satisfying than its film adaptation.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, had repeatedly asserted that the tax bill would pay for itself and that Treasury staff were working on a detailed analysis of the plan\u2019s costs that would bear out that assertion.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not provide that analysis before the Senate voted on the tax bill and did not provide Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, a promised analysis showing the tax plan would not add to the federal deficit. The lack of the analysis raised questions whether Treasury\u2019s team of tax experts could really back up Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s claims that the tax bill would not balloon the deficit.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear whether the Department\u2019s involvement in the tax legislating process in 2017 has been any more or less \u2018political\u2019 than it has been in past years,\u201d Rich Delmar, the counsel to the inspector general, wrote in a report outlining its findings. \u201cI do not see a basis to conclude that the process employed by Treasury this past year was contrary to law, an abuse of authority or otherwise improper.\u201d", "title": "Treasury Inspector General Finds No Political Meddling in Tax Analysis", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "D.B.: Can you say more about Diego?\n\nN.B.H.: Diego had growth failure, but he also had asthma, eczema and behavior problems. The frame shift for me was instead of doing the standard treatment for each of his four diagnoses, I asked, \u201cIs it possible that the trauma that he\u2019s been exposed to could be the underlying cause of all these problems?\u201d When I consulted hormone specialists, I was told that\u2019s likely the case. O.K., well, then, the thing we need to treat is the trauma.\n\nThat\u2019s when I began diving into the research literature. In 2008, I came across the ACE Study, which had been published in 1998. I was absolutely shocked that I had never heard about it and that as a doctor I was never trained on it. And so for me that began a mission to translate the science into something useful for patients.\n\nD.B.: What needs to happen?\n\nN.B.H.: No. 1, universal screening. The best tools we have right now are early detection and prevention. Studies show that when kids received early high quality intervention, their brain scans ended up looking more like those of children who had never been maltreated than children who had been maltreated. Ultimately, every pediatrician in America needs to be screening for ACEs.\n\nD.B.: How do you make screening doable?\n\nN.B.H.: At our center, we screen for the number of ACEs, but we don\u2019t ask folks to identify each individual one. We recognize that these are sensitive questions to ask in a clinical setting. But we need to screen the entire population, and the only way to screen everyone is in primary care. If you\u2019re waiting until you get to a mental health practitioner, you\u2019re going to be too late, and a lot of kids will be missed. Our screening can be done in three minutes or less. It\u2019s quick to interpret. A doctor can look at it and say this child is at low risk, moderate risk or high risk of having a toxic stress physiology. For me it\u2019s no different than laying a stethoscope on a patient\u2019s chest.\n\nD.B.: What are the treatment implications?\n\nN.B.H.: One of the key ingredients for keeping the body\u2019s stress response out of the toxic stress zone is the presence of a healthy buffering caregiver. So we need to educate parents and caregivers about the impact a child\u2019s environment and exposures may be having on their health. We also know that if a caregiver is able to self-regulate, their kids have much better outcomes. Good old-fashioned mental health care really does help. In research studies, certain types of interventions, including child-parent psychotherapy, can help to normalize cortisol levels and get the body\u2019s stress response back on track. We designed our services at the Center for Youth Wellness with this science in mind. We provide mental health and wellness services to either the child or the parent. It\u2019s really important that we do this two-generational work.\n\nD.B.: What else is helpful?\n\nN.B.H.: The six core pieces that are key to addressing the biology of toxic stress are sleep, exercise, nutrition, mindfulness, mental health and healthy relationships. Certain diets support a healthy immune system and neuroplasticity. And when you exercise, it helps to metabolize stress hormones and release other hormones that counteract effects of stress and also support cardiovascular health and reduce chronic inflammation.\n\nD.B.: What social problems can this science help us understand better?\n\nN.B.H.: Substance dependence: An individual with four or more ACEs is 10 times more likely to be an IV drug user as someone with no ACEs. Education and underperforming schools is a big one: When we did a chart review of 702 patients, we found that if a child had an ACE score of 4 or more, they were 32.6 times more likely to have learning or behavior problems. The justice system: When you look at the proportions of folks in our jails who have high adversity, especially our juvenile incarcerated population, we\u2019re talking about greater than 90 percent.", "title": "Opinion | Treating the Lifelong Harm of Childhood Trauma", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cIn doing the healing work, you look at what the patient\u2019s support systems are, \u201c said Priscilla Dass-Brailsford, a trauma psychologist and an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry at Georgetown University. \u201cThe biggest supports are parents and family. These kids don\u2019t have that. The parents were the aggressors.\u201d\n\nExperts interviewed for this article, who underscored that they had no direct knowledge of the California case, said that because the siblings\u2019 primal assurance of unconditional love and safety had been ripped away, they would almost certainly struggle to trust and attach to future supportive figures.\n\n\u201cThe notion that this was done by parents increases a child\u2019s helplessness and hopelessness,\u201d said Nora J. Baladerian, a Los Angeles psychologist who often treats traumatized individuals.\n\nDr. Dass-Brailsford compared the 13 siblings\u2019 situation to that of prisoners of war, who have been deprived of food, freedom and sufficient nurturing.\n\n\u201cOne glimmer of hope is that they did not go through this alone,\u201d she said. \u201cPrisoners of war are isolated as part of their torture. These children at least had each other.\u201d\n\nBefore formal therapy can begin, the siblings must be placed in a safe, nurturing environment where kind treatment will be a positive constant they can rely upon, experts said. They added that keeping as many siblings together as possible would be important, to sustain their bonds.\n\nPhoto\n\nDaniel L. Davis, a forensic psychologist in Columbus, Ohio who has treated victims and perpetrators and evaluates children for juvenile court, said that there is not one behavioral model that adequately describes a typical parent perpetrator.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere are risk factors, certainly,\u201d he said. A list might include a prior history of abuse, domestic violence, and a cluster of personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Such people, he said, might be overly emotional, unpredictable, manipulative and exploitative.\n\nBut like other trauma experts, Dr. Davis emphasized that children can be remarkably resilient. He treated an elementary school-age boy whose parents had kept him locked away for such a long period that the child showed significant developmental delays. \u201cBut with intensive treatment and real effort by a support team, his growth was impressive,\u201d said Dr. Davis. \u201cHis parents were sent to prison.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A documentary \u201cThe Wolfpack\u201d tells the story of seven siblings isolated in a Lower East Side apartment by their father. In 2015, three siblings were found locked by their parents in a urine-and-feces infested room in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. That same year, a teenage girl in Murfreesboro, Tenn., was also discovered having been locked in her bedroom for months by her parents, who had allowed her three siblings to travel at will.\n\nDr. Davis said that while poverty is an element in many cases, it is certainly not a signature characteristic; indeed in the California case, the family lived in a middle-class neighborhood and the father, David Allen Turpin, had reportedly once been employed as an engineer. But poverty-afflicted situations may come to light more often, Dr. Davis noted, \u201cbecause the perpetrators don\u2019t have the resources to keep shielding from public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nFormal treatment begins after children are placed in a secure home and assessed for trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder. They may be unwilling or unable to describe their experience. Nightmares may roil them. The slightest trigger \u2014 the rattle of keys, for example \u2014 might send them into a hysterical tantrum. They may seem hyper-aroused or vigilant, ever alert and cringing, braced to flee or fight. Younger children may act out the trauma as they play; for others, the emotional pain may be so overwhelming that they seem numb.\n\n\u201cBut the majority of these children can bounce back, \u201c said Anthony P. Mannarino, director of the Center for Traumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019ll forget it but they can find a way to go forward.\u201d\n\nDr. Mannarino is a co-developer of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The typical treatment, he said, is 12 to 16 sessions.\n\nFirst, a therapist works with a child to manage terrifying thoughts and feelings about the experience. Next a therapist helps the child gradually discuss the trauma.\n\n\u201cThose memories are really scary,\u201d Dr. Mannarino said. \u201dMaybe the parents said, \u2018You deserve what you\u2019re getting, it\u2019s your fault,\u2019 and the child may have internalized shame. Helping them talk and processing that distortion gives them a chance to understand that they are not to blame.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinally, TF-CBT involves the child\u2019s new caregivers. \u201cWe work with them to understand that the child\u2019s behavior expresses what happened to the child, as opposed to who they really are,\u201d said Dr. Mannarino.\n\nOf numerous therapies developed to address traumatized patients, TF-CBT is one of the most studied. In a 2004 randomized, multisite study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 203 children between eight and 14 who had symptoms of PTSD related to sex abuse, and their caretakers, were randomly assigned to TF-CBT or \u201cchild-centered\u201d therapy \u2014 a talk therapy model often use in rape-crisis or sex-abuse treatment centers. TF-CBT patients showed significantly more improvement in markers such as PTSD, depression and behavior.\n\nDr. Baladerian hoped that not only would the California family receive sufficient services, but that \u201cthe attention will also help other victims whose cases might not have been attended to with such alacrity.\u201d", "title": "Treatment Offers Hope for Imprisoned California Siblings", "authors": ["Jan Hoffman"]}

Most recently, he was the executive editor of HuffPost, a job he left in December, when he said he planned to start a nonprofit news site.\n\nDuring his last stint at the tabloid, Mr. Rich, 46, distinguished himself with attention-grabbing headlines that excoriated Republican leaders. After Donald J. Trump won the New Hampshire primary during the 2016 presidential campaign, for instance, the Daily News front page included an image of the candidate in clown makeup with the headline \u201cDawn of the Brain Dead \u2014 Trump comes back to life with N.H. win.\u201d\n\nMr. Rich, whose departure from the Daily News in 2016 shocked staff members, will take over for Arthur Browne, who retired at the end of December.\n\nIn a statement announcing the changes, Justin C.

Zuckerman, recently suspended its managing editor, Rob Moore, and its Sunday editor, Alexander Jones, because of sexual harassment allegations made against them by current and former employees.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt The Times, Ross Levinsohn, who was named publisher in August, was put on leave after National Public Radio published an article that detailed sexual harassment allegations made against him while he worked at other companies. On the same day, the newsroom announced that it had voted to unionize by an overwhelming margin \u2014 a move that followed years of discontent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTronc vetted Mr. Levinsohn, a former Yahoo executive, before he was hired as The Times\u2019s publisher, but company executives were not aware that he had twice been a defendant in sexual harassment lawsuits while employed by other companies, according to two people briefed on the matter who were not permitted to speak publicly about it.\n\nThe fallout from the N.P.R. report on the allegations against Mr. Levinsohn, which was published Jan. 18, reached beyond Tronc on Monday, when Tribune Media disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mr. Levinsohn had notified the company last week that he was taking leave from its corporate board. (Tribune Media and Tronc, formerly called Tribune Publishing, had been one corporation, Tribune Company, before a spinoff of the newspaper business in 2014.)\n\nMr. Kirk joined Tronc in August and became a jack-of-all-trades for the company, serving as the interim executive editor of The Times and the interim editor in chief of The Daily News. His new appointment was largely met with a sense of relief within the Times newsroom but also a recognition that his appointment will not undo years of frustration among employees or rid the paper of its underlying financial challenges.\n\nThe man he replaced, Mr. D\u2019Vorkin, faced suspicion in the newsroom almost from his arrival, partly because of his previous role at Forbes, where he broadened the company\u2019s native advertising offerings and introduced a product that allowed advertisers to contribute material alongside Forbes articles. Newsroom skeptics feared that he would focus more on clicks and advertising innovations than quality journalism.\n\nTronc executives decided to move Mr. D\u2019Vorkin, 65, out of the top newsroom job at a time when they were also revisiting a companywide reorganization plan, according to two company officials briefed on the discussions.

Mr. Levinsohn, the publisher now on leave, was a main architect of the restructuring plan. But the plan is now in flux, according to the two people.\n\nMr. Levinsohn\u2019s leave came at the end of an aggressive attempt by Times management to thwart the newsroom\u2019s ultimately successful union drive \u2014 a campaign that occurred as the paper\u2019s editors and reporters were distinguishing themselves with aggressive coverage of sexual harassment in Hollywood and natural disasters in California.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Critics of the rule \u2014 including Ben Carson, before he became HUD secretary \u2014 argue that it amounts to an aggressive intrusion by the federal government into some of the most intimate decisions local citizens and communities make: about where to live, who lives next door and how to design their neighborhoods. Since joining the agency, Mr. Carson has said that he wants to \u201creinterpret\u201d the rule.\n\nHUD\u2019s notice argues that a delay is necessary because local communities need more technical assistance from the agency and have struggled to figure out how to measure their progress toward affirming fair housing. The agency notes that among the first 49 assessments submitted, about a third were initially returned by HUD as unacceptable. But the system was designed to include that kind of back and forth, former HUD officials said.\n\nSara Pratt, a former deputy assistant secretary for fair housing at the agency, said HUD had provided consultants and a hotline that jurisdictions could call for help. Many of the communities that fell short on their assessments had simply failed to follow HUD\u2019s road map, said Ms. Pratt, who left the department in November 2015 and now works as a civil rights lawyer in private practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a teacher in a classroom saying, \u2018Too many people aren\u2019t passing the test, so I\u2019m just going to change the test,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nWhat worries her most, she said, is that HUD will allow cities to revert to prior standards for assessing fair housing.

The original language of the law also required communities to \u201caffirmatively further\u201d fair housing \u2014 to, in effect, promote desegregation in addition to prohibiting discrimination.\n\nThe federal government never fully enforced that element of the law, however. And 50 years after the Fair Housing Act was passed, many communities have made little progress toward desegregation, while some programs funded with federal support have had the effect of reinforcing segregation.\n\nThe 2015 rule \u2014 the \u201caffirmatively furthering fair housing rule\u201d \u2014 required communities to analyze policies that contribute to segregation. These might include locating low-income housing projects only in black neighborhoods, or barring multifamily housing from neighborhoods with good schools. The rule broadly required analysis of housing opportunities available not just to minorities, but also to the disabled, the poor and other disadvantaged groups.\n\nThe new HUD notice reiterates that local communities still have a legal obligation to further fair housing, and to pledge that they\u2019re doing so. But a reversion to the policies in place before the 2015 rule makes critics fear that the government will go back to a time when it turned a blind eye to segregation, giving taxpayer dollars to communities actively thwarting a central goal of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n\u201cIt says \u2018segregate as usual,\u2019 \u201d said Myron Orfield, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe 2015 rule was imperfect, he said, but it also amounted to the federal government\u2019s first major effort to strengthen civil rights around housing since the Lyndon Johnson era.\n\n\u201cResidential segregation is at the heart of racial inequality in the country,\u201d Mr. Orfield said. \u201cAll of the disparities in the U.S. \u2014 in education, in income, wealth, employment, health \u2014 between the races are all fundamentally linked to residential segregation.

He made them during a discussion of an emerging bipartisan deal to give legal status to immigrants illegally brought to the United States as children, those with knowledge of the conversation said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump heard that Haitians were among those who would benefit from the proposed deal, he asked whether they could be left out of the plan, asking, \u201cWhy do we want people from Haiti here?\u201d\n\nThe comments were reminiscent of ones the president made last year in an Oval Office meeting with cabinet officials and administration aides, during which he complained about admitting Haitians to the country, saying that they all had AIDS, as well as Nigerians, who he said would never go back to their \u201chuts,\u201d according to officials who heard the statements in person or were briefed on the remarks by people who had.

The 90-minute session \u2014 more than half of which played out on national television \u2014 appeared to produce some progress: Mr. Trump agreed to a framework for a short-term immigration deal to couple protection for young, undocumented immigrants with border security.\n\nBut in suggesting that a broader immigration measure was possible next, Mr. Trump was giving a rare public glimpse of an impulse he has expressed privately to advisers and lawmakers \u2014 the desire to preside over a more far-reaching solution to the status of the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living and working in the United States. Passage of a comprehensive immigration law would give Mr. Trump success where Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush failed.\n\nThe push for an immigration deal with Democrats has the potential to alienate the hard-line anti-immigration activists who powered his political rise and helped him win the presidency, many of whom have described it as amnesty for lawbreakers.

Liebman, a former chairwoman of the labor board. \u201cBut this was so sweeping and so fast that it was just kind of startling.\u201d\n\nThat same month, the agency overturned a key Obama-era ruling that had made it easier to hold companies responsible for labor-law violations at companies they do business with, such as franchisees and contractors.\n\nMr. Robb came to his position after a career largely spent representing management, including handling part of the Reagan administration\u2019s litigation against the air traffic controllers\u2019 union that waged an illegal strike in 1981. Most labor historians say the government\u2019s hard line in firing the controllers contributed to organized labor\u2019s decline in subsequent decades, said Joseph A. McCartin, a history professor at Georgetown University.\n\nThe labor board\u2019s general counsel is confirmed by the Senate. The counsel has independent authority as a prosecutor, derived from the National Labor Relations Act, and performs other duties on behalf of the agency\u2019s board, which acts as its highest court of appeals.\n\nDemoting the regional directors \u2014 there are 26, including two vacancies \u2014 and inserting a new group above them would most likely require board approval. The regional directors\u2019 account suggested that the new officials would probably be civil servants as well, rather than political appointees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichael J. Lotito, a lawyer with the management-side firm Littler Mendelson, who has discussed the proposal with officials at the agency, said they had assured him that it was largely a response to budget cuts reflecting a significant decline over several decades in the number of labor charges filed.\n\nHe said some of the savings could come from staff reductions among managers and supervisors at the regional offices, achieved in part through attrition.\n\nThe agency itself said that \u201cgiven budgetary issues, the general counsel is assessing the current organizational structure for possible changes,\u201d but added, \u201cNo specific plan involving the restructuring of our organization has been developed.\u201d\n\nMr. Robb\u2019s proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg Law.\n\nLabor advocates and even management-side lawyers often praise the professionalism of the regional directors, but critics consider them too sympathetic to workers and unions.\n\n\u201cSome are way more ideologically pro-union than others, but they all tend to be fairly ideological,\u201d Mr. Lotito said. \u201cThe agency tends to promote \u2014 I think that it should \u2014 individuals who want to protect the rights of employees.

In one case, a top climate policy official was reassigned to the office that collects royalty payments from oil and gas companies. He quit not long after.\n\nAccording to the N.L.R.B. regional directors\u2019 letter, Mr. Robb said on the conference call on Jan. 11 that the changes were necessary and independent of budget considerations \u2014 implying a lack of confidence in the directors\u2019 ability to investigate and adjudicate allegations of labor-rights violations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Robb, according to the letter, said the agency might hire a handful of district directors, each with authority over a portion of its 26 regions, and proposed lowering the regional directors\u2019 rank within the Civil Service.\n\nThe letter expressed concerns that Mr. Robb was intent on \u201cremoving many of the core responsibilities of the sitting regional directors,\u201d though it acknowledged that it was unclear how much authority he intended to shift to district directors, how many there would be, and whether any regional offices would be closed or consolidated.\n\nMr. Lotito, the management lawyer who has discussed the concept with agency officials, said the idea was to keep most or all of the regional offices in place and allow management and labor to appeal decisions to the district directors.\n\n\u201cThe regional directors are their own fiefdoms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was an ability to go to a district director, who oversees eight regions, chances are that would drive consistency.\u201d\n\nLike the civil servants who were reassigned at the Interior Department, the regional directors at the labor board are members of the Senior Executive Service, which was established by Congress in the late 1970s as an elite corps of executives who could be deployed to tackle the government\u2019s thorniest challenges.\n\nConservatives and some nonpartisan experts have complained that members of the Senior Executive Service are far less mobile than Congress envisioned, burrowing into particular agencies.\n\nBy proposing to downgrade the regional director positions into the ranks of standard government workers, where they would make less money and have narrower authority, Mr. Robb in some respects proposed going further than Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who reassigned Senior Executive Service members but preserved their status.\n\nThe changes proposed by Mr. Robb \u201cwould have a severe and negative impact on our agency and our stakeholders,\u201d the directors wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWilliam Valdez, president of the association representing the senior executives, said the labor board could eliminate such positions, making the regional directors eligible for comparable jobs elsewhere in government, but could not demote them en masse. As a practical matter, he said, many of the regional directors may choose to reapply for their jobs at lower rank.\n\nEven many management-side lawyers consider the regional directors effective. \u201cSome people are better than other others, but I think the standards are pretty high,\u201d said Steven M. Swirsky, a former field lawyer for the labor board who has spent decades representing employers.\n\nAt a Jan. 19 meeting with an American Bar Association committee whose members represent both management and labor, Mr. Robb argued that the reaction to his proposal was overblown.\n\nAccording to someone familiar with the discussion, Mr. Robb acknowledged that he would need the approval of the agency\u2019s board for any changes, and he said he would seek public comment as well as input from the regional directors.\n\nIn the meantime, the letter from the regional directors indicates that many may take Mr. Robb\u2019s proposal as a cue to resign or retire, as some of their counterparts at the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department did.\n\n\u201cWe believe the changes you suggest, including the removal of directors from the Senior Executive Service, will cause senior directors and managers, whose institutional knowledge is a valuable asset to the agency, to retire sooner than they otherwise intended,\u201d the directors wrote to Mr. Robb. \u201cAs you can imagine, the information you provided to the regional directors has created much uncertainty and has disheartened us.\u201d", "title": "Trump Appointee Is Trying to Squelch Us, Labor Board Staff Says", "authors": ["Noam Scheiber"]}

During his Christmas break in Florida, Mr. Trump stewed and consulted with aides and relatives, according to advisers, but ultimately opted against responding publicly to avoid drawing more attention to Mr. Bannon\u2019s remarks.\n\nBut accusing the president\u2019s eldest son of treason crossed the line. \u201cGoing after the president\u2019s son in an absolutely outrageous and unprecedented way is probably not the best way to curry favor with anybody,\u201d said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.\n\nThe book presents Mr. Trump as an ill-informed and thoroughly unserious candidate and president, engaged mainly in satisfying his own ego and presiding over a dysfunctional White House. It reports that early in the 2016 campaign, one aide, Sam Nunberg, was sent to explain the Constitution to the candidate. \u201cI got as far as the Fourth Amendment,\u201d it quotes Mr. Nunberg as saying, \u201cbefore his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe book cites an email from an unnamed White House aide offering a harsh assessment of Mr. Trump\u2019s operation that was said to reflect the view of Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s national economics adviser: \u201cIt\u2019s worse than you can imagine. An idiot surrounded by clowns. Trump won\u2019t read anything \u2014 not one-page memos, not the brief policy papers; nothing. He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored.\u201d\n\nThe book also asserts that Mr. Cohn and other advisers and associates of Mr. Trump deride him in private, calling him an \u201cidiot,\u201d a \u201cdope\u201d or \u201cdumb\u201d as dirt. Thomas J. Barrack, a friend and adviser to Mr. Trump, was quoted telling a friend that the president is \u201cnot only crazy, he\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nReached by telephone on Wednesday, Mr. Barrack said that account was \u201ctotally false.\u201d Mr. Barrack added, \u201cIt\u2019s clear to anyone who knows me that those aren\u2019t my words and inconsistent with anything I\u2019ve ever said.\u201d He said that Mr. Wolff never ran that quotation by him to ask whether it was accurate.\n\nA longtime media columnist and author, Mr. Wolff brings a high profile, vivid writing style and years of experience but sometimes mixed reviews to the task of chronicling Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. Interview subjects have complained in the past that he took comments meant to be off the record and used them. In a 2004 profile, the journalist Michelle Cottle wrote that \u201cthe scenes in his columns aren\u2019t recreated so much as created \u2014 springing from Wolff\u2019s imagination rather than from actual knowledge of events.\u201d\n\nMr. Wolff clearly benefited from close cooperation from Mr. Bannon and the book is infused with his views. The author was frequently seen in Mr. Bannon\u2019s office while he was still working in the White House. According to Ms. Sanders, Mr. Wolff spoke with the president just once, for five to seven minutes, in the first month of the administration, when Mr. Trump called Mr. Wolff to thank him for his criticism of a Times article that the president did not like.\n\nGoing beyond the president\u2019s pushback on Mr. Bannon, Ms. Sanders attacked the book as a whole, hoping to discredit its reporting. Ms. Sanders released a statement calling it \u201ctrashy tabloid fiction\u201d that is \u201cfilled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House.\u201d\n\nMr. Wolff, responding by email, said he was \u201cwholly comfortable with my numerous sources.\u201d", "title": "Trump Breaks With Bannon, Saying He Has \u2018Lost His Mind\u2019", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Maggie Haberman"]}

Virginia charges $3 per carton. New York charges $43.50. A simple plot to buy cigarettes in one state and sell them in another can generate tens of thousands of dollars. Criminal organizations rely on more complicated schemes to move untaxed cigarettes in bulk, evading federal and state taxes. By some estimates, more than half of New York\u2019s cigarettes come from the black market.\n\nThe A.T.F. once made tobacco investigations a priority, with ruinous results. The New York Times revealed last year that one major investigation spawned a multimillion-dollar slush fund for agents to tap for both business and personal expenses. An inspector general report in 2013 also found widespread mismanagement in tobacco enforcement operations. Since then, the A.T.F. has redirected all but a tiny amount of its tobacco enforcement budget to fighting violent crime.\n\nThe Trump administration has called on the A.T.F. to lead its crackdown on gun violence and criminal networks.

Senior A.T.F. officials supported the idea, the two administration officials recalled.\n\nIt is not clear what would happen to the small number of A.T.F. agents assigned to investigate tobacco and alcohol smuggling.

Mueller III into the Trump campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia, and frivolous matters, like the manner in which journalists conveyed how the president fed fish during a stop at a koi pond on his visit to Japan.\n\nThe first item on the list referred not to a news article but to a short opinion piece posted on The Times\u2019s website at 12:42 on the night Mr. Trump became president: \u201cThe New York Times\u2019 Paul Krugman claimed on the day of President Trump\u2019s historic, landslide victory that the economy will \u2018never\u2019 recover,\u201d the entry read.\n\nWhat Mr. Krugman actually wrote was this: \u201cIf the question is when markets will recover, a first-pass answer is never.\u201d Mr. Krugman concluded his election night take by predicting that a global recession was likely, while adding the caveat, \u201cI suppose we could get lucky somehow.\u201d\n\nThree days later, Mr. Krugman retracted his prediction of an economic collapse, saying he overreacted.\n\nThe next target was Brian Ross of ABC News, who was suspended by the network last month because of an erroneous report.\n\nPhoto\n\nABC apologized for and corrected Mr. Ross\u2019s report that Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, planned to testify that Mr. Trump had directed him to make contact with Russian officials when Mr. Trump was still a candidate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Flynn to make contact after the election, when he was president-elect.\n\nAt the time of Mr. Ross\u2019s suspension, Kathleen Culver, the director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that the president was likely to use the mistake as ammunition against his political opponents \u2014 an observation that seemed borne out by the \u201cFake News Awards.\u201d\n\nThe third entry on the GOP.com list went after CNN, a favorite target of the president, for reporting incorrectly last month that the president\u2019s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., had received advance notice from WikiLeaks about a trove of hacked documents that it planned to release during last year\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nIn fact, the email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent a day after the documents, stolen from the Democratic National Committee, were made available to the general public. The correction undercut the main thrust of CNN\u2019s story, which had been seized on by critics of the president as evidence of coordination between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign.\n\nAnother entry on the list took on The Washington Post, claiming that it had \u201cFALSELY reported the President\u2019s massive sold-out rally in Pensacola, Florida was empty. Dishonest reporter showed picture of empty arena HOURS before crowd started pouring in.\u201d\n\nThe reporter in question was David Weigel, who had posted the photo in question on his Twitter account before quickly deleting it. The Post itself did not publish the photo or a report on the size of the crowd at the Trump event. The \u201cFake News Awards\u201d entry, however, conflated a reporter\u2019s tweet with the publication itself. It also omitted the fact that Mr. Weigel deleted his tweet and apologized for it when it was pointed out to him that it was misleading. Further, it did not mention that Mr. Trump had called for Mr. Weigel to be fired over the tweet.

In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s endeavor, the Committee to Protect Journalists this month recognized the president among the \u201cworld leaders who have gone out of their way to attack the press and undermine the norms that support freedom of the media.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo Republicans from Arizona, Senator John McCain and Senator Jeff Flake, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-press attacks, with Mr. Flake noting in a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday that the president had borrowed a term from Stalin to describe the media: \u201cenemy of the people.\u201d\n\nThe buzz around the president\u2019s latest anti-press stunt has contributed to a larger shift in American attitudes toward the press.\n\nIn a study released this week by Gallup and the Knight Foundation, 66 percent of Americans who were surveyed said most news organizations blurred opinion and fact, up from 42 percent in 1984. \u201cFake news\u201d was deemed a threat to democracy by a majority of respondents.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s list did not mention BuzzFeed, a media outlet that drew his ire last year when it published a salacious and largely unsubstantiated intelligence dossier that purported to lay out how Russia had aided the Trump campaign. On Jan. 8, President Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, filed a defamation lawsuit in federal court against Fusion GPS, the firm behind the report, as well as a separate lawsuit against BuzzFeed in state court.\n\nMr. Trump also did not mention Michael Wolff, the author of the slashing, if error-specked, best seller, \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d although a lawyer working on his behalf had sent a letter demanding that the publisher Henry Holt and Company halt publication of the book.\n\n\u201cFire and Fury\u201d did not come out until Jan. 5, so perhaps the author will receive a prominent mention next January, if the president sees fit to give out the 2018 Fake News Awards.", "title": "Trump Hands Out \u2018Fake News Awards,\u2019 Sans the Red Carpet", "authors": ["Matt Flegenheimer", "Michael M.

Tests of the liver, kidney and thyroid were all normal.\n\nIn addition to the cholesterol medicine, Mr. Trump takes small doses of aspirin for heart health and a small dose of Propecia, a medicine to treat male-pattern baldness.\n\nDr. Jackson said tests of the president\u2019s heart indicated \u201cexcellent\u201d cardiac health, especially for someone of his age.

But we already know the F.B.I. director James Comey said that Mr. Trump asked him to back off on the Russian election meddling inquiry, and in particular on investigating his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey when he refused to abide by these instructions.

Mr. Graham said bluntly, \u201cThis is a negotiation.\u201d\n\nMembers of both parties said that legislation would have a better chance of passing if it focused on legal status for DACA recipients without a dramatic crackdown on illegal immigrants or new restrictions on legal immigration for extended family members.\n\n\u201cIf you start putting in all of these highly charged toxic issues, it\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.\n\nVideo\n\nAnti-immigration activists also assailed the plan, though for the opposite reason. Breitbart News greeted word of the president\u2019s plan with the headline \u201cAmnesty Don Suggests Citizenship for Illegal Aliens.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, described to reporters by senior White House officials, young immigrants who were brought into the United States illegally as children would be granted legal status, would be allowed to work, and could become citizens over a 10-to-12-year period if they remained out of trouble with the law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn exchange, Congress would have to create a $25 billion trust fund to pay for a southern border wall, dramatically increase immigration arrests, speed up deportations, crack down on people who overstay their visas, prevent citizens from bringing their parents to the United States, and end a State Department program designed to encourage migration from underrepresented countries.\n\nWhite House officials said that the list of enhanced security measures \u2014 which have been on anti-immigration wish lists for decades \u2014 were nonnegotiable. They warned that if no deal is reached, DACA recipients will face deportation when the program fully expires on March 5.\n\nOne senior official said the young immigrants would not be targeted, but are \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d who would be processed for deportation if they came into contact with immigration officers.\n\nEddie Vale, a Democratic consultant working with a coalition of immigration groups, described the president\u2019s proposal as an effort to sabotage bipartisan talks and win passage of \u201ca white supremacist wish list.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the president\u2019s decision to formally present a plan to Congress was a direct response to members of Congress, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who had complained that they did not know where the president stood in the immigration debate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically signaling that this is the bill the president can sign,\u201d one senior official said during the briefing.\n\nOfficials said they expected Mr. McConnell to bring the president\u2019s plan to the Senate floor for a vote during the week of Feb. 5, just days before the Feb. 8 expiration of a short-term government spending plan.\n\nThe president\u2019s legislative proposal is designed to exert maximum pressure on Democrats, who are desperate to protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, but who fiercely oppose the policies embraced by hard-liners like Mr. Miller.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe strategy would work only if the Senate fails to reach a broad bipartisan accord on an alternative: legislation that would protect the Dreamers and bolster border security, but reject the most draconian aspects of the White House\u2019s proposal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

At issue is the scope of the bill. Some senators want to draft a narrow bill that bolsters border security and codifies protections now extended to DACA recipients, which do not include a path to citizenship. Others say the legislation should take Mr. Trump up on his offer of citizenship, but to do that, lawmakers might have to take the rest of the White House\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cDo we simply codify what DACA is and extend it out over a period of time, or do we try to go farther than that as the president is suggesting?\u201d asked Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota. \u201cIf you do that, you have to address the issue of chain migration, and that\u2019s where it becomes a lot more complicated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHard-liners, apparently led by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, say the White House\u2019s strategy needs to be considered \u2014 and that means four elements: Dreamers; border security and a wall; chain migration; and an end to the diversity visa lottery.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants to alter reality in a way that sort of suits their needs,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cBut the reality is the president said there has to be four pillars. People just need to accept that and deal with it.\u201d\n\nSenator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Mr. Graham have been leading bipartisan talks on immigration. Their initial proposal \u2014 which did not include the president\u2019s more hard-line proposals \u2014 was rejected by Mr. Trump during a White House meeting in which the president used vulgarities to describe Africans.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mr. Graham held a meeting with a far larger group of about 30 senators. They decided that Mr. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, and Mr. Cornyn would each function as a clearinghouse for ideas on immigration from their respective parties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more people in the room, which is good,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more input.

The promise of that university education was why the people I grew up with believed in the dream.\n\nWe made fun of the white picket fence part, which seemed stiff and boring to our 1990s teenage tastes.

The long decline of labor unions and the rise of automation, among other things, have made it harder for many people to afford a picket fence or 2.5 kids.\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s racist and classist policies are hastening the demise of the American dream. His cruel, unnecessarily hard-edged approach to immigration enforcement goes after law-abiding, taxpaying residents.

Roy Cooper of North Carolina, also a Democrat, called drilling a \u201ccritical threat\u201d to his state\u2019s economy.\n\nMr. Zinke said the drilling plan was part of \u201ca new path for energy dominance in America,\u201d but said he planned to speak with Governor Scott and other state leaders before the proposal was finalized. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be done overnight,\u201d he said.\n\nOil industry leaders cheered the reversal, calling it long overdue.\n\n\u201cI think the default should be that all of our offshore areas should be available,\u201d said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance. \u201cThese are our lands. They\u2019re taxpayer-owned and they should be made available.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Obama administration blocked drilling on about 94 percent of the outer continental shelf, the submerged offshore area between state coastal waters and the deep ocean. Mr. Zinke charged that those restrictions had cost the United States billions of dollars in lost revenue and said the new proposal would make about 90 percent of those waters available for leasing.\n\nThe Interior Department would open 25 of 26 regions of the outer continental shelf, leaving only the North Aleutian Basin \u2014 which President George Bush protected in an executive order \u2014 exempted from drilling.\n\nInterior officials said they intended to hold 47 lease sales between 2019 and 2024, including 19 off the coast of Alaska and 12 in the Gulf of Mexico. Seven areas offered for new drilling would be in Pacific waters off California, where drilling has been off limits since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara.\n\nPresident Trump signed an executive order in April requiring the Interior Department to reconsider Mr. Obama\u2019s five-year offshore drilling plan, which had invoked an obscure provision of a 1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, to block new lease sales in large areas of the Arctic and Atlantic. The ban \u201cdeprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinalizing the new plan could take as long as 18 months, experts said, and in the meantime challenges are expected in the courts and in Congress.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many said they were exploring legal options.\n\nSenator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, vowed to pursue \u201call legislative tools\u201d to block drilling off the East Coast, including the Congressional Review Act, which allows agency actions to be undone by Congress. Xavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, said the state is \u201cevaluating all of our options\u201d to protect its coast. And, several groups warned, a future Democratic administration could again redraw the boundaries of allowable drilling.\n\nBut for now, Republicans\u2019 efforts to roll back restrictions on energy production are winning the day. Last month Congress opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil and gas drilling as part of the tax overhaul. And last week the Interior Department rescinded an Obama-era rule that would have added regulations for hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, on federal and tribal lands. It also repealed offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon spill.\n\nJody Freeman, director of the environmental law program at Harvard Law School and a former Obama climate adviser, said the latest Trump proposal was more about sending a message. In the Arctic in particular, she said, low oil prices and the decision by Royal Dutch Shell to give up all but one of its federal oil leases indicate drilling is not on the near horizon.\n\n\u201cBut the decision is a signal, just like the one Congress sent with ANWR, that Republicans want to open the nation\u2019s public lands and waters for business,\u201d she said.\n\nFrank Knapp, president of the Business Alliance for Protecting the Atlantic Coast, said thousands of small businesses, from restaurants to hotels to commercial fishing operations, oppose drilling off their states\u2019 waters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not consistent with our vibrant tourism, fishing and recreation,\u201d Mr. Knapp said. \u201cTheir concern is their livelihood, the local economies. We all saw what happened to the Gulf Coast with Deepwater Horizon.\u201d\n\nOf particular interest to oil companies \u2014 and concern to many Florida lawmakers \u2014 will be the decision to open the eastern Gulf of Mexico, said Kevin Book, an energy consultant and managing director of ClearView Energy Partners. He noted the area is attractive to the energy industry because there is already a large amount of infrastructure in the region.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can talk about the Atlantic all you want, but you\u2019re 10 years, 15 years from production,\u201d Mr. Book said.\n\nAnalysts said the oil industry was unlikely to rush headlong into new areas. While oil companies have eyed regions like the East Coast for years, oil and gas operators are still smarting from the steep fall in oil prices that began in 2014 because of a global oil glut, which has only recently eased.\n\nDespite the recent sharp rise in prices to about $68 a barrel for Brent crude, companies remain wary of spending, particularly in areas where the amount of oil and gas present is unknown and production is likely to be expensive without existing pipelines and other infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a really long story,\u201d said William Turner, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Houston. \u201cIt is not going to be gangbusters.\u201d", "title": "Trump Moves to Open Nearly All Offshore Waters to Drilling", "authors": ["Lisa Friedman"]}

Mr. Trump repeated his sympathies on Tuesday at the White House meeting.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the president\u2019s attitude, urging their Republican colleagues to support legislation that would permanently legalize the Dreamers to work in the United States, and give them an eventual path to American citizenship.\n\nBut hard-line conservatives say that would amount to an amnesty program for lawbreakers, and some Republicans in Congress have been pressing for other immigration changes before they will support legislation for the Dreamers.\n\nIn particular, Republicans at the White House meeting demanded an end to rules that allow immigrants to sponsor their extended family members \u2014 aunts, uncles, cousins \u2014 to enter the United States.

At a meeting of economists in Philadelphia over the weekend, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, drew criticism from liberal economists for claims that centered on one tax cut in the bill while excluding a related tax increase.

The Moca is used in all 31 of the National Institute on Aging\u2019s Alzheimer Disease Centers.\n\nWhile there are many such screening tests, the Moca is gaining acceptance because it is a bit harder than the Mini-Mental and can pick up problems that occur in the earliest stage of dementia, mild cognitive impairment \u2014 a sort of everyday forgetfulness.\n\nAbout one in five people over age 65 have M.C.I., and roughly a third will develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease within five years.\n\nWhat does the test ask?\n\nMoca has 30 questions meant to briefly assess memory, attention and concentration, control and self-regulation, and other mental skills.\n\nTo test memory, for example, the examiner reads five words at a rate of one per second and asks the subject to repeat them immediately and then again after some time has passed.\n\nTo assess attention and concentration, subjects are read a list of five digits and asked to repeat them in the order they were provided and then in reverse order.

Doctors start simply by talking to the patient: Has she noticed memory problems, or issues with judgment or reasoning?\n\nIt\u2019s also important for the physician to talk to someone who knows the patient well, because people who are slipping cognitively do not always recognize it. \u201cLack of awareness or insight can be part of the package\u201d of dementia, Dr. Petersen said.\n\nIf the doctor is concerned, and if a family member also says the subject is forgetful or repeating himself, and if this behavior is becoming a pattern \u2014 all those factors will influence the decision to \u201cpursue this to the next level,\u201d Dr. Petersen said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome patients simply prefer not to know if they are developing dementia. But those who do are given a neuropsychological test much more difficult and intense than the Moca. And doctors will repeat it over time.\n\nIn such a test, for example, the examiner reads a short story and asks the subject to repeat it. Thirty minutes later, the subject is asked to repeat the story again.\n\nThe subject is also asked to draw geometric shapes and to remember them a half-hour later. The examiner may ask the subject to recall a list of 15 words as many as five times, and then recall them 30 minutes later.\n\nWhat physicians look for is a slow decline. At Washington University, for instance, researchers are studying people in families with an inherited form of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Those subjects come in annually for their tests; the initial score is much less important than a pattern of deterioration.\n\nWhat about Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nThe results of neuropsychological tests can tell doctors how a subject is performing relative to others of the same age, sex and education level. If the doctor thinks something is amiss, a clinical exam might follow to figure out what might be causing the problem.\n\nMost cases of dementia result from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. An M.R.I. scan can help with diagnosis. It can detect a stroke and other conditions. It also can determine if the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, is shrinking, as happens in Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nA PET scan that uses glucose measures the activity of brain cells. Cells starting to falter and die, especially in certain areas of the brain, may be a sign of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nNeither scan is itself diagnostic, Dr. Petersen said. Instead, the results add to the weight of evidence suggestive of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAnother test, whose $5,000 to $7,000 cost is not covered by insurance, is a scan to look for amyloid protein in the brain.

Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Asia last year underscored his disagreements on trade issues with countries in the region.\n\nMany of the participants at Davos are sure to embrace the globalist views that Mr. Trump has rejected, providing the potential for dramatic disagreements between the president and others at the meeting.\n\nBut the event \u2014 which often focuses on global economic issues \u2014 also will provide Mr. Trump with a platform to boast about the improving American economy, including the rise in the stock market and the low jobless rate.\n\nThe president has eagerly claimed credit for the economic improvements during his first year in office, and has predicted that the tax overhaul passed at the end of last year would accelerate those trends.\n\nThe annual economic forum takes place in the resort town of Davos high in the Swiss Alps, bringing together more than 3,000 members of the global elite in what has been described as the world\u2019s most high-powered networking event.\n\nThose who attend include journalists and columnists, Hollywood celebrities, researchers, corporate chief executive officers and other business titans, and some heads of state. Former President Bill Clinton attended the forum in 2000 and former president George W. Bush attended a meeting of the Word Economic Forum in Egypt in 2008.

One was an 11,253-ton oil tanker, the Lighthouse Winmore, supposedly heading to Taiwan. The other, an aging freighter, was emblazoned with the red, white and blue flag of North Korea.\n\nIn an illicit high-seas exchange captured in photographs taken by an American spy plane, the Lighthouse Winmore offloaded what officials later said was 600 tons of oil to the North Korean vessel in violation of United Nations sanctions.\n\nWith those sanctions constricting its trade, including the import of refined petroleum, North Korea has increasingly turned to illegal clandestine shipments to acquire the fuel it needs, according to diplomatic officials and documents obtained by The New York Times.\n\nTrafficking on the high seas has become what these officials regard as a pernicious subversion of the sanctions. Though the frequency of smuggling is difficult to estimate, they fear it is undermining efforts to thwart the nuclear weapons ambitions of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, through economic pressure. The trafficking has also strained relations between the United States and North Korea\u2019s two largest trading partners, China and Russia.", "title": "Trump Rebuked China for North Korea\u2019s Oil Smuggling.

It encouraged Iranians to use virtual private networks to sidestep the government\u2019s efforts to block them.\n\nMr. Trump himself sought to link the grievances of the Iranian demonstrators to his predecessor\u2019s policies, saying that the corruption of Iran\u2019s leadership had been fueled by the benefits of the nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime,\u201d he said in an early-morning tweet. \u201cAll of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their \u2018pockets,\u2019\u201d he added, apparently referring to the Iranian funds that were freed up when Iran agreed to constraints on its nuclear program.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s invocation of Mr. Obama and the nuclear deal muddies his message, analysts said, by turning the spotlight away from the Iranian government\u2019s economic failures \u2014 which have given rise to this powerful, if inchoate, protest movement \u2014 to the lingering debate in Washington over the nuclear agreement.\n\nMr. Trump never fully resolved that debate himself. In October, he refused to certify the deal, but he left it to Congress to legislate changes to it. Lawmakers have made little progress and European leaders have refused to revisit it. Between Jan. 11 and 17, Mr. Trump faces new deadlines on whether to recertify the deal and to continue to waive sanctions.\n\n\u201cHe was going to be put on the spot, anyway, explaining why he was keeping the deal alive without these improvements,\u201d said Philip H. Gordon, a senior National Security Council official in the Obama administration. \u201cIf the Iranians are killing people in the streets when it comes time for Trump to extend the sanctions waivers, it is hard to see him doing it.\u201d\n\nYet killing the deal, Mr. Gordon said, could enable the Iranian government to galvanize domestic support against the United States rather than face questions about why it has not been able to improve Iran\u2019s economy. \u201cRight now, they cannot blame us or the international sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis could allow them to make the U.S. the enemy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven critics of the deal said they worried that the protests would tempt Mr. Trump to abandon it rather than try to improve it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In theory, that would allow the Senate additional time to try to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s request that the legislature make alterations to the agreement.\n\nStill, it remained unclear on Tuesday whether Republicans and Democrats would be able to agree on a path to do so, with Democrats convinced that the kind of changes Mr. Trump has asked for would prompt either Iran or the United States\u2019 European allies to withdraw.\n\nVideo\n\nDespite their fears about the fate of the deal, some Obama officials endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s vocal support for the protesters, favorably comparing it with Mr. Obama\u2019s muted response when thousands of Iranians took to the streets in June 2009 after a rigged presidential election. Mr. Obama withheld criticism, in part, because dissidents warned them that Tehran would use that endorsement to discredit the movement.\n\nWith hindsight, some say, that was a mistake because the protesters deserved the United States\u2019 public backing, and the Iranian government would have labeled them foreign stooges either way. Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, has described it as one of her greatest regrets from that period.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us who were in the administration, there is some regret,\u201d said Daniel B. Shapiro, a former senior National Security Council official and ambassador to Israel. \u201cAt that moment, it would have been desirable to be more outspoken on behalf of the rights of the Iranian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see Iranian citizens going into the streets to protest a brutal and corrupt regime,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said of the current uprising, though he cautioned that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d given the lack of leadership and traditional roots of these protests.\n\nMr. Shapiro, now a visiting fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the United States should impose targeted sanctions on Iranian officials who order a violent crackdown on the protests. He said the administration should also redouble its efforts to push back on Iran\u2019s military adventurism in the region.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMilitary commanders and Pentagon officials say they are drafting plans to counter what they call Iran\u2019s \u201cdestabilizing\u201d activities, like supporting Hezbollah and other militant proxy groups, supplying missile technology to Houthi rebels in Yemen, and carrying out cyberoperations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to go to war with Iran, but we are trying to hold them accountable for some of the things they\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re trying to roll some of that back,\u201d Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the Pentagon\u2019s Central Command, said in a recent interview in Bahrain.\n\nThere is another, less likely, course that Mr. Trump could take to show solidarity with the Iranian people, analysts said: Lift the travel ban on people from Iran who seek to visit the United States.\n\n\u201cIranians took the travel ban very personally because they were the largest group most directly affected,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert who is the deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.", "title": "Trump Reiterates Support for Iranian Protesters, but Also Criticizes Obama", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}

The entire exchange was fewer than 350 words, but those 350 words were rich in misinformation.\n\nMr. Trump has spoken often about climate change and often his arguments have little in common with the overwhelming scientific evidence that the climate is changing and humans are the primary cause. Instead, he tends to offer cherry-picked facts that do not stand up to scrutiny.\n\nHere are excerpts from the interview, with comments by The New York Times.\n\nHe defended himself as a protector of the environment\n\nMr. Morgan: Quick fire: climate change. For you, is it about the science or about the money? The Paris accords. Mr. Trump: I think it\u2019s about everything and I\u2019m a believer in clean air and clear water.\n\nAnd later in the interview:\n\nMr. Trump: I\u2019ll tell you what I believe in. I believe in clean air. I believe in crystal-clear, beautiful water. I believe in just having good cleanliness in all.\n\nMr. Trump has often cited clean air and water as his highest environmental priority.

Mr. Trump\u2019s positions have been difficult to discern, vacillating between his expressions of sympathy for the DACA recipients and his hard-line demands for a crackdown on illegal immigrants.\n\nMr. Trump campaigned for the presidency with nativist rhetoric that assailed the threat from outsiders, especially Mexicans and Muslims. As president, he quickly tried to impose a travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries and gave immigration agents more authority to round up undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut he also once said that he wanted \u201ca bill of love\u201d to address the fate of the DACA recipients.\n\nSenator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, who is a hard-line conservative on immigration issues, reiterated that any deal on immigration would have to include Republican demands for tougher enforcement on immigration, saying on Twitter that \u201cit must be done responsibly, guaranteeing a secure & lawful border & ending chain migration, to mitigate the negative side effects of codifying DACA.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks drew support from Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has in recent weeks been at the forefront of efforts to reach an immigration deal.

Mr. Trump referred to the program as a \u201cbroken system\u201d that brings the wrong kind of people into the United States. He said that he wanted to negotiate an end to so-called chain migration, but said he would work to allow nuclear families to stay together.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s pledge to the Dreamers, his administration cracked down earlier Wednesday on so-called sanctuary cities. The Justice Department asked the 23 jurisdictions across the country to furnish documents proving that they had not kept information from federal immigration authorities.

Bush, said the tweet demonstrated an immaturity that is dangerous in a commander in chief.\n\n\u201cSpoken like a petulant ten year old,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut one with nuclear weapons \u2014 for real \u2014 at his disposal. How responsible people around him, or supporting him, can dismiss this or laugh it off is beyond me.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s supporters brushed off the criticism, calling the president\u2019s words a bracing stand that would force North Korea to confront the potential repercussions of its efforts to develop nuclear weapons that could reach the continental United States.\n\nMichael Flynn Jr., the son of the president\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T.

A no bulls#t leader not afraid to stand up for his country.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s saber-rattling tweet shifted the tenor of his response to the South Korean initiative just hours after a milder initial statement. Mr. Trump, who has disdained the prospects of negotiating with North Korea, said earlier in the day that the possible talks between the two governments on the peninsula resulted from sanctions imposed by the United States and the international community. \u201cPerhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see!\u201d he wrote Tuesday morning.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he has not hesitated to match North Korea\u2019s incendiary language even as other American presidents resisted such back-and-forth taunting out of concern that it was unwise and unnecessarily rewarding the hermit nation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the summer, Mr. Trump vowed to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea if it posed a threat to the United States. In the fall, he went before the United Nations General Assembly to warn that he would \u201ctotally destroy North Korea\u201d if the United States were forced to defend itself or its allies.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, South Korea proposed holding talks with North Korea next week in Panmunjom, a village straddling the border between the two hostile countries. If North Korea agrees, it would be the first official dialogue between the Koreas in two years in what leaders in Seoul hope could dampen the talk of war that has consumed the past few months.\n\nNorth Korea has made significant strides in the past year in developing intercontinental ballistic missiles that could eventually deliver nuclear warheads to targets as distant as the United States. More than two decades of efforts by the United States and other major powers have failed to thwart North Korea from building a nuclear arsenal in defiance of international law.\n\nMr. Trump has emphasized a more militant line, arguing that his predecessors were too soft in responding to the threat. He has ratcheted up American sanctions and lobbied the United Nations to increase punitive measures, as well. While at various points in the past he has suggested that he would be open to negotiations, he has more often emphasized lately that he did not believe talks would lead to a fruitful outcome. On more than one occasion when his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, publicly broached the possibility, Mr. Trump pulled him back, declaring, at one point, that talks would be a waste of time.\n\nMany security experts have said there is no reasonable military option for restraining North Korea that would not involve unacceptable loss of life, which is one reason South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, is more eager for dialogue. But Mr. Trump and his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have argued that there is a viable military alternative.\n\nWhether intended or not, the diverging messages between Mr. Trump and Mr. Moon could create a good-cop, bad-cop situation in which the South Koreans use the specter of a militant United States as leverage to win concessions from North Korea.\n\nMr. Kim has sent conflicting messages all by himself. In his New Year\u2019s Day speech that provoked Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, Mr. Kim both floated the idea of talks and boasted of his nuclear capacity. \u201cIt\u2019s not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.\u201d", "title": "Trump Says His \u2018Nuclear Button\u2019 Is \u2018Much Bigger\u2019 Than North Korea\u2019s", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Michael Tackett"]}

And it marked the end of a year of wooing of Mr. Erdogan, whom Mr. Trump has repeatedly praised despite the Turkish leader\u2019s authoritarian crackdown at home.\n\nIn Syria, a Turkish warplane launched a shell that fell near the northern city of Manbij, where United States troops have been training and equipping Kurdish forces that are holding the strategic city. American officials are increasingly worried that a wide-scale attack on Manbij would bring troops from the United States and Turkey into direct conflict.\n\n\u201cThe shell fell in an empty place. It didn\u2019t cause any damage,\u201d said Sherfan Darwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council. \u201cIn general, the fronts are quiet.\u201d\n\nThe main brunt of an ongoing Turkish attack targeted the Syrian border town of Afrin, which is controlled by Kurdish forces. The United Nations said the recent fighting had displaced at least 5,000 people in and around the Afrin district. Of the area\u2019s 323,000 residents, only some of whom are Kurds, more than a third have been displaced from elsewhere in Syria.\n\nVideo\n\nIn one video posted online, an Afrin resident stood beside his destroyed house and cursed the Turkish president.\n\nThe Turkish attacks led Kurds in Syria and elsewhere to worry that the United States would again abandon them. They harked back to massacres of Kurds in Iraq by the former dictator Saddam Hussein \u2014 including a 1988 chemical weapons attack in Halabja that killed 5,000 \u2014 that they say Washington either failed to prevent or was complicit in covering up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNisrine Abdallah, the spokeswoman for the Kurdish Women\u2019s Union, described the situation in Afrin as \u201cmiserable\u201d and said the Turkish bombing campaign against civilians there was intensifying.

We didn\u2019t see any movement by the Americans,\u201d Ms. Abdallah said, adding: \u201cI wish the U.S. would take a clear position, at least on the humanitarian level.\u201d\n\nEven as the White House has sought to strike a balance between Turkey and Kurds in Syria, the Pentagon has maintained its support for the Kurdish militias it has fought with in eastern Syria.\n\nWithout logistical support from Kurdish forces, the nearly 2,000 American troops in Syria would be unable to continue in almost any effective role, according to senior military officials. Kurdish militias are expected to play a pivotal role in coming months in defeating the last pockets of several hundred Islamic State fighters in the country.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s phone call, the White House said, Mr. Trump also voiced concern about \u201cdestructive and false rhetoric coming from Turkey.\u201d Additionally, he noted prolonged detentions of American citizens and local employees in Turkey, a rare reference by the White House to human rights concerns.\n\nThe United States turned to Kurdish forces when the Islamic State shocked the world in June 2014 after it seized control of Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second-largest city, and then rolled across much of Syria. With Iraq\u2019s army shattered and Syrian troops battling political opponents, Kurdish militias became the most dependable ground force available against the extremists.\n\nMost of the weapons provided to Kurdish militias are Soviet in design and would blend with most other firearms in the region, making them extremely difficult to track and spot even during peacetime \u2014 never mind during the chaotic environment of a war.\n\nStrains between Turkey and the United States have been growing for years. They accelerated after a failed 2016 coup attempt in Turkey led Mr. Erdogan to tighten his grip on the nation and ramp up rhetorical attacks on the United States and Europe. The Turkish government said the coup was led by Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic cleric who is living in exile in the United States.\n\nBoth countries view the fight against the Islamic State as important.

Putin in 19 countries, and describes misinformation campaigns, the funding of far-right political causes and the manipulation of energy supplies long before 2016 in an attempt to glean lessons for American officials considering how to counteract similar efforts here.\n\nIn total, the report offers more than 30 recommendations to safeguard the country\u2019s electoral process and to work with allies, primarily in Europe, to establish new standards to address these types of threats. They include new sanctions to punish states that initiate cyberattacks on elections or critical infrastructure, an international summit meeting centered on such threats, an allied commitment of mutual defense against cyberattacks, as well as forcing social media companies to disclose the sources of funding for political ads.\n\nThe document begins by calling on Mr. Trump to \u201cassert presidential leadership\u201d to establish a governmentwide response to the Russian efforts, including setting up an interagency center modeled after the National Counterterrorism Center to coordinate the American response to threats and policy related to their deterrence. And it argues that merely investigating what the Russians did in 2016 will be insufficient in protecting against future attacks, given their persistence.\n\nOver all, the report argues that Mr. Putin\u2019s rise and hold on power in Russia has depended on the use of force and the undermining of institutions at home and abroad. It points to successful actions taken by European nations, including Germany and Nordic countries, as models for counteracting Russian tools like disinformation and hacking.\n\nSenator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who commissioned the report, said it was not the investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling but the president\u2019s own inaction in the face of Moscow\u2019s brazen attack that was harming the country.", "title": "Trump Sidesteps Question on Mueller Interview", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-22 00:00:00", "text": "Protectionism was a defining theme of the populist presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump gleefully rebuffed the longstanding Republican embrace of free and open markets. Upon taking office, Mr. Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-country trade deal, and threatened other actions, including a withdrawal from the North American Free Trade Agreement and the imposition of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum. He has yet to make good on any of those threats.\n\nInstead, the White House took action on imports of washing machines and solar products based on requests by companies who said their operations in the United States were being harmed by imports.\n\nWhirlpool Inc. appealed to the White House for help in curbing washing machine imports from its Korean competitors, while two solar companies, Suniva Inc. and SolarWorld Americas, said imports of cheap solar cells and modules were similarly putting their companies at risk.\n\nWhile the tariffs were welcomed by the companies that sought them, economists warned the levies could drive up prices for consumers and hurt some American businesses. The solar industry has been split over the tariffs; companies that develop large-scale solar farms, as well as purchasers of solar power such as retailers and tech companies, opposed the tariffs over concerns that they would cost them more money and make solar power less competitive with other energy sources, at least in the short term.\n\nAbigail Ross Hopper, the president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, which opposed the measures, said the decision \u201cwill create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs.\u201d\n\nOther trade skeptics were more sanguine about the president\u2019s decision, including Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, where Whirlpool makes its washers. Mr. Brown, who described himself as an ally of the administration on trade, called the decision \u201cwelcome news\u201d and said the tariffs \u201cwill help level the playing field, and show anyone who tries to cheat our trade laws that they won\u2019t get away with it.\u201d\n\nThe trade cases rely on a little-used section of trade law that provides a \u201csafeguard\u201d for industries beset by imports \u2014 and which casts a wide net on products from around the world. The law has not been used to impose tariffs since 2002, when President George W. Bush clamped down on imports of steel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, that approach has shown mixed results. The World Trade Organization ruled against the United States in 2003, and the Bush administration ultimately withdrew the measure under threat of retaliation.\n\nChina on Tuesday hinted it could take a similar approach. \u201cWith regard to the wrong measures taken by the United States, China will work with other W.T.O. members to resolutely defend our legitimate interests,\u201d its Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.\n\nIn both of Monday\u2019s cases, trade officials said the safeguard measure was necessary because foreign producers were evading American restrictions on imports from specific countries by hopscotching their factories around the globe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The United States International Trade Commission, an independent body of trade officials, also examined the cases and found that imports were hurting domestic manufacturers. They also made several recommendations that ranged in severity; Mr. Trump ultimately opted for relatively stringent measures after consulting with his own advisers.\n\nThe president approved solar tariffs for the next four years, starting with levies of 30 percent that will ultimately fall to 15 percent. In each of the four years, the first 2.5 gigawatts of imported solar cells will be exempted from the tariff, an exception designed to ensure that existing solar module manufacturers in the United States can still access cheap supplies of cells.\n\nThe administration said that the tariffs are largely directed at China, which over the past decade has built itself into the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of solar products, flooding global markets with low-cost crystalline silicon panels. While the United States has previously imposed restrictions on Chinese solar products, Chinese firms simply moved production to other countries, the United States trade representative said in its announcement.\n\nBut since the United States already levies many trade restrictions on Chinese products, neither measure appeared likely to put a significant dent in China\u2019s exports. Other countries may be hit harder. Currently, more than 95 percent of America\u2019s solar panels are imported, with half of those imports coming from Malaysia and South Korea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile that global production frenzy has hurt American solar manufacturers, it has been a boon to those who want to buy solar power. The average cost of solar installations in the United States has fallen 70 percent since 2010, from $7.50 per watt down to around $1 per watt.\n\nBut major solar companies that operate global supply chains worry that their products will be caught in the snare.\n\nSuvi Sharma, the chief executive of Solaria, a solar panel maker headquartered in California that makes products in both the United States and South Korea, said the trade action would be an incentive to shift more of its operations into the United States. But he also worried that it could damage the industry\u2019s prospects by making solar energy more expensive in a highly competitive utility market.\n\n\u201cWith a high tariff, there is going to be more manufacturing of solar in the United States, but the question is, at what cost?\u201d Mr. Sharma asked.\n\nFor imported washing machines, the president approved a combined tariff and quota for the next three years. In the first year, the first 1.2 million washing machines that are imported will face a tariff of 20 percent, while all subsequent imports will have a tariff of 50 percent. Those tariffs are then gradually phased down in the second and third years.\n\nIn the washing machine case, Whirlpool argued that its South Korean competitors, Samsung Electronic Co. and LG Electronics, moved their production facilities around the world to avoid tariffs.\n\nSamsung and LG described Whirlpool\u2019s case as a protectionist grab designed to shut out products that American consumers find more attractive, and argued that such restrictions on their products would hurt consumers by raising prices. They also fought against restrictions on imported parts, saying those could slow operations at facilities they had opened in the United States, including Samsung\u2019s new appliance factory in South Carolina.\n\nWhirlpool\u2019s chairman, Jeff M. Fettig, called the decision \u201ca victory for American workers and consumers alike.\u201d \u201cThis announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,\u201d he said.", "title": "Trump Slaps Steep Tariffs on Foreign Washing Machines and Solar Products", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Brad Plumer"]}

He promised a Muslim ban; a much more modest travel ban is now tied up in the courts. He launched a voter fraud commission, which his critics regarded as a step toward massive vote suppression; it was ineffective and broke up. He keeps threatening to change the libel laws; they aren\u2019t changing, and the anti-Trump press is thriving. NATO and Nafta are both still there; the trade war with China has been postponed; we are not at war with Iran or (yes, I know, yet) with North Korea; the scope of the Russia investigation has only widened since Trump\u2019s hamfisted intervention.\n\nBefore Trump took office, it was reasonable to worry that he would fill high offices with cronies, but the real cranks have rarely lasted and many appointments have been reasonable and conventional and even boring. The president is filling the courts with Federalist Society conservatives, not his sister or Ivanka or Newt Gingrich, and his cabinet looks a lot like a generic Republican administration, whose efforts liberals understandably oppose and sometimes deplore, but which are not remotely like the workings of a fascist cabal circa 1935.\n\nAnd then legislatively, the story of the Trump era so far is failure on every front save tax cuts, an outsourcing of policymaking to Hill Republicans, and a general incompetence that is bringing us yet another government shutdown. The recurrence of these shutdowns is, certainly, a symptom of the republic\u2019s sclerosis \u2014 but it is not a Trump-specific problem, and he seems to have made it neither better nor much worse.\n\nNow it might be argued that all of this \u2014 the balking of Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses, the normalcy of his appointments, his massive unpopularity and legislative failures \u2014 is due to the intense vigilance of the Resistance, the widespread determination to treat this president as an existential threat.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. Senate Republicans succeeded in normalizing Trump\u2019s cabinet and judicial appointments by behaving, well, normally: Working behind the scenes to veto bad choices and elevate more conventional picks. Congressional Democrats have stalled Trump\u2019s agenda by campaigning against its substance, as they would with any other G.O.P. president, and they are threatening to take the House and Senate by running no-fuss-and-drama candidates. The Deep State of bureaucrats and generals has prevented sudden breaks with U.S. policy not with high-profile resignations or massive acts of sabotage, but by repeatedly, patiently talking the president out of his most disruptive or dangerous ideas.\n\nAnd where an abnormal response to Trump has kept things on an even keel, it hasn\u2019t been furious protests; rather, it\u2019s been a collective decision by many different actors, from his own appointees to his congressional opponents to foreign leaders the world over, to simply behave as if he isn\u2019t actually the president, as if the system around him is what matters, and his expressed desires are just a reality TV performance.\n\nThis is not how a truly dangerous authoritarianism works. It\u2019s not how the imperial presidencies of the past worked, either: For all his braggart\u2019s talk, Trump has done nothing that compares with the power grabs and norm violations of Woodrow Wilson or Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson or Richard Nixon, George W. Bush or even Barack Obama \u2026 and because he lacks the popularity or media adulation that all of those presidents enjoyed at one point, it\u2019s very hard to see how he would go about imitating them.", "title": "Opinion | Trump So Far Is More Farce Than Tragedy", "authors": []}

His party\u2019s ideologues don\u2019t want them, the opposition party doesn\u2019t want to make a deal with Trump to get them, and his White House doesn\u2019t actually have any detail behind the rhetoric. The ideas are just things that the president would probably like to do but that someone will talk him out of, or that he\u2019ll forget about, or that he\u2019ll offer in a halfhearted way and that Congress will never bother to take up.\n\nThe only exception, the only issue where he does actually have some details to offer, is immigration reform. But here the speech\u2019s appeal to the assembled legislators to make a version of the deal he\u2019s offering on DACA \u2014 essentially an amnesty and path to citizenship now in exchange for future immigration reductions \u2014 was undercut by all the fearmongering about immigrant crime that Trump wrapped it in. For Democratic politicians whose base doesn\u2019t want to compromise and whose own political interest isn\u2019t served by any kind of major immigration deal, the bloody-shirt business with MS-13 murders was a permission slip for intransigence: Why make a bargain with a president who talks like half your immigrant constituents are gangbangers?\n\nSo this State of the Union both showed what a more successful version of the Trump presidency would look like \u2014 still conservative on many fronts but more genuinely populist, less same-old G.O.P. \u2014 and why the possibility of that success has probably already slipped from this administration\u2019s grip. There were ideas here that could make Trump\u2019s second year more successful than the first, but there was no plan to actually enact them, no sign that Trump is prepared to build bridges where he\u2019s burned them, no plan for getting more out of this speech than just a temporary polling bump.\n\nWhat there was instead was something you can expect to hear a lot of between now and November 2020: If you like this economy, you should like me, too.\n\nPoliticians have won re-election with that sort of messaging.

He later defected.\n\nGesturing to Mr. Warmbier\u2019s parents, Fred and Cindy, who watched from the visitors\u2019 gallery in the House, their eyes wet with tears, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all.\u201d\n\nThe defector, Ji Seong-ho, was also in the gallery and held up his wooden crutches in triumph when Mr. Trump hailed him.\n\nHours before the speech, the president\u2019s Korea policy was buffeted by the administration\u2019s decision to abandon a long-delayed plan to nominate a prominent Korea scholar, Victor D. Cha, as its ambassador to Seoul.\n\nMr. Cha, 57, had voiced opposition to the administration\u2019s threat to carry out a preventive military strike against North Korea, said two people with knowledge of the decision. He had already undergone an extensive vetting process, and his name had been submitted for approval to the South Korean government \u2014 normally an indication that the background check was complete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOfficials in Seoul had already signed off on the ambassadorship; Mr. Cha is a Republican who identifies as a hawk on North Korea. But friends said he told Pentagon and other administration officials his concerns about ordering a pre-emptive, or preventive, military strike on North Korea before it had the capacity to fire a nuclear-armed missile at the United States.\n\nAdministration officials, particularly the White House national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R.

The administration had not formally submitted Mr. Cha\u2019s name to the Senate, even after he had undergone months of vetting.\n\nThe White House had initially hoped to have a new ambassador in place in time for the Winter Games, which begin in 10 days in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang. But as the deadline approached, Mr. Cha told friends he had heard nothing from the White House or the State Department about the status of his nomination. The Washington Post first reported that the White House was not moving forward with his nomination.\n\nMichael J. Green, a colleague of Mr. Cha, said the dropped ambassadorship was \u201cdiscouraging in terms of what it says about the administration\u2019s North Korea policy, but also their ability to attract qualified people to come into these kinds of jobs.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Trump made no mention of the Winter Olympic Games. Nor did he mention a budding d\u00e9tente between North and South Korea, which have agreed to march their teams into the opening ceremony under a single flag and to field a unified women\u2019s ice hockey team.\n\nVideo\n\nFor the president, cataloging the horrors inflicted by North Korea was part of an exercise that he called \u201crestoring clarity about our adversaries.\u201d He said he had stood up for antigovernment demonstrators in Iran and asked Congress to fix the flaws in the \u201cterrible\u201d nuclear deal that world powers brokered with the country in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president also said the United States had imposed sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela, though he made no mention of new penalties against Russia, which lawmakers had passed in a lopsided majority but which the administration has so far declined to impose.\n\nMr. Trump said much less about America\u2019s role in alliances like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And he barely mentioned China or Russia, two countries his own administration identified as the nation\u2019s greatest geopolitical adversaries in the recent National Security Strategy.\n\nWhile he mentioned his decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Mr. Trump said nothing about his administration\u2019s effort to broker a peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. That effort seemed more elusive than ever, given Palestinian outrage over Jerusalem.\n\nRather than talk about peace, Mr. Trump emphasized his determination to punish countries that split with the United States over what he called \u201cAmerica\u2019s sovereign right to make this recognition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help insure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America\u2019s friends,\u201d he said.", "title": "Trump Vows a Muscular America to Confront a World of Enemies", "authors": ["Mark Landler"]}

That would be easier to do, they said, if the talks remain focused on relatively narrow issues, like security at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt is fine for the South Koreans to take the lead, but if they don\u2019t have the U.S. behind them, they won\u2019t get far with North Korea,\u201d said Daniel R.

Before leaving Washington this week, he slapped new tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as he has on immigration in recent days, Mr. Trump toggled between being hard-line and accommodating. In an interview with CNBC to be aired on Friday before his speech, Mr. Trump raised the possibility of rejoining the Pacific partnership, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama but never submitted to Congress amid bipartisan opposition.\n\n\u201cI would do TPP if we were able to make a substantially better deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe deal was terrible; the way it was structured was terrible. If we did a substantially better deal, I would be open to TPP.\u201d\n\nFor other Davos participants, more disturbing than his trade views were his utterances on race and gender, most recently in his resistance to immigrants from Haiti and Africa.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to be written off by some ill-judged words,\u201d said Nicky Newton-King, chief executive of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. \u201cOur exchange is regarded as world class. We\u2019re completely proud of what we\u2019re able to do in one of these countries the president is so dismissive of.\u201d\n\nLynette Wallworth, a virtual reality filmmaker from Australia who has traveled the world to introduce viewers to diverse cultures, expressed hope that Mr. Trump would use his time here to absorb challenging points of view.\n\n\u201cHe seems to talk about barriers,\u201d she said. \u201cHe needs to listen to the people who are gathered here, who are trying to make an inclusive world.\u201d\n\nTolu Oni, a professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, asked if Mr. Trump was capable of absorbing opinions that conflict with his preconceptions.\n\n\u201cI wonder what he will get from this,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope that in coming here, there is some degree of learning that national interests are not necessarily in contradiction with being a responsible global citizen.\u201d", "title": "Trump and Davos: Not Exactly Best Friends, but Not Enemies Either", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Peter S.

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "Saturday is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. For President Trump, it is a shot at redemption.\n\nHe failed a moral test on the same occasion a year ago when he issued a message that strangely left out any specific reference to the six million Jews murdered in the Nazis\u2019 industrialized genocide. The White House cast the omission as somehow an \u201cinclusive\u201d approach because, it said, Roma, gays, the disabled and others were also victims. But Jews were unique targets. Failing to mention them was as bizarre as it would be to write a history of slavery and ignore the ordeal of Africans brought to America in chains.\n\nIt was an example of Mr. Trump\u2019s complex, at times disturbing, instincts in regard to Jews.\n\nOn one hand, his elder daughter is a convert to Judaism, married to an observant Jew. His years in New York real estate involved frequent dealings with Jewish counterparts. He has thrilled many American Jews by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital (though he\u2019s displeased many more of them, who fear that this will impede the search for Middle East peace). At a ceremony on Capitol Hill in April, he spoke forcefully about the Holocaust as he pledged \u201cnever again.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s always another hand with Mr. Trump, and it can be unsightly.\n\nAfter a march that included neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., last summer, the president said that there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d among them. No, there weren\u2019t. There are no very fine Nazis, neo or otherwise. He has passed along tweets from unabashedly anti-Semitic accounts, and has been slow to denounce assaults, vandalism and other Jew-hating acts, which the Anti-Defamation League says have risen sharply. In the first nine months of 2017, the latest period with available numbers, the league reported there were 1,299 such episodes, an increase of 67 percent over the 779 recorded in the same stretch of 2016.", "title": "Opinion | Trump and the Holocaust Remembrance: A Second Chance", "authors": []}

But all but one of the lawmakers she briefed are Democrats. While some Republicans have raised concerns, they do so mostly in private. Others scoff at the question, dismissing it as outrageous character assassination.\n\nFew questions irritate White House aides more than inquiries about the president\u2019s mental well-being, and they argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents are trying to use those questions to achieve what they could not at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be dignified with a response,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor.\n\n\u201cThe partisans on Capitol Hill consulting with psychologists should reorient their spare time: support the president\u2019s positive agenda of middle class tax cuts, rebuilding infrastructure and the military, investing in our work force,\u201d Ms. Conway said later in an email. \u201cThe never-ending attempt to nullify an election is tiresome; if they were truly \u2018worried about the country,\u2019 they\u2019d get to work to help it.\u201d\n\nThomas J. Barrack, a friend of Mr. Trump\u2019s, was quoted in Michael Wolff\u2019s new book, \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d as telling a friend that the president was \u201cnot only crazy but stupid.\u201d In interviews, Mr. Barrack denied that and insisted that many people miss Mr. Trump\u2019s actual brilliance.\n\n\u201cPotus has learned over time that Socratic testing and a lack of predictability is a worthy weapon in both negotiations and in keeping his team well honed, unentitled and on alert,\u201d he said, using the initials for president of the United States. \u201cHe has no truck with political correctness, self-promotion or personal hubris of his team. This may cause him to appear at times to be overly realistic, blunt or to be politically insensitive even to his own subordinates. However, that is not the case.\u201d\n\nStill, in private, advisers to the president have at times expressed concerns. In private conversations over the last year, people who were new to Mr. Trump in the White House, which was most of the West Wing staff, have tried to process the president\u2019s speaking style, his temper, his disinterest in formal briefings, his obsession with physical appearances and his concern about the theatrics and excitement of his job.\n\nIn conversations with friends, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, has said Mr. Trump is \u201ccrazy but he\u2019s a genius.\u201d Other advisers speak about the president as a volatile personality who has to be managed carefully. While Mr. Wolff\u2019s book generated enormous attention, news accounts over the past year have reported the president\u2019s mood swings and unpredictable behavior.", "title": "Trump, Defending His Mental Fitness, Says He\u2019s a \u2018Very Stable Genius\u2019", "authors": []}

After a $38 billion tax payment for repatriating money is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.\n\nHow much of that, if any, would go toward manufacturing was unclear. Apple has said it plans to open a new domestic campus that, at least initially, will house technical support for customers. More than $10 billion of planned capital expenditures will go toward American data centers.

And he can do it safely: While there has been speculation about potential retaliation against the United States if it raises import restrictions, an exception in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade permits them for security purposes.\n\nMr. Trump should make use of his authority in this case. Even in this digital age, steel undergirds our military power, not to mention critical infrastructure. Tanks, aircraft carriers and the energy grid all rely on high-strength, lightweight steel. That steel has been made in America for generations.\n\nThe security of our own steel industry, though, has been in doubt for a long time. Domestic steel production peaked in 1973. The industry is now operating at less than three-fourths of its capacity. Thousands of steelworkers have been laid off since 2015, and those still working know their jobs are under constant threat. Only one American company makes essential electrical steel, and only one other supplies the type of steel needed to make Virginia-class submarines, the generation of attack submarines that are expected to be in production until 2043.\n\nThe main culprit? In this case, Mr. Trump is right to blame China, which has added 550 million metric tons of steel capacity \u2014 more than six times total American production \u2014 since 2007, when Beijing first acknowledged it was making more steel than it could use. A significant amount of that steel has flooded global markets. Today, most of the world\u2019s largest steel companies are state-owned Chinese firms. Whether or not you believe Beijing\u2019s intent was to disrupt our own industry, that has certainly been the effect.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump deserves credit for opening the national security review of steel imports, he has made plenty of mistakes regarding trade along the way. Initiating the 232 investigation and then sitting on it for months was feckless; American steel imports spiked by 15.5 percent in 2017 as foreign steel makers rushed in products ahead of tariffs that have yet to materialize.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Chance to Save American Steel", "authors": []}

The best Mr. Trump could hope for, one official said, would be a commitment from Europe to begin work on a new and separate agreement. Such a step, they said, would require the participation of China and Russia, which are also signatories to the deal, as well as Iran itself \u2014 something the White House ruled out.\n\n\u201cIf we want seriously to be able to raise the price to the Iranians of what they are doing internally and externally, we need the Europeans,\u201d said Dennis B.

It is considering the appointment of a special envoy for Iran, who could negotiate with the Europeans on the nuclear deal, as well as marshal a stronger response to Iran\u2019s behavior in the region.\n\nAny envoy would face a tough task: Administration officials said Mr. Trump was demanding an agreement that would eliminate all \u201csunset clauses,\u201d under which Iran can resume activities like enriching uranium, and would explicitly link its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Iran fought against both of these demands in the negotiations that led to the 2015 deal.\n\nWith North Korea, the administration\u2019s policy has been more balanced between diplomacy and military planning.

Mr. Pottinger, a retired Marine, also has a background in military intelligence, though at other times, he worked as a journalist and for a hedge fund.\n\nWhite House officials are deeply skeptical of the overture from Mr. Kim to South Korea. They say he is trying to drive a wedge between South Korea and the United States. And they have urged the South Koreans to keep the exchanges limited to narrow issues, like security at the coming Winter Olympics in the South Korean town of Pyeongchang.\n\nMr. Trump, however, appears caught between continuing to heap ridicule on Mr. Kim and taking credit for the diplomatic opening. At Camp David last weekend, the president said he hoped the talks ranged far beyond the Olympics, and he backed them in a call with South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in.\n\nThe trajectory of the talks may be out of Mr. Trump\u2019s control anyway, according to experts on the region.

Mr. Mueller, the president argued, could not serve because, years before, he had resigned his membership at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia because of a dispute over fees; or he needed to be fired because he had worked at the law firm that previously represented Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nWhy strain to concoct such feeble rationales unless the truth is indefensible?\n\nThen there is the provocative point that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts were parried by the threat to resign of his own White House counsel, Mr. McGahn.

Dr. Jackson oversaw Mr. Obama\u2019s physicals and was part of the medical team involved in at least one of Mr. Bush\u2019s physicals.\n\nDr. Jackson assumed care of the president when Mr. Trump entered office and has spent a \u201csignificant\u201d amount of time with him over the past year, Ms. Sanders said. Dr. Jackson is also the physician from the White House medical unit who is with Mr. Trump most often.\n\nBecause Mr. Trump is a commander in chief who is selective about releasing information about his personal life, questions have been raised about the reliability of the information he shares with the public. In the past, physicians examining presidents have mischaracterized or hidden illnesses to present them as healthier: President Franklin D. Roosevelt readily acknowledged his polio, for instance, but his White House doctor hid the severe high blood pressure that led to heart failure.\n\nThe Trump White House has not disclosed the names and specialties of the medical professionals who will be evaluating the president, as a number of his predecessors have.

And the reason for that is pretty clear. The American people do not want a president who is compulsively dishonest, who is a bully, who actively represents the interests of the billionaire class, who is anti-science, and who is trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our nation of origin, our religion, our gender, or our sexual orientation.\u201d\n\nA dispute over infrastructure.\n\nPresident Trump called for an infrastructure that would leverage federal dollars, state and local government contributions and private sector funds to total $1.5 trillion.\n\nBut Democrats, who have pressed for infrastructure spending since Barack Obama was president, were not satisfied.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is saying he has a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan. He actually has an infrastructure plan with only $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years.

But when Mr. Trump denounced \u201cchain migration,\u201d some of them spoke out \u2014 with boos.\n\nFor decades, immigrants who become American citizens have been able to sponsor their family members to join them from abroad. The \u201cfamily-based migration system\u201d has been relabeled \u201cchain migration\u201d by opponents, a new nomenclature not appreciated by many Democrats.\n\nGuant\u00e1namo Bay stays open.\n\nMr. Trump has announced, as expected, that he has signed an executive order to keep the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison open. Essentially a symbolic act, it brings official executive branch policy into line with what it has effectively been all along: the prison remains open for business, at least for those detainees who are already there.\n\n\u201cI just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to re-examine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\u201d he said.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Trump\u2019s order revokes an ill-fated January 2009 order signed by former President Barack Obama directing the government to close the prison within a year \u2014 a goal Mr. Obama failed to achieve. He did, however, winnow down the number of detainees, from the 242 he inherited from President Bush, to the 41 remaining there when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nMr. Obama also refused to bring any new detainees to the prison. Mr. Trump vowed during the campaign that he intended to fill it back up \u201cwith some bad dudes,\u201d but to date his administration has not added any newly captured terrorism suspects to the inmate population, instead following the Obama approach of using law enforcement procedures and civilian courts to handle them.\n\nThe order Mr. Trump signed had a long bureaucratic history. Its first draft, circulated days after he took office, would have gone much farther, including laying the groundwork for reopening the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s defunct \u201cblack site\u201d prisons, where it formerly tortured high-value detainees during the Bush administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter an uproar in Congress, including pushback from Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Mr. Trump shelved that idea. The executive order went through various further drafts, eventually being pared to little more than repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s defunct directive.\n\nIn August, Mr. Trump was on the cusp of signing it when he appointed the John Kelly, a retired marines general who formerly oversaw the prison operation as the leader of Southern Command, as his chief.\n\nOne of Mr. Kelly\u2019s first acts was to send the draft order back to national security agencies and departments for further reworking. Among the apparent changes in the final document was a direction that Mr. Mattis to establish criteria about what should be done with newly captured terrorism suspects.\n\nWhat are those purple ribbons?\n\nPhoto\n\nAt least a dozen members of Congress wore purple ribbons at President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday night to help raise awareness about the country\u2019s opioid epidemic.\n\nIn October, Mr. Trump declared that the crisis had become a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Overdoses killed about 64,000 Americans in 2016, making it the leading cause of death for people under 50.\n\nMr. Trump mentioned the opioid crises again in his speech on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting the number of overdose deaths in 2016. \u201cMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need. The struggle will be long and difficult \u2014 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail.\u201d\n\nTrump backs new declaration of force against ISIS\n\nMr. Trump appeared to throw his support behind having Congress enact legislation to update the 16-year-old statute that provides the legal basis for most counterterrorism operations around the world, making it explicitly cover the Islamic State \u2014 also known as ISIS.\n\n\u201cI am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2014 wherever we chase them down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongress enacted the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F., in September 2001. It authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored or aided them \u2014 that is, Al Qaeda and the Taliban. But in 2014, the Obama administration stretched it to justify combat operations against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, without new Congressional sanction.\n\nThat step was legally contentious because even though Islamic State grew out of an Al Qaeda affiliate, the two organizations had split and gone to war with each other. One of the reasons the Trump administration has not brought any Islamic State detainees to the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo is warnings by legal specialists that doing so would risk giving a judge an opportunity to rule that the A.U.M.F. does not cover the group, jeopardizing the broader war.\n\nThe Obama administration had fruitlessly asked Congress to enact a specific military force authorization for the Islamic State as well, while also saying it was legally unnecessary. But disputes over what it should say \u2014 including whether it should contain limits on duration, geographical scope, or the use of ground forces \u2014 prevented any consensus.\n\nLast fall, Mr. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the Trump administration did not support Congress overhauling the war authorization law.\n\nManufacturing, yes, but not a tech guy.\n\nPresident Trump praised Apple for a promise made earlier this month to invest $350 billion in the United States and create 20,000 domestic jobs over five years.\n\nBut his speech was devoid of any mention of the role of technology in his vision for the economy. He called for legislation for $1.5 trillion in infrastructure investments for \u201creclaim our building heritage.\u201d He mentioned roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways. But he did not mention any of those funds going to the expansion and improvement of broadband internet networks.\n\nTrump talked about investing in work force development and job training. But instead of training for science, technology, engineering or math \u2014 or STEM \u2014 training, he talked about opening vocational schools.\n\nHis words stood in contrast to State of the Union speeches by President Obama, who called for universal broadband for all Americans and the importance of spreading faster networks to close the digital divide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSonny Perdue, agriculture secretary, designated survivor.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s the first lady\u2019s clothes or which big wig will fall asleep this year.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, was flummoxed by the administration\u2019s decision:\n\n\u201cThat bill passed with only two dissenting votes in the Senate. It was not partisan in the least,\u201d she said on CNN. \u201cThe one thing we know for sure already is the Russians did attempt to meddle in our elections, and not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year, because we know that the Russians have not given up on their disinformation campaign and their attempt to sow discord in this country and also to undermine faith in democratic institutions.\u201d\n\nTestifying before a Senate panel on Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his department had followed instructions under the sanctions law and drawn up a list of Russian targets for sanctions.

Speech-writing meetings at the White House with Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top speechwriter, John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and others were coordinated by Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary.\n\nAides said that in the last two weeks, Mr. Trump received printed drafts of the speech \u2014 with ample margins \u2014 and used a black felt marker to make additions, deletions and changes.

The names of donors giving more than $200 in a single election cycle must be reported to the Federal Election Commission and are public record, but the voluntary disclosure of the names of small donors is uncommon. Additionally, previous presidents\u2019 campaigns did not raise money for re-election so early in their first term. Former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign did not file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and begin raising money until the third year of his presidency.\n\n\u2014 Rachel Shorey\n\nFour Supreme Court justices will be in the crowd.\n\nPhoto\n\nChief Justice John G.

Bush, has these thoughts:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem for Donald Trump going into the State of the Union. He could come out with a very traditional State of the Union and for a normal president, that would help set the agenda for at least, you know, maybe a few weeks. In Washington, you\u2019d plan other policy speeches to follow up on certain aspects of the State of the Union and there would be an entire rollout around the State of the Union. I think with this president, you would expect it would be much shorter. Even if there is a surprise \u2014 Oh, look, Donald Trump sounded presidential \u2014 but then the next day there could be a tweet, and then, you know, work on a very, very long speech is overshadowed by a 280 characters. That\u2019s my one prediction. In some sense, whatever he ultimately says is overshadowed by a 280-character tweet.\u201d\n\nMichael Waldman, president of the Brennan Center for Justice at N.Y.U. School of Law and a speechwriter for former President Bill Clinton, also weighed in:\n\n\u201cThe power of that podium is not just the audience watching. It\u2019s the sense that the president is somebody who speaks for the whole country. And the way he has governed over the past year has been so filled with denunciations and racial division and flat-out falsehoods that he doesn\u2019t have a lot in the tank when it comes to credibility for anybody who isn\u2019t already an avid supporter. Often, these State of the Union addresses can be a time when the panoply of the presidency can give whoever the president is, sort of, a second chance with a lot of people. I\u2019d be surprised if that\u2019s the case here.\u201d\n\nCody Keenan, chief speechwriter for former President Barack Obama, also had concerns:\n\n\u201cPresident Obama always wanted to close his State of the Union addresses with an argument about the state of our politics. You know, what can we do to make them better? What can we do to be better citizens? I always remember reading criticisms the next day, certainly from the left, saying why is he wasting real estate in the speech on that? It\u2019s never going to happen. \u201cWell, that\u2019s part of leadership.

He was hosting a party whose guests included a bipartisan group of former White House staffers, and there wasn\u2019t enough ice. While he was driving to the store, his phone rang. It was his wife, the journalist Susan Glasser. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m getting the ice,\u201d he told her. \u201cNo, no, no, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president just fired the F.B.I. director.\u201d\n\nHe returned, bag of ice in hand, to a room full of White House veterans, Democrat and Republican, stunned by the news. \u201cIt was striking to have all these people, very experienced people in Washington, there in that moment,\u201d he said, \u201cmouths agape, trying to process what had just happened and what it might mean.\u201d He excused himself from his own party and ran upstairs to write.\n\nThere was no indication that the May 9 firing of the F.B.I. chief, James B.

When Sean Spicer, then the president\u2019s press secretary, appeared in the almost-empty briefing room to announce the news, Mr. Shear sent an email to The Times\u2019s Washington bureau from his phone: Comey fired. \u201cIt was all on the fly,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a different White House, it would be mapped out to the nth degree.\u201d\n\nFor the journalists who have covered the first year of Donald J.

{"date": "2018-01-21 00:00:00", "text": "Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, visits Israel this week, the culmination of his years of support for the country on religious grounds. But the Trump administration\u2019s policies, while lauded by American evangelical groups, are opposed by Palestinian Christians and have been questioned by Pope Francis.\n\nThose policies, in other words, align poorly with either the religious solidarity or foreign policy realism that supposedly animated them, but align perfectly with American identity politics.\n\nMr. Trump, with his penchant for indulging his nationalist impulses and disregarding foreign policy doctrine, is a perfect vessel for carrying that culture war abroad, with potentially far-reaching consequences.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow a Mideast Conflict Divided Americans\n\nAmericans, more polarized than at perhaps any other point in their modern history, tend to be less divided on foreign policy. But they split on Israel as if it were a domestic issue, suggesting that, whether they realize it or not, they experience it as such.\n\nAsked whether they sympathize more with Israelis or Palestinians, Republicans answer the former nearly seven to one, according to a Pew survey. Democrats sympathize with the groups about equally. Within the parties, conservatives tilt more pro-Israeli.\n\nThat partisan gap is at it widest since Pew began asking the question in 1978. And it applies to nearly any policy question related to Israelis and Palestinians, suggesting that Americans derive their views by identifying with one side over the other.\n\nPicking sides has long been taboo in American policy, with presidents asserting that the United States must remain neutral in order to negotiate peace. Mr. Trump, breaking with this practice, answers a major conservative demand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this demand is relatively new. Its origins goes a long way to explaining Mr. Trump\u2019s actions on Israel \u2014 and how they fit within his instincts for stoking American divisions.\n\nWhen evangelical Christians organized as a political bloc in the 1980s, they made Israel a priority. Some interpreted the Bible as asserting Israel\u2019s right to control the Palestinian territories. In the 1990s, as Democrats pushed for social changes, evangelicals sorted into the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cIsrael isn\u2019t an \u2018issue\u2019 for evangelicals in the same way that deregulation and a better tax policy are issues,\u201d Robert Nicholson, who leads a Christian advocacy group, said in an email. \u201cIt is a matter of identity.\u201d\n\nWhile this bolstered Republicans\u2019 pro-Israel attitudes, the parties did not polarize on the issue. Many evangelicals expressed their support as a matter of spiritual kinship rather than prevailing over Palestinians. After all, a number of Palestinians are Christian themselves. And Mr. Trump, though popular with evangelicals, is hardly one himself.\n\nResearch by Amnon Cavari, an Israeli political scientist, found that hard-line views on Israel had spread among conservatives only recently, and largely because of partisan polarization over domestic issues. Though conventional wisdom often suggests that evangelical and Jewish groups energized conservative views on Israel, in fact it was the other way around.\n\nThat began with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which divided Americans over issues of terrorism, torture and inclusion, particularly of Muslims.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

Israeli leaders, seeking Washington\u2019s support, encouraged Americans to see their conflicts as one and the same.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeing tough on terrorism became a core conservative value that was expressed, in part, as support for Israel \u2014 specifically, as support for harsh Israeli policies toward the conflict. This also aligned with increasingly negative attitudes toward Muslims. And an atmosphere of us-versus-them politics equated supporting Israelis with opposing Palestinians.\n\nThough George W. Bush, then the president, encouraged both inclusion of Muslims and neutrality on Israel, polarization pulled some conservatives toward a zero-sum view of the conflict, in which maximally opposing Palestinians became a matter of identity.\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump Exports the Culture War\n\nThis opened a gap between the identity politics of the Republican base and the policies of its leaders \u2014 precisely the sort of gap that Mr. Trump would exploit in his presidential primary bid. As he rose by saying what others would not, he supercharged the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\u2019s salience to identity issues among what would become his base.\n\nMr. Trump advocated severe restrictions on legal and illegal immigration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries whose citizens he said posed a threat. In doing so, the president aligned fear of demographic change with fear of terrorism.\n\nThere is no reason that those positions must necessarily line up with support for Israel, but Mr. Trump leveraged culture war passions to try to bring them together.\n\n\u201cHorrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist.\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted in 2016, adding, in a line that became his slogan for a travel ban on people from several majority-Muslim countries, \u201cWe must get tough.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump also exploited polarization over Israel to rally supporters against Barack Obama, whom he repeatedly suggested was foreign-born, Muslim and suspiciously hostile toward Israel.\n\n\u201cIs President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves?\u201d Mr. Trump asked on Twitter, also in 2016. \u201cThink about it and let me know!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn office, this is one of a handful of issues, along with sharply curtailing legal immigration, on which Mr. Trump has taken concerted, unilateral action. He is now pressing to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as early as next year.\n\nThese policies meet rising conservative demands that the United States abandon its traditional neutrality on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and instead side overtly with Israel.\n\nWhile some say pro-Israel groups are responsible for this shift, Mr. Trump, who has had an icy relationship with those groups, in fact appears to be following the Republican base. In 2014, 51 percent of Republicans said the United States should lean toward Israel in peace talks. That number has since grown to 58 percent.\n\nMr. Trump represents the culmination of a trend that pro-Israel groups resisted for years: the loss of Jewish support. Even as Jews grew more liberal, many supported strongly pro-Israel policies. But as \u201cpro-Israel\u201d becomes synonymous with \u201cconservative Republican,\u201d Jews are drifting away. They oppose moving the embassy by almost 3-to-1.\n\nParty politics started this process. In 2015, Republicans invited Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s right-wing prime minister, to address Congress in opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s policies on Iran. Though intended to turn American Jews and others against Mr. Obama, it had the opposite effect, polarizing them against Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Trump has taken it drastically further. He has indulged hard-core conservative instincts to a degree that, deliberately or not, attracted support from a white nationalist fringe that also tends to be hostile to Jews.\n\nHe is moving the idea of being \u201cpro-Israel\u201d even further right, separating it even from the Jewish support that is ostensibly critical to Israel\u2019s long-term survival.\n\nRevoking aid from refugees to punish Palestinian leaders, for instance, aligns with Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist tendencies to treat foreign populations as monolithic blocs. This, too, has its roots in American culture wars over immigration.\n\nLike his immigration restrictions, Mr. Trump\u2019s Israel policies can be unpopular outside his base. A December poll by the Brookings Institution found that only 31 percent of Americans support moving the embassy. But the base has shown itself often able to overwhelm party leadership.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pence\u2019s religiosity may embody the old mode of American support for Israel, driven by groups with strong views on the conflict itself. That still exists, but is increasingly subsumed by a broader, blunter worldview that treats the Israeli-Palestinian issue as an extension of another conflict that can seem just as intractable: American partisanship.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Hard-Line Israel Position Exports U.S. Culture War Abroad", "authors": ["Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}

They said that he lied to federal investigators about his contacts with the news media.\n\nThe move infuriated Democrats. They characterized it as an attempt to discredit a crucial source in the investigations by Congress and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and distract from the central question: whether the Trump campaign knowingly sought aid from Russia.\n\nThat question remains unanswered.

In August, Mr. Cohen went so far as to give Congress a point-by-point rebuttal of the dossier\u2019s allegations that he has deep ties to Russian officials. He specifically denied one of the best-known allegations against him \u2014 that he secretly met in Prague with a Russian official last summer.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyers say that Fusion acted recklessly and then disseminated the dossier to reporters without being able to back up its explosive claims.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Longtime Lawyer Sues BuzzFeed and the Firm Behind Russia Dossier", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "Instead of requiring states to increase and strengthen coverage, C.M.S. will now allow them to use waivers to promote \u201cupward mobility\u201d or \u201cresponsible decision-making.\u201d If those sound good to you, understand that they are known euphemisms for work requirements. The key point, as the Medicaid analyst Jessica Schubel points out, is that neither of those goals align with Medicaid\u2019s mission of providing comprehensive health insurance to low-income people. They would instead, she said, \u201clet states kick people off coverage if they don\u2019t comply with new requirements that have nothing to do with health insurance.\u201d\n\nPeople losing coverage could suffer severe harm. A study of Medicaid expansion in Kentucky and Arkansas found that it led to significant gains in access to care, financial security and health, with increases in the share of low-income adults going for checkups, getting regular care for chronic conditions and reporting that they are in excellent health. It also found large decreases in the share of people struggling to pay medical bills and relying on hospital emergency rooms for care. Under the new waivers, these gains will be reversed.\n\nIt\u2019s also essential to recognize that Medicaid work requirements won\u2019t work. There\u2019s no evidence that Medicaid discourages work, which comports with common sense: You can\u2019t pay rent or buy groceries with health coverage. About 80 percent of able-bodied adult Medicaid recipients are part of working families (that is, either they or their spouses work), and about 60 percent work themselves. Among adults on Medicaid who don\u2019t work and could be subject to the work requirement, more than a third have a chronic health problem or disability, about half take care of their family or go to school, and just under 10 percent can\u2019t find work.\n\nIt\u2019s far more likely that Medicaid work requirements will backfire, at least in terms of improving beneficiaries\u2019 living standards. By providing coverage for workers in jobs that are unlikely to provide such benefits, and by helping to stabilize the finances of people with illnesses, Medicaid has been found to help people stay employed or find work.\n\nOf course, not all of the Republicans\u2019 efforts to shrink Medicaid are occurring through executive, as opposed to congressional, action. The new tax law\u2019s repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate could, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, cut five million from the Medicaid rolls by 2027. That\u2019s because, absent the mandate, fewer low-income people will find out that they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid, especially in expansion states.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Medicaid Work Requirement Will Backfire", "authors": []}

But I think it was more constructive than that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump used the occasion to suggest restoring the banned congressional practice of allowing members to designate money for projects in their districts, a process known as earmarks but conventionally called pork. For Mr. Trump, it was a nod to Washington institutionalists who say such spending makes it easier to forge legislative compromises, but it seemed to conflict with his promise to \u201cdrain the swamp.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s outreach to Democrats came on the same day the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president announced that he would travel this month to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, a gathering that is ground zero for the wealthy elite and globalist leaders that he has derided.

Among presidential speeches, the State of the Union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally \u2014 the form of oratory at which he excels. So even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening.\n\nHe became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech \u2014 surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since Ronald Reagan had the dubious idea of turning the State of the Union into a report card on the State of the People.\n\nThe rhetorical flourishes in last night\u2019s address owed much to Reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) \u201cfrom welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\u201d\n\nA few hard edges were smoothed away.
