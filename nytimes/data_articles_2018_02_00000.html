The purchase comes with the right to make the building even larger by adding about eight stories, or 300,000 square feet. The current owner obtained the necessary zoning change in 2011 when it wanted to erect a 12-story hotel over the Buddakan restaurant, on Ninth Avenue.\n\nNeither side has made clear what Google\u2019s plans for the building are, and whether the popular food market will stay in place. But getting rid of tenants with leases would be a long-term process.\n\nTech employment in New York City reached 128,600 last year, according to the comptroller\u2019s report. But analysts using a broader definition of tech put the total at nearly 326,000.

In a snapshot of recent tech-sector activity, those companies have leased or renewed leases for 21 million square feet of office space in the last 10 years alone. If telecom companies are included, that number jumps to 26.8 million.\n\nNine years ago, tech firms had only 17.6 million square feet of office space, or 5 percent of the office market.\n\nTech\u2019s Growing Footprint in New York City The number of tech workers in New York City was growing faster than in Silicon Valley as of 2013.

When companies grow and need a more robust infrastructure, she said, some tech firms are migrating to traditional office towers.\n\nSalesforce, the cloud computing company based in San Francisco, moved its three Manhattan offices into a 41-story skyscraper at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue. The Salesforce logo replaced the MetLife branding atop the building.\n\nAnd Spotify, the music streaming company, is moving from 620 Sixth Avenue and several other locations into nearly half-a-million square feet at the 4 World Trade Center skyscraper in Lower Manhattan.\n\nBut it was Google that prompted real estate brokers, landlords, city officials and economists to sit up and take notice of the burgeoning tech sector a decade ago.\n\nIn 2006, the company moved into 111 Eighth Avenue, a massive onetime shipping terminal, with tenants that included Verizon, Sprint, Web MD and BarnesandNoble.com. The building sat atop a high-powered fiber artery snaking along Manhattan\u2019s West Side.

Not so long ago, blue-collar tenants had paid a very modest $6 per square foot for space there.\n\nBut Google\u2019s need for space continues unabated. The company has been unable to dislodge the other tenants at 111 Eighth Avenue as quickly as it had hoped. The company has leased large blocks of space nearby, at Pier 57; at 85 10th Avenue, another former Nabisco cookie factory, between 15th and 16th Streets; and at Chelsea Market.\n\nFacebook has about 5,000 employees now in the Chelsea neighborhood, occupying a total of 900,000 square feet.\n\nOwning Chelsea Market would enable the company to create a campus akin to its headquarters in California, albeit one that is more vertical.

Neal of Massachusetts, a Democrat, have pushed an effort that would attempt to stabilize plans with 30-year loans from the Treasury Department, as long as plan managers could demonstrate the money would put them on a path to solvency \u2014 and not invest it in risky assets. Fiscal hawks, like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, warn that the bill could leave taxpayers responsible for as much as $100 billion if the loans are not repaid. Backers of the bill say taxpayers should not end up paying a dime.\n\n\u201cThis is beyond party affiliation, this really cuts to the root of what retirement is going to look like,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who will be a member of the special committee and has been working to recruit more House Republicans to support his proposal.\n\nMr. Neal has six Republican co-sponsors on his bill and said that several others have expressed support. A handful of Republican senators have also been engaged on the issue, including Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who said this month that she was pleased the spending bill \u201crecognizes the urgent need to help tens of thousands of retired coal miners.\u201d", "title": "1.5 Million Retirees Await Congressional Fix for a Pension Time Bomb", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "But the people most affected by these proposed changes \u2014 residents in places like Mindong \u2014 say they feel a sense of powerlessness, as if awaiting a storm that they cannot control.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany are less concerned about disputes over the clergy than about a hollowing out of Catholic life in the Chinese countryside. Others say that the outside world\u2019s binary view of Chinese Catholicism \u2014 of loyalist underground church members and government flunkies \u2014 misses more subtle realities on the ground.\n\n\u201cThis is something higher-ups will decide,\u201d said Huang Xiaofeng, 40, a shopkeeper catering to pilgrims who visit a holy mountaintop cave. \u201cWe believers just go to church and pray.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican has already asked Guo Xijin, the underground bishop in Mindong, to yield his leadership of an estimated 70,000 Catholics to a government-appointed cleric who commands about 10,000 followers \u2014 a huge concession to Beijing.\n\nBishop Guo, 59, who has been a priest in Mindong since 1984, said in an interview that he was willing to accede if it helped heal the long split between the underground and government churches.\n\nBut he added that it would not address larger problems that are diminishing Catholicism here. \u201cThe main problem is believers\u2019 educational level and spiritual foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have belief, but there is no depth to it.\u201d\n\nBishop Guo was referring to the fact that while Catholicism is strongest in poorer, rural parts of China, the countryside is emptying out. A few decades ago 80 percent of Chinese lived in rural areas; today only half do.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn areas like Mindong, that has meant a collapse of churchgoing. Bishop Guo estimates that more than a third of local Catholics have left Mindong to find work elsewhere. Almost all young people are gone, leaving villages dotted with churches used only on a rotating basis by a dwindling elderly population.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMindong\u2019s problems reflect a larger trend. According to surveys of the official and underground churches by Anthony Lam, a researcher with the Holy Spirit Study Center in Hong Kong, the total number of Catholics in China peaked around 2005 at 12 million and has since declined to 10 million.\n\nThat makes Catholicism the smallest major religious group in China, and the only one that is shrinking \u2014 even as other faiths, especially Buddhism and Protestantism, have grown rapidly amid a nationwide religious revival.\n\nVisitors to the Bishop Bai Cave near Mr. Huang\u2019s shop speak constantly of these challenges. Many are migrants working in cities like Shanghai. In the days before the Chinese New Year, they come home to see their parents and visit holy sites like the cave, where a Dominican friar hid from Qing dynasty soldiers in the 1700s before being executed.\n\nBut few of them are practicing Catholics any more, and their own children are growing up without the faith. There are Catholic churches in the cities but they seldom reach out to migrants.\n\nLin Gang, 36, who left Mindong to open a shop in Changzhou, a prosperous city on the Yangtze River, said he rarely had time for church and that almost none of his neighbors there are Catholic.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf we could get off Sundays for Mass it would be easier,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have to keep the store open to take care of my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne\u2019s faith grows weaker when one goes out to work,\u201d he added.\n\nThe roots of the church\u2019s problems in China go far back. The Qing emperor banned Christianity for about a century before Western powers forced the dynasty to let missionaries in again. When the Communists gained control of China in 1949, Catholicism was hit especially hard because of the Vatican\u2019s strident opposition to communism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Catholicism survived as a clan-based, rural religion without its old missionizing impulse.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1957, the authorities added to the church\u2019s problems by setting up the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association to replace the Vatican in appointing the clergy and give Beijing\u2019s atheist leaders control over the church.\n\nMany worshipers resisted. They boycotted the government church in favor of underground churches led by clergy members whom they elected. Over time, the Vatican approved most of these locally appointed clergy. That created two Catholic lineages in China: those appointed by Beijing and those by the Vatican.\n\nThis is the rift that is the focus of the current negotiations. But the picture is more complicated than it seems.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany government-appointed bishops, for example, have quietly received the Vatican\u2019s blessing. And Pope Benedict XVI said in 2007 that loyal Catholics could worship in Chinese government-approved churches.\n\nEven the term \u201cunderground\u201d is largely a misnomer now. Although some clergy have been detained and face harassment, others mostly operate in the open. In many places, underground Catholics have built their own churches, sometimes huge cathedrals, without government interference.\n\nBishop Guo, for example, lives in a seven-story residence next to a twin-spired church clad in white tiles. Mindong is dotted with dozens of these churches, many of them with soaring spires, chapels, residences and nunneries, all of them technically illegal.\n\nMoreover, many of the churches received construction permits with the help of Zhan Silu, the government-appointed bishop to whom the Vatican has asked Bishop Guo to cede his position.\n\nBishop Zhan declined to be interviewed, but local Catholics say he signed off on the permits to reach out to underground believers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt shows it\u2019s not underground at all,\u201d said Eugenio Menegon, a professor of history at Boston University, who wrote a book on Catholicism\u2019s deep roots in Mindong. During his time in the region, he said, he found that the unofficial clergy often gets along fine with the local authorities.\n\nPhoto\n\nTensions arise when one side pushes the other. Recently, the pressure has come from Beijing, which has adopted new regulations that are meant in part to curb underground churches.\n\nThe Vatican\u2019s desire to have Bishop Guo step aside in favor of Bishop Zhan also worries residents. Many feel they should be consulted on the appointment of their spiritual leader \u2014 an issue that could come up in other Chinese dioceses where the future of as many as 30 underground bishops is uncertain.\n\nOne lay nun whose order has deep roots in Mindong said Bishop Zhan would have difficulty running the diocese because most worshipers are in the underground church and support Bishop Guo. Still, she said that if the Vatican recognized Bishop Zhan, she would obey.\n\nThough weakened by migration and buffeted by change, Mindong remains a place where one can still sense the world of the Dominican friars who first brought Catholicism to these hilly shores in the 1630s \u2014 and the powers of faith that can outlast politics.\n\nNot far from Bishop Guo\u2019s cathedral is Shangwan Village, the burial site of a Catholic priest named Miu Zishan who was persecuted by Communist zealots in the 1960s and died shortly after.\n\nIn front of his grave, Wu Saiqing, 49, was sleeping on a stone bed. Locals believe that doing so cures illnesses, and so Ms. Wu was there for a midday nap, hoping to improve her health.\n\nMs. Wu said her family\u2019s Catholic roots dated to the 17th century. Two of her siblings serve the official church, one as a nun and one as a priest. But she attends an underground church.\n\n\u201cIt makes no difference to me,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cIt is the Lord we believe in.\u201d", "title": "10 Million Catholics in China Face Storm They Can\u2019t Control", "authors": ["Ian Johnson"]}

Figuring out how, when and where to get your news is key to mental health.\n\n\n\nStudents wrote about downloading too many apps and getting too many news alerts as they began phase two of their news challenge. But as they began to fiddle with sources and platforms, they figured out what worked for them, whether it was podcasts, videos, briefings and other shorter ways of getting news; apps like Flipboard that aggregate a number of sources; or watching satirical news to relax after reading too much \u201creal\u201d news.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I appreciated about turning over this new leaf was how in control I was of my media consumption. No longer was I hearing random stories just because of their momentum; I was reading the stories that I wanted to read \u2014 ones I wanted to learn from,\u201d wrote Michelle Yu, 17, of Cresskill High School.\n\nJaredth Thor, 16, of Merced High School, realized watching CNN 10 was a lot easier than reading The New York Times:\n\nI\u2019ve been noticing myself going to CNN 10 first instead of The New York Times. I really did not understand at first but then I realize that I would rather watch a 10 minute video with Carl Azuz talking about trivial events rather than read a gigantic essay that goes back and forth, using rhetorical devices, counterarguments, analysis, etc. That is the beauty of having a news outlet that promotes videos, the information comes quick and is easily gathered turning a chore of reading into a fast paced interesting session of knowledge.\n\nAnd Grace C., 14, of River Dell High School, noticed that, as a lesbian, she\u2019d rather read about news affecting the LGBTQ community on social media because she can connect with others:\n\nWhen I learned about the Pulse Nightclub shooting or Roy Moore\u2019s beliefs from traditional news, I felt vulnerable.

Usually I talk to him for a minute about politics and I\u2019m bored out of my mind, but this time I felt something different. This conversation that, at one time, would put me to sleep, was appealing to me now. I knew this was a product of the news diet. I talked with Uncle John about things I didn\u2019t know about. One of which as was his career as a NYPD Police Officer. I connected with his stories now after listening to countless stories about his experiences. One such story caught my attention. It was 1974 and my uncle was working with the 7th Precinct. He was on a burglary call and he found the suspect going out the fire escape. He chased him across the roof, and while running it gave way and he fell off the building. He told me how he was feeling as he felt the roof give out from under his feet and how he felt while falling to the ground. It gave me a more in depth look at how an officer thinks and a different perspective to all the news stories concerning police officers, and a chance to see how they feel in a situation that the media makes them out to be the bad guys.\n\nNow, we invite you to read the essays of our seven top winners.\n\n_________\n\nEssay Winners\n\nKatie Golden, 14, River Dell Regional High School:\n\nShocking stories change us. Almost six years ago, my grandpa first introduced me to the horrors of the Holocaust and World War II. Drafted at the age of 17, a warrior in the famous Battle of the Bulge where he suffered frost bite in his toes to this day from interminable days without shoes, he was one of the last American soldiers to be stationed in Germany when war concluded. Why did he tell me these gruesome stories I knew hewished to forget? So that I wouldn\u2019t forget. So that it would never happen again. I\u2019m sure my grandfather wanted me to be informed about the world \u2026 and I thought I was. I knew all about the teen world: Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2019s on-and-off romance, what fashion was especially trending in November, and what color dress matches my personality (thank you, People magazine!) I even read the sports section of the Daily News, and usually directed the basketball conversations in my friend group. The deficiencies in my media diet became clear when I was at a Global Connections Club meeting. We were discussing ways to help the Rohingya Refugees, a group of people being targeted for \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d The presenter said they were the \u201cleast wanted group in the world.\u201d She shared news stories about villages being burned and women being raped. I was shocked when the presenter compared the events in Myanmar to the Holocaust. Their situation sure sounded like the people my grandfather once told me about. Hadn\u2019t we all sworn it would never happen again? At this moment, I experienced a new revelation about myself: my eyes were on all the wrong stories. Terror was continuing to dominate our world, even in today\u2019s world. As part of the New York Times Media Challenge, I needed to alter my media intake, and as a result of my club meeting, I decided to look for news about the forgotten people of the world: poor people affected by new tax laws, immigrants facing deportation, women silenced by sexual harassment, and Beijing workers forced out of their homes. Like my grandpa, these reporters were exposing atrocities. They were telling stories of human suffering that they would probably like to forget too. News is the microphone for the forgotten, powerless voices of the world. The media is the shield in the current war our world wages on Human Rights. It speaks for victims of persecution, harassment, deportation, and ethnic cleansing. We can\u2019t limit ourselves to the fun news, but consider the heavy and sometimes gruesome stories the news may cover. The news exists simplistically to help and investigate when anyone is suffering. If we don\u2019t acknowledge the media, these barbarities will happen, again, and again, and again.\n\nHelen, 14, River Dell Regional High School:\n\nThe day had just started and I was sitting in a classroom with two uneven pigtails, one untied lace, half of my best friend necklace, and zero English skills. Already, I felt lost. Having just moved from Germany, I was attempting to participate in a geography game. As my classmates kept putting up correct answers, I didn\u2019t have even one. Unless I could master the new language, I would have no power. I had a flashback to those times six years ago when my teacher asked me to participate in the New York Time Media Challenge. My writing class was talking about the news, and a wave of opinions drowned me. Like my former self, I was lost again. It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the news, but none of it was about the government. I read about Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s $400 million dollar painting and Europe\u2019s first underwater restaurant, but I didn\u2019t know how the tax bill was going to affect my family or how the Russian investigation tainted our election. I realized I had no idea what was going on in politics. It appeared I had a new language to master. Because I am a busy high school student, I didn\u2019t have much extra time, so I decided I would watch ABC Nightly News and hope for some better results. I began following the Congressional tax bill, Michael Flynn\u2019s guilty plea, and even the Alabama senate race. I began to form so many different opinions. Politics is a topic no family wants to talk about over Thanksgiving dinner, but after this experiment, I had couldn\u2019t wait to share my thoughts. (Surprisingly, I still have relatives talking to me.) There are many people who don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening in politics and rather than reading the news they decide to tune it out. Not paying attention to the news isn\u2019t going to make you understand it. The more you immerse yourself in the news, like a language, the more you will understand it. For those out there who believe that following the tax bill is too complicated, they are becoming submissive. They are willing to sit back and accept whatever the government is handing them. If you engage yourself in the media and follow that tax bill, you can write letters, fight for what you believe, and possibly change the direction of laws. Rather than believing the government will do the right thing, you will know, and can hold them accountable. Knowledge is power.\n\nIsabella Jimenez, 17, Canterbury School:\n\nIt\u2019s overwhelming, really. My phone chimes at least 100 times a day, my push notifications filled with news headlines. Facts, opinions, controversies, and current events are constantly hurled at me a million miles an hour, and in the of age of technology, it\u2019s impossible to hide. It all becomes white noise, and it is hard to differentiate what is fact from fiction. Although I routinely read the news and stay up-to-date on what\u2019s going on in the world, I sometimes feel trapped. The news, despite its ability to empower, inspire, and educate many, has also acted as the carrier of anger, burden, and tragedy. My father had just picked up my sister and I from school. The second he turned on the car, he immediately shut off the radio, afraid of what my sister and I might overhear. I wasn\u2019t na\u00efve: my whole school had been in lockdown for the last five hours. I asked my dad what was wrong and he answered with silence, leaving me with an empty feeling in my stomach. On our way home, we stopped by Dunkin\u2019 Donuts/Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, because even at 13 years old, I already was a coffee dependent life-form. I remember walking in, hand and hand with my younger sister, and seeing \u201cBreaking News: Mass Shooting in Newtown Connecticut at local elementary school. \u201d flashing in big red letters on the screen and people on the floor helplessly crying. That whole afternoon, my eyes were glued to the TV as the number began to rise, finally stopping at 26. For the next couple of weeks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to school, turn on the TV, or even leave my house to go have breakfast at the local diner as information hungry news reporters infiltrated my town. I was trapped. Everywhere I went, the news followed. Living in Connecticut, the news is my means to escape to the world beyond my small high school and rural hometown. It has brought me face to face with President Trump, climate change, the refugee crisis, and with the victims of other mass shootings. Before experimenting with my news diet, I regularly pressured myself to read the news, reminding myself the importance of a globalized perspective and having this information as \u201csocial currency.\u201d I never took into consideration the toll it would all have on me and never realized the power I had to chose the news I wanted to consume. Participating in the news audit and reading almost every article that popped up into my notification feed and watching the TV, left me tired and frustrated. It made me feel as I did in the following weeks after the Sandy Hook tragedy: trapped. I realized through this project the importance of having a balanced news diet: an ideal combination of all perspectives from all news realms. Butmost of all, I recognized that sometimes, you need to take a step back in order to process, reflect, and breathe.\n\nMatthew Kaufman, 15, River Dell Regional High School:\n\nWhile a teen sits and plays Call of Duty, a North Korean missile sails toward our country. The teen is oblivious as he strives to reach level 3 on the game. This seems like a scene out of Ray Bradbury\u2019s Fahrenheit 451. In thatnovel, citizens watch their full wall TVs, unaware of the warplanes flying above them. Participating in the New York Times Media Challenge, I found that I might be the teen described above and could star in a modern-day version of this book. Step one of this experiment required completing a review of my news diet. After monitoring my main sources of news, I discovered a blatant flaw in my news intake: I only read the headlines. Not only was it just the headlines, but I would only look at the five recommended articles that were displayed as widgets on my phone. If I found an article that was interesting, I might read some of it, or tell someone else about it. But if they asked me a question about a specific detail, I would answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I only read the headline.\u201d Embarrassed by my lack of depth, I challenged myself to dive into entire articles, as opposed to the five ones displayed in a preview. What I got from this experience was a deeper understanding of the content. I took away more information than I would have from just reading the headlines, and I felt more content with myself after this experience. One article that stood out to me was from BuzzFeed. The headline stated that immigration officers continued to arrest illegal immigrants in Florida during Irma, even though they promised not to. The headline made the officers seem like villains, but when I read the whole article I saw both sides of the accusation. Headlines can show one-sided arguments, while reading the article in detail gives you all the information needed to comprehend a topic. Ray Bradbury warned us back in 1953 about what our society was becoming. Captain Beatty is one of the men in charge of keeping books out of peoples\u2019 hands. He describes why the world came to be the way that it is, and we are quickly becoming that society. Beatty says that all people want are, \u201csnap endings.\u201d I think this describes our world today perfectly. People don\u2019t read the whole book; they skip to the last page. They don\u2019t want to take the time to digest what they\u2019ve been given. I realized this after my experiment. I am becoming what Bradbury feared. We all are. It\u2019s time for our society to get out of the express lane.\n\nWynn Maloney, 18, Canterbury School:\n\nUnconsciously, as it must be for many other eighteen year olds, my news diet was bland, lazy, and lacking effort. The only time I would ever discover news would be when I was tapping through my snap stories on Snapchat until I reached the discover section of the screen, or scrolling through my Instagram feed when I would come across a Barstool sports post. Occasionally, I would click on an alert from the news app on my iPhone when I was trying to clear my notifications, but I would find myself lost in the article I had just entered. I was absent and blind to what was going on around me in the world, I admit it. Once I realized the isolation I had put myself through that had prevented me from not only becoming an educated citizen of society, but also becoming aware of my surroundings, I decided it was time to change up my news diet. My first step was to turn on my brain and open my eyes in order to become more aware whenever I would come across a piece of news so I didn\u2019t just scroll or tap away to something more interesting to my tastes. Slowly, I noticed myself wanting to read the whole article or post whenever I would come across news, no matter the topic. Then, my second step was to turn on all my notifications in my news app in order to spark more news action in my day to day life. Once the news started to come to me, I would click on every notification and read up on the article. If I found myself lost, I would simply search the background of the topic through other news sources. The chase through my news app to catch the next update on particular stories I was following had become like gambling at a casino, every time I won, or found an amazing or interesting news piece, I was left hungry for more. Ever since I have implemented these two simple steps into my life I have found that I feel like I can contribute to society through participating in intriguing conversations pertaining to up-to-date news. I also feel as if I am able to make personal connections to many day to day issues through the feelings that arise within me once I read many articles that address national and even international issues. I was once an 18-year-old girl who unhealthily and lazily consumed my news, but now I am still that eighteen year old girl who now looks forward to educating myself and consuming every ounce of knowledge I can obtain through news, and for that I am grateful for my news diet project.\n\nOlivia McCormack, 14, The Franklin School Of Innovation:\n\nThis project was an eye-opener, revealing several things including the substantial amount of news I got daily. The latter part of the project inspired me to learn what I could about our current world. I started with a 24 hour period where I recorded all the news taken in. I found the news I got was mainly background noise with no focused time, and with news taken in all at once, so for my news diet mix up, I chose to change this. My planwas to do two things: listen to NPR news podcasts and read CNN articles on my phone. The first week I quickly found that the mornings were not the time for focused news, so I changed my intake time to in the car or ondeck before swim practice. During this experience, I found myself inspired and powerless with many issues. I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing about all the sexual harassment allegations and denials. People denying these brave women who are speaking out while knowing they will be pushed around. For a month I listen to coverage of people giving brave testimonies, while men in power were denying and bashing on these women. I was left heartbroken and questioning; what kind of world is this where there is no equality? I don\u2019t mean just in this matter, I see it everywhere, people not making something as simple as a cake for the lone reason the clients were gay, it\u2019s just so unconstitutional. I found that another time I had to stop listening to the news was during coverage of the terrorist attack in Egypt. I just couldn\u2019t bear to hear any more about the horrific things people do to each other. Still, there were times the news I heard excited me, these were times where things like advancements in Muller\u2019s investigation where people were finally paying for their crimes, or when the transgender woman was elected in Virginia an example of how we are coming closer to true equality. This project left me knowing that the news is a very valuable part of life in this country. I also realized that without the news, I would be as innocent as a kindergartner, so I the news is needed in order to be a valuable member of society. Throughout my experience in the new diet mix up, I know that if I ever want to be a valuable member of society I will need to be as informed as I can be. I hope to do so by finding the right news diet and to be able to find places where I can speak up and stand out. One needs a healthy amount of news in life to a point that you are informed but not overwhelmed. Overall, I learned that there are multiple issues that we as a society need to fix and that our news intake should be enough that we are informed, but not to the point that we\u2018re overwhelmed.\n\nJocelyn Savard, 16, Hoggard High School:\n\nEach day, I attend a swim practice for about three hours. As soon as it ends, us, being teenagers go straight to our phones. My friends phones are filled with text messages, Snapchats, and missed calls. Of course, mine has all those things too but thrown in are news article headlines. If I have time, I will immediately read the articles. If I don\u2019t have time then, I make sure I get to them relatively soon. Many people in my community are not receiving any sources of news. Physical deliver-to-your-doorstep newspapers are rare in households now because of the internet. But how many of the people not receiving newspapers read them online daily? If the generation above us is not informed, how can we be expected to be? Most teenagers\u2019s only source of news are the gossip articles at the grocery store checkout lines. What sort of condition will our country be in twenty years when it\u2019s run by a generation who only knows about their individual lives performed until that point? Possibly more concerning than the lack of knowledge is the lack of consistency. I read everything from the \u00fcber conservative Washington Times to the extremely liberal New York Times. Each article the story changes; in one I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that will save the country\u2019s economy by saving x amount of money each year. Then, I go to the next article on my list and I\u2019m reading about the bill President Trump passed that is dooming the country\u2019s economy by losing x amount of money each year. As I\u2019m more left leaning, I tend to believe the more liberal sources which would be great except I have right leaning friends who believe the conservative sources. We are truly a divided country. If I weren\u2019t reading a wide range of news sources would I realize the biases? And despite reading several news sources, some such as USA Today (notoriously neutral), often times I don\u2019t know what the full truth is. Again, how can we be expected to lead a country where we only know a biased history of it, if any? During my audit, possibly the only new thing I realized was how negative all the news intake I was receiving constantly was. I read about poisonous cities, Trump\u2019s mistakes, and falling stocks. I didn\u2019t have articles on people beating cancer, communities coming together or good political choices. It seems that news has always been this way but it can still be linked to the lack of consumption of news from everyone of all ages in our country. Someday, I hope to leave swim practice with articles written by opposite political affiliations having consistent facts and possibly one story that would make anyone smile. I have hope that we can change the way we perceive the news, possibly by changing the news first, so that my generation will be able to grow to our full potential and lead well in coming years.\n\n_________\n\nRunners-Up\n\nShreya Aggarwal, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\nAlexis, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\nChristopher Burmaster, 15, River Dell Regional High School\n\nMelissa Canales, 17, TERRA Environmental Research Institute\n\nOlivia Chislett, 16, the American School in England\n\nEllyn Fritz, 17, Canterbury School\n\nMlawson19, 17, Exeter High School\n\nOlivia, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOlivia, 18, Cresskill High School\n\n\n\nSpencer Schultz, 17, Jamesville-DeWitt High School\n\nMax Wilson, 16, Cresskill High School\n\n\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nJulia Bialek, 17, Horace Greeley High School\n\nAndrew Caslin, 14, River Dell High School\n\nLeah Fishman, 14, River Dell High School\n\nGabriel, 13, Franklin School of Innovation\n\nQuinn Hagerman, 16, Merced High School\n\njhamburger, 16\n\nIsabella Kahn, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\nAlex Main, 17, Landstown High School\n\nMary, 16, Merced High School\n\nOlivia, 18, Cresskill High School\n\nSamantha, 17, Merced High School\n\nClara Tomann, 17, Canterbury School\n\nMegan Tracy, 17, Canterbury School\n\nJosh Wiesenfeld, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\nMichelle Yu, 17, Cresskill High School\n\nJoanne Yang, 14, Seoul International School\n\nSherry Zhu, 14, River Dell Regional High School\n\n_________\n\nThank you to our judges, who included not only Learning Network staff, but also Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, the executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.\n\nInterested in more student challenges?

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cI\u2019d like to consider myself a perpetual competitor,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cI\u2019m blessed with that.\u201d\n\nThe Orioles finished 75-87 last season for their first losing record since 2011. But they stood just a game out of a wild-card spot as late as Sept. 5, with Beckham fueling an unlikely surge. Acquired from the Rays in a July 31 trade for the Class A pitcher Tobias Myers, Beckham hit safely in his first 12 games for Baltimore, batting .531. His final August average was .394, with 15 multi-hit games.\n\n\u201cThe first time a guy is traded, you\u2019ve got a window of opportunity you can walk through,\u201d Orioles Manager Buck Showalter said. \u201cBut I never dreamed he would have the month he had. I mean, he was unbelievable. There wasn\u2019t a better player in the American League for a month.\u201d\n\nDan Duquette, the Orioles\u2019 executive vice president for baseball operations, knows all about players thriving in new environments. In 2013, he traded a player who was 27, still with his first team, and who had never quite translated his talent to consistent success. That player was Jake Arrieta, who went on to stardom for the Chicago Cubs.\n\nBeckham was the Arrieta of the Rays: 27 years old last summer, in his fourth major league season with his only team, undeniably talented but going nowhere. The Orioles had seen plenty of Beckham, in spring training and the A.L. East, and they liked his tools.\n\n\u201cHe can run, he can throw, he\u2019s an excellent athlete,\u201d Duquette said. \u201cIt looked to me like he was learning how to hit and use his power. And he was hungry \u2014 he wanted to play every day, and he didn\u2019t get the opportunity.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

He struggled that month but still finished with a .306 average for the Orioles and a .782 on-base plus slugging percentage for the entire season \u2014 matching Machado and ranking seventh among 20 everyday major league shortstops.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Beckham, it was vindication for all the time he believed he should have been starting for the Rays. He missed 50 games in 2012 after a second positive test for marijuana, and missed most of 2014 with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. But he never understood why the Rays acquired so many veteran shortstops \u2014 Yunel Escobar, Asdrubal Cabrera, Adeiny Hechavarria, Brad Miller, Matt Duffy \u2014 instead of seeing what he could do.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get locked in unless you\u2019re playing every day, unless you\u2019re given an opportunity to fail and they run you back out there,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cIf I go 0 for 4 in Tampa, I might not play for four days, and then the next at-bat I get might be against Zach Britton.\u201d\n\nAs a right-handed hitter, Beckham would often play against All-Star left-handers like Britton, Chris Sale and David Price, who combined to hold him to two hits in 28 at-bats with the Rays. His pedigree made his lack of playing time stand out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 1-1, so how does that happen?\u201d Beckham said, referring to first pick, first round. \u201cNow everyone\u2019s looking at me \u2014 \u2018he\u2019s not doing this, he\u2019s not playing well.\u2019 No, I\u2019m not playing at all.\u201d\n\nBeckham did play regularly for the Rays last season, mostly because of injuries to Miller and Duffy. Facing a logjam in late July, Tampa Bay traded him and promptly fell out of the playoff race. The Rays did not have a winning record after Aug. 11, and the tenure of their former top pick had ended with a thud.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe it as not working out. I really wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Rays General Manager Erik Neander said, explaining that, by the end, Beckham had finally blossomed. \u201cCertainly, what he accomplished in Baltimore further cemented that, and we\u2019re happy for him in that regard.\n\n\u201cFor us, hindsight helps a lot. But at the time with our infield situation, the way the at-bats were going to be allocated, we felt we were going to move someone, and that\u2019s the way we went.\u201d\n\nNeander said the Rays liked Myers and had depth in right-handed infielders like Beckham. They have since acquired even more, in deals that sent Longoria to San Francisco and starter Jake Odorizzi to the Minnesota Twins, right fielder Steven Souza Jr. to Arizona and left fielder Corey Dickerson to Pittsburgh. A rebuild is on for the Rays, and Beckham is happy in a city where nobody cares that he is not Buster Posey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGood for him for all the accolades he\u2019s gotten and deserves \u2014 he\u2019s a heck of a catcher, a heck of a baseball player,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cWith that being said, me getting a chance to play every day and getting on a winning ball club and a winning organization with the history of the Baltimore Orioles, I look to do the same thing.\u201d\n\nTo Beckham, there is simply no doubt. He will work as hard as he can to learn third base, but shortstop could be his again, if Machado is traded or leaves as a free agent next winter. Beckham knows he can still be a star, wherever the Orioles put him. It says so right on his back.\n\n\u201cI will be,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be. As long as I\u2019m playing every day, I\u2019m going to be a star player.\u201d", "title": "10 Years After He Went No. 1, Tim Beckham Can See Himself at the Top", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner", "On Baseball"]}

For the rest of you, pull up a blanket and settle in with Lisa Halliday\u2019s \u201cAsymmetry,\u201d a smart and ambitious debut novel that opens with a particularly literary-minded love affair. As my son said the first time he saw \u201cTitanic,\u201d at age 13, \u201cThings seem to be getting very kissy around here.\u201d\n\nGregory Cowles\n\nSenior Editor, Books\n\nTHE FRIEND, by Sigrid Nunez. (Riverhead, $25.) Nunez\u2019s allusive and charming new novel is about an unnamed woman living in a small apartment who inherits, after the suicide of a friend, his Great Dane. The book is about the writing life, sex and mentorship, in addition to pets. Its tone can be comic but is mostly \u201cmournful and resonant,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \u201cIt sheds rosin, like the bow of a cello. The woman grieves for her friend, who was her mentor and, if only once, her lover. His dog soothes her; they sleep in the same bed; he is a constant reminder of the man she misses.\u201d\n\nASYMMETRY, by Lisa Halliday. (Simon & Schuster, $26.) The first section of this debut novel follows Alice, a 20-something assistant at a publishing house who tumbles into a relationship with a man who bears a terrifically unabashed resemblance to Philip Roth (with whom Halliday had a relationship while in her 20s). The second section transports us to a holding room in London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, where Amar, an Iraqi-American economist, has been detained. The novel is \u201cscorchingly intelligent,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes, and it satisfies multiple appetites. \u201cIt\u2019s a clever comedy of manners set in Manhattan as well as a slowly unspooling tragedy about an Iraqi-American family, which poses deep questions about free will, fate and freedom, the all-powerful accident of one\u2019s birth and how life is alchemized into fiction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTHE HEART IS A SHIFTING SEA: Love and Marriage in Mumbai, by Elizabeth Flock.

In Saadawi\u2019s intense and surreal novel, an Iraqi junk peddler named Hadi starts to bring home the body parts of bomb victims, stitching them together in the hope that if he can create a whole corpse someone will give it a proper burial. The ensuing hallucinatory story is \u201cfunny and horrifying in a near-perfect admixture,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes.

(St. Martin\u2019s, $24.99.) Khan-Cullors, an activist and a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, wrote this memoir with the journalist Bandele. Khan-Cullors grew up poor in Los Angeles, and attended a gifted program in a middle school in Sherman Oaks, a nearby affluent neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s a persistent longing that threads through this book,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, \u201cnot so much for the consumerist dream represented by Sherman Oaks, but for the secure relationships she saw her wealthy, white classmates taking for granted.\u201d\n\nA MORE BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE HISTORY: The Uses and Misuses of Civil Rights History, by Jeanne Theoharis. (Beacon, $27.95.) This history revisits the hostile reception that greeted civil rights activists half a century ago. It\u2019s particularly attuned to how the legacies of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. have been co-opted into a narrative of uplift, with civil rights history sanitized for public consumption. \u201cAt bewildering moments like this one,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, \u201cit\u2019s clarifying to read a history that shows us how little we remember, and how much more there is to understand.\u201d", "title": "11 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the new year\u2019s best. Its 80 freehand renderings of different brain cells, as viewed through a microscope, helped prove that they are unconnected, communicating across tiny gaps called synaptic clefts, which earned Cajal a Nobel Prize in 1906.

This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works \u2014 a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris\u2019s \u201cMan at the Caf\u00e9\u201d (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration.

Mount Kumgang, or the \u201cDiamond Mountain,\u201d lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang\u2019s Olympic Stadium, but it\u2019s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. This melancholy beauty of a show, featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, assembles three centuries\u2019 worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics.

These massive wooden crests \u2014 in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows \u2014 served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met\u2019s recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a \u201csculpture\u201d divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own.

But that\u2019s not the reason to see it (or see it again); it was a hit then, and it has endured for more than four decades because it is a masterfully constructed adventure ride, filled with bruising set pieces, eerily convincing effects, quotable dialogue (they are, in fact, gonna need a bigger boat), and memorable characters.

But Nolan augments the storytelling with an appropriate stylistic flourish, presenting it in reverse chronological order, so that in each new scene, the viewer is as uncertain about what\u2019s happening as the protagonist. Replete with neo-noir styling and a cast of top-notch character actors (including Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Stephen Tobolowsky), \u201cMemento\u201d is a deliciously inventive mystery with a potent dose of melancholy right under its surface.\n\n\u2014\n\nKitty Winn and Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park.\u201d 20th Century Fox\n\n\u2018The Panic in Needle Park\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore \u201cSerpico,\u201d before \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d before even \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Al Pacino made his big-screen breakthrough in this 1971 drug drama from director Jerry Schatzberg (\u201cStreet Smart\u201d). As a heroin addict and street hustler whose nights and days are an endless search for money, drugs or both, Pacino is both scarily convincing and offhandedly charismatic; you get a sense of why his new girlfriend, Helen (Kitty Winn, also terrific), would fall for him, and also why she should stay far away. Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne\u2019s low-to-the-ground script and Schatzberg\u2019s gritty, neorealist-inspired photography create scenes that feel less written and staged than overheard and captured, resulting in an uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience.\n\n\u2014\n\nNatasha Lyonne in \u201cSlums of Beverly Hills.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures\n\n\u2018The Slums of Beverly Hills\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAmerican comedies don\u2019t deal in matters of class nearly as much as they could (and should), which is part of what makes this 1998 comedy from the writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\u201cThe Savages\u201d) unique, and valuable. Set in 1976, it concerns a lower-income family\u2019s attempts to keep the kids in good schools by dwelling in sketchy apartments right on the edge of Beverly Hills. Alan Arkin is a marvel as the hyper-neurotic patriarch, and David Krumholtz is uproariously funny as the unreasonably confident older son. But the showcase performer is Natasha Lyonne, warm and winning as the teenager daughter in the midst of a poorly-timed sexual awakening.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nA scene from \u201cThe Craft.\u201d Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018The Craft\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMisfits and weirdos will love this 1996 supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic boarding school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches\u2019 coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and director Andrew Fleming) nicely quenches one\u2019s thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it\u2019s not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.\n\n\u2014\n\nEva Mendes and Will Smith in \u201cHitch.\u201d Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018Hitch\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBetween \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cI Am Legend,\u201d Will Smith got so good at saving the world, he rarely got the chance to flex his considerable romantic charm. This 2005 hit filled that niche a bit, casting Smith as a relationship expert and one-on-one date coach whose latest client (a sweet and likable Kevin James) is something of a challenge \u2014 one that arrives just as he meets (and finds himself atypically tongue-tied around) the woman of his own dreams (Eva Mendes). Director Andy Tennant mines plenty of laughs from Smith\u2019s built-in swagger and James\u2019s customary oafishness, and he also has a great time turning those personas inside out. Smith and Mendes generate real chemistry, provoking a genuine rooting interest in the midst of this lightweight romp.\n\n\u2014\n\nMarlon Brando in \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Horizon Pictures\n\n\u2018The Chase\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA knockout ensemble cast \u2014 including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and Angie Dickinson \u2014 assembles for this swampy, boozy, atmospheric thriller, in which a small town is rocked by a prison escape that unlocks their secret affairs, desires and lesser instincts. The pacing is a little punchy and the proceedings are a tad overheated, but it\u2019s worth a watch for the skill of the performers (Brando is particularly strong as a sheriff who\u2019s rapidly approaching the end of his rope) and for the inventive direction of Arthur Penn, whom we see tinkering with some of the thematic and stylistic interests he harvested to greater effect for his next film, \u201cBonnie and Clyde.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nMireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, right, in \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Chris Large/AMC\n\n\u2018The Killing\u2019 (Seasons 1-2)\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNormally, the removal of the first two seasons of a mystery serial would be a real bummer. But this four-season crime drama is something of an exception, as the split between Season 2 and Season 3 signaled the end of one story (and the end of an era, changing out all but two of the key cast members, which happened again for the fourth) and the beginning of the next. The first two years of the series, based on the Danish crime show \u201cForbrydelsen,\u201d tell a story about the murder of a Seattle teen in meticulous detail \u2014 each episode covers just 24 hours of the investigation. Taut and disturbing, intricate and moody, \u201cThe Killing\u201d is the kind of meaty crime drama that sticks to your ribs.\n\n\u2014\n\nClockwise from top left: Cyril Figgis, Krieger, Cheryl, Pam Poovey, Sterling Archer and Ray Gillette in \u201cArcher.\u201d FX\n\n\u2018Archer\u2019 (Seasons 1-7)\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 14\n\n: March 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWhen it began in 2009, this animated FX comedy from Adam Reed sounded like a one-joke premise, and not exactly a fresh one either: an extended spoof on James Bond-style spy stories, set at a secret intelligence agency during an indeterminate and anachronistic pseudo-Cold War period. And yet it took flight (eight seasons and counting) thanks to the show\u2019s frisky writing, winking self-awareness, willingness to reboot itself entirely (full seasons have reset the narrative as a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d spoof and a private eye yarn), and most of all, the skills of the uproarious voice cast, including the \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Jessica Walters as another unstable mother and the \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d gem H. Jon Benjamin as the boozing, womanizing title character.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ms. Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) in \u201cZootopia.\u201d Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\n\u2018Zootopia\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 20\n\n: March 20 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOn the surface, there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly revelatory about a Disney movie with cuddly talking animals. What\u2019s fresh and fascinating about this 2016 smash Byron Howard and Rich Moore, however, is the way it takes the conventions of those movies and injects them with a subtle dose of social commentary \u2014 without turning preachy or detracting from its surface pleasures. Ginnifer Goodwin is plucky and charming as Judy Hopps, a bunny cop in a utopian city who is drawn into a mysterious case wherein tame animals are reverting to their wilder instincts. Jason Bateman is a marvelous counterpoint as the con-artist fox who leads her into the city\u2019s criminal underworld, creating a buddy cop dynamic that recalls \u201c48 HRS.\u201d as much as \u201cBambi.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) and Bob Hoskins in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit.\u201d Walt Disney Studios\n\n\u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 24\n\n: March 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cZootopia\u201d wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first tale about crime-solving anthropomorphic mammals in the big city. One of its biggest hits of the 1980s was this clever story about cartoon animals and cynical humans who exist together in 1940s Los Angeles, where the movie star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering a local tycoon. He hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a hard-boiled private eye, to clear his name, and they embark on a hilarious investigation of the animated movie industry, with cameo appearances by iconic characters from not only the Disney stable but also those of Warner Brothers, Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz. It\u2019s a treat for movie buffs and cartoon aficionados. It\u2019s also an entertaining potboiler, dipping into the juicy, \u201cChinatown\u201d-like mysteries and scandals of postwar Hollywood.\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left: Waris Ahluwalia, Michael Gambon, Anjelica Huston, Noah Taylor, Bud Cort, Bill Murray, Matthew Gray Gubler, Seu Jorge, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Phlippe Antonello/Touchstone Pictures\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u2019\n\nLeaving Netflix: March 26\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-style oceanographer and documentarian, in this frisky yet bittersweet comic drama from director Wes Anderson. Working for the first time with Noah Baumbach (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cFrances Ha\u201d) as his co-writer, Anderson indulges in an absurdist streak that meshes nicely with the familial discord and dry wit of his previous pictures. He also marshals one of his most impressive casts to date, which includes Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, who is both touching and goofy as Zissou\u2019s estranged son.\n\n\u2014\n\nInterested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

Other times the appeal is more idiosyncratic: a strong voice, a great story, a brilliant mind at play. This week\u2019s recommended titles offer distinctive and wide-ranging pleasures \u2014 beginning with a couple of distinctive and wide-ranging essay collections from Martin Amis and Zadie Smith, celebrated novelists who also rank among the best literary critics of their generations.

The fourth collection of Amis\u2019s nonfiction and Zadie Smith\u2019s new book of essays find these two celebrated writers, friends from different generations, addressing politics, aging, art and more. \u201cAmis\u2019s new book, like the collections that preceded it, is the product of a ferocious yet sensitive mind,\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \u201cEven when he is considering writers he\u2019s assessed many times before, his aim is so unerring that he resembles a figure out of Greek myth, firing arrows through ax-heads lined up in a row.\u201d Garner writes that Smith\u2019s \u201cFeel Free\u201d is a \u201cgentler ride,\u201d but in the best pieces, she \u201cpresses down hard as a cultural critic, and the rewards are outsize.\u201d\n\nHEART BERRIES: A Memoir, by Terese Marie Mailhot. (Counterpoint, $23.) Mailhot, whose early life on Seabird Island Indian Reservation in British Columbia was pocked with poverty, addiction and abuse, began working on this memoir when she had herself committed after a breakdown. In it, she reckons with the wages of intergenerational trauma. Members of her family had passed through Canada\u2019s brutal residential school system, which separated indigenous children from their families and cultures, and, in some cases, subjected them to physical and sexual abuse. The book is a \u201csledgehammer,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. It has \u201ca mixture of vulnerability and rage, sexual yearning and artistic ambition, swagger and self-mockery that recalls Chris Kraus\u2019s \u2018I Love Dick.\u2019\u201d\n\nRISE AND KILL FIRST: The Secret History of Israel\u2019s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman. Translated by Ronnie Hope. (Random House, $35.) Bergman, a journalist based in Israel, conducted a thousand interviews with political leaders and intelligence operatives for this history of Israel\u2019s secretive program of targeted assassinations. The result is \u201can exceptional work, a humane book about an incendiary subject,\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes. \u201cBlending history and investigative reporting, Bergman never loses sight of the ethical questions that arise when a state, founded as a refuge for a stateless people who were targets of a genocide, decides it needs to kill in order to survive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIN EVERY MOMENT WE ARE STILL ALIVE, by Tom Malmquist. (Melville House, $25.99.) Based on a true story, this searing autobiographical novel, translated from the Swedish by Henning Koch, depicts a father struggling to cope with the tragic loss of his partner just as their daughter is born. \u201cThis is narrative as raw material,\u201d Katie Kitamura writes in her review. \u201cA novel about permeability, \u2018In Every Moment We Are Still Alive\u2019 captures the jumbled sensory experience of being profoundly, catastrophically overwhelmed. \u2026 It\u2019s clear that Malmquist is explicitly interested in what can\u2019t be contained, what continues to trouble.\u201d", "title": "12 New Books We Recommend This Week", "authors": []}

So this is a great month for the Winter Olympics to arrive, filling our TV screens with hours and hours of skating, skiing and, yes, even curling.\n\nThe downside for television viewers who don\u2019t care about sports is that many of the networks and basic cable channels will effectively take this month off, rather than try to compete with the NBC Olympics juggernaut. (One major exception? NBC itself, which will be using the games as a launching pad for new series.)\n\nStreaming services and premium channels seem determined to fill in the gaps. From new series by the creators of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d and \u201cThe Killing\u201d to hard-hitting looks at opioid-dealing and the rise of Al Qaeda, here\u2019s what else we\u2019ll be talking about this month:\n\nA.P.

Bio\u2019\n\nStarted: Feb. 1, on NBC\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nGlenn Howerton took a leave of absence from \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d to star in this dark, strange sitcom, playing an accomplished academic who\u2019s forced to take a job as a high school teacher. Created in part by the quirky \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer-filmmaker Mike O\u2019Brien, \u201cA.P. Bio\u201d also stars Patton Oswalt, as the school\u2019s principal, who stands in the way of the new teacher\u2019s plan to turn the most gifted students into his minions in a mission of revenge. The series started airing Thursday, but the first episode is already streaming on Hulu, and the first three are on NBC.com.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nHBO\n\n\u20182 Dope Queens\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 2, on HBO\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe comedians Phoebe Robinson and Jessica Williams adapt their popular podcast and live stage show to television, in four one-hour episodes that tackle topics relevant to the hosts\u2019 experiences as young, black New Yorkers. Robinson and Williams will share screen time with some of their friends and favorite comics, along with high-profile guests including Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Stewart and Tituss Burgess from \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d The hybrid of talk show and stand-up showcase looks to offer fresh, funny insights into modern life in a diverse metropolis.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2018Altered Carbon\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 2, on\n\nFeb. 2, on Netflix Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIf the recent \u201cBlade Runner\u201d sequel didn\u2019t satisfy your thirst for futuristic detective tales, this adaptation of the novelist Richard Morgan\u2019s 2002 cyberpunk classic should do the trick. Joel Kinnanman (\u201cThe Killing\u201d) plays Morgan\u2019s gruff, tough action hero Takeshi Kovacs, a mercenary whose consciousness was stored away for hundreds of years before being slipped into a new human \u201csleeve\u201d and employed to solve a murder. The series combines stunning science-fiction imagery with a traditional film noir plot, putting both in service of disturbing speculation on how humanity might evolve \u2014 and in some cases become more depraved \u2014 in the centuries ahead.\n\n\u2014\n\nSHOWTIME\n\n\u2018The Trade\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 2, on Showtime\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe documentarian Matthew Heineman has shown an uncanny ability to gain access to hard-to-reach people and places, from the militias on the American-Mexican border in \u201cCartel Land\u201d to the Syrian citizen activists in \u201cCity of Ghosts.\u201d For Heineman\u2019s new five-part series \u201cThe Trade,\u201d he tackles the reality of America\u2019s opioid crisis by embedding with the people profiting from the problem \u2014 including the criminals and the cops \u2014 while also spending time with the users and their families, who\u2019ve seen their lives torn apart by addiction.\n\n\u2014\n\nNFL\n\n\u2018Super Bowl LII\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 4, on NBC\n\n\u2018XXIII Olympic Winter Games Opening Ceremony\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 9, on NBC\n\nThe TV audience has fragmented so much over the past several decades that pretty much the only broadcast Americans still watch en masse is the Super Bowl \u2026 even if much of that audience will be tuning in this year for the commercials and the Justin Timberlake halftime show. A week later, NBC will begin broadcasting the Winter Olympics from Pyeongchang, South Korea, and while Olympic viewership lagged for the most recent Games, in Rio, NBC should still dominate the prime-time ratings from the Feb. 9 through 25 \u2014 starting with an opening ceremony that should feature the kind of awe-inspiring pageantry even the sports-averse can enjoy.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2018Queer Eye\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 7, on Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA new roster of lifestyle experts replaces the groundbreaking \u201cFab Five\u201d of Bravo\u2019s original \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy,\u201d a series which, back in the early 2000s, helped diversify programming and establish the vibrancy of gay culture on television. The Netflix revival will venture beyond the New York home of the original, taking the panel\u2019s tips on how to dress, cook and behave to the rest of America.\n\n\u2014\n\nHBO\n\n\u2018Here and Now\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 11, on HBO\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe writer and producer Alan Ball (\u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d \u201cTrue Blood\u201d) returns to HBO with a new series that arrives shrouded in mystery. Described as a family drama set in Portland, Ore., \u201cHere and Now\u201d stars Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter as an upper-middle-class married couple who raises multiracial adopted children alongside their biological offspring. The show also contains some supernatural elements, with a character who begins experiencing visions. Regardless of whether \u201cHere and Now\u201d is ultimately filed under fantasy, melodrama or something else entirely, expect it to express Ball\u2019s usual fascination with dysfunctional relationships, and how they connect to our communal search for deeper meaning.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2018Seven Seconds\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 23, on Netflix\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nVeena Sud, who created \u201cThe Killing,\u201d is back with another gritty crime story combined with a moody study of urban life, this time based on the Russian movie \u201cThe Major.\u201d Regina King stars in this series as a Jersey City mom whose son is accidentally run over and killed by a police officer, exacerbating tensions between law enforcement and local black residents. The aftermath of the accident draws the private lives of several local citizens out into the open, exposing the fragility of a society riven with conflict.\n\n\u2014\n\nTBS\n\n\u2018Final Space\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 26, on TBS\n\n\n\nNot to be confused with Yahoo! Screen\u2019s dearly missed science-fiction sitcom \u201cOther Space,\u201d the wry animated genre parody \u201cFinal Space\u201d has the popular YouTube vlogger Olan Rodgers voicing both an astronaut named Gary and his cute-but-destructive pal, Mooncake. Conan O\u2019Brien\u2019s production company developed the series, which also features the voices of the geek TV favorites David Tennant (\u201cDoctor Who\u201d), Gina Torres (\u201cFirefly\u201d), Steven Yeun (\u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) and John DiMaggio (\u201cFuturama\u201d), in a story about interstellar adventurers investigating the outer limits of the universe.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nGood Girls\n\n\u2018Good Girls\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 26, on NBC\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe subversive \u201980s movie \u201cHow to Beat the High Cost of Living\u201d gets an update in writer Jenna Bans\u2019s \u201cGood Girls.\u201d This cockeyed crime drama follows some desperate suburbanites who pull a heist at their local market. In familiar \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d fashion, what starts out as a desperate quick-fix becomes more complicated when the mob gets involved. The core cast includes Christina Hendricks, Mae Whitman and Retta, which should make it a lot easier to root for these antiheroines to succeed.\n\n\u2014\n\nHulu\n\n\u2018The Looming Tower\u2019\n\nStarts: Feb. 28, on Hulu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe prolific documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney and the Oscar-nominated screenwriter Dan Futterman assemble top-shelf character actors \u2014 including Michael Stuhlbarg, Bill Camp, Peter Sarsgaard, Jeff Daniels, and Tahar Rahim \u2014 for this dramatization of Lawrence Wright\u2019s Pulitzer-winning book, \u201cThe Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11.\u201d Set mostly in the late 1990s, the ten-part series will look at how the turf wars between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. left the United States scandalously unprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cTalk Show: The Game Show\u201d (truTV, Feb. 1), \u201cAbsentia\u201d (Amazon, Feb. 2), \u201cCoach Snoop\u201d (Netflix, Feb. 2), \u201cStrike Back\u201d (Cinemax, Feb. 2), \u201cChannel Zero: Butcher\u2019s Block\u201d (Syfy, Feb. 7), \u201cHomeland\u201d (Showtime, Feb. 11), \u201cOur Cartoon President\u201d (Showtime, Feb. 11), \u201cThis Close\u201d (Sundance Now, Feb. 14), \u201cEverything Sucks!\u201d (Netflix, Feb. 16), \u201cMozart in the Jungle\u201d (Amazon, Feb. 16), \u201cThe Joel McHale Show with Joel McHale\u201d (Netflix, Feb. 18), \u201cMarseille\u201d (Netflix, Feb. 23), \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d (Netflix, Feb. 23), \u201cNotes from the Field\u201d (HBO, Feb. 24), \u201cAsh vs. Evil Dead\u201d (Starz, Feb. 25), \u201ciZombie\u201d (the CW, Feb. 26), \u201cLiving Biblically\u201d (CBS, Feb. 26), \u201cMcMafia\u201d (AMC, Feb. 26), \u201cUnREAL\u201d (Lifetime, Feb. 26), \u201cThe Voice\u201d (NBC, Feb. 26) and \u201cUnsolved: The Murders of Tupac and The Notorious B.I.G.\u201d (USA, Feb. 27).\n\n\u2014", "title": "12 Shows We\u2019ll Be Talking About in February", "authors": ["Noel Murray"]}

Tempos stay slow and voices tender in this Austin, Tex., duo\u2019s music, which is well suited to anyone who\u2019s ever loved Yo La Tengo\u2019s quieter moments. Their latest album, \u201cCranberry,\u201d unfolds like an afternoon whose warm mood you remember long after the details have faded.

With his round and crinkled baritone, Mr. Bey can turn jazz vocals into a vessel for close inspection and surprise (that beats the more typical role they play: delivering comfort and emotional payoff, without much work from the listener). Audiences in the 1960s knew him for his work in Andy and the Bey Sisters, a vocal trio, and in the \u201970s he staked out distinctive terrain in the funk-fusion landscape. But since the 1990s, Mr. Bey, who doubles on piano, has thrived as a soloist. He performs jazz standards and his own poetic originals, letting the songs open up and slow down and sometimes nearly dissolve on his tongue.\n\n212-243-2222, mintonsharlem.com\n\nGERALD CLAYTON QUARTET at Jazz Standard (through Feb. 18, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Mr. Clayton, a pianist with a lissome and prayerful touch, leads a quartet here featuring the bassist Yunior Terry, the drummer Obed Calvaire and the percussionist Gabo Lungo. The group is joined during this run by two special guests: On Friday, it\u2019s the young vibraphonist Joel Ross; on Saturday and Sunday, the alto saxophonist Yosvany Terry. All of these musicians can play with ease and assurance, as if submitting to some ecstatic momentum, but they get there by different routes. Mr. Clayton\u2019s piano playing cascades, illustrates and embellishes, whereas Mr. Ross likes to interpose and chatter, like a kinetic conversationalist. And Mr. Terry, on saxophone, treats the tousled rhythmic logic of Cuban rumba as his foundation, moving in arcs and dashes and sweeps of color.\n\n212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com\n\nCORCORAN HOLT at Ginny\u2019s Supper Club (Feb. 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Mr. Holt, a bassist known for his work alongside the saxophonist Kenny Garrett, moved to New York from Washington, D.C., more than a decade ago. The title of Mr. Holt\u2019s newly released debut album, \u201cThe Mecca,\u201d nods to the idea that New York is jazz\u2019s promised land. But the record\u2019s sound suggests something else: the proud complexity of his hometown\u2019s own musical history. (For much of the 20th century, after all, Washington was a jewel of black arts and letters nearly on par with Harlem.) There\u2019s the sturdy, Southern-tinged swing feel; the proud, muscular harmonies beneath the lead lines; the occasional hand-drum rhythms, suggesting a lifelong exposure to go-go music. He\u2019ll play songs from \u201cThe Mecca\u201d here with Keith Loftis on tenor saxophone, Ashlin Parker on trumpet, Benito Gonzalez on piano and McClenty Hunter on drums.\n\n212-421-3821, ginnyssupperclub.com\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Lowe doubles as an alto saxophonist and a kind of alternative cultural anthropologist. His histories of American popular music (\u201cThat Devilin\u2019 Tune: A Jazz History 1900-1950\u201d and \u201cGod Didn\u2019t Like It: Electric Hillbillies, Singing Preachers and the Beginning of Rock and Roll, 1950-1970,\u201d among others) reflect a fathomless musical knowledge and an iconoclastic streak. Those elements define his music too: a loose meld of American folklore, halcyon pop and free jazz. For this concert, Mr. Lowe has convened a 13-piece band to honor the heavy influence of John Coltrane\u2019s 1960s work. He\u2019s doing it in decidedly unconventional fashion, reaching back to the polyphonic sound of early-20th-century New Orleans.\n\n212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys\n\nMIN XIAO-FEN WITH REZ ABBASI at Roulette (Feb. 18, 4 p.m.). Ms. Min plays the traditional pipa and other Chinese lutes with a hard-bitten, unflinching power. A conceptualist as well as a folklorist, she will present a new, original score for \u201cThe Goddess,\u201d a seminal silent film from 1930s Shanghai. The music she has written draws from across the spectrum of Chinese heritage, including references to Tibetan chants as well as other folk forms, while remaining in contact with her jazz influences. Accompanying her is the prodigious guitarist Rez Abbasi.\n\n917-267-0368, roulette.org\n\nJAY RODRIGUEZ AND SPECIAL GUESTS at Le Poisson Rouge (Feb. 20, 9:30 p.m.).

On his own forthcoming album, \u201cYour Sound (Live at Dizzy\u2019s Club Cola-Cola),\u201d Mr. Rodriguez moves between idioms and energies as easily as he switches instruments. He celebrates the album\u2019s release with this concert, featuring a powerhouse band: J. D.

The United States pledged $3 billion to the fund, but Mr. Trump halted contributions, with $2 billion still outstanding. Developing countries, including Mexico, Indonesia and Mongolia, also are putting money into the fund.\n\n\u201cCompanies are pouring back into this country, pouring back. Not like \u2014 when did you hear about car companies coming back into Michigan and coming to Ohio and expanding? You never heard that.\u201d\n\nFalse.\n\nThe Reshoring Initiative is an advocacy group that works with manufacturing companies to return jobs to the United States from overseas. Its website lists dozens of instances when car companies returned manufacturing jobs to the United States over the past decade. For example, Ford announced it would move production of pickup trucks from Mexico to Ohio in 2015, and General Motors said it would build a type of Cadillac in Tennessee instead of Mexico in 2014.\n\n\u201cWe declined to certify the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible deal. Whoever heard you give $150 billion to a nation that has no respect for you whatsoever?\u201d\n\nThis is misleading.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal released about $100 billion \u2014 not $150 billion \u2014 in previously frozen Iran assets; the United States did not cut Iran a check. Much of that money is also tied up in debt obligations. For example, $20 billion is owed to China for financing projects in Iran. Estimates for the actual amount available to Iran range from $35 billion to $65 billion.\n\n\u201cYou saw Apple just brought $350 billion in.\u201d\n\nNot quite.\n\nMr. Trump has previously claimed that Apple\u2019s $350 billion investment is the direct result of his tax cuts. But Apple, according to reporting in The Times, \u201cwas already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After the $38 billion tax payment is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not giving us their best people, folks. They\u2019re not giving us \u2014 use your heads. They\u2019re giving us \u2014 it is a lottery.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nMr. Trump is referring to the diversity visa lottery. But foreign governments do not select entrants; rather, millions of individuals enter of their own volition. A computer chooses winners at random and, before receiving a visa, those selected must undergo a screening process that bars criminals and the indigent. In fact, those who have been admitted through the program have higher rates of employment and of finding work in professional or managerial occupations than most other immigrants.\n\n\u201cThis guy came in through chain migration. And a part of the lottery system. They say 22 people came in with him.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence to support this.\n\nIt is implausible that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the October 2017 truck attack in Manhattan, enabled 22 to immigrate to the United States. He is a green card holder who immigrated to the United States in 2010 from Uzbekistan, married another Uzbek immigrant in 2013 in Ohio and fathered three children in the United States.

The Uruguayan-American sculptor Gonzalo Fonseca (1922-97) pioneered an architecturally inflected, whimsically literary style of relentless ambiguity. Whether covering large pieces of Italian travertine with incised circles and tiny pyramids, fixing a small red sail to a flat chunk of limestone or titling a tabletop-size pillar of dark gray stone \u201cSelf-Portrait,\u201d Fonseca made his work live by putting it almost entirely in the power of the viewer\u2019s imagination.

The coach, Sean Hutchison, denied the allegations, saying that the pair had a \u201ccommitted relationship\u201d that began after she was of age.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen, this month, The Orange County Register published an article of almost 7,500 words alleging that U.S.A. Swimming executives were aware of sexually predatory coaches for years, but that they did not take action against them or try to change the organization\u2019s permissive culture.\n\nMs. Woessner was among the officials accused in the Register report of choosing not to pursue sexual abuse cases against coaches even after being presented with direct complaints.\n\nIn her resignation letter, Ms. Woessner acknowledged that in 2007, during her first stint working with U.S.A. Swimming \u2014 as a database coordinator \u2014 she \u201cengaged in kissing on a single occasion\u201d with Mr. Hutchison, who was then a coach.\n\nShe left the organization later that year to pursue a master\u2019s degree in social work, and then returned to U.S.A. Swimming in 2010, when she was named the organization\u2019s athlete protection officer. In that role, Ms. Woessner wrote, she was asked to assist in an investigation into whether Mr. Hutchison was romantically involved with \u201ca 21-year-old athlete member.\u201d (U.S.A. Swimming has said it became aware of a rumored relationship between Mr. Hutchison and Ms. Kukors in 2010, when Ms. Kukors was 21.)\n\nIn her resignation letter, Ms. Woessner said she had never had sex with Mr. Hutchison and \u201cnever had a sexual or romantic relationship of any kind at any time\u201d with him.

Swimming said she had recently provided the organization with information about the \u201cpersonal interaction.\u201d Her behavior didn\u2019t break any rules until she took the job as the athlete protection officer, the statement said.\n\nBut the statement added that \u201cconsidering Woessner\u2019s Safe Sport role,\u201d she should have disclosed her interaction with Mr. Hutchison before taking part in the investigation into his behavior.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Woessner did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Friday night.\n\nMr. Hogan, who served in his role at U.S.A.

The Democratic memo reveals that the F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Page as late as March 2016 about his contacts with Russian intelligence agents, the same month Mr. Trump added him to his foreign policy advisory team.\n\nThe information from Mr. Steele was about \u201cspecific activities in 2016\u201d by Mr. Page, including suspected meetings with close associates of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during a July trip to Moscow, the Democrats said.\n\nThe document says that the bureau did disclose to the court that it had made use of information that was gathered through politically motivated means and quotes from the application itself.\n\n\u201cThe F.B.I. speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the F.B.I. wrote in the application.\n\nThe Democrats said that it would have been inappropriate and inconsistent with standard practice for officials to have disclosed to the court the names of American individuals and organizations that had paid Mr. Steele.\n\nThe F.B.I. frequently relies on sources who have agendas, whether it is a gang turncoat or a mafia informer. What is typically seen as important by courts is that the agenda is disclosed to a judge.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Page, the surveillance applications were reviewed by four different judges, all appointed by Republican presidents, the document says. Each approved of the request.\n\nThe memo also asserts that in applications to renew the wiretap, the F.B.I. provided the court with information from independent sources corroborating Mr. Steele\u2019s findings. Much of the specific corroborating evidence was blacked out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd, according to the Democrats, the wiretap produced \u201cvaluable intelligence\u201d for the F.B.I. that was used to justify its renewal three times. The document once again offers specific examples, which were redacted by the Justice Department.\n\nThe warrant application itself remains under seal, and only a handful of lawmakers from either party have seen it. The New York Times has filed a motion asking the surveillance court to take the unusual step of unsealing it.\n\nThe Democratic document also rebuts claims by Republicans, including Mr. Trump, that the F.B.I. relied on Mr. Steele\u2019s findings to open its counterintelligence inquiry in late July 2016. Information from Mr. Steele, the memo says, did not reach the F.B.I. counterintelligence team investigating Russian meddling until mid-September, well after the inquiry had been opened and after the F.B.I. had already begun looking at other campaign associates.\n\nThe document challenges several other prominent Republican claims. For instance, the Republican memo asserted that the F.B.I. had presented to the court a Yahoo News article from September 2016 as corroboration of Mr. Steele\u2019s claims, despite the fact that it later emerged that Mr. Steele had been a source for it.\n\nThe Democrats said that the article, and another it did not identify, was merely used to inform the court that Mr. Page had publicly denied having the meetings in Moscow.\n\nRepublicans on the Intelligence Committee released a point-by-point response to the Democratic document, which they said only confirmed that the F.B.I. had relied on politically motivated material. In a separate document, they wrote that the Democrats had provided a \u201clengthy but wholly unpersuasive attempt to distract from the committee\u2019s key findings\u201d on surveillance abuse.\n\nMr. Page, in a statement, called the memo \u201ca smear campaign\u201d by Democrats that only made it more important that the underlying applications be released publicly.\n\nDemocrats have insisted that Mr. Trump\u2019s deference to national security concerns in delaying the memo\u2019s release was hypocritical and politically motivated. Just a week before blocking their memo\u2019s release, the president had ignored similar objections from the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to declassify the contents of the rival Republican memo, which was based on the same underlying documents.", "title": "2 Weeks After Trump Blocked It, Democrats\u2019 Rebuttal of G.O.P.

American officials were informed in mid-January that the militia might have captured the men.\n\nThe S.D.F. suspected that the two men were foreign fighters and gave them access to American Special Operations forces, United States officials said. The Americans confirmed their identities using fingerprints and other biometric measurements.\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir capture and detention were described to The New York Times by several United States officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details of the case remain secret. Cmdr. Sarah Higgins of the Navy, a Pentagon spokeswoman for detention policy issues, declined to comment.\n\nThe series of gruesome beheadings that started with Mr. Foley in 2014 rocked the Obama administration, which had been accused by the victims\u2019 families of failing to do enough to save their loved ones. The American military did raid the prison in Raqqa in July 2014, but the Islamic State had already moved its hostages.\n\nBecause of the families\u2019 complaints, the Obama administration made major changes to the way the government handles the abduction of United States citizens. It created a Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which is led currently by the F.B.I., and a special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The Trump administration has yet to fill the envoy role.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe families have long hoped to recover the bodies of their loved ones, but the Islamic State\u2019s control of chunks of Syria rendered the task nearly impossible.\n\nIt was not clear whether the Justice Department would prosecute the two men or when the United States military would take custody of them. For the F.B.I. agents and other officials who have long worked on the case, bringing back the men to face federal prosecution would be a major victory.\n\nBut Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been an outspoken supporter of continuing to use the wartime prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, and the military commissions held there. Thomas P. Bossert, the president\u2019s chief counterterrorism adviser, has also pushed for the suspects to be sent to the military prison.\n\nBritain, a close ally of the United States, could object to sending the men to the wartime prison, which has a toxic image abroad. It negotiated the repatriation of all nine of its citizens whom the Bush administration had brought there by 2005; the last resident of Britain held at the prison, Shaker Aamer, a Saudi citizen who lived for years in Britain with his family, was sent back there in 2015.\n\nBut the British government has stripped Mr. Kotey and Mr. Elsheikh of their citizenship, according to a United States official. Last year, The Times of London reported that the government had rescinded the British citizenship of about 150 dual citizens who were suspected of having joined the Islamic State, in order to keep them from re-entering the country.\n\nIn addition, because the men are suspected of being members of the Islamic State, not Al Qaeda, taking them to Guant\u00e1namo \u2014 where detainees have a right to bring habeas corpus challenges to their detention \u2014 would create a legal headache that national security officials want to avoid. It would give a judge an opportunity to rule on the dispute over whether the congressional authorization for use of military force against the perpetrators of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, legitimately covers the Islamic State.\n\nMoreover, if the United States fails to prosecute the men in federal court, it could anger the victims\u2019 families, causing yet another disappointment. The Guant\u00e1namo military commissions system has struggled to get contested cases to trial, even as prosecutors in civilian court have won numerous convictions in terrorism cases.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The Islamic State said she was killed in a bombing raid.)\n\nSome American law enforcement officials wanted to prosecute Ms. Sayyaf in Virginia, and federal prosecutors filed charges against her, but after a lengthy interrogation, she was turned over to Iraqi government custody instead.\n\nMs. Mueller had been originally imprisoned by the British militants, but was moved to another location, where she is believed to have been badly abused by the leader of the Islamic State before her death.\n\nA senior United States official said Mr. Kotey and Mr. Elsheikh had provided valuable information to military interrogators about the remaining Islamic State leadership and support structure, which are under tremendous pressure from air and ground attacks.\n\nThere were some indications that the two men initially sought to hide their identities, but the Special Operations forces routinely run fingerprint checks and other biometric measurements to identify known terrorist leaders and catalog rank-and-file militants.\n\nOther information has been collected from cellphones and other electronic equipment they were carrying, the United States official said. The men could also have information about other hostages, including the British journalist John Cantlie, who was abducted with Mr. Foley in 2012. Since he was taken hostage, Mr. Cantlie has appeared in several Islamic State propaganda videos.\n\nAmerican officials had sought to keep the capture of the two British suspects under wraps to allow analysts more time to pursue the intelligence leads developed from their detention and prepare raids against unsuspecting Islamic State targets.\n\nAmerican warplanes and Kurdish-led ground forces are hunting for the several hundred remaining Islamic State fighters hiding along the Euphrates River Valley near the border between Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe American-led military command in Baghdad said in a statement last week that four senior Islamic State commanders and officials, including two operatives dealing with logistics and immigration, were killed in the region in the past month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe most prized Islamic State target, however, has proved the most elusive: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group\u2019s leader.

To many in 2004, searing dispatches from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d (which billed itself as \u201cthe most trusted name in fake news\u201d) and The Onion seemed like the best weapon against Washington spin and obfuscation .

As a result, the wines are often a bit more accessible at an earlier age than Barolo. They are required by law to be aged for at least two years before they can be released, as against Barolo\u2019s three years.\n\nEven so, these wines are never easy to drink young. Nebbiolo is notoriously tannic, with plenty of acidity, and regardless of how it compares with Barolo, Barbaresco is powerful in its own right. Even the most immediately appealing of the 2014s would benefit from another few years of aging before drinking.\n\nIn the tasting, we found many good bottles, characterized by freshness, expressiveness and a lovely balance. But the wines were inconsistent. Some were oddly green, or overly astringent. And we were all surprised by how oaky some wines seemed, enough so that the barrel flavors may never integrate.\n\nOakiness was a particular problem in the Piedmont in the 1980s and \u203290s, when many younger producers began to age their wines in small barrels of new French oak rather than in the traditional big vats, made of Slavonian oak, which were used year after year.\n\nThe Slavonian oak allows minute amounts of oxygen to interact with the wine, giving it the structure and stability to age for many years. Since the vats are generally not new, they impart little in the way of wood flavors or oak tannins.\n\nNew, small barrels of French oak, by contrast, permit a faster exchange of oxygen, which softens the grape tannins more quickly. But the wines absorb oak tannins, which have a markedly different texture than grape tannins, as well as wood flavors. New oak also tends to fix the color of the wine at a darker hue. Some producers prefer that, as nebbiolo naturally fades to a kind of garnet color, which consumers sometimes mistakenly associate with weakness in wines.\n\nBy the 2000s, many of the producers who had adopted French oak had moderated their use, so the wines no longer had the extreme oaky character of some of the previous vintages.

Three appeals are pending, and one of the 43 athletes did not appeal the sanctions.\n\nRussia celebrated the ruling.

Putin said in televised comments from Rostov-on-Don. \u201cWe should also respect the side which we were in dispute with. That\u2019s why there should not be any sense of euphoria from our side, we should be calm about it.\u201d\n\nThe court of arbitration noted that it was not passing judgment on \u201cwhether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples in the Sochi laboratory,\u201d but on the culpability of individual athletes.\n\nIn its statement, the I.O.C. lamented that the court of arbitration had not taken into account the \u201cproven existence of the systematic manipulation of the antidoping system\u201d by Russia.\n\nThe case against Russia was largely built on the bombshell testimony of the former head of its drug testing laboratory, Grigory Rodchenkov. Rodchenkov, now living in hiding in the United States, detailed how he had formulated cocktails of banned substances to athletes and swapped the tainted samples under the direction of government officials.\n\nHis testimony backed up laboratory data that allowed the Olympic committee to essentially concur with the conclusions about the existence of a systematic doping scheme made in a 2016 investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, described it is an \u201cunprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport.\u201d\n\nRodchenkov, the whistle-blower, had alleged that Russia had found a way to pry open supposedly tamper-proof drug-testing bottles and replace their contents without detection.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe arbitration panel rejected 11 appeals, including that of the two-time bobsled gold medalist Alexandr Zubkov. His retested samples had abnormal levels of salt, a substance, according to Rodchenkov, that was used to cover up doping violations in the swapped samples.\n\nMcLaren and Rodchenkov provided testimony to the Russian appeals hearings via video link. They were not interviewed by the Olympic committee panel that issued the original ban on the Russian athletes.\n\n\u201cClean sport is dead,\u201d Rodchenkov\u2019s lawyer Jim Walden said. \u201cThe C.A.S. decision proves that certain countries can get away with anything and everything. Today\u2019s decision will forever stand as the low point in sports integrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis panel\u2019s unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes, but a complete \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 for most. Thus, the C.A.S. decision only emboldens cheaters, makes it harder for clean athletes to win and provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically.\u201d\n\nHandling the fallout from the scandal has been a draining and damaging experience for the International Olympic Committee\u2019s leadership. The run-up to the Rio Olympics was marred by indecision over whether to allow Russia to participate. The committee tossed the decision to individual federations, which led to some, including track and field, to issue a near-blanket ban on Russians. That ban remains in place.\n\nOrganizers of the Paralympics were more decisive, announcing a ban on the entire Russian contingent.

The app encourages users to take and upload selfies so that Google\u2019s facial-recognition algorithm might compare them to its vast digital art archive. (Google says it does not store the selfies.) One year ago our generation was donating to the A.C.L.U.; now we\u2019re taking photos of ourselves for a multinational corporation that has cooperated with the government\u2019s surveillance programs. Such is the allure of the selfie.\n\nEler, who is the visual arts critic for The Star Tribune in Minnesota and also a millennial, has published for years on the selfie and its implications for privacy, self-expression and sex. In the selfie she finds \u201can aspirational image\u201d essential to \u201cbeing seen by others online.\u201d She sees the selfie as a lifeline to those who struggle to be represented in the media ecosystem; she mentions transpeople and agoraphobes. And not all selfie-takers, she proves, are as oblivious as imagined.\n\nUnfortunately, Eler\u2019s book would have benefited from a more careful edit. Her discursive style is sometimes whimsical, but mostly distracting. She dwells on a topic having little to do with selfies and then glosses over complicated selfie-related stories. Fake news in the 2016 election gets at least seven pages; the macaque who took a selfie and then saw PETA sue for his copyright gets just two. She provides an extended discussion of blogs that post screenshots of bad Tinder conversations but glosses over the July 2016 Facebook Live stream by Diamond Reynolds after her husband, Philando Castile, was shot by the police. And while there are moments where her light touch suits the material well, a section on social-media surveillance at Standing Rock is hindered by her choice to discuss it through quoting a meeting she had over coffee with a protester.\n\nIn spite of its flaws, though, Eler\u2019s book alights on the source of the selfie\u2019s power: It is the easiest way to assert one\u2019s humanity in our hyper-networked world. Perhaps our much-fussed-over narcissism is not a flaw but a survival tactic.\n\niGEN\n\nWhy Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy \u2014 and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood\n\nBy Jean M. Twenge\n\n342 pp. Atria. $27.\n\nPhoto\n\nBack in 2006, the psychologist Twenge swiped at millennials in her book \u201cGeneration Me.\u201d She wrote then that we were miserable, entitled narcissists ruined by our parents\u2019 adoration. She was trying to rebut Neil Howe and the late William Strauss (the gurus of generational theory) who had contended in 2000 that civic-oriented millennials would become \u201cthe next great generation.\u201d Time has evidently softened her.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer new \u201ciGen\u201d pities rather than disdains those born after 1995, arguing that smartphone addiction has saddled a new generation with profound psychological problems, including sleep deprivation, depression and unshakable senses of loneliness and fear. They drink less and have less sex; they socialize less without their parents present; they hardly read for pleasure or go to the mall; they eschew church and even spirituality; they kill themselves more (but others less); they wait longer to get drivers\u2019 licenses and give birth. Twenge premises her conclusions on longitudinal studies of high schoolers and college students, which she supplements with first-person accounts from members of iGen. She concludes by offering this advice: \u201cDo not sleep with it or give it nude pictures of yourself. It is not your lover. Do not continuously turn your attention to it when you are talking with someone in person. It is not your best friend.\u201d\n\nTwenge is right to highlight smartphones\u2019 contributions to our malaise. In one section she notes the feeling of rejection that arises from a text sent without an immediate response, and in another she notes that more screen time leads to less in-person socializing, which breeds loneliness.\n\nShe could stand to incorporate some of Harris\u2019s alarm about the economy. She duly recognizes income inequality as a prime source of iGen\u2019s anxiety about its future. But while she discusses how smartphones do their harm, she has no such harsh words for the modern labor market. Instead she tells marketers how to exploit iGen\u2019s diminished expectations, which struck me as tacky and not particularly useful, besides.

It has become an increasingly attractive tool for major metropolises overwhelmed by the traffic strangling their streets.\n\nBut actually carrying out congestion pricing has been anything but easy \u2014 at least in three cities that are often cited as international models. In London, Singapore and Stockholm the fees were met with skepticism and outrage by commuters and civic and business leaders, though they later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution.\n\nAs New York debates whether to join these cities after decades of stalled efforts, their experiences could provide a road map. Each city does congestion pricing in its own way. Singapore sets varying fees based on the road and time of day, and adjusts them in response to traffic conditions, with fees going up when there is congestion, and down when there is not. Stockholm also sets varying fees for a congestion zone covering the central city area, with the highest fees at the busiest times of day. But its system is less flexible than Singapore\u2019s since those fees do not regularly fluctuate with traffic and any changes require the approval of Sweden\u2019s Parliament.\n\nIn contrast, London charges a simple flat-rate of $16 per day no matter how often a vehicle goes in and out of a designated congestion zone in the center of the city. In New York, a state task force has proposed a flat rate of $11.52 per day for passenger cars \u2014 and $25.34 for trucks \u2014 for entering a congestion zone in Manhattan that would stretch from 60th Street south to the Battery. Taxis and ride-hailing cars could face a separate charge of $2 to $5 per ride.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll three cities invested heavily in technology and infrastructure before they rolled out their congestion-pricing systems. Stockholm spent the most \u2014 $237 million \u2014 to set up a system of gantries and cameras in 2007 that register and identify vehicles by snapping photos of license plates, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit policy and advocacy group based in New York that has compared the three systems. London also relies on gantries and cameras that cost nearly as much, or $214 million, in 2003. Singapore\u2019s project cost $110 million in 1998 and requires every vehicle to be outfitted with an electronic device that automatically tallies up the fees, according to the Transportation Campaign.", "title": "3 Far-Flung Cities Offer Clues to Unsnarling Manhattan\u2019s Streets", "authors": ["Christina Anderson", "Winnie Hu", "Weiyi Lim", "Anna Schaverien"]}

That same year, the Department of Justice began a civil rights investigation, but the case has been delayed by a dispute between federal officials in New York and Washington, and a change in presidential administrations. The city has put off an administrative trial for Officer Pantaleo until federal prosecutors decide whether to file civil rights charges. In the meantime, Officer Pantaleo remains on desk duty.\n\n\u201cThis investigation has dragged on for so long it\u2019s getting to the point of outrage,\u201d said William R. Yeomans, a fellow at the Alliance for Justice, a liberal judicial advocacy group, who once served as the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights.\n\nPhoto\n\nGetting answers in some of the city\u2019s most notorious police-involved killings can often take years. With competing legal interests, family members of the victims can wait up to a five years to learn the fate of officers involved. From state criminal trials to federal civil rights investigations and the decision about whether an officer will remain on the force, the lengthy and complicated process conspires to frustrate families who say they are only seeking justice.\n\nMr. Yeomans said the initial request from federal prosecutors to hold off on an administrative trial was not unusual, but that the Justice Department has had enough time to act.\n\n\u201cThe Garner case is an open, festering sore that the federal government has not taken steps to heal.\u201d Mr. Yeomans said. \u201cAt some point, the city has got to move on.\u201d\n\nLast year the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent agency that investigates claims of excessive force against the New York Police Department, substantiated charges of misconduct against Officer Pantaleo for using a chokehold and recommended severe penalties that could lead to his dismissal.\n\nThe next step would be an administrative trial prosecuted by lawyers with the review board. A final recommendation would be sent to the police commissioner who can \u201caccept, reject or modify\u201d any suggestion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAustin Finan, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said in a statement that the city had never gone ahead with a disciplinary hearing if the Justice Department had requested it to wait.\n\nThe city\u2019s top lawyer, Zachary W. Carter, said the Department of Justice asked the city not to proceed with an administrative trial to avoid interfering with the federal investigation by questioning witnesses and gathering statements and testimony that could be duplicative or create prejudice.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the length of time that has passed during which the Department of Justice has had this under investigation adds to the family\u2019s anguish,\u201d Mr. Carter said. While he acknowledged that the city is under no obligation to wait on federal prosecutors, he said it would be the \u201chighest level of irresponsibility\u201d to move forward against their wishes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

O\u2019Malley, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, declined to comment on the status of the Garner investigation.\n\nThe city has moved swiftly recently to bring administrative charges against other officers accused of misconduct.\n\nTwo officers, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, quit the Police Department in November, three days before they were scheduled to face an administrative trial. The officers\u2019 trial on charges of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman in Coney Island, Brooklyn, after a drug stop had just begun. A crucial difference between the case of the two officers and Officer Pantaleo is that Mr. Martins and Mr. Hall have been charged.\n\nRather than hurt the federal case, Susan M. Karten, a lawyer who represented the Baez family in their civil suit against the city, said testimony gathered for Mr. Livoti\u2019s administrative trial helped reveal discrepancies among the statements of officers at Mr. Baez\u2019s arrest. While Mr. Livoti claimed that Mr. Baez\u2019s struggling set off an asthma attack, another officer said that Mr. Baez was not struggling and was handcuffed on the ground when she arrived.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe departmental trial was the first time Mr. Livoti had testified.\n\n\u201cI think the more prior testimony you have,\u201d Ms. Karten said, \u201cthe better in these cases where there are several people involved and they get together and get their story together.\u201d\n\nTwo officers were fired after an administrative trial in 2003 for perjuring themselves in testimony about Mr. Baez\u2019s death.\n\nThe actions of other officers as Mr. Garner was being subdued for reportedly selling illegal cigarettes, and the reports they filed, could be under scrutiny in any investigation, Ms. Karten added.", "title": "3\u00bd Years After Eric Garner\u2019s Death, Family Still Waits for Closure", "authors": ["Jeffery C.

Beginning on Feb. 23, the Quad will present a new digital spruce-up of \u201cKing of Hearts\u201d (1967), the cult classic and antiwar fable in which Alan Bates plays a British soldier at the end of World War I who finds that the loosed asylum inmates in a French town are more sane and peaceful than the society he knows.

In Jerzy Skolimowski\u2019s eerie \u201cThe Shout\u201d (Tuesday), Mr. Bates plays a mental patient himself. Over the course of the film, he relays the story of how he upended the marriage of an English couple (John Hurt and Susannah York) with possible supernatural help. The nerve-jangling sound design should play exceptionally well in a theater.\n\n212-255-2243, quadcinema.com\n\nDOC FORTNIGHT 2018 at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 26).

How They Make Money: \u201cFrom a consumer\u2019s standpoint, it\u2019s important to understand what the monetization model is for the company that makes these apps,\u201d added Kowsik Guruswamy, chief technology officer at Menlo Security. \u201cThat alone can be very revealing in how the companies plan to use their data.\u201d For example, an app might make money through sponsorships with the brands it partners with or it might offer customers paid upgrades. However, it\u2019s also likely it makes money selling your data to advertisers or other third parties, which is why it\u2019s important to note what kind of data it tracks and how it uses it.\n\n3. What Other Users Have to Say: Beyond reading the fine print, you can also research the app\u2019s reputation via online reviews. Pay special attention to reviews that address privacy issues. \u201cWhile many apps offer legitimate means to make money \u2014 taking surveys, snapping photos of local businesses, lock screen ads and reviewing products \u2014 be wary of apps that seem too good to be true,\u201d Mr. Bischoff said. \u201cSometimes an app combines a legitimate cash-for-task model with background data collection, so watch out for that, too.\u201d\n\nMoneymaking Apps That Make the Grade\n\nWe looked at dozens of apps that promise to help you make money from the comfort of your smartphone, and most of them aren\u2019t worth your time. Some, however, do what they promise, even if the trade-off is a good bit of your personal data.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to trade, the following (free) apps are well established and can legitimately help you earn cash back. No, you won\u2019t fund your retirement or put a down payment on your home, but you can earn a few bucks to pay for your latte \u2014 or dare we suggest avocado toast?\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind searching the web, answering surveys or watching videos, you can earn a few \u201cSwagbucks,\u201d which you can then trade in for gift cards at places like Amazon, Starbucks and Home Depot.\n\n\u201cI typically cash out the Swagbucks for gift cards that I use on Amazon to buy household goods,\u201d said Cherie Lowe, a personal finance writer and author of the book \u201cSlaying the Debt Dragon.\u201d Ms. Lowe has used the app for nearly eight years, earning around $3,000 worth of gift cards over all. \u201cI did save up enough to get $600 to put toward a laptop at the Apple store at one point in time,\u201d she added.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

According to the Swagbucks website, this is the equivalent of earning 1 percent cash back. With online surveys, you typically earn 40 to 200 Swagbucks (100 Swagbucks = $1), according to the site. You can also earn a few Swagbucks for watching videos, and the app will tell you how long you can expect to spend watching. You\u2019ll spend about half an hour and earn a few points.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen it comes to privacy, Mr. Guruswamy says apps like Swagbucks often use cookies to track your information. \u201cSo by using Swagbucks, not only is the user giving away a lot of their personal information, they are also opening themselves to being monitored and tracked by all of the Swagbucks affiliates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is that you have to read the fine print.\u201d Swagbucks is available in the U.S., U.K., Ireland, Canada, and Australia.

I like that you can cash out your rewards at as little as $2 in gift cards, too. Every little bit helps. I typically stockpile and cash out around Christmas to supplement our budget.\u201d\n\nOnce you download the app, you earn points, or \u201ckicks,\u201d every time you spend at partner retailers. You can earn kicks without spending, too, by checking into stores or scanning certain items. While you won\u2019t get cash back directly, you can trade the points for gift cards to dozens of partner retailers. In short, Shopkick essentially works like any other rewards shopping site except there\u2019s no need to hop through a portal to earn your points. Just spend with your card as you normally would.\n\nOf course, you have to link your credit or debit card to earn points with your spending, so if you\u2019re worried about your privacy with this app, keep that in mind. With so many data breaches lately, you might be apprehensive to connect your card to the app. While it does collect data about your transactions (which is necessary to automatically earn \u201ckicks\u201d), it doesn\u2019t store your actual credit card information. \u201cIf a user has a linked credit or debit card associated with his or her Shopkick account, that information solely and securely remains with Visa or Mastercard,\u201d said Bill Demas, the app\u2019s chief executive officer. Read the privacy policy here. Shopkick is U.S. only.\n\nIbotta is a couponing app, but instead of getting a discount on your purchases, you get cash-back rebates. You check the app for offers \u2014 $1 cash back on a pizza brand, for example \u2014 and then either scan your receipt or link the app to your store loyalty cards so your savings are automatic. Ibotta accepts receipts only from participating stores and retailers, but most of the big players are listed: Whole Foods, Walmart, Ralph\u2019s, Kroger, HEB. Some offers will apply to only one retailer; others might be valid at several.\n\n\u201cI use Ibotta regularly and have made $253 so far,\u201d said Jessica Landon, an avid Ibotta user who\u2019s been using the app for about a year and a half. \u201cI usually look up offers before I head in the store, then upload and scan the products right when I get in my car so I don\u2019t forget.\u201d She said staples like produce usually earned only about 25 cents cash back, but it can add up. \u201cBuying beer for my husband usually gets me larger amounts. Diapers is another item that can earn you cash back faster.\u201d\n\nIn its privacy policy, Ibotta is clear about the information it collects, which includes your contact information, search queries, transaction information and location, and why it collects it. Ibotta also places cookies on your device to \u201crecognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience,\u201d according to the privacy policy.

Although he was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1968, he was nominated for this mother of a creepfest. He lost to Billy Wilder for \u201cThe Apartment,\u201d which also beat \u201cPsycho\u201d for best black and white art direction.\n\nJanet Leigh was in the hunt for best supporting actress, but perhaps because her part was cut so short, she was passed over in favor of Shirley Jones in \u201cElmer Gantry.\u201d That film\u2019s lead, Burt Lancaster, took home the best actor prize for his portrayal of the titular charlatan.

The Academy snubbed this satanic satire from Roman Polanski, choosing not to nominate it for best picture or director, both of which were won by Carol Reed\u2019s more upbeat \u201cOliver!\u201d\n\nMia Farrow\u2019s affecting, tremulous work as the mother of the devil\u2019s spawn was left out of the best actress race, which ended in a tie between Barbra Streisand for \u201cFunny Girl\u201d and Katharine Hepburn for \u201cThe Lion in Winter.\u201d That royal saga\u2019s screenplay, by James Goldman, bested Mr. Polanski\u2019s adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s novel.\n\n\u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d found favor only in the best supporting actress category, where 72-year-old Ruth Gordon snagged the prize for her hysterical portrayal of a buttinsky neighbor who leads a coven of Upper West Side witches.

I was too young to see the movie while it was in theaters, but when I was in junior high school, I tried to watch it on HBO \u2014 except my family didn\u2019t subscribe to the channel, so I could see only scrambled images.

Robert De Niro knocked out voters for best actor in \u201cRaging Bull\u201d and Thelma Schoonmaker won for best editing. The Academy dug Sissy Spacek\u2019s take on Loretta Lynn in \u201cCoal Miner\u2019s Daughter\u201d for best actress. Mr. Polanski\u2019s version of Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cTess\u201d cleaned up in the categories of cinematography, art direction and costume design.\n\n\u201cThe Shining\u201d did earn the dubious distinction of garnering two Razzie nominations: Shelley Duvall for worst actress and Mr. Kubrick for worst director.

But the Trump administration has significantly thinned the flow of refugees, and officials said this week that those from Syria and several other countries will be let in only after undergoing new vetting on top of the screening they already receive.\n\nThe temporary status is granted to certain groups of people in the wake of natural disasters, wars, outbreaks of disease and other catastrophes that would make it difficult for them to return safely to their home countries. Government officials periodically review the program to decide whether to extend it, and most groups have received regular extensions in the past. The administration ended protected status for people from Haiti and El Salvador on the grounds that both countries had recovered sufficiently from the earthquakes that were the reason for their original inclusion in the program.\n\nThe protections can be extended for 6, 12, or 18 months at a time. The Obama administration extended them for Syrians three times, and each time it allowed new applicants to join. Homeland security officials did not say on Wednesday evening why they had decided to offer an extension to Syrians who already had the status, but not to offer it to those who did not.\n\nSyria was originally included in the program in 2012 because of the armed conflict among government forces, anti-government insurgents and the Islamic State. According to the United Nations refugee agency, more than 5.4 million people have fled Syria since 2011, when the civil war began, and that number climbs every month. Another 6.1 million Syrians have been forced from their homes, but are still living within Syria\u2019s borders.\n\nJust this month, the United States accused the government of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, of attacking its own people with chemical weapons, a war crime, in the same region that was devastated four years ago by the deadliest chemical attacks of the entire Syrian conflict.\n\n\u201cThere is no way to go back,\u201d said Radwan Ziadeh, a prominent Syrian dissident who was denied political asylum last year, but has been allowed to remain in the United States under the program. \u201cI have a death sentence from the Assad government, I\u2019m on the top of their list.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s common sense actually to do the right thing, to renew T.P.S.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear that Syrians could be deported from the United States, even if immigration officials tried, said Robert S. Ford, an American ambassador to Syria during the Obama administration who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. There is no direct air service between the two countries, and neither country maintains an official diplomatic presence in the other, which may complicate any efforts to obtain the documentation required before anyone can be deported.\n\nAdvocates for extending protected status for Syrians had been hopeful that the administration understood the depths of the challenges still facing Syria. They had seized on remarks made recently by Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, who pledged to keep American troops in Syria even after the Islamic State is eradicated there in order to stabilize the country.", "title": "6,900 Syrians Win Permission to Stay in the U.S., for Now", "authors": []}

Like many young boys, he was enamored of cowboys, known as butteri in Italy, where the 59-year-old Moretti works for clients including the kitchen and bathroom designer Boffi and Milan\u2019s avant-garde design firm Dimore Studio. \u201cHe had a fantasy of being on his own, near horses, of having a rifugio in nature,\u201d she says.\n\nSo in 2015, when a friend was cleaning his villa\u2019s property and offered Orso a midcentury canned-ham-shaped camper, the kind that might have once been hitched to a Chevy Bel Air, the boy was immediately smitten. Moretti and her son, now 14, live in Brescia, east of Milan, in a restored 15th-century parsonage filled with vintage furniture by Hans Wegner and Arne Jacobsen alongside family antiques. But once the camper \u2014 a dilapidated Roller Super 3, built in Italy around 1960 \u2014 was fixed up, Orso could spend summers living out his dream.\n\nThe romance of a tiny portable home is forever linked to images of open highways during America\u2019s postwar leisure era, but such transient dwellings in fact made their way into the public imagination in Europe much earlier. In the late 19th century, William Gordon Stables, a famed Scottish author of books for boys, commissioned the first \u201cgentleman\u2019s caravan\u201d to travel the United Kingdom, based on wagons used at that time by the Romani people who had immigrated to the British Isles centuries before. Stables, who modeled himself after Jules Verne, called his horse-drawn cabin \u201cThe Wanderer.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUnlike the author, Moretti wanted to keep her caravan in one place. She had spent her own childhood summers in Maremma, in seaside Tuscany, where butteri continue to herd cattle on horseback nearby, and she knew the perfect spot: a secluded beach in Punta Ala on a 12-acre tract, where a retired polo player named Marco Semprini keeps about a dozen ponies. He was happy to lend her space to park the 11-by-7-foot camper.\n\nFor the renovation, the stylist and her son \u2014 her \u201caccomplice,\u201d as she calls him \u2014 drew on their shared passion for the outdoors, the history of caravans and Moretti\u2019s own peripatetic career. She had collaborated with Barnaba Fornasetti, who now runs the decorative-arts line created by his father, Piero, so she lined the ceiling, doors and cabinets with the company\u2019s iconic clouds in a wallcovering by Cole & Son, to create a dreamy atmosphere. The complementary Fornasetti owl motif, in paper and fluttering fabric, adds a \u201cnocturnal element,\u201d she says; at night, the camper and grounds are lit only by solar-powered lanterns. A friend of Moretti\u2019s hand-dyed the vintage linen that covers the benches, which double as bunks \u2014 Orso can host two friends at a time \u2014 and painted the aluminum shell the dark green of an old English Land Rover, which blends into the lush surroundings, thick with oak and pine.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe family spent most of last summer in Punta Ala, and plans to for years to come. Orso sleeps in the caravan or in a hammock outside, and helps take care of the polo player\u2019s horses, occasionally leading tourists on riding excursions to the beach. He showers with the hose hooked up to the animals\u2019 stalls. His mother also sleeps in the caravan, a surprisingly ad hoc arrangement for someone who makes a living conjuring high-gloss perfection.\n\nAs the burnt-orange Tuscan moon sets in the navy sky, Orso chars steaks on the grill and Moretti pours herself a glass of Brunello. They listen to the water lap at the rocks on the nearby shore. \u201cWe pretend we are in a magic tiny house abandoned in a forest,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, really, there is no reason not to believe it.\u201d", "title": "A (Teenager\u2019s) Caravan in Tuscany", "authors": ["Nancy Hass"]}

The manufacturers of synthetic diamonds, on the other hand, are promoting the environmental benefits of their process, hoping to attract millennials more concerned about being green and saving money than embracing the tag line \u201ca diamond is forever.\u201d\n\nBut it may turn out that the buyers of these synthetic diamonds, particularly those trying to get more diamond for less money, may lose out in the end.\n\nLet\u2019s start with how synthetic diamonds are made. The process can be completed in as little as three months. There are two approaches. One simulates the crushing force of the earth by applying high temperature and high pressure to dissolve carbon into a diamond seed. The other is akin to a 3-D printing approach, with pieces of carbon being layered on a diamond seed in a vacuum chamber.\n\nThe result is a diamond that has the same properties as a natural diamond but different and distinguishable crystal patterns.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis is not the first time gemstones have been manufactured. In the late 1800s, Auguste Verneuil, a French chemist, manufactured the first synthetic rubies. His process has also been used to make synthetic sapphires. Cultured pearls, where an irritant is placed into the oyster to create a pearl, have been made since the 19th century in Japan.\n\nThe first synthetic diamonds were created in the 1950s for industrial uses by companies like General Electric. They did not approach gem quality until the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with colored diamonds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTom Moses, who oversees the laboratories and research at the Gemological Institute of America, said it was not until the past five years that synthetic diamond producers began to create stones that could compete with natural diamonds \u2014 and fool people buying them.\n\nThey look the same to the naked eye, but many in the diamond trade say they are deceiving buyers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a fraud on the buying public to say they\u2019re the same thing as diamonds from an economic standpoint,\u201d said Tom Gelb, a co-founder of the Diamond Durability Laboratory and a consultant to the diamond industry.\n\nMr. Gelb bets that the value of synthetic diamonds will drop as production costs fall. It is a gem\u2019s rarity, he says, that maintains its value. If price is the issue, he suggests sticking with a proven fake, cubic zirconia: \u201cYou can get one for $25, so why would you pay $3,500 for a synthetic diamond?\u201d\n\nBut not all jewelry designers agree with the industry\u2019s rarity argument.\n\n\u201cDiamonds are a commodity with tightly controlled sourcing and marketing,\u201d said Jeffrey D. Feero, managing partner of Alex Sepkus, a high-end jewelry designer. \u201cI don\u2019t consider most diamonds rare and unusual, except for rare, natural-colored diamonds in green, red, pink, purple and vivid yellows.\u201d\n\nThat argument aside, there are two primary areas where buyers could be hurt financially. The first is in their ability to resell manufactured diamonds. One argument for buying gemstones is that they are a store of wealth.\n\nThis holds true for large, rare diamonds \u2014 or rubies or sapphires, for that matter. But small diamonds, like ones in engagement rings, are too widely available to appreciate in value and do not often maintain the price paid for them at a retail store.\n\n\u201cMaybe 2, 3, 4 percent of diamonds have the opportunity to appreciate over time,\u201d said Alan Bronstein, a diamond trader who is president of the Natural Color Diamond Association, a trade group.\n\nThat\u2019s bad enough for natural diamonds. But there is at least a willing buyer at some price. Mr. Bronstein said there was no secondary market for manufactured diamonds, largely because diamond traders will not deal in them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIf people think they\u2019re getting a bargain when they buy a synthetic diamond, the discount that they\u2019re getting is not considerable enough when you think of the possibility that they won\u2019t be able to recover some financial benefit if they need to sell it,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second risk, though, is that a buyer might purchase a manufactured diamond believing that it is a natural diamond.\n\nMr. Feero, who said he used only gemstones that occurred in nature, said he worried about fakes because the quality of manufactured diamonds had improved so rapidly. \u201cI have no problem with lab-created gemstones, but I have a problem with a lack of disclosure,\u201d he said. \u201cDisclosure will be the saving ingredient.\u201d\n\nThe Gemological Institute of America and other groups have created tools to distinguish between the two types of diamonds.\n\nKelly Good, director of marketing at Pure Grown Diamonds, said the company favored disclosure.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "So in 2009, a group of mothers in Massachusetts organized a simple, before-school activity program in their local grade school. They opted for the before-school start because they hoped to add to the total amount of time their kids spent moving and not displace existing physical education classes or after-school sports. It also struck many of the working parents as convenient and, apparently, did not lead to bitter complaints from their children about early rising times.\n\nThe original one-hour sessions consisted of a warm-up, running, calisthenics and rousing group games like tag, led by parent volunteers. The workouts proved to be so popular that other parents began asking if they could start a similar program at their children\u2019s schools\n\nToday, the program has gained a formal curriculum, a name and acronym, Build Our Kids\u2019 Success (BOKS), along with corporate underwriting from the shoe manufacturer Reebok. (The similarity of the nomenclature is intentional.) It also has become one of the world\u2019s most widely disseminated, free, school-based exercise programs. According to a BOKS spokeswoman, it is used at more than 3,000 schools worldwide.\n\nBut popularity is no guarantee of efficacy. So researchers at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, some of whom have children enrolled in a BOKS program, began to wonder about the measurable impacts of the exercise.\n\nThey also were aware that a number of school districts in Massachusetts had plans to allow BOKS at their elementary and middle schools during the 2015 or 2016 school years and, for the new study, which was published this week in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, asked if they could piggyback their research onto the start of those programs. Principals at 24 schools agreed. The schools included students from a broad spectrum of incomes.\n\nThe researchers then asked those families planning to participate in BOKS, which is always voluntary, if they and their children would join a study.\n\nSeveral hundred students in kindergarten through eighth grade and their parents consented. Other children, who would not be joining the exercise program, agreed to serve as a control group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers measured everyone\u2019s heights, weights, body mass indexes and, through brief psychological surveys, general happiness, vigor and other signs of well-being.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At some schools, the program was offered three times a week, at others twice.\n\nAfterward, the researchers returned and repeated the testing.\n\nAt this point, those students who had exercised before school three times per week had almost all improved their B.M.I.s and fewer qualified as obese. (Many had gained weight as children should while they are growing.) They also reported feeling deeper social connections to their friends and school and a greater happiness and satisfaction with life.\n\nThose students who had exercised twice a week also said they felt happier and more energetic. But the researchers found no reductions in their body mass.\n\nThe students in the control group had the same B.M.I.s or higher and had no changes to their feelings of well-being.\n\nThe upshot is that a one-hour, before-school exercise program does seem likely to improve young people\u2019s health and happiness, says Dr. Elsie Taveras, a professor at Harvard and head of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital, who oversaw the study and whose children have participated in BOKS. (The experiment was partially funded by the Reebok Foundation, as well as the National Institutes of Health and other sources. None of the funders had control of the design or results, Dr. Taveras says.)\n\nBut the benefits are most noticeable if children exercise \u201cat least three times a week,\u201d she says.\n\nThis study was short-term, though, and looked only at a few, narrow physical and emotional impacts. Dr. Taveras and her colleagues hope soon to track the program\u2019s impacts, if any, on academics and on aerobic fitness.\n\nPerhaps most important, the study was not randomized. It involved self-selected students and families who chose to join. The results, in theory, would apply only to the kinds of children who will get up early and run and hop and skip and squeal for an hour before school.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut, Dr. Taveras says, those should be all children.\n\n\u201cIn my experience as a pediatrician and parent, kids naturally love to move,\u201d she says. \u201cThey revel in it.

Unfortunately, legislation by Congress to protect Mr. Mueller is incompatible with the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers.\n\nInstead, there is another way, firmly grounded in the nation\u2019s history, to provide assurances to all Americans \u2014 both supporters and opponents of the investigation \u2014 that the rule of law will prevail. It comes out of a forgotten part of the story, which came in the wake of President Richard Nixon\u2019s so-called Saturday Night Massacre: President Trump and his Justice Department should follow the path of none other than Robert Bork.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the problem. Prominent voices continue to urge President Trump to take various ill-considered steps: to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign, making room for someone who can fire Mr. Mueller; to dismiss Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who has the power to fire Mr. Mueller but has so far refused to consider doing so; and otherwise to denounce the entire investigation. All of that predictably has led to bipartisan calls for legislation to protect Mr. Mueller\u2019s job.\n\nBut the proposed legislation is imperfect. Putting aside the question of whether Congress could muster the political will to pass such legislation, in our view a legislative fix would probably be unconstitutional. The Constitution vests the president with the power over prosecutors, and it is hard to imagine courts permitting Congress to place serious restrictions on that power. Imagine if the shoe were on the other foot: The president shouldn\u2019t be able to place restrictions on whom Congress can hire or fire, or whom federal judges can hire as their law clerks.

Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare\u2019s rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don\u2019t obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back.\n\nThe result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don\u2019t cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.\n\nLegislation to replace the individual mandate has already been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey with prominent sponsors. Political leaders in other states, including California, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut as well as the District of Columbia, are weighing options for replacing the mandate this year, as Stephanie Armour reported in The Wall Street Journal. The mandate was designed to give healthier people an incentive to buy insurance before they fell ill, lowering the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it.\n\n\u201cClearly, I think the federal administration and Congress are moving in one direction,\u201d said Brian Feldman, a Maryland state senator who leads the state health subcommittee and was the primary sponsor of mandate legislation there. \u201cAnd I think states like Maryland would like to move in a different direction.\u201d\n\nMr. Feldman and his colleagues aren\u2019t planning simply to replicate the federal individual mandate.

No artist has made use of New York quite like Hammons, whose work is constructed from the city itself, and is often a part of it \u2014 he\u2019s placed empty bottles at the ends of bare branches of trees in abandoned Harlem lots (in unnamed pieces from the early 1980s) and rolled condoms onto the arms of a subway turnstile in Queens (\u201cFour Beats to the Bar,\u201d 1990) \u2014 and yet for an artist so energetically engaged with the outside world, he himself has remained curiously absent. As Hammons became more and more successful, Cannon \u2014 along with a few other surrogate egos, like a homeless man known as Junior who lived for a number of years in the East Village\u2019s Tompkins Square Park \u2014 became a crucial link to the city that inspired him. In turn, Hammons made works for Cannon\u2019s magazine, like the cover of issue eight, from 1997, which featured a photograph of an original sculpture of a pair of boxing gloves next to an ear of corn with a bite taken out of it \u2014 a reference to Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield\u2019s infamous rematch fight earlier that year.\n\nThe art world rewards cults of personality, and for that reason Cannon and Hammons exist on its fringes \u2014 Cannon for his warmth, Hammons for his refusal to participate on anyone\u2019s terms other than his own. But it is as if Hammons\u2019s self-determined unreachability requires the balance of Cannon\u2019s accessibility. Where Hammons will not appear, Cannon does: writing poems about his work and attending his openings on Hammons\u2019s behalf.\n\nHammons was always a looming presence at Tribes, even when he wasn\u2019t physically present. For a time, a kind of social realist painting of Avenue C at night sat behind the couch in the gallery section of Cannon\u2019s house. Hammons \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand it,\u201d Cannon says. In 1995, he painted an ornate red-and-gold pattern directly onto the wall, attaching to it a makeshift shrine constructed from wire and human hair. Hammons didn\u2019t name or sign the work, but it became the gallery\u2019s centerpiece, and so associated with Tribes that Cannon had it cut out and took it with him when he moved out of the building in 2015 following a dispute with his landlord. (The piece is now in storage in a Brooklyn warehouse.)\n\nCannon\u2019s current apartment is three blocks away from Tribes\u2019 original home. It\u2019s much smaller \u2014 just two rooms and a bathroom. There\u2019s no space to organize shows or concerts. But visitors still drop by at all hours \u2014 Reed when he\u2019s in town from California, Henderson, who was among the dozens of Tribes regulars who helped Cannon move into the apartment, and, of course, Hammons. After the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s announcement in late 2017 of Hammons\u2019s proposed major public art installation on the Hudson River \u2014 a sculpture that will depict the outline of an enormous shed that used to stand on a pier at the site, and would be one of the largest public art installations in the city \u2014 he is more in demand than ever. (Hammons, unsurprisingly, has made no public statement about the project and has declined all interviews.) And yet he continues to visit Cannon, who may no longer have his gallery, but who still publishes his magazine online. He also published a print anthology of Tribes last year, with contributions from Hammons, Myles and Reed, among many others. And his apartment remains a salon of sorts, with Cannon sitting on the same sofa, chatting with his guests. When Hammons visits, he occasionally brings along a sketchpad, asking Cannon \u2014 who does not draw \u2014 to make portraits: of the Obamas, of himself. \u201cHe figures if he gets me in a show I\u2019ll stop asking him for money,\u201d Cannon says. \u201cYawn, yawn, yawn, yeah right, David.\u201d", "title": "A Blind Publisher, Poet \u2014 and Link to the Lower East Side\u2019s Cultural History", "authors": []}

Its oldest room was built in 1830 as a ranching outpost when families lived on the south side of the Rio Grande and farmed their cattle to the north. In the face of constant raids from Native Americans, its thick fieldstone walls became a refuge and its gunports a defense. Over 70 years, five rooms and a walled courtyard were added. Those additions reflect a changing world.

With human subjects, most oncologists don\u2019t have data on the evolving tumors of each individual patient and of a cohort group. Dr. Blau wanted a way to characterize the effect of various treatments on malignancies in humans at a molecular level.\n\nTo address the problem, he helped create the Center for Cancer Innovation at the University of Washington in 2013 and the next year he helped design a new type of clinical trial.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt brought together clinicians and researchers with nurses, geneticists, specialists in information technology, computational biologists and statisticians, not only at one hospital but globally. Each breast cancer patient would be closely monitored. There would be multiple biopsies of tumors from multiple sites on each patient \u2014 many enrolled as a last-ditch effort to help themselves and future patients \u2014 as well as DNA and RNA sequencing to produce huge databases. Hypotheses about treatment were put on the cloud; experts around the world could provide input and feedback. Dr. Blau said he discovered that most scientists appreciated the opportunity to offer their arcane knowledge to aid people in dire straits.\n\nAfter Dr. Blau\u2019s myeloma was diagnosed in 2015, he decided to apply this approach to himself. \u201cI had 22 biopsies of the tumor in my left pelvis, as well as bone marrow biopsies,\u201d he said, \u201cand we compared the genomic profile of the myeloma cells in my pelvic tumor with that of myeloma cells in my bone marrow.\u201d In the process, he learned about a molecular feature that kicked him out of the most favorable prognostic category.\n\nBecause he still had a tiny percentage of myeloma cells in his bone marrow after an arduous autologous stem cell transplant, which uses the patient\u2019s own cells, he rejected the advice of specialists and underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplantation, using cells from a genetically matched person. His donor, a brother and a Methodist minister, believes that he infused Dr. Blau with the Holy Spirit.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWith (possibly related) zeal, Dr. Blau soon started All4Cure, a knowledge-sharing platform for clinicians, researchers and myeloma patients who register (without cost) to allow their medical records to be accessed. Once names are replaced by numbers, these files can be tapped to create \u201ca personalized dashboard\u201d: a graph depicting all treatments, tests and responses as well as tumor sequencing. Beneath the graph, a discussion panel enables participants to comment on the particular patient\u2019s situation. To date, about 150 myeloma patients, 30 clinicians and 20 researchers have enrolled.\n\nPersonalized medicine depends upon information technology and knowledge sharing. Since every cancer contains a singular collection of mutations that can vary significantly across patients or over time within a single patient, computational analysts map how mutations interact within a specific individual, Dr. Blau explains. When a physician reviews data about a faraway patient, that doctor may draw upon her experience \u2014 for example, with the synergy of combining three drugs in a similar case \u2014 to propose an alternative approach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch global networking has the capacity to break down geographic and institutional barriers to communication. It also enables patients to report outcomes immediately so that protocols with deleterious side effects can be quickly changed. Patients can compare their treatment with those of others; researchers can broadcast breakthroughs. The growing database should help predict which regimens might be most effective for a particular person.\n\nOf course maintaining and extending the platform could be expensive. When I asked Dr. Blau how his for-profit company was financed, he said that the initial investment came from a house he and his wife sold three years ago. He hopes that future revenue might come from pharmaceutical companies. All4Cure could accelerate the approval of investigational drugs and provide feedback on approved drugs.\n\nDr. Blau\u2019s enthusiasm sparks my realization that the sort of networking available to myeloma patients through All4Cure would transform the lives of the women in my gynecological cancer support group. Most of us feel only tenuously connected to an oncologist who often does not specialize in ovarian or uterine disease.\n\nIt is paradoxical that personalized medicine involves crowdsourcing.

An ancient, sandy-colored grain, fonio was cultivated for thousands of years across West Africa and still is. Thiam remembers eating the grain too, though it wasn\u2019t really prized, at least not in the way it used to be.\n\nStanding barefoot in a friend\u2019s apartment in Manhattan, where we met before a recent snowstorm to make lunch, Thiam explained how local grains like fonio lost some cultural currency around the time of French colonization.

Back in the 1980s, when I came to New York, they were simply a thing you had to order with Chinese takeout because somebody always wanted them, even though they usually tasted like leftover spaghetti with Skippy.\n\nBefore this, though, cold sesame noodles in New York were the specialty of one particular Sichuan-born chef, Yu Fa Tang. Called Shorty by everybody, Tang came here in the early \u201960s after working for more than a decade in Taiwan. By 1967 he had his own restaurant on East Broadway, Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn, where among other renditions of Sichuanese food he made cold sesame noodles that would lodge themselves in the memories of generations of New Yorkers and be imitated, lamentably, by takeout cooks all over town. At its peak it reportedly went through 500 pounds of noodles a day.\n\nFor more details on the background of the dish and its life after the restaurant closed, I refer you to a 2007 treatise that Sam Sifton wrote in The New York Times Magazine. For a taste of the original and unexpurgated recipe, I refer you to the very good new restaurant that opened on the site of the original in October. Its name now shortened to Hwa Yuan Szechuan, it is worth visiting for reasons that go well beyond nostalgia.\n\nHwa Yuan is an imposing restaurant, built by Shorty\u2019s son Chien Lieh Tang and his grandson James Tang to plant the family name solidly in this century.

With skewed census data, public health officials may invest in solving a problem that does not exist \u2014 or worse, may overlook one that does.\n\n\u201cThis is completely foundational,\u201d said Michael Fraser, the executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. \u201cWe take for granted that we have a really accurate understanding of who lives in this country: their ages, ethnicities, where they live.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Fraser added, \u201cThe bottom line is, if we are handed baseline numbers that aren\u2019t accurate, everything we do for program planning and what we do for implementation will be inadequate.\u201d\n\nPublic health officers use demographic data to model neighborhoods before launching preventive programs, like tracking old housing in low-income communities where they expect to find lead-based paint. The same is true for preventing asthma, a condition often correlated with substandard housing. By targeting the right homes for remediation early, officials can prevent disease and save millions of public dollars in treatment down the line.\n\nThe results of the census determine how more than $600 billion is appropriated across state and local governments each year, including federal block grants for children\u2019s health and preventive care services. An immigrant-heavy region that underreports its total population could lose public health dollars \u2014 as well as funding for food programs, school programs and transportation services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if immigrants going into the woodwork would solely harm services for that group. It would throw the whole system off,\u201d said Dr. Georges C. Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association. \u201cA representative census is what\u2019s best for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, argued that counting noncitizens caused other problems.\n\n\u201cOnly U.S. citizens should be represented in Congress,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cIf we counted only citizens for redistributing seats, California would give up several congressional seats to states that actually honor our Constitution and federal law.\u201d\n\nThe top two Census Bureau seats have interim occupants, and financial constraints have led the bureau to skip two of its three trial runs of its overhauled process for 2020. Experts worry that the funding constraints will hinder the bureau\u2019s ability to adjust the data for low participation rates or deploy adequate enumerators to low-response communities.\n\n\u201cAttorneys from the Department of Commerce are currently examining the justification for the data needed by the Department of Justice,\u201d Albert E.

The combination of coriander and black pepper give the dish a backbone of spice, strong enough to stand up to the onions, herbs and hit of pungent garlic.\n\nYou can serve lobio as a meatless main dish, or as a side dish with roasted or grilled meats or fish. Either way, its mix of sharp raw onion and soft, sweet browned onion, along with plenty of fresh green herbs, makes it hard to stop eating once you start.\n\nRecipe: Red Bean Stew With Fried Onions and Cilantro\n\nAnd to Drink \u2026\n\nThe ideal accompaniment to this Georgian bean stew would naturally be a Georgian wine, preferably made in the traditional manner, fermented and aged in a qvevri, like an amphora. If you have access to these wonderful wines, saparavi, a dry, sturdy red, might go well and would certainly be in the right spirit. A dry white from Georgia, which may more accurately be described as amber, would also be delicious. It derives both color and tannic structure in the qvevri by macerating and aging with the grape skins. If you can\u2019t find any traditional Georgian wines, other options include a good Cahors, perhaps an Etna red from Sicily or a Ribeira Sacra from Galicia in Spain. Or you could select from the genre known as orange wines, whites made not too differently from the Georgian whites.

The reluctance makes sense; local markets are by definition small, and journalism is expensive.\n\nBut after studying Ms. Lessin\u2019s and Mr. Thompson\u2019s methods, I suspect there\u2019s a market for subscription-based local coverage. Someone just has to build it.\n\nHow? Consider Ms. Lessin\u2019s plan for The Information, the tech news service she started in 2013 after spending eight years at The Wall Street Journal. Back then, online subscriptions seemed antiquated; many companies had experimented with charging users, but most had failed to win large numbers of subscribers, and the big money in media was in ad-supported sites aiming for rapid expansion through viral traffic.\n\n\u201cPeople thought no one would pay for news, especially tech news,\u201d Ms. Lessin told me last month. \u201cThe problem was the news business hadn\u2019t been focused on a key question: How do I deliver a differentiated product that people would pay for?\u201d", "title": "A Crazy Idea for Funding Local News: Charge People for It", "authors": []}

Preceding her appointment to the French house, the Paris native had spent 15 years working under her mentor Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re, first at Balenciaga and then at Louis Vuitton, as his right hand and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Ghesqui\u00e8re, Ramsay-Levi says, taught her to create with a democratic touch; arriving at Balenciaga as an intern in 2002, she was struck by his equal love for classical paintings and the music of Mariah Carey.\n\nThe confident, sexy collection she sent down the runway last fall \u2014 full of \u201970s citrus and earth tones, easy prairie dresses in micro floral prints, sharply tailored A-line miniskirts and denim, and insouciant, heavy-metal combat boots \u2014 revealed Ramsay-Levi\u2019s deep understanding (and personal mastery) of French cool-girl chic. It\u2019s that same, endlessly worshiped je ne sais quoi that the brand was built upon, when its founder Gaby Aghion introduced Chlo\u00e9 \u2014 and the concept of luxury pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter \u2014 to the world in 1952, at a time when most fashion houses were exclusively creating couture. \u201cI always like to have something that is a bit wrong \u2014 nothing too bourgeois,\u201d says Ramsay-Levi of her sensibility, which is informed by everything from New Wave cinema to Cycladic artifacts. \u201cI call it vintage in the future.\u201d\n\nThe first Frenchwoman to take the helm at Chlo\u00e9 since Martine Sitbon in 1987, Ramsay-Levi was raised on the Left Bank in a literary family (her father was a book and magazine editor) and now lives in the Second Arrondissement with her 5-year-old son, Balthus. She pursued her childhood fantasy of becoming an archaeologist by getting a history degree before enrolling at the esteemed fashion school Studio Ber\u00e7ot in 2000. There, she quickly became known as \u201cthe Balenciaga fan,\u201d for her obsession with Ghesqui\u00e8re, the house\u2019s then-creative director.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "T Introduces: The Nomad\n\nWhat is a hotel for? For most of history, it did only what it had to: provide a home when you were away from yours. Then, in the last century, a hotel became a place meant not just for shelter, but a destination; a place that embraced its not-homeness by being better than your home could ever be.\n\nNow, a new project is defining the hotel anew. In September, 700,000 Heures will become the world\u2019s first nomadic hotel. The idea is that a hotel is not an actual structure, but a state of mind, a series of experiences, a respite from your life. Every six months, 700,000 Heures (the approximate length of an average human life in the developed world) will change locations, occupying different buildings in different places \u2014 sometimes an existing building will be reimagined or refit for the hotel\u2019s needs; other times, it might even be built from scratch. First up will be a four-room, 19th-century stone palazzo in Gagliano del Capo, a small town in Salento, Italy, known for its wild beaches and groves of knotted olive trees. Then, after this trial run, the palazzo will be returned to its owner, and 700,000 Heures will move to northwestern Cambodia, where guests will stay in a series of locations, among them an ancient Buddhist temple. Most of the structures the company inhabits will be small \u2014 likely no more than eight rooms in any one location \u2014 and first priority will be given to its several hundred members, who\u2019ll pay an annual 500 euro fee and will be able to opt into destinations as they please. (Those wanting to join can apply through one of 700,000 Heures\u2019 50 approved travel agents.) The company is the invention of a French hotelier named Thierry Teyssier, who over the years has operated small, exquisite hotels in Morocco, Portugal and Brazil. \u201cI want to be able to spend real time with my guests,\u201d he says. \u201c700,000 Heures is personal. It\u2019s the hotel I would like to find, if I were the traveler.\u201d\n\nAlthough 700,000 Heures will be the first impermanent hotel, it finds its origins in a dining and hospitality culture that has become ever more attracted to the ephemeral, the rootless and the rare. The past decade or so has seen a proliferation of pop-up restaurants and shops \u2014 Teyssier made his own contribution to this trend in the form of a pop-up hotel in Paraty, in southern Brazil, which operated for six months in 2014 before shutting down. At the same time, there\u2019s been an embrace of what might be called subscription-based hospitality: In London, there\u2019s Carousel, a restaurant with a constantly rotating series of guest chefs and a set menu each night for which tickets must be purchased in advance, or the membership-based Soho House, which now has 18 locations worldwide. Teyssier\u2019s company speaks to a certain kind of traveler\u2019s desire for both novelty and consistency \u2014 the location might be different, but the mood must always feel familiar.\n\nOne of the ways 700,000 Heures plans to achieve this is through Teyssier\u2019s presence; indeed, he\u2019ll act less as hotelier and more as impresario, remaining on-site through each of the hotel\u2019s incarnations, and organizing excursions and events for all of the guests. In Salento, this might mean a fishing-boat ride through hidden coves along the Adriatic, or a sunset picnic at Santa Maria di Leuca, a little-known Roman sanctuary. In Cambodia, destinations will include Tonle Sap Lake, a biosphere reserve with a floating village of wooden houses, or the French colonial city of Battambang, where travelers can train with acrobats at the renowned Phare Circus. The goal, Teyssier says, is for the guest to feel like an actor in a theatrical production: the natural outgrowth of an age in which vacations are presented like biopics on social media. And, as for an actor, 700,000 Heures also provides props: Along with the physical spaces, Teyssier has created a series of leather trunks \u2014 each filled with objects to create a different mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, from cocktail bar to art studio \u2014 that will appear at all of the hotels and will provide an aesthetic through line. The hotel will also present members with a mock passport, which will be stamped after each trip. \u201cSome people make sculpture,\u201d Teyssier says. \u201cI\u2019m in the business of creating memories.\u201d \u2014 GISELA WILLIAMS", "title": "A Cultural Compendium of What\u2019s New", "authors": []}

With Area C annexed, identifying the few bad guys seeking to kill Israelis among the 300,000 new Palestinian Israelis from Area C (who would have unfettered access to Israel) would be difficult and costly.\n\nThe physical barriers required to prevent residents of Areas A and B from filtering into Area C en route to Israel would be a security nightmare. The perimeter of each of the 169 Palestinian islands would have to be treated as an international border. To separate the annexed land from the islands it encircles, 1,200 miles of new barriers would be required, along with hundreds of security gates that would allow controlled Palestinian movement from one enclave to another or from their enclaves to land of theirs in Area C (where 75 percent of the land is owned by Palestinians). The cost of building such a barrier system would be about $10 billion, and constructing the gates, along with associated security measures, would cost far more.\n\nPalestinians would view Israeli annexation as a game-changer, foreclosing the option of a viable Palestinian state. The Palestinian Authority would collapse, and Israel would have to impose martial law and provide basic services to all Palestinians in the West Bank. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has estimated the annual cost of social security alone for Palestinians at $6 billion. The yearly cost of health, education and other government services could be $5 billion more.\n\nWith the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, Palestinian-Israeli security coordination would vanish. Many of the Palestinian troops would turn their weapons on Israelis, and the Palestinian street would most likely explode. This would leave Israel\u2019s military and its domestic security agency, Shin Bet, to take full security responsibility not just in the newly annexed Area C, but also for the millions of Palestinians in Areas A and B, where Palestinian security agencies now operate in close coordination with the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThis, in turn, would necessitate an increase in the I.D.F.\u2019s presence throughout the West Bank; the standing army could not do the job alone and a mobilization of reserves would be required. This, too, would tax the Israeli economy and severely diminish military preparedness for other security threats, most directly from Syria, where Iran seeks to establish a presence, and Lebanon, where Hezbollah has become more experienced at combat.\n\nArab governments might not be able to ignore potentially violent domestic expressions of outrage at Israel\u2019s actions. Accordingly, Israel\u2019s diplomatic and security relationships with Egypt and Jordan might not survive, and chances for additional relationships would vanish.\n\nIsrael\u2019s relationship with the American Jewish community would also be jeopardized, with annexation attempts further alienating large numbers of American Jews and accelerating the alarming trend of Jewish youth distancing themselves from Israel \u2014 a trend that undermines a major pillar of Israel\u2019s long-term national security.\n\nAnd not only Israel would suffer. All of this would come back to haunt the Trump administration, by undermining its efforts to forge an American-led regional coalition harnessing the resources of Israel and moderate Arab states to check Iran\u2019s hegemonic ambitions \u2014 a goal that serves the strategic interests of all.", "title": "Opinion | A Dangerous Course Israel Should Avoid", "authors": []}

Daphne, the novel\u2019s heroine, also experiences these spells when she\u2019s startled. In fact, Daphne has troubles when she feels any emotion, be it love, ecstasy, horror, gaiety or anger. Her head lolls and her knees buckle. She goes bum over teacup. The condition is debilitating, and thus Daphne has had to arrange her life incorporating many fail-safes. First off, she dulls her emotions by drinking \u2014 a lot. She hardly ever drives. She belongs to a support group for similarly afflicted people, and she\u2019s adopted a \u201cgrinding, deadening\u201d routine \u2014 work, home and Pit Stop, her neighborhood bar \u2014 that keeps her \u201csurviving.\u201d At home, Daphne\u2019s an expert cook, spends lots of time perusing an interior design publication and leaves NPR on low volume. \u201cPattern, repetition, small, comforting tasks \u2014 with the constant low buzz of stimuli, there just isn\u2019t time or space enough to really feel.\u201d Just like that, Boast seems to have captured today\u2019s cultural zeitgeist.\n\nPhoto\n\nDaphne\u2019s profession is also chosen to temper emotional responses. She works at the pharmaceutical laboratory MedEval, where she tests heart devices on, wait for it, dogs \u2014 adorable, lonely dogs with names like Biscuit. Where you or I might train our bodies at a gym, Daphne instead toughens up by watching a loop of heart-wrenching videos of global disasters and starving children on the internet. It\u2019s difficult to feel compassion for Daphne\u2019s condition given her brutal coping strategies.\n\nHowever, even the best-laid plans are no match for the heart. Daphne meets and falls in love with Ollie, a sensitive construction worker who pushes her outside her comfort zone. He takes Daphne for long walks in Golden Gate Park, to concerts inside enormous cement drainage pipes where, \u201cin the close, echoing confines, the notes seemed to sound directly in my ears,\u201d and on a particularly dangerous outing to a protest march. Watching Ollie and Daphne fall in love is both sweet and fraught. Their romance provides the novel\u2019s first opportunity for the reader to empathize with Daphne \u2014 love and sex are tricky for all of us. Her humanizing is not without its costs: She finds it harder to shut out a co-worker\u2019s worries over his ailing daughter, or the suffering of the dogs. A friend at her support group keeps arriving with bruises from his recent collapses. Daphne\u2019s concern about all of it begins to trigger her own episodes. Her plight is universal; risk losing control over one\u2019s own life by embracing human intimacy, or remain in the safe isolation of a hermetically sealed existence.\n\nThe novel is a loose retelling of Ovid\u2019s myth of Daphne and Apollo, in which the forest nymph prefers her freedom over the greedy love of the sun god. In the myth, as she flees Apollo, Daphne cries out to her father, the river god, to save her. Suddenly her legs stiffen, bark encircles her body and she turns into a laurel tree. Boast\u2019s own Daphne experiences a reverse evolution: As she comes to know Ollie, and to make timid forays into the politics and pain and tenderness of the world, she sheds her bark, her roots loosen. In the throes of new love, she thinks: \u201cSometimes I pray I could just stop dead in the middle of the street, in the middle of the day, and root myself fast in place.

It was a shattering moment, an event that changed my worldview.\u201d She adds: \u201cThat is part of what I wanted to capture in \u2018Love, Hate & Other Filters\u2019 \u2014 that moment when a young person\u2019s life is shattered by an event that has nothing to do with them.\u201d Maya\u2019s main narrative is shot through with a secondary tale, an unfolding act of domestic terrorism. \u201cThat story was inspired by two very specific references,\u201d Ahmed explains, \u201cthe interstitial chapters in \u2018The Grapes of Wrath\u2019 in terms of craft and structure, and a line from \u2018In Cold Blood,\u2019 by Truman Capote: \u2018Presently, the car crept forward.\u2019 That inspired the tone, the tension I wanted to capture.\u201d\n\nDARK STAR: As you can tell from her novel, \u201cThe Hazel Wood,\u201d a fantasy that features a 17-year-old drifter and enters the young adult list at No. 3, Melissa Albert read a lot of fairy tales as a child. \u201cThe ones I loved best included \u2018The 12 Dancing Princesses,\u2019 which is the closest the classic fairy-tale canon comes to portal fantasy,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso \u2018The Juniper Tree,\u2019 which mixes up filicide, madness, cannibalism and revenge into fairy-tale Grand Guignol, and \u2018Beauty and the Beast,\u2019 which I love best in retellings that work at expunging the whiff of Stockholm syndrome from the romance.\u201d The frightening side of fairy tales always appealed to her: \u201cBeing afraid of a wicked queen or a robber bridegroom is delicious and distant, miles away from, say, watching a slasher flick.\u201d Albert says she was also influenced by Yeats. \u201cI took the book\u2019s title from the first, haunting line of Yeats\u2019s wonderful poem \u2018The Song of Wandering Aengus,\u2019 which is also my epigraph: \u2018I went out to the hazel wood, because a fire was in my head.\u2019 It\u2019s the name of the grand, isolated estate belonging to my heroine\u2019s grandmother, a self-mythologizing author of dark fairy tales.\u201d", "title": "A Debut Novelist Takes On Islamophobia", "authors": []}

Ms. Taylor had read Mr. Cassese\u2019s speeches as a student.\n\nCarrying only a backpack filled with shabby clothes, Ms. Taylor asked her father to mail her something she could wear to her first job in The Hague. \u201cThey were completely inappropriate,\u201d she said, recalling those outfits.\n\nPhoto\n\nSpeaking from her home in The Hague, Ms. Taylor said she was drawn to defense work because it was essential to maintaining rights for everyone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTo have justice, it\u2019s two sides of the coin,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need defense.

I would never not defend someone because of who they are.\u201d\n\nIn June 2012, those principles were tested when she represented Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, who was accused of war crimes \u2014 a decision that led to her incarceration in a Libyan military facility.\n\nWhile conducting interviews with Mr. Qaddafi, after the coup that resulted in his father\u2019s ouster and death, Ms. Taylor and three of her colleagues were arrested by Libyan security forces.\n\nThe Libyans accused Ms. Taylor of carrying coded messages to her client and claimed she had used a \u201cspy pen\u201d with an embedded camera when meeting with him.\n\nIt was the first time lawyers working for the International Criminal Court, who have immunity from arrest, had been detained.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Unbeknown to Ms. Taylor and her colleagues, representatives from Australia and the International Criminal Court and lawyers from around the world were campaigning for their release.\n\n\u201cIt was a great shock,\u201d said Anthony Cassimatis, a law professor at the University of Queensland who had taught Ms. Taylor 15 years earlier. \u201cShe felt very strongly that he was entitled to a fair trial. I think she would do it again, in terms of ensuring that he was given appropriate defense protection.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe detained lawyers were each allowed a single five-minute phone call. Ms. Taylor spoke with her husband, Geoff Roberts, who is also a lawyer in The Hague, and her daughter, who was 2 years old at the time.\n\n\u201cNothing in my legal training had readied me for it,\u201d she said of her arrest, adding that the experience had made her more sympathetic to detainees.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think, until you\u2019ve been in detention, you can appreciate what it\u2019s like. You have no ability to know what\u2019s happening \u2014 those four walls control your life.\u201d\n\nSafely back in the Netherlands, Ms. Taylor took a single day to acclimate before returning to work. Two years later, she was offered a meeting in London with another Australian: Mr. Assange.\n\nThe pair met at the Ecuadorean Embassy for two hours.\n\n\u201cIt was quite surreal, actually, to compare our experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the years since that first meeting, Ms. Taylor has seen Mr. Assange\u2019s public standing change. Many who once saw him as a champion of liberal transparency now consider him a lawless partisan who enabled Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election on Donald J. Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nThough she has represented only Mr. Assange, not WikiLeaks, Ms. Taylor defended the organization\u2019s decision to publish the emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, at a key point in the race.\n\n\u201cWikiLeaks was not seeking to put someone in power. WikiLeaks was seeking to empower people to make informed choices,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cHow can you hold your politicians to account unless you know their views?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe leaked emails published by WikiLeaks, like the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Mr. Trump\u2019s crude remarks published by The Washington Post and Mr. Trump\u2019s leaked tax return obtained by The New York Times, demonstrate the importance of transparency, Ms. Taylor said.\n\n\u201cWhen liberals criticize WikiLeaks, they\u2019re not looking at the bigger picture. WikiLeaks has actually given birth to this idea that this information should come out, that we should hold people to account,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you look at something like the #MeToo campaign, it\u2019s a similar idea \u2014 the system was broken. WikiLeaks has encouraged a process.\u201d\n\nAsked how, as a feminist, she could defend Mr. Assange, a man who has been accused of rape and frequently called a misogynist, Ms. Taylor implied that the question was itself misogynistic.\n\n\u201cThat seems to have an implicit assumption that women can\u2019t be defense counsel,\u201d she said. \u201cThat we can\u2019t make impartial choices about representation issues, that we can\u2019t see issues of process. I would have an issue with that.\u201d She added that she believed that Mr. Assange\u2019s accusers had a right to be heard.\n\n\u201cAs a female, I think women should be able to do whatever we want to do,\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about fair trial, and I\u2019m passionate about female rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I can reconcile the two,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t have to choose.\u201d", "title": "A Defender of Assange Says She\u2019s Fighting for All", "authors": ["Adam Baidawi"]}

Yet this is a glancing admission, slipped passively into the narrative without elaboration. Cant\u00fa recounts moments of tender connection with frightened, injured border crossers. But he seems unwilling to look too closely at his complicity in despicable behavior, leaving a reader to worry about the fate of that close-up quest for enlightenment he told his mother he was after.\n\nWe surmise early on that Cant\u00fa, his psyche under strain, is not long for the job.

Long gone are the days when women in a Korean family were not allowed to eat at the same table as men or had to wait until men were finished. Government agencies and big corporations have instituted mandatory classes on harassment in recent years.\n\nStill, in this deeply patriarchal society, sons in many families still get the lion\u2019s shares of inheritances from parents, and in workplaces, women are often treated like temporary employees expected to quit once they marry.\n\nThe World Economic Forum ranks the country 118th of 144 in terms of gender equality. Men earn 37 percent more than women on average, a gap in wages that puts South Korea at the bottom of member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (The gap is 18 percent in the United States and 26 percent in Japan.)\n\nAs elsewhere, sexual abuse victims often remain quiet for fear of losing their jobs or being ostracized in the workplace.

In November, a 25-year-old employee of the furniture maker Hanssem posted a detailed account of being sexually assaulted by male colleagues. In another episode, nurses at Hallym University Medical Center in Anyang, south of Seoul, said they were told to dance in skimpy outfits at work-related events.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA broader outcry and lasting reforms, however, have been slow to materialize.

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "Could I fire her as my patient? I went to see the chief of my training program. He offered to help, but there was little that he could do; part of our work, he said, was to deal with \u201cdifficult patients.\u201d\n\nOver the next six months, I received hundreds of pages, phone calls, threats and entreaties from S. I tried prescribing methadone through a hospital program. It helped \u2014 it would turn out to be the only thing that helped \u2014 but she refused to continue the program. I referred her to a psychiatrist. I read books on headaches, on addiction, migraines, malingering, the ethics of abandoning the ill and the breakdown of a doctor-patient relationship. Late one night that fall, one of the E.R.s in the city paged me. S. had come in with a headache. By the time I spoke on the phone with the doctors, they had discharged her with a handful of Vicodins. A week later, she was in a walk-in clinic in northern Boston. Fed up with her yelling in the clinic, they had sent her home with a week\u2019s cache of Percocets.\n\nI\u2019m not writing this to expiate the guilt of doctors or excuse my complicity but as a testimony of the 12-odd months of mutual assured destruction that characterized my first encounter with addiction. We had no training in this kind of medicine. If the addict was helpless, then so, too, was the young physician: To try to treat addiction was to discover an inverted form of doctoring, in which the patient and doctor turned into wary, suspicious aliens circling and jabbing at each other. Medicine depends implicitly on a therapeutic alliance between a doctor and a patient, but addiction, I learned, distorts that alliance. The doctor shifts from healer to dealer. To the addict, the doctor is contorting the truth; to the doctor, it\u2019s the addict who is constantly inverting reality. The doctor is, at first, the enabler and the supplier, and then the tormentor, the withholder, the liar, the enemy. Perhaps the reason that the methadone clinic had worked for S., albeit fleetingly, I realized, was not only because of the drug\u2019s pharmacological effect but also because the clinic had forcibly re-established the alliance: There was, at least, a transactional transparency in what she was giving and getting. Rather than trying to fix her, here, at last, was a doctor who would willingly give her a fix.\n\nA few months ago, I was a visiting professor at the hospital in Boston where I first met S. I skipped the usual tradition of delivering a long, didactic lecture and joined the interns on their medical rounds. Every one of their medical practices, I learned, had an addicted patient. The residents now possessed the vocabulary and skills that I had lacked. They had learned the street slang for the drugs; they understood how to navigate some of the legal dilemmas of treatment and relapse. Some had visited methadone clinics in Boston, and they had memorized the complications of co-dosing with molly and China white. But many of them seemed to be reliving the fundamental uncertainties that I encountered 16 years before: How do you establish an alliance with a patient when the relationship is scarred by suspicion and mistrust? It was reassuring, yes, to see them trying to understand the impulses that drove an addict. But I wondered whether we also needed to understand the impulses that drive a doctor\u2019s relationship with an addicted patient: the failure of our credibility, our bizarre circumlocutions, our helplessness, the chronic relapses into self-doubt and disappointment. It was as if they had seen a fragment of a torn map, or solved only half of a puzzle.\n\nSometime in the fall of 2002, S. vanished. The pages stopped; the scheduled appointments were missed. I tried to call her at home; the phone rang insistently, as her pages had, but there was no response. Perhaps she had moved to another city, or found another doctor. I never saw her again. In 2006, I heard that she had died of an overdose.

He blamed politicians \u2014 mayors Michael R. Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo \u2014 and their acquiescence to the rich for permitting so many cars to flood the streets.

Paper, $16.95.\n\n\u201cLittle Reunions\u201d follows Julie Sheng from her teenage years into adulthood as she navigates a series of, yes, reunions, with her various family members and lovers \u2014 all set against the backdrop of a tumultuous time in Chinese history, the Sino-Japanese War. Julie splits her time between Hong Kong, where she goes to school, and Shanghai, where she, her family and extended family reside. Later she meets Chih-yung, a charming but mysterious man who works for the Japanese regime during the occupation. They become lovers, despite the fact that Chih-yung is not only married to more than one woman, but also romantically involved with still others besides Julie. The protagonist spends the latter half of the novel waiting for Chih-yung to commit to her; however, even when he does, their marriage is doomed: After the Japanese defeat, Chih-yung is forced to flee to the countryside.\n\nWhile one might expect \u201cLittle Reunions\u201d to chart Julie and Chih-yung\u2019s affair and subsequent marriage, and then her later affair with Yen Shan, it does not. In fact, the novel resists tracing any one particular relationship in a focused way. Eileen Chang (1920-95) uses broad brush strokes to take the reader through decades of a crumbling family. At this time in Chinese history, the aristocracy is falling out of favor. Looming on the horizon a few decades ahead is the Cultural Revolution. Readers should expect an extensive cast and speedy transitions, and take stock of the character index, a helpful 10-page, alphabetized list of everyone in the novel. And, given these quick transitions, be prepared to jump from event to event; for example, from an intimate conversation between mother and daughter to a sudden bombing.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I say we Chinese know nothing about romance and still never learn,\u201d says Julie\u2019s mother, Rachel, gloomily. \u201cWho would take a visitor at the gate straight to the inner chamber?\u201d\n\nImage\n\n\u201cWhen the bombing began, everyone said that the hotel staircase was the safest place.

Please hold.\u201d\n\nI suppose I could pretend that I didn\u2019t experience a tiny thrill when I heard that, and a bigger one a few seconds later when that unmistakably smooth and smoky voice said, \u201cHello.\u201d Who am I kidding? I saw \u201cKing Kong\u201d when I was 10, and just about everything she has done since, and a critic is really nothing more than a fan with a dubious professional credential. In spite of what some people might imagine, it\u2019s not often that I find myself in conversation with great actors. The customs of The New York Times keep critics at a distance from the people we write about. I prefer it that way, too. I don\u2019t want my own sympathies \u2014 my desire to like and be liked \u2014 to get in the way of the rigor and impersonality of the job.\n\nBut I am always curious about their jobs. For Sunday\u2019s newly redesigned issue of T Magazine, its editors asked me to talk to a bunch of artists \u2014 three bunches in fact, including composers, film editors, actors, directors and theater producers \u2014 about their work. Specifically about the ways they work together, collaborating on successive projects in a fashion that recalls the traveling troupes of the olden days. The assignment gave me a chance to indulge that curiosity, while also staying away from the kinds of personal inquiries that make profile-writing my least favorite journalistic exercise. (Except as a reader.)\n\nSo I talked to Ms. Lange (along with Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson and Sterling K. Brown) about Ryan Murphy, whose \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d series are specimens of the modern troupe sensibility. I talked with John Leguizamo and Oscar Isaac about Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater in Lower Manhattan, and with Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig about Noah Baumbach, whose films include \u201cThe Squid and the Whale\u201d and, recently, \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected).\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t talk to only well-known actors, and I wasn\u2019t looking for the usual quotes about what kind of \u201cjourney\u201d a particular project represented. I was after something more elusive, and a thing that might have been hard to capture over the phone: the logic of collaboration itself, the particular alchemy that endows a body of work with its own personality, one which is not just that of a single artist. The signatures of the director, the showrunner or the theater\u2019s boss may be on the shows and the films, and their authority and vision may keep the wheels turning, but what magnetizes the interest of audiences is not just a singular voice. It\u2019s a chorus finding new arrangements and harmonies each time it assembles. As a critic, you observe the patterns (and take note of the recurring names in the credits), but all you see is the finished product of efforts that remain fundamentally mysterious. It\u2019s intriguing to ask the magicians about their tricks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, all of them had much more to say than I could ever hope to fit into 2,000 words or so. Mr. Eustis treated me to a 40-minute lecture on three decades of American theatrical history that made me wish for another hour. Jeanine Tesori, who wrote the music for \u201cFun Home,\u201d sat with me for more than an hour in a noisy Manhattan restaurant patiently explaining how the musical took shape. Jen Lame, Mr. Baumbach\u2019s editor, in her ninth month of pregnancy, walked me through the Baumbach method from script to postproduction. And then I heard it again, a bit differently, from Mr. Baumbach himself.\n\nThe most challenging interview was with Ms. Gerwig, who has co-written three films with Mr. Baumbach, appeared in four and lives with him in New York. When we spoke on the phone, she was in Sacramento and I was in Rome. The time difference was ridiculous, time was tight, and I felt a little awkward about the fact that I had just filed my review of Ms. Gerwig\u2019s movie, \u201cLady Bird.\u201d I ducked into a doorway on a semi-quiet street and took notes by the light of a streetlamp, managing to record her perfect metaphor for creative collaboration, which I won\u2019t spoil by paraphrasing here.", "title": "A Film Critic\u2019s Fan Boy Comes Out to Play", "authors": ["A.

Mr. Perillo is a registered Republican, though he said that was because of a single vote long ago, adding that he has always been an independent.\n\nThe battle with the Council has quickly enveloped the entire town. Mr. Perillo\u2019s supporters have launched a Facebook group to back him, while his campaign Facebook has also been pushing his arguments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSoon, hundreds of people were flooding the normally staid Council sessions, loudly cheering on their new mayor. It elicited a rare emotion from Mr. Perillo: surprise.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe public was doing more than I was. There were people who thought I wasn\u2019t being treated fairly.\u201d\n\nSome Council members have described their early dealings with Mr. Merillo as \u201cchallenging,\u201d attributing it to the mayor\u2019s inexperience.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe is very new at politics, and the things that go on in the internal side of it,\u201d said Christopher Pak, a councilman. \u201cBut he\u2019s working hard toward making it work.\u201d\n\nIf there is a starting point for Mr. Perillo\u2019s decades-long, relatively unplanned drift into politics, it might be sometime in the last year, when he finally reached a breaking point with his property tax bill, and grew increasingly angry at what he viewed was opaque spending by the town\u2019s administration. A whistle-blower lawsuit involving the Police Department that cost his town $1.1 million further motivated him.\n\n\u201cI wanted to find out what was going on actually,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of ticked me off a little bit.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Perhaps no one was better suited to canvass the 15-square-mile borough.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really see the point of mailing a flier out if we could walk them to people\u2019s doors,\u201d said Mr. Leech, 60, who has also been Mr. Perillo\u2019s next-door neighbor since 1992.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo the two men with no political experience (Mr. Leech says did technically serve as campaign manager for a student council president in high school \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m two-for-two now\u201d) set out for a monthslong walkabout.\n\nSometimes they just left fliers, while other times visits led to extended conversations. Mr. Perillo was always proud to end an encounter with a handshake, a grip that even after 93 years \u2014 38 of them as an electrical engineer for the Department of Defense, plus a tour in the South Pacific during World War II \u2014 can still crack a knuckle.\n\nHis vigor, he says, comes from keeping his body in motion. He tries to play golf at least two times a week, though he laments that he uses a golf cart now, and considers himself a consistent player (\u201cSometimes I wish I could hit it like him,\u201d said his grandson, Mike Perillo-Gentile).

The two men are close; Mr. Perillo was the best man at his grandson\u2019s wedding last October.

Her eyes were not closed and I made a mental note to look that up: Do birds have eyelids? Echo whined at the front door to be let inside, and I ignored her.

They are confusing and \u2014 for many voters the Democrats need \u2014 beside the point. Let Robert Mueller do his business and support him throughout. Otherwise restrain yourself. There may turn out to be not much there. There certainly aren\u2019t many votes.\n\nERIC WEINBERGER\n\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a progressive member of the party who has consistently felt dismissed and belittled by mainstream Democrats, I would strongly recommend that they treat the progressives as though we matter, and that our opinions and positions have value. To disregard or ridicule our interests and then to insist that we must vote Democratic is demoralizing. We have enough trouble motivating people to vote without treating them as though their only importance to the party is pulling the Democratic lever.\n\nIt\u2019s true that both sides of the party need to compromise and work together in order to win, but so far \u201ccompromise\u201d seems to mean \u201cprogressive people, do as you\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nT. COLE, BOSTON\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI have been a registered Democrat since being able to vote, and I come from a very progressive family. Nonetheless, the Democrats\u2019 persistent pushing of identity politics has made it nearly untenable for me to vote for my party in 2018 \u2014 yes, even in the face of Trumpism. The Democrats need to ease off the \u201ccis white male bashing\u201d and foster a narrative not based on identity politics, lest they lose their centrist base to appease a vocal radical fringe. Continuing doing what the party is currently doing is not convincing any middle-class and poor Rust Belt voters that we are the party that is best for them.

I would suggest \u201cfairness,\u201d which strongly resonates with most people, including with many Trump voters who constantly complain that the system is rigged. Many people on the right feel that they have been left behind while others (immigrants, minorities, \u201cwelfare queens,\u201d etc.) are cutting the line and unfairly using the government to their advantage. This anger needs to be redirected toward the real source of unfairness: the rich who take advantage of the poor and the middle class. The Democrats should above all explain as clearly as possible the causal link between the Republican tax cuts (very generous to the rich) and the Republican budget (very cruel to the poor and middle class).\n\nPATRICK SINGY, NISKAYUNA, N.Y.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhen I was growing up (I\u2019m 71), the Democratic Party was a bold, brash big tent of diversity representing the working class, bursting at the seams with a plethora of viable and colorful candidates. It was the party that conceived Social Security, Medicare and the Civil Rights Act and was willing to fight for those programs, damn the consequences, because they were right and just. Flash forward to now.\n\nThe Democratic Party needs to begin by replacing the likes of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, with new, exciting, dramatic figures. It needs to persuade young Democrats to run for leadership roles and national office. It needs to fully re-establish itself as the party of the working class and the forgotten, willing to pursue its ideals, damn the consequences.", "title": "Opinion | A Game Plan for Democrats (Actually, 16 of Them)", "authors": []}

Three works by the outsider sculptor Judith Scott (1943-2005), known for creating evocative misshapen presences by wrapping found objects in layers of yarn , share a low platform with the work of the mainstream artist Nancy Shaver, whose delicate assemblage-boxes covered with found papers and fabrics, resemble folk-art updates. An airy assemblage by Jessica Stockholder, also mainstream, takes elegant charge of one wall. On another hangs a large provocative quilt by Rosie Lee Tompkins (1936-2006) made of found fabrics, including segments of an American flag and towels, one depicting Jesus. It has the bold color and scale of a James Rosenquist Pop art painting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is just the overture. Because of the volume of material here, it\u2019s best to view the show the way Ms. Cooke intended, by tackling the three periods chronologically.\n\n1924 to 1943: Folk Aesthetics Reconfigured\n\nPhoto\n\nThis section traces the growing understanding of folk art\u2019s formal simplicity as implicitly modern. It includes the work of trained artists who were early appreciators, among them, Charles Sheeler, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Marsden Hartley, Florine Stettheimer and Elie Nadelman. There are also unfamiliar works that mesmerize, including two from around 1930: \u201cAdam and Eve and the Garden,\u201d a carved wood tableau by Jos\u00e9 Dolores L\u00f3pez that buzzes with medieval sprightliness, and Palmer Hayden\u2019s \u201cUntitled (Dreamer),\u201d which depicts a black man sleeping in a pose and simplified style reminiscent of both Henri Rousseau and Paul Gauguin. The man\u2019s head rests sweetly on a fringed pillow, while a trumpet, a guitar and a drum are played by disembodied hands.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art collected and exhibited some of the self-taught artists found here under the leadership of its founding director, Alfred H. Barr Jr. \u2014 a folk-art true believer. Perhaps the most surprising is the presence of work by Edward Hicks, the early-19th-century Quaker painter of sentient animals, including a \u201cPeaceable Kingdom,\u201d from about 1834, similar to the one the Modern once owned.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt times the allegiance to chronology curtails chances to surprise. Lonnie Holley\u2019s wonderful 1985 sculpture in carved sandstone is marooned just outside the show; it should have been with its (mostly) 1930s precursors, among the carved stone sculptures of William Edmondson and John B. Flanagan whose pairing is by now a bit tired. And there are strange missed opportunities: \u201cMilky Way,\u201d a luminous dripped-paint abstraction from 1945 by the self-taught Ukrainian-American artist Janet Sobel, should have been paired with one by Jackson Pollock (who was aware of her work). But Ms. Cooke consistently skirts canonical figures; her vanguard artists are also in different ways outliers, except for art stars like Kara Walker and Cindy Sherman, both of whom appear later without much justification, though Ms. Sherman collects and has written about some of the outsider photographers grouped around her.\n\n1968-1992: Commensurables and Incommensurables\n\nPhoto\n\nThe second section gives the show a combustible center; its title alludes to the debate over whether self-taught artists could be compared to trained ones or are incomparable. \u201cOutsider art\u201d supersedes \u201cfolk art,\u201d connoting a more jarring, free-range aesthetic usually from outside the Northeast, as demonstrated here. Starting in an almost too spacious gallery this section contains the most intense visual conversations between taught and self-taught.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s between the idiosyncratically figurative Chicago Imagists (Roger Brown, Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson) and some of the outsider greats they discovered, recovered or championed: Ram\u00edrez, Joseph Yoakum and P.M. Wentworth. The back and forth between Brown\u2019s meticulous landscape forms and Yoakum\u2019s is especially rewarding.\n\nNext, there is also a dialogue regarding visceral materials and sometimes painful themes between self-taught and taught African-American artists. The first group gained wider attention with \u201cBlack Folk Art in America: 1930-1980,\u201d a landmark exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1982. They included David Butler (1898-1997), who fashioned animals, angels and people from cut and painted tin and other found items; the religious painter Sister Gertrude Morgan (1900-1980); Steve Ashby (1904-1980), who made raw figurative assemblages out of scavenged materials; and Elijah Pierce (1892-1984), whose carved and painted wood reliefs depict biblical scenes and national figures like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThen the show turns to work by the second group, an imposing cadre of trained artists working in Los Angeles like Betye Saar, John Outterbridge, Senga Nengudi and Noah Purifoy, who worked for decades at the margins of the mainstream, exploring aspects of assemblage and found materials as well as political expression in often abstract forms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1998-2013: Determining Difference Differently\n\nPhoto\n\nThe show starts to unravel as it rushes through its final section, despite the title\u2019s koan-like optimism. Mr. Holley\u2019s two delicate assemblages may make you yearn for something bigger and more ferocious from this versatile Southern outsider, and also for the obstreperous painted or rusted metal reliefs by his friend Thornton Dial, who is inexplicably absent. Two formally educated artists especially make sense in the \u201coutlier\u201d zone. One is Greer Lankton, whose drawings, photographs and dolls allude to her transition to womanhood and celebrate various glamorous icons, including the first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who remains unforgettably elegant amid tragedy, in the famous pink Chanel suit she wore on Nov. 22, 1963. The other is Matt Mullican, whose large drawings on paper-backed bedsheets covered with numbers, words and images has a \u201cdrawing in tongues\u201d quality, and were partly achieved through hypnosis. It is however unclear what \u2014 besides being two-sided \u2014 his work has to do with the big watercolors of the towering outsider talent Henry Darger (1892-1973), whose illustrated epic about the Vivian Girls used enlarged images from children\u2019s coloring books and would be better compared with Warhol.\n\nIn the last gallery you can revel in the vibrant geometric quilts of Mary Lee Bendolph and Annie Mae Young, who emerged in the rapturously received exhibition \u201cThe Quilts of Gee\u2019s Bend,\u201d which toured the country in 2002. Also here are two more quilts, made of small irregular squares of color, by the great Rosie Lee Tompkins. Ms. Tompkins may belong to the string of geniuses who emerged in the last three decades of the 20th century. But who knows, there always seem to be more, expanding and improving the story of American art.\n\nLooking for More Information? Here\u2019s a History\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first section of \u201cOutliers and American Vanguard Art\u201d includes a memorable glimpse of the MoMA\u2019s early devotion to self-taught artists. This involvement is known, but seeing it made flesh with wonderful works of art is a different order of magnitude \u2014 at once exciting and saddening. We see a museum that might have been: more open and democratic, less bound up in the rigid Francophile narrative that defined the Modern in the later decades of the 20th century.\n\nBarr, the museum\u2019s founding director, viewed self-taught and educated art as equally essential to 20th-century modernism. Ultimately, this didn\u2019t sit well with the museum\u2019s blue-blooded trustees, and it was among the main reasons he was fired in 1943.\n\nBarr, who might well have embraced the \u201coutliers\u201d term, is the de facto hero of Ms. Cooke\u2019s National Gallery exhibition: a historic figure and early adopter of the integration that her exhibition proposes. It\u2019s enticing to consider how different the Modern and the art world might be had his directorship continued. \u201cOutliers\u201d and its predecessors might not even have been necessary.\n\nDuring the 1930s and early 1940s, Barr and his curatorial staff mounted several shows of self-taught artists and included them in more general exhibitions. Rousseau, the French na\u00efve painter who is represented in \u201cOutliers\u201d by three silent, hallucinatory canvases, was arguably the cornerstone of Barr\u2019s self-taught faith. An American favorite was John Kane, known for his dense paintings of life and industry in and around Pittsburgh, like the one in \u201cOutliers,\u201d and also for his startling 1929 self-portrait. One of six Kanes still in the Modern\u2019s collection, it shows a bare-chested strongman going soft, seemingly deified by three thick white bands that frame his head.\n\nOne of the \u201cMoMA-owns-this?\u201d surprises in \u201cOutliers\u201d is Dominique-Paul Peyronnet\u2019s \u201cThe Ferryman at Moselle,\u201d from around 1934. This polished vignette freezes forever a moment from World War I: its protagonist has just cut the ferry\u2019s rope, capsizing his boat and its load of German soldiers while others watch from the bank. A great artist who got away is also here: a dozen of Bill Traylor\u2019s taut silhouettes of town and farm life. Barr tried to buy a group of Traylors in 1941 for such a pittance that his offer was spurned. No one gets every great thing that comes along, not even Alfred Barr.\n\nIn 1941, a new installation of the museum\u2019s permanent collection began with a gallery of \u201cmodern primitives,\u201d but Barr\u2019s time was running out. One of the last straws was an exhibition of the paintings of the retired tailor Morris Hirshfield, represented in \u201cOutliers\u201d by \u201cGirl With Pigeons\u201d (1942), which shows a statue-like figure reclining on a splendid red couch. Today the most prominent vestige of Barr\u2019s folk-art advocacy is Rousseau\u2019s work, such a familiar part of the Modern\u2019s identity that it barely registers as \u201cself-taught.\u201d", "title": "A Groundbreaking Show Presents a New, Inclusive Vision of American Art", "authors": ["Roberta Smith"]}

But, Mr. Brewer said, \u201cit didn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d\n\nNational advocates for the homeless say much the same thing. The city of Seattle helps fund some tent camps, they said, through financial or logistical support, but the city also continues practices of sweeps and evictions for unsanctioned camps that it doesn\u2019t want.\n\n\u201cSeattle is doing some things that are fairly innovative,\u201d said Maria Foscarinis, the executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty, a nonprofit legal group in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut the encampments are there because of the failure to create affordable, decent housing. I absolutely fear that they will be seen as the solution.\u201d\n\nStill, over the 15 years that the Seattle area has allowed some camps \u2014 some anchored in one place, others, like TC3, roving from host to host \u2014 the arrangement has often affected the permanent residents they wound up living beside. Nowhere was that more true than at Seattle Pacific. The idea of a university hosting the homeless at all, let alone for months, is all but unheard-of around the nation, education experts said.\n\n\n\nThe university, which was founded by Free Methodist Church members in 1891, has allowed TC3 on campus for three 90-day stays over the last six years. Two other Seattle schools, the University of Washington and Seattle University, have also hosted camps.\n\n\u201cIt does change the institutional DNA,\u201d said Nate Mouttet, Seattle Pacific\u2019s vice president for enrollment management and marketing.

Clark, a former member of the Seattle City Council, said she had long wrestled with the question of whether supporting sanctioned camps was an openhearted city response, or a failure that looked good only in the moment. The population of the 11 sanctioned camps fluctuates, but their total capacity of about 500 to 600 people constitutes only a small fraction of the need here. Experts say that there are more than 11,000 homeless people in the region. Some say the sanctioned camps have created something of a hierarchy among the homeless, between people in the permitted tent cities and those in camps deemed illegal.\n\n\u201cMy thinking has evolved,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cIf the world were a better place, I would never support funding or policies that make outdoor camping \u2014 tent cities \u2014 a permanent part of the response to homelessness.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut as I look around at the scale of the crisis in the Seattle area, I don\u2019t have a better solution.\u201d\n\nInside TC3, alcohol or drug intoxication, violence, or failure to work volunteer security shifts can get residents banished by camp leaders, one of the relatively elaborate camp rules that cover 14 pages.\n\nStill, sometimes there is no clear path. Last fall, when Micailah Moore, a 20-year-old sociology major, arrived in the camp for an interview with a resident who was living there with his 6-year-old daughter, she found that the father had taken ill and was headed by ambulance to the hospital.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nHe pleaded with Ms. Moore: Could she drive his daughter there and meet them? She immediately said yes, but on the way, she became unsure about the ethics and liability at issue. She knew that her professors were having a meeting that day in a nearby doughnut shop, so she pulled over and ran in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What do I do?\u2019\u201d Ms. Moore said.\n\nThe situation was soon resolved. The little girl got a doughnut and was reunited with her father, who recovered from what turned out to be food poisoning.\n\nBut a bigger problem, Ms. Moore said, emerged more gradually, as she spent more time in the camp. She was raised Baptist in North Carolina, the daughter of a pastor. But now, she said, she was identifying with members of the tent camp and beginning to have questions about her faith.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I think it\u2019s O.K. to struggle and have doubts, but I\u2019ve had a lot more,\u201d she said. \u201cI want so badly for these people to be miraculously helped \u2014 I\u2019ve gone through placing that blame on God, and being frustrated.\u201d\n\nPatricia Malone, 57, a TC3 resident who has been through four moves now, leaned against a stack of boxes as the camp broke down at Seattle Pacific University on a recent Saturday morning.\n\nMs. Malone spent 40 years waiting tables, which she said took a toll on her back and legs. She came to Seattle in 2012 seeking better medical care and has been homeless on and off since.

But a range of conditions in the Pacific Ocean not necessarily related to climate change, including El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, can contribute to the formation and positioning of a ridge, Dr. Swain said.\n\nThe thin California snowpack is also a function of high temperatures. Following a record warm summer and fall in the state, temperatures have continued well above normal this winter. In the Sierra town of Truckee, Calif., on Thursday the high temperature, 64, was 21 degrees above the historical average.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is more precipitation as rain than as snow,\u201d said Doug Carlson, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources. The warmer temperatures raise the snow line, the elevation above which it is cold enough that precipitation falls as snow. They also cause what snow there is to melt faster.\n\nRain runs off immediately, while snowpack serves as a reservoir of water that is released over time as it melts. So, changes in the proportions of snow and rain and the rate of snowmelt can affect the availability and timing of water for people, industry and agriculture.\n\nThe snowpack conditions in the Sierra this year may be an extreme example of what scientists suggest will be the case with climate change \u2014 that as average temperatures rise, average snowpack will decline, perhaps by as much as 25 percent by midcentury.", "title": "A Hot, Dry Winter in California.

In Saskatchewan, tensions between indigenous and non-indigenous people run several generations deep.\n\nYet for many people in Canada, the reaction to the Boushie verdict has come as a surprise. A study in 2016 found that Canadians have only recently begun to understand the discrimination faced by indigenous people, and many feel it is no different from that faced by other minority populations in the country.\n\nThis can be explained partly by an urban-rural divide. Eighty percent of Canadians live in cities, and half of indigenous people reside in rural areas, leaving many urbanites unaware of the systemic and longstanding racism plaguing indigenous people. But if you look beyond the urban enclaves to Canada\u2019s rural backyard, you see a more complete picture.\n\nI grew up in a small Saskatchewan town two hours east of where Mr. Boushie was killed.

Normally, planes are barred from landing in the United States for six months after a visit to North Korea. (Asiana used an Airbus jet, not an American Boeing, for the trip.)\n\nThe joint ski training was held at North Korea\u2019s Masik Pass resort, a choice that drew heated criticism from South Korean conservatives. The resort is one of the signature projects of the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, who has ostentatiously supplied it with snowmobiles and other pieces of sports equipment considered luxuries in the impoverished North.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those fears were borne out when the names were announced on Wednesday: Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister, Kim Yo-jong, who is part of the delegation, was blacklisted by the United States Treasury in January 2017 over accusations that she was involved in North Korea\u2019s \u201congoing and serious human rights abuses and censorship activities.\u201d\n\nAnother member of the delegation, Choe Hwi, chairman of the North\u2019s National Sports Guidance Committee, was put on the same sanctions list, as well as on the United Nations Security Council sanctions list.\n\nSouth Korean officials said Thursday that they were talking with Washington and the United Nations to clear the North Koreans\u2019 visit to the South. They said the North Korean delegates\u2019 visit would help reduce tensions.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the Mangyongbong pulled into Mukho Port in South Korea, people waved signs welcoming its arrival.

The Winnipeg was available but since it was a cargo boat it had to be refurbished to accommodate some 2,000 passengers with berths, canteens for meals, an infirmary, a nursery for the very young and, of course, latrines.\n\nWhile volunteers from the French Communist Party worked around the clock to ready the vessel, Neruda was gathering donations from all over Latin America \u2014 and from friends like Pablo Picasso \u2014 to finance the increasingly exorbitant enterprise. Time was short: Europe was bracing for war, and bureaucrats in Santiago and Paris were sabotaging the effort. With only half the cash in hand one month before the ship was set to sail, a group of American Quakers unexpectedly offered to supply the rest of the required funds.\n\nThrough it all, Neruda was fueled by his love for Spain and his compassion for the victims of fascism, including one of his best friends, the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who had been murdered by a fascist death squad in 1936.\n\nAs Chile\u2019s consul during the early years of the Spanish Republic, Neruda had witnessed the bombardment of Madrid. The destruction of that city he loved and the assault upon culture and freedom were to mark him for the rest of his life and drastically change his literary priorities.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic, he declared, \u201cI swear to defend until my death what has been murdered in Spain: the right to happiness.\u201d No wonder he proclaimed the Winnipeg to have been his \u201cmost beautiful poem\u201d as it steamed away \u2014 without him or his wife, as they did not want to occupy space that was better occupied by those whose lives were in danger.\n\nAnd when that magnificent, gigantic, floating \u201cpoem\u201d of his, after a hazardous voyage, finally reached Valpara\u00edso, its passengers \u2014 despite the protests of right-wing nationalists and Nazi sympathizers \u2014 were given a welcome befitting heroes.", "title": "Opinion | A Lesson on Immigration From Pablo Neruda", "authors": []}

He filled the upper balloon with water to ensure that the catheter didn\u2019t slip out. Then, he inflated the lower balloon, filling that one with water, too. It pressed the embryo embedded into my C-section scar against the wall of my uterus, until the heart beat no more. In the second embryo, which was close by, the heartbeat had already stopped.

They did.\n\nAnd the doctor, who had preserved my uterus for a future and wanted pregnancy, warned that, if I chose to have another child, though rare, this could happen again.

A report issued last year by the British insurer Hiscox showed sales on the online art market in 2016 were up 15 percent over the previous year, reaching $3.75 billion. In 2015, sales were at $3.27 billion, a 24 percent increase from 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nMatthew Dibble, 60 a roofer in Cleveland, painted in the off season for three decades before turning to art full time. He began posting his work \u2014 large-scale abstract paintings with vigorous brush strokes \u2014 on Facebook in 2009, not because he was thinking about selling, but because he was attracted to the idea that a post could be seen and shared by people around the world, he said. He got hooked on the platform after making his first online sale there, to a collector in France \u2014 even though at $1,500 it was a lower price than his work had been fetching. He later added accounts on Pinterest and Instagram, where he has more than 15,000 followers.\n\nSince 2012, he has exhibited on saatchiart.com, a large commercial online gallery that displays more than 500 of his paintings, ranging in price from $2,500 to $10,000. He estimates he sells three to four works on the site a year. Working with the site, he said, \u201chas allowed me to expand my audience and has helped me gain confidence and a new sense of optimism for the future.\u201d\n\nAfter a representative from Kalisher began looking for Cleveland artists for a local client, Mr. Dibble landed a big commission in 2015. The result: 24 paintings hung as a single unit on display in the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Hotel. He earned just over $19,000 for the job.\n\nGeoffrey Stein, 57, a former lawyer who now paints full time, was forced to make a change when a Westchester County gallery that displayed his work, Lionheart, closed last fall after the gallery owner died. The gallery director, Susan D. Grissom, took the inventory online, calling the new site paraphe.art. The power of social media influenced her decision. \u201cInstagram is your new storefront,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Stein still sees a need to continue marketing in the physical world. He has been keeping some work with a gallery in Britain, while also being digitally savvy. \u201cArtists will need more than one platform,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Carolyn Edlund is the executive director of the Arts Business Institute, a nonprofit group on the Gulf Coast of Florida. The association conducts workshops in major cities and online for artists who want to start a business. \u201cEntry into the marketplace is incredibly easy,\u201d she said, making it crowded.\n\nSome see that as a virtue. Rachel A.J. Pownall, an art economist at Maastricht University in the Netherlands who prepared a report on art market trends for the European Fine Art Fair, said in an email: \u201cThe online developments are helping the art market blossom by reaching many more buyers through a large number of business models.\u201d She said that the online market could be a boon for older women whose work might have been overlooked by traditional galleries.\n\nMs. Pownall, who co-authored the recent paper, \u201cGlass Ceilings in the Art Market,\u201d said female artists, to establish themselves in the marketplace, have to be better than average.\n\n\u201cAn online presence using an art e-commerce platform,\u201d Ms. Pownall said in the email, \u201cis therefore likely to be a more attractive option for sales for females, who have more to gain by circumventing the traditional channels of the dealer and gallery, and hence my intuition that female artists are more prone to move online.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there can be some potential downsides to going online, but even those are changing. Artists have long relied on traditional galleries, for example, to navigate contracts and help them market their work. Now, online galleries are also bridging that gap. UGallery helps artists with pricing and offers advice about a professional path, and Saatchi Art has an artists relations team.\n\n\u201cWe help the artist prepare for every shipment, no matter how complicated, and act as his or her liaison with the courier services, managing any customs clearance issues on behalf of the artist and the art buyer,\u201d Saatchi Art\u2019s chief curator, Rebecca Wilson, said in an email.\n\nArtists who place their work on nonexclusive sites also need to be familiar with the terms, Ms. Grissom said.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "The train to Kazan stretched for what seemed like miles alongside the platform at the Moscow station. The green-painted locomotive and the long string of gray carriages looked like something from wartime. We had a second-class compartment with four berths, and as the train slowly pulled out of the station, I took out my book on Lenin, tucked my suitcase under the bed and settled myself by the window.\n\nThe book, \u201cLenin the Dictator: An Intimate Portrait,\u201d by Victor Sebestyen, was intriguing. Lenin\u2019s favorite writer was always Turgenev. I found that strange, because Lenin was one of the most strong-willed men who ever lived; he was at once zealously one-sided and emotionally evasive, but nevertheless, throughout his exile, no matter where he happened to be, in Zurich, London or Paris, he made sure to have Turgenev\u2019s collected works with him.\n\nI was reading about Lenin because the places we were going to for the next seven days had been set up in part with him in mind: In just a few weeks it would be exactly 100 years since the 1917 October Revolution, when he almost single-handedly seized power in Russia. We were going to Kazan, where Lenin studied law and where he was radicalized, and then we were going to Yekaterinburg, where Czar Nicholas II and his family were executed in a cellar on Lenin\u2019s order in 1918. That act, in its ruthless brutality, marked the end of Russia\u2019s old world and the beginning of its new one. Everything in the old world would be eradicated to make way for the new; no price was too high and there would be no way back.\n\nI desperately wanted a cigarette. Brown said it was against the law to smoke on the train, but if we just bought something from the crew, a candy bar or some tea, she was sure they would be able to suggest something.\n\nAfter we finished our tea, I followed Brown through the carriage. Just then the conductor emerged from her little cubicle. Her face was set and solemn, grim almost. She opened the door leading to the narrow passageway between the carriages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSmoke here,\u201d she said.\n\nI stepped out onto the juddering, swaying metal platform, one side of which was open all the way down to the rails underneath, so the sound of the thundering wheels filled the tiny space. She shut the door, and I bent to light a cigarette.\n\nWhen I got back, we walked through to the adjoining carriage. This one was third class: completely open, with bunk beds on both sides, and it was packed with people. The feet and heads of those sleeping in the top bunks were only inches away from my face as I went by, and the fact that they lay completely uncovered made me feel that I was intruding on something private. But none of the passengers seemed to think anything of it; they acted as if they were at home in their own living rooms.\n\nNot since the 19th century could any Scandinavian railway carriage have been as crowded, I thought.\n\nWe stopped in front of three women sitting chatting by a window who could have been in their late 50s. I asked Brown if she could introduce us. She did, and the three women eyed me attentively and expectantly.\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked them.\n\n\u201cTo Izhevsk,\u201d one woman said. \u201cWhere they make the Kalashnikovs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been in Moscow?\u201d\n\nThey nodded.\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing there?\u201d\n\nThey exchanged glances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a secret,\u201d she said, smiling. The other two laughed.\n\nPhoto\n\nBehind me someone said something, and when I turned I saw an old man, probably in his late 70s, grab Addario\u2019s hand and kiss it.\n\nEveryone around us laughed, including Addario.\n\nThe woman said something to Brown who smiled.\n\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said you\u2019re very handsome.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAre you going to write that down?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d I said. \u201cBut would you ask them if we can come back later and speak to them again?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time we returned it was pitch-dark outside. The three women were sitting around a small table with a bowl of nuts between them. The mood was quieter now, more of the passengers were asleep, the voices of those still talking were lower.\n\nThe woman who did most of the talking earlier must have given some thought to what she should say, because she started telling us about herself before I had even asked a question. Her name was Natalya. Her two friends were Olga and Zinaida. She told us that she was brought up in an orphanage, that she could not remember her parents, but that she had a sister from whom she had been separated and whom she never saw again. She had been searching for her sister all her life but still didn\u2019t know where she was.\n\n\u201cIn those days, it was standard practice to split up siblings when they were taken into care,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t do that anymore, but that was the system back then. She was sent to another home. When I grew up, I went back and got a job in the same home, I thought I might be able to steal her file and find out where she was. But I didn\u2019t find anything. So now I\u2019ve written to the producers of a state television program, which helps to reunite people with lost family members, and I\u2019m waiting to hear from them. I\u2019m hopeful!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen did you write to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo years ago.\u201d\n\nIt must have occurred to her as she said this that it didn\u2019t actually sound very hopeful, because she looked at me and added: \u201cIt can be difficult to trace people, even for their reporters. Sometimes it can take as many as five years.\u201d\n\nThe steady, rhythmic rumble of the train wheels over the railroad ties reverberated through the carriage. Now and again the walls were buffeted by a shift in the air pressure outside, and each time the door next to us was opened, all the sounds of the train would suddenly rise to an infernal cacophony of rattling and banging and hissing as the air from the gap between the carriages swept in.\n\nNatalya started to talk about her Christian faith. She had visited Israel the previous year to see the spot where Jesus was crucified.\n\n\u201cI once prayed for another woman to have a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she did. For myself I prayed for a husband. And then I met this wonderful man!\u201d\n\nThe others laughed.\n\nAs the stream of Russian flowed easily, almost dreamily back and forth in the sleep-drenched compartment, I caught the word \u201cPutin.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDid she say something about Putin?\u201d I asked Brown.\n\n\u201cYes, yes. She says her mother is a great fan of Putin. They\u2019re all fans of Putin.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love our homeland,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cAnd for the first time we have a Christian president, an Orthodox president.\u201d\n\nShe flipped over a magazine that was on the table to show us the cover. All the photos on it were of Putin. In one of them, he was stripped to the waist.\n\n\u201cDo you see that? Could Trump show off his body like that? He\u2019s old. His body is just a lump of lard!\u201d\n\nAll three laughed loudly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now a hundred years since the revolution. What does that mean to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t care about it,\u201d Natalya said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a hundred godless years. They tore down all the churches. They\u2019re being rebuilt now, and we can go there without being afraid. Here in this city, there\u2019s an icon of the Virgin Mary. It\u2019s very, very old. When it was found, it was completely black. Now it\u2019s gradually getting lighter. With every year that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer.\u201d\n\nWhen the interview was over, I headed down the corridor to the tiny space between the carriages for a smoke. As I opened the door I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looked around. It was the young, grim-faced conductor.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said wagging her finger at me. \u201cNo smoking anymore.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nI returned to our compartment and sat down by the window. In the bunks across from me, Addario and Brown had turned in for the night. About an hour later, the train stopped, and I peeped out of the window. It was pitch-black out there, no station to be seen. I got up and went to investigate. I opened the door onto the space between the carriages, and there was the conductor, puffing on a cigarette.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAha!\u201d I felt like saying. \u201cGotcha!\u201d\n\nInstead, I locked eyes with her for a second, just long enough to let her know that I knew, then I closed the door and went back to my compartment.\n\nThere is a particular pleasure in coming to a city at night, in the dark, with no idea of how it looks until you wake the next morning and step out onto the streets, into which \u2014 deprived of the gradual acclimatization of arrival \u2014 you feel suddenly thrust.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat sort of city was Kazan?\n\nThe neighborhood in which I found myself was modern and well maintained. The magnificent mosque, which I had seen from my hotel window when I woke, was brand new. When I went out for a walk, even the old wooden kiosk I stood and stared at, which was octagonal with a green metal dome and a little spire on the top, looked freshly renovated, more like a reconstruction of the past than a symbol of it.\n\nKazan, the capital of Tatarstan, is also the city where Lenin studied law and was expelled from the university. His father was an official in the czarist Civil Service, and the young Lenin\u2019s life revolved around school, literature and chess, which he played at a high level. Then two things happened that changed everything. First, his father, only 54, died suddenly from a stroke. And second, his brother Alexander, whom he idolized, was executed for conspiring to kill the czar.\n\nAlexander was studying natural sciences at Petersburg University when he became involved with a revolutionary student cell. To help finance the plot, he sold a gold medal he had been awarded for his academic work. Lenin had known nothing about his brother\u2019s revolutionary activities, and until then he had been totally uninterested in politics. His brother\u2019s execution changed all that. Not only did he immediately join a revolutionary cell at the university in Kazan but, as Sebestyen describes it in his Lenin biography, his whole personality was transformed. The happiness and high spirits of his early teens vanished, leaving behind a determined, withdrawn, highly disciplined, single-minded young man. It seems as though, from the moment he was expelled, Lenin never looked back: He spent the rest of his life working for the revolution, a revolution that he could not be sure would ever actually happen.\n\nAnd when it did finally come, he forced it to follow his line. The Bolsheviks were atheists, and religion was expunged from the whole of the new Russian state. For three generations, religion was repressed, until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, when it returned with a vengeance. That was very visible in Kazan. There are nearly 200 national and ethnic minorities in Russia. The largest of these are the Tatars, who make up roughly 4 percent of the population. Most of them practice Islam, and Kazan had, therefore, one of the largest Muslim communities of any city in Russia.\n\nThat evening I parked our rental car by the curb across the road from the National Museum of the Republic of Tatarstan. It was 6 o\u2019clock, and we were there to pick up a young woman named Dina Khabibullina, a Tatar and a practicing Muslim. We had met her earlier that day and talked about what it was like to belong to a religious and cultural minority in Russia, and she invited us to her apartment for dinner.\n\nDina was 29, we learned, and a postdoc at the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Tatarstan. She also worked at the museum and organized tours to local Tatar attractions. She was six months pregnant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe was brought up as a non-Muslim, in a home in which the Tatar culture was scarcely detectable and where they mainly spoke Russian. When she was 19, she had a sudden awakening. She converted to Islam and taught herself Tatar. So did many of her friends.\n\nHad religion always been there, buried deep in the society, merely biding its time? Did it fulfill such a powerful need in people that it was simply indestructible?\n\n\u201cWhat made you turn to the faith?\u201d I asked her.\n\n\u201cI was 19, and my father had died,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question arose as to whether he should be buried according to proper Muslim practice. At that moment I understood that there is an explanation for everything. I asked myself what I could do for him after his death. And in the teachings of Islam, it is clearly written: You must give alms to the poor, perform the hajj and slaughter a he-goat.\u201d\n\nDina\u2019s apartment complex appeared to date from the 1950s. The brick buildings, along narrow roads and surrounded by tall trees, were old and weathered but beautiful nonetheless, as buildings from bygone eras often are.\n\nShe led us up the stairs to the third floor, where her son, Gizzat, who was 7, was waiting along with her husband and her mother. The boy\u2019s father, her first husband, was dead, I eventually gathered.\n\nThe apartment was small, consisting of one room in which the adults and the child all slept, a tiny bathroom and a narrow kitchen. But it was warm inside, and Dina no longer seemed wary, as she had earlier that day; she was cheerful and relaxed. After saying goodbye to her mother, who was not staying for dinner, she went into the kitchen to make dinner while her husband, Damir Dolotkazin, spread a prayer mat on the living-room floor and the boy sat on the sofa bed and watched him.\n\nDamir looked as if he was in his late 20s; he was skinny, with short, dark hair and intense but gentle eyes. Barefoot, he stood in the corner of the living room and began to sing. The music, foreign to my ears, filled the room, and I was struck by the way in which it changed the whole apartment. Suddenly the mood grew solemn, but with the everyday routine \u2014 Dina cooking, her son on the sofa with his feet dangling, the toy helicopter on top of the bookcase \u2014 still present and alive.\n\nDamir knelt and bowed down. As he got to his feet again he whispered an almost silent prayer. Then he rolled up the mat, and the air of solemnity was gone as abruptly as it had come.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the kitchen, Dina called us in. She ladled a clear soup with pearls of fat, vegetables and chunks of dark meat into our bowls.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe intensity I had initially seen in Damir\u2019s eyes proved to be, or turned to, enthusiasm. He ate heartily and willingly answered all my questions.\n\n\u201cHave you always been a Muslim?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in the army here in Kazan. I was with a security division that escorted supply troops. I was 18 at the time and a Christian.\u201d One of his army friends was a Muslim, Damir went on, and \u201che taught me what it was about. I thought it was a very strong religion. Everything is explained in its teachings, including what to do, how to act.\u201d\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\u201cThis is very good,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat sort of meat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horse meat,\u201d Damir said.\n\nOh, no.\n\nOh, no, oh no.\n\nThere was no choice but to carry on eating; we were their guests, and it would have been rude not to eat the food they served us.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s very sad. What the politicians say and do doesn\u2019t necessarily have anything to do with those of us who live here. There are a lot of good people here, kind souls, and bad people too, of course. When it comes to politics, nothing has really changed. The elections are a joke.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner, a large tray of Tatar cakes was placed on the table. Damir told us that he used to be a great soccer fan. But then he corrected himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t really like the soccer. I liked the fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a soccer hooligan?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I spent three years traveling to soccer matches and fighting. I had some trouble with the law back then. But I no longer have any contact with that scene. Now I read instead. I try to read 20 books a year.\u201d\n\nOnce we had eaten and felt that we couldn\u2019t take up any more of their time, we said our goodbyes and were putting on our coats in the tiny hall when he came up to me.\n\n\u201cMy sister was killed in a plane crash in 2013,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d I said, not knowing what to do with the information.\n\nHe simply nodded, and we shook hands. I felt a great warmth toward him; he had told me about his life and this, one of the most important events, couldn\u2019t be left out, even if it didn\u2019t fit the rest of the conversation. The last thing I saw before the door closed behind us was the chair in the living room, over which hung a little boy\u2019s suit, a white shirt and a tie.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe landscape that opened up to either side of us as we left Kazan was flat and wide. The yellows and greens of the vegetation gleamed with lush intensity in the streaming sunlight, and always the Kazanka River was there, sometimes right alongside the road, sometimes far off, sometimes as wide as a great lake, sometimes narrowing, but always glittering and shimmering in the light, in every possible shade of blue.\n\nIt was beautiful, and wild too, although most of the land was cultivated. Maybe the air of wildness came from the scale, I thought, the very sense of earthly grandeur aroused as we drove along in our tiny car.\n\nAfter a while we stopped at a roadside diner lying out in the middle of a steppe. We all ordered soup at the counter and sat down at one of the tables. The four women working there, all white-clad, with red, hot cheeks, went back and forth between the counter and the kitchen beyond.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce we had eaten, we asked one of the waitresses if we could talk to her. She nodded uncertainly and dried her hands on her apron. She was young, in her late 20s, and she told us that this was just a temporary job; the restaurant was part of a chain, and she came in to help out when someone was sick. There was something reserved and guarded about her, and when I started asking her about Russia, she shot a glance at the others before answering.\n\n\u201cThings are better in Russia now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economy is improving, our lives are getting better and better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d said a man over at the cash register, looking at us. \u201cThings are worse in Russia! It\u2019s all going downhill! Worse and worse!\u201d\n\nHe was big and powerfully built, with close-cropped hair and a pale, flat face.\n\nBut he was smiling when he said it.\n\n\u201cNo progress,\u201d he boomed and went to sit down at a table in the center of the room. I thanked the reserved young woman, who fled into the kitchen, clearly relieved, as I walked somewhat hesitantly over to the truck driver.\n\nHe looked up at me, with his spoon in his hand.\n\n\u201cWhy are you writing about Russia?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn America, the image of Russia has so much to do with Putin and politics. So we\u2019ve come here to see what life outside of that is like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you!\u201d he said. \u201cSit down!\u201d\n\nHis name was Sergei. He was 44, and he drove a truck carrying cars from a Lada factory to dealers in Kazan.\n\n\u201cI have to work 16 hours a day to make ends meet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to live, you have to work. In 2004 I slept four hours a day and worked the rest. Then I had a boss to answer to. Now I work for myself, so at least I can choose my own routes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe looked straight at me as he spoke, always with a glint in his eye. A joke was never far away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chance of a lifetime, meeting someone like you,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI got robbed once, would you like to hear about that?\u201d\n\nOne evening, 15 years earlier, he had parked his truck outside Moscow and was making tea in the cab. The doors were locked. Suddenly the passenger window was smashed and two men were forcing their way in.\n\n\u201cLuckily only one of them had a knife,\u201d Sergei said. \u201cThe first one opened the door, the other climbed in and put a cord around my neck. I held him off with one arm, started the truck and drove it out onto the road to block it and get help that way. The guy who was trying to choke me was in the way of the guy with the knife. That\u2019s what saved me. I managed to open the other door and jump out. Then the guy with the knife stabbed me in the back. I still have the scar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they took off with the truck?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. I just wanted to save myself. I walked along the road, but no one stopped to help. It was hardly surprising, I was half naked and covered in blood. There was no one at the police station. Eventually I came to a house where there was a party, I ran in, grabbed some clothes and ran off again. They found the truck later, abandoned and broken down, minus the load. And I was arrested for stealing the clothes!\u201d\n\nHe laughed. His face was constantly in motion, his expression changing in counterpoint to every twist and turn. It was a trait I recognized: He was a storyteller.\n\nHe said his grandfather once claimed that he was a Romanov.\n\n\u201cA Romanov?\u201d I said. \u201cAs in the imperial family?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes. I asked my mother about it, but I have never been able to find out for sure.\u201d\n\nThat was pretty good luck, I thought. Running into a possible descendant of the czars in a roadside diner in the middle of Russia.\n\nHe started to talk about his grandfather.\n\n\u201cHe was very strong,\u201d he said, bringing his fist down between us on the table. It was giant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHis fist was like two of mine. One time he was going to water a calf. It was a hot day, and the air was still. The calf was being bothered by a fly, it kept trying to shake it off.\u201d He raised his head, tossing it about the way the calf had done. \u201cIts head hit Grandfather. He got mad and punched the calf and it dropped down dead. One punch. Dead.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a moment to let this story sink in, then he laughed.\n\n\u201cI believe that dreams are real,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case I\u2019ll tell you about a dream I had. I added an extra year to my grandfather\u2019s life in that dream. I had left my father and was living with my grandfather. I loved him very much. One night I dreamed that three men in black hats and black clothes \u2014 very mysterious, they looked a little like Georgians \u2014 came into our house. They walked right past me and up to my grandfather. They grabbed hold of him, and he didn\u2019t put up a fight, he just went with them. I hung on to him and was dragged along with him, out into the darkness. I couldn\u2019t save him, even though I\u2019m strong, too. It was hopeless. I started shouting and screaming. One of the men in black asked, \u2018Who\u2019s that shouting and screaming?\u2019 He spotted me, and then he asked: \u2018How long has he got?\u2019 \u2018One year,\u2019 said one of the others, \u2018for a few good deeds.\u2019 And then they disappeared.\u201d\n\nThe truck driver looked at me.\n\n\u201cOne week later Grandfather was taken into intensive care, he was in a coma. I said we didn\u2019t need to spend money on doctors, that he would get better. Five days later he woke up. He lived for exactly one more year.\u201d\n\nAfterward we stood outside and watched Sergei walk across the forecourt to his long semitrailer in the sunshine. He turned and waved, clambered in, started the grumbling engine, put the truck into gear and drove off.\n\nOne thing I most associated with Russia, something I had always wanted to see in real life, was the archetypal sort of village found in 19th-century Russian novels and historical photographs. A huddle of wooden cottages, often unpainted, some wooden fences, some vegetable plots, a few chickens running around, perhaps a shady grove of trees nearby, a lazily flowing river, surrounded by endless fields. Many times on this trip, I saw villages like this in the distance, first on the way to Turgenev\u2019s estate and later alongside the railroad line to Kazan. So, on this particular day, when a cluster of houses suddenly appeared just after the crest of a little hill, right there by the highway, I turned onto the rutted side road, stopped the car and got out.\n\nThe village seemed deserted except for a solitary old lady, bent over double working in a vegetable plot. Brown talked with her, and it appeared that there was a woman living in the village who was 102 years old.\n\n\u201cCan we meet her?\u201d I said.\n\nBrown asked the woman, who nodded and pointed out the direction.\n\nWe walked over to a bright, blue house with a woman in a head scarf moving around outside it. In her arms she held a large white hen that was struggling to get free.\n\nWhile Brown talked to her, a young rooster sped by with another in hot pursuit. The chase ended in a ball of feathers a little farther off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been invited in,\u201d Brown said.\n\nI stepped over the high threshold and into the hallway. It smelled slightly sour and musty inside, but it was pleasant and warm. There were rugs everywhere, both on the floors and on the walls. It felt like entering a cave.\n\nIn the middle of the living room stood a very old woman. As we entered, she turned her head slowly and looked at us.\n\nThe woman who had followed us in bustled past, led the old lady over to a bed that was pushed up against the wall, sat her down, removed her head scarf and put on a fresh one, then slipped a pair of leather slippers onto her feet.\n\nIt was almost as if she were dressing a doll. But the old woman didn\u2019t seem to mind. She sat perfectly still with her hands in her lap, watching us.\n\nShe wore a black dress patterned with roses. The white head scarf was big; it not only covered her head but also fell all the way down her back. Her name was Minizaitunya Ibyatullina.\n\nI walked over to her and gently shook her hand. It was dry and warm. She said something as she looked up at me.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s speaking Tatar,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\nMinizaitunya slowly turned her head toward the camera as Addario started taking photographs of her. Her son, Kasym, stood in the doorway, smiling and looking on. His wife, whose name was Alfiya, produced a large laminated photograph from a drawer and handed it to the old woman. It was of a soldier, and she held it up in front of herself.\n\nThis was a photograph of Minizaitunya\u2019s husband, who died in the war in 1943, in Ukraine. He was a very beautiful man. How odd it must be for her, I thought, to look at that picture of him, 70 years later, with him so young and handsome and her now 102.\n\nShe didn\u2019t appear to think anything of it. She looked proud, sitting there holding his picture.\n\nIt must have been odd for her son too. He was 80, more than twice as old as his father was when he died.\n\nKasym had lived in the village all his life. It had been a collective farm under the Soviet Union. He had worked as a carpenter, he told us. His mother had also worked all her life.\n\nShe said something in a soft voice, and her son bent down to her.\n\n\u201cShe says she\u2019s too old to work now,\u201d he said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have the strength for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sort of work did she do?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe worked on the collective farm. Milking the cows and other chores.\u201d\n\nAlfiya came into the living room and invited us to come to the table. She had been baking while we were there: On the table was a platter holding a warm flat loaf and several sorts of jam. There were only two chairs, and there could be no talk of either of them sitting down. The wife poured tea, the husband presented a large bag of hard candy and when I made no move to help myself, he took out three pieces and laid them next to my plate.\n\nFrom the living room came the sound of soft, slow footsteps.\n\n\u201cThe babushka\u2019s coming!\u201d Alfiya said. Seconds later Minizaitunya appeared in the doorway. Her son escorted her over to another bed, where she sat and watched us while we ate.\n\nShe was born in 1915. Russia was still a monarchy then, and Nicholas II still ruled. So she had seen the old czardom, the revolution, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union and, now, the new Russia.\n\nAlfiya put some fresh bread in a bag for us, Kasym gave us some bags of candy, and each of us was also presented with a small embroidered cloth to take with us. Even Minizaitunya had gifts for us: a bar of soap for Brown, scarves for Addario and me.\n\n\u201cAll of the people I grew up with are dead,\u201d she said from her seat on the bed when we were on our feet and about to leave. \u201cThere\u2019s no one left.\u201d\n\nI never look anyone straight in the eye for more than a few seconds at a time. I don\u2019t want to intrude on anyone, and maybe I don\u2019t want them to intrude on me. But once I had shaken everyone\u2019s hand in farewell that afternoon and was standing there looking at her and she looked back at me, I thought that I ought to hold her gaze, that I should look into her eyes. Those eyes that had seen the world during the time of the czars and seen the world for a hundred years after that.\n\nWe looked at each other for a long time. At first she seemed surprised, as if she were wondering what I was up to, but then, slowly, she began to smile, and it was so wonderful, that smile, that there were tears in my eyes a moment later when we walked out the door and left the house.\n\nThe final day of our journey to Yekaterinburg was a 15-hour drive. Near the end of the journey, in the middle of a deep forest that was still about an hour\u2019s drive from the city, I pulled onto a side road, stopped by a river and smoked a cigarette under the starry sky, right next to what I guessed was a pulp mill. Addario and Brown were asleep, and I thought about what lay ahead in the morning. The killing of the czar and his family in that cellar in Yekaterinburg was an earth-shattering event, a replay of the French Revolution, but for Lenin it must also have been a personal matter. He must have been full of hatred as a 17-year-old wandering through Kazan, hatred of the czar who had executed his brother, and it is not hard to imagine this personal hatred making him all the more steely and intransigent. After the revolution in 1917, when he assumed responsibility for the czar, who was by then in captivity, he must have thought of his brother, how he could avenge him. And do what his brother had once tried to do: kill the czar.\n\nA set of headlights flickered farther in among the trees. I followed them with my eyes as they drew closer. When the lights lit up the car I was leaning against, they slowed down. A faint unease welled up inside me. I had heard stories about violent robberies in the towns nearby. But then whoever it was sped past. I stepped on my cigarette, got into our car and drove back onto the main road. It was probably just some bored teenagers out for a ride, I thought. And you could understand why, out here where there was nothing but trees and water.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Yekaterinburg the next day we drove by a big crowd in a square, several hundred people carrying flags and shouting. We all turned to look as we passed.\n\n\u201cWhat are they protesting?\u201d Addario asked.\n\n\u201cThere are demonstrations all over the country today,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn support of the imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei Navalny. It\u2019s Putin\u2019s birthday today.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d I said, but a moment later I had forgotten the demonstration, because we were approaching the Church on the Blood, which sat on the actual spot where the legendary czar\u2019s story ended. It also housed something that, to me, was just as much the stuff of legend \u2014 an authentic Orthodox church service, which, thanks to all the Russian novels I had read, not least the works of Dostoyevsky, was bathed in a special light. This was the selfless light of mercy, associated not only with the highest and richest but also with the lowest and poorest. In Dostoyevsky\u2019s books, there is something morbid about this light, a frenzied, exhausting quality, which I have always regarded as typically Russian. I\u2019ve certainly never observed it anywhere else.\n\nWe got out of the car and stood in the rain, looking up at the church.\n\nI knew right away that I would not be realizing any kind of Dostoyevskian vision. The church had been built in the traditional style, with multiple shining domes, but it was clearly brand new. Looking at it gave me the same strange feeling I had once in Warsaw Old Town, where the buildings destroyed in World War II, many of which were centuries old, had been replaced with pristine replicas. It was like flickering through a glitch in time. The old was not old, the new was not new. So where were we?\n\nOn the night of July 16, 1918, as the story goes, the czar\u2019s family was awoken and told that they were being taken to a safer location. They came down from their rooms and were asked to wait in the cellar. They had no idea what was about to happen until the guns were raised against them. The revolutionaries who made up the firing squad were amateurs; some of them were drunk. The shots hit the family at random, the floor ran with blood, the air was thick with smoke, there must have been screaming and banging and confusion, several members of the family lay bleeding, but alive, on the floor, until they were finally killed with shots directly to the head. The bodies were then driven out of the town, and attempts were made to render their faces unrecognizable with acid before they were thrown down a mine shaft. Some days later, they were brought up again, transported to a nearby forest and buried there.\n\nThe house was gone, the cellar was gone, the blood and the bodies were gone. But the Romanovs weren\u2019t gone. In the Church on the Blood, they had returned, as symbols. Those crazed and bloody minutes, and all that they represented, had now been subsumed into reliquary forms that promised the opposite: foresight, structure, harmony, balance.\n\nAt the entrance to the church stood a sculpture of the whole Romanov family, made in the same heroic-realist style that Soviet artists used to depict the workers of the 1920s and 1930s. Inside the church hung icons in which Nicholas II was portrayed in the manner of the Middle Ages. Almost everything in the church involved a distortion of time. The ritual and repetition of the services abolished time entirely, linking the time within that chamber to divine time, which was eternal, unaffected by life or death, which was always there, which lasted forever. The czar and his family were lifted into this room, and the story with which they were associated disappeared, traceless. And yet Lenin existed in a similar space. Lying embalmed in his mausoleum on Red Square, his body was real and bound to the moment, but there was nothing about the body that connected him to the time when he held sway; he, too, was simultaneously inside and outside time.\n\nPhoto\n\nHistory is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake, Joyce wrote. Nowhere was that truer than Russia.\n\nThe next morning at the airport in Yekaterinburg, while I was waiting for my flight back to Moscow, I looked through the day\u2019s papers on my phone. There had been demonstrations against Putin and his government in all the major cities the day before. Particular mention was made of the demonstration in Yekaterinburg, the one we saw on our way to the church, because the police detained 24 demonstrators there.\n\nMy first thought was that I should have been there, that this was the place where it was all happening, that this was what I should have gone to see in order to present the best possible picture of modern Russia.\n\nThen I thought: no.\n\nStories have always held Russia together, and what makes them different from most other countries\u2019 nation-building stories, perhaps, is the authoritarian nature of the stories themselves: One story has been paramount while all that deviate from it have been forbidden. So it was under the czars, who censored books and newspapers; so it was under Lenin. And so it still is today \u2014 reporters in Russia are regularly imprisoned and sometimes simply murdered.\n\nAnd yet the alternative stories, the ones the authorities did not want to see gaining a foothold, the ones that told of abuse of power and oppression, of living in a dictatorship where all hope for the future was gone \u2014 these too had become standardized.\n\nThe demonstration was what the international newspapers reported about Russia the day before, and their stories confirmed and reinforced the larger story about a downtrodden people in a totalitarian state. But behind this reality there was another reality as well. The three lively women on the train; Dina and Damir, the young couple in Kazan with a baby on the way; Sergei the truck driver; the old, old woman in the village and the elderly couple who cared for her \u2014 which story about Russia could contain all of them without, at the same time, drastically reducing what was unique to each of them?\n\nTurgenev\u2019s stories could. The characters in them do not lead to anything beyond themselves. But the world as it is can\u2019t exist without its twin, the world as we want it to be. Lenin, the oppressor, read Turgenev all through his life, and Vladimir Putin revealed his love for \u201cA Sportsman\u2019s Sketches\u201d in an interview from 2011, when he said: \u201cThe main character, in a simple but picturesque and very sympathetic way, tells stories about people he met while hunting, and their lives. They are a sort of sketches on Russia\u2019s heartland of the mid-19th century that provide food for thought and allow us to see our country, its traditions and national psychology in a new light.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nLater that afternoon, at a hotel bar in Moscow, I met Sergei Lebedev, a 36-year-old novelist and journalist who lately had emerged as a civic activist. I was feeling as curious about the man himself as I was about his writing, as intrigued by his family background as by his knowledge of the country\u2019s history. He was born in 1981, I knew, and so was just old enough to have spent the first part of his childhood in the Soviet Union and his youth in the chaotic years after its demise. I also knew that he had originally been a geologist.\n\n\u201cI was born into a classic Soviet family,\u201d he said once we had taken our seats at a table near a window looking out onto the street. \u201cBoth my parents were geologists; they were members of the Soviet intelligentsia.\u201d\n\nHe was short and stocky, with a stubbly beard, and there was something indomitable about him that made me think about an animal that won\u2019t let go of something when it gets its teeth into it. Lebedev\u2019s books dealt with history \u2014 it lay like a shadow over everything he wrote \u2014 and the fact that its presence was so powerful suggested that the conflicts and tensions inherent in it were still unresolved, still had a bearing on Russian society in obscure yet palpable ways.\n\nLebedev told me that everything in his childhood was designed to keep parts of the past hidden from him. His great-grandfather had, for example, been an officer in the czar\u2019s army before he switched sides and joined the Red Army. But in the family\u2019s version of events, he had always worn the Red Army\u2019s cape with its red star, as if he had been born in 1917 and there had been nothing before that.\n\n\u201cFor me that was normal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo live in an incomplete world. To live in a world full of holes. With all these questions that could never be asked.\u201d\n\nThe street outside was lit by the rays of the low October sun and busy with people strolling through the town on this Sunday afternoon. Many of them must have had stories similar to Lebedev\u2019s, I thought. There is a mechanism in people that stops us from talking about bad experiences and makes us reluctant to stir up the past. But secrets foster a specific version of reality in which the individual pieces have to be arranged in a particular way, fitting so neatly together that if just one were to change position, the whole picture would fall apart. Our identity is shaped by stories, about our own history, about our family\u2019s history, about the history of our people or our country. What happens when one of these identity-shaping stories doesn\u2019t fit? Suddenly you are not who you thought you were. And then who are you?\n\nI asked him what the narrative in Russia was like now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very strange,\u201d he replied. \u201cFirst of all, it is important to understand that the authorities have no single, coherent ideology. They use elements from all sorts of different fields: If it works, they\u2019ll take it. They need a smoke screen to hide the fact that they\u2019re nothing but a bunch of kleptocrats. Take, for example, the name of the United Russia party. Those words, a \u2018united Russia,\u2019 were a slogan of the counterrevolutionaries, coined in reaction to Lenin and the Bolsheviks, who wished to establish new, self-governing republics. The current administration is building a state founded on Soviet nostalgia, but they have no qualms about appropriating an opposition slogan. And it\u2019s not the slightest bit controversial.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cWith each year that passes they try to reduce the significance of 1917. They do this because in their ideal version of events there was no revolution! They are trying to establish an unbroken link between the czars and Stalin\u2019s Russia. According to the current narrative, foreign spies and traitors provoked us into killing one another a hundred years ago. That must never happen again. Therefore we have to stand together, therefore we must all follow Putin\u2019s banner, therefore we must forbid all opposition, therefore we must even sacrifice our civil rights, because it must never happen again. That\u2019s roughly how it goes.\u201d", "title": "A Literary Road Trip Into the Heart of Russia", "authors": ["Karl Ove Knausgaard"]}

Roy, a young black man, is tried and wrongly convicted of rape while his wife, Celestial, waits for his return. But Jones\u2019s story isn\u2019t the one we are expecting, a courtroom drama or an examination of the prison-industrial complex; instead, it is a clear vision of the quiet devastation of a family. The novel focuses on the failed hopes of romantic love, disapproving in-laws, flawed families of origin, and the question of life with or without children that all married couples must negotiate. It is beautifully written, with many allusions to black music and culture \u2014 including the everyday poetry of the African-American community that begs to be heard.\n\nCelestial and Roy \u2014 in love, educated, middle-class members of the post-integration African-American generation \u2014 are decidedly upwardly mobile and unconcerned about issues of racial uplift and representation, though they have been chaptered and versed by their parents in the language of oppression. With Roy\u2019s career \u201con the come-up,\u201d as he describes it, and Celestial building a portfolio as an artist, they see a trajectory to become black rich, maybe even white rich. But after only 18 months of marriage, Roy is sentenced to 12 years in prison. The horror of this story lies in its banality: An innocent man, happily married, who does all the right things to succeed, is nonetheless sidelined to a concrete cell. The unfairness of the years stolen from this couple because of someone else\u2019s mistake, the great cosmic error that derails Roy\u2019s life, is the novel\u2019s slow burn.\n\nImage\n\nMuch of this story is told through the letters that Roy and Celestial write each other during and after his incarceration. Jones recreates the couple\u2019s grief, despair and anger until they finally work their way to acceptance. This is complicated emotional territory navigated with succinctness and precision, making what isn\u2019t said as haunting as the letters themselves.\n\nBy design, we learn little about prison life or about the inmates except \u201cGhetto Yoda,\u201d an old head who gives Roy advice and guidance. What we know for sure is that Roy\u2019s life has disintegrated while Celestial finds financial and artistic success making dolls in Roy\u2019s likeness. Her act of creation results in lifeless cloth babies that cannot provide succor or even connection to their inspiration. Celestial must ultimately decide if her approximation of a life and family is all she deserves.", "title": "A Marriage Upended, a Life Destroyed", "authors": []}

It includes a few images from his early, lastingly moving \u201cSentimental Journey\u201d (1971), whose small-scale prints document his honeymoon with his beloved wife, Yoko. Mr. Araki captures her staring into space on a bullet train, lying nude on a bed, and, in one of his most famous images, sleeping in a rowboat on a river in Kyushu, her checked skirt contrasting with the woven mat on the hull. He provided a wrenching coda after Yoko\u2019s early death from ovarian cancer, in 1990; we see her here in a flower-strewn coffin, her face so overlit she appears an angel bound home. (You may have seen more of this series in \u201cFor a New World to Come,\u201d the big photography show at Japan Society in 2015.)\n\nThere are a few excellent prints here of Mr. Araki\u2019s densely colored floral photographs \u2014 which, in contrast to Robert Mapplethorpe\u2019s elegant still lifes of tulips and calla lilies, take a licentious up-close view of pistils and stamens. Mr. Araki\u2019s commercial work and celebrity editorial are also included. We see Lady Gaga, her bound wrists undergirding her raised legs, or the Icelandic popstar, Bj\u00f6rk, who waxes eulogistic about Mr. Araki in a video here. (Weirdly the show omits the Bj\u00f6rk photographs themselves; Mr. Araki shot the cover of her album \u201cTelegram,\u201d rope-free.) And there is teeming, glorious Tokyo, whose blossoming trees and lowlife nightclubs have been his most reliable muse. If Mr. Araki has ever loved anything more than his wife, it is the megacity of 35 million, and several series intermingle nudes with prints of commuter trains, electoral posters, and landmarks like Philippe Starck\u2019s Asahi headquarters.\n\nStill, rope is for Mr. Araki what blue paint was for Yves Klein, and at the Museum of Sex especially, bondage is given particular prominence. His tied-up models are rarely fully nude, and usually have their eyes locked on the lens. They do not smile, but do not struggle either. A small fraction of his photographs objectify his models, but in the vast majority the bound women are in utter command.

It\u2019s too easy for mentally ill people to get guns.\u201d\n\nWe were already too deep in the weeds. The camera light snapped off; the reporters moved on.\n\nBut the interview continues in my imagination. I have questions for the reporter. Do you think that what you are doing will stop what\u2019s happening with guns in this country? Why are you so curious about my squishy emotional insides when they are clearly not part of the situation you are supposedly reporting? Surely you\u2019re aware of the iconography of televised mass shooting reports. The fleeing victims, the hugging weepers, the shrouded corpses, the departing ambulance. There\u2019s a form to it now. It\u2019s drama. It\u2019s entertainment. How does it feel to keep reporting mass shootings as you do?\n\nWhen gun violence becomes commodified as content by the media, we consume it rather than experience it. As a nation, we\u2019re dead to it now. Despite our momentary hysteria, we\u2019ve pretty much compartmentalized gun death, random mass shootings in particular. Consequently, we live in a country that seems to agree that 33,000 gun deaths a year is an acceptable price to pay for our unique, constitutionally guaranteed access to firearms.\n\nI do not believe this can be true. But how do I pierce America\u2019s complacent hide? Polls tell us that than 90 percent of people favor universal background checks, but a much smaller percentage actually do anything \u2014 at the ballot box or anywhere else \u2014 to make background checks a reality. How do we break through to the goodness in people? How do we get the attention of that vast middle?\n\nThere we were, pushing for another law that will save a few families from enduring what our families have endured. There are models that work; Massachusetts has some of the most stringent gun laws in the country. It also has the lowest gun death rate in America. There are dozens of ways to reduce gun violence, but the country as a whole seems to lack the will to do any of them. We lack the will to elect people who understand that sensible gun laws will save lives.\n\nI\u2019ve been at this for 25 years, and frankly I\u2019m fed up with carefully reasoned essays, with weeping in front of cameras. I\u2019m fed up with vigils, candles and moments of silence, and I think America is, too.\n\nPerhaps my next sound bite should be a snarl. I know of a survivor who has a crime-scene photograph of her daughter\u2019s bullet-riddled corpse. When she speaks with politicians about gun laws, she shows them the photograph. I have a similar photograph of my son. Perhaps the time has come to use it.", "title": "Opinion | A Message From the Club No One Wants to Join", "authors": []}

He acknowledged that some of the reserve\u2019s young people, along with white youths in the area, passed too much of their time with drinking, drugs and petty crime. For that he blamed the lack of job opportunities since the decline in oil prices, the lingering effects of the residential schools on families and the general dysfunction of the reserve.\n\nA relatively new and well-maintained school is an exception in the area. No footprints lead through the snow to a hockey arena seemingly too large for the 500 or so people who live there. Money and energy to keep it operating ran out some time ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nPointing to the community center across the street, Mr. Baptiste said that its basketball programs had stopped and that the building was used only for wakes and ceremonial occasions.

He said he was trying to turn off the engine of the car the men were driving while holding the pistol when the fatal bullet fired in what he testified was a complete surprise.\n\nExperts brought in by Mr. Stanley\u2019s lawyer said that on rare occasions, bullets can briefly linger inside guns and rifles after a trigger is pulled \u2014 although neither those experts nor ones with the police were able to recreate the flaw using Mr. Stanley\u2019s gun and ammunition.\n\nFor Ms. Tootoosis, the social media hatred prompted by the killing of her cousin may also prove to be his legacy.\n\n\u201cUltimately Coco\u2019s death needs to have a purpose,\u201d she said using the family\u2019s nickname for Mr. Boushie. \u201cIt\u2019s brought to light such a divide, and the question now isn\u2019t what is the government do about it, what are the courts going to do about it?

But one thing was clear: when the sun came up a few hours after the group had piled into a cab Mr. Fisher was dead.\n\nThe investigation went nowhere for a year.\n\nWhen the police found Mr. Fisher\u2019s body, the only thing that he had on him was $12 in cash. But they quickly discovered his wallet in a nearby sewer and identified him. They also learned that Mr. Fisher\u2019s Fairfield friends had reported him missing. The friends told the police that Mr. Fisher had gone off with Ms. DiPietro and her own friends. That was how investigators learned about the party at Mr. Giuca\u2019s house.\n\nBut most of the young people who had been there were \u201cuncooperative,\u201d said Raymond W. Kelly, the city\u2019s police commissioner at the time \u2014 an accusation disputed by their parents.\n\nThe body had been found been across the street from Mr. Cleary\u2019s house. And Mr. Cleary, whose mother, Susan Cleary, was a top official in the Kings County Republican Party, hired a lawyer almost instantly. Investigators said that Ms. DiPietro, who had slept at Mr. Cleary\u2019s house that night, was at first \u201cdifficult to locate.\u201d But her father, James DiPietro, a prominent defense lawyer, said she made herself available.\n\nWithin minutes of the shooting, police records maintain, Mr. Russo rushed home and chopped off the dreadlocks he had worn for years. Two days later, when he was interviewed by the police, he implicated Mr. Giuca and Mr. Cleary in the murder. A few days after that, Mr. Russo, who had not been charged yet, bought an airline ticket and went to California. At more or less the same time, the police used his statement to arrest Mr. Giuca. Without more evidence, however, the district attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute.\n\nPhoto\n\nForensic evidence, in fact, was slim. While a gun was never found, the police had recovered two of the five .22-caliber shell casings. Mr. Cleary\u2019s neighbors on Argyle Road reported hearing the shots, and police records show that some said they also heard a distinctly female voice on the street. Others claimed they saw a white car speeding up the block. Mr. Bederow, Mr. Giuca\u2019s lawyer, contends that Mr. Fisher was likely shot in the car and that the missing shell casings landed in it. In early reports, the police themselves said that Mr. Fisher had been dumped in the driveway from a car.\n\nAll of this \u2014 the kaleidoscopic theories, the stalled investigation, the constant media coverage \u2014 went on for months as no one was indicted. It took a toll on Mr. Fisher\u2019s parents, who lived in the bucolic town of Andover, N.J. Michael Fisher, an engineer for I.B.M., and Nancy Fisher, a real-estate agent, had never heard of Prospect Park South until they were told their son had been killed there. But on Feb. 4, 2004, four months after the murder, the Fishers joined the police at a news conference across the street from Mr. Giuca\u2019s house, urging his friends to share what they knew. Two days later, echoing their plea, The Daily News published a scathing editorial saying it was \u201cbeyond pathetic\u201d that the witnesses in the case had \u201clawyered up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSomeone who was at that party knows something,\u201d The News opined. \u201cThe question: Does he or she have compassion and conscience enough to come forward?\u201d\n\nBy May 2004, having already offered a $100,000 reward, the Fishers met with Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney. They were furious with how Mr. Hynes was handling the case and demanded changes. They soon got what they wanted. That same month, The Daily News later reported, Mr. Hynes created an \u201celite team\u201d to reinvestigate the killing, largely by going after the uncooperative young people. \u201cThey thought they could wait us out and thumb their nose at us,\u201d Mr. Hynes told The News. \u201cAnyone who saw pictures of that kid lying on the pavement with all the bullet wounds and did not feel a tinge of empathy is a cretin.\u201d\n\nJoe Hynes, as everyone in the Brooklyn courts called him, had been in office for nearly 15 years. But in 2004, he was anxiously anticipating a tough re-election campaign as several candidates were lining up to challenge him in the 2005 Democratic primary. The Fisher investigation was becoming a political albatross. Mr. Hynes needed a conviction.\n\nSo his new team went to work. In July 2004, nine months after Mr. Giuca\u2019s first arrest, he was arrested again, accused of having shot at a group of men in Florida while he was on vacation. Law-enforcement officials said at the time they hoped the arrest would pressure Mr. Giuca to cooperate in the Fisher case, which he did not. The Florida charges were ultimately dropped.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe prosecutors also empaneled an investigative grand jury that took testimony from nearly 100 witnesses. But by the end of the process, only two of them \u2014 Mr. Cleary and Lauren Calciano, Mr. Giuca\u2019s girlfriend at the time \u2014 offered any direct evidence of his involvement in the murder. In an odd move, Ms. DiPietro, who had seemed so central to the case, was never asked to testify.\n\nIn what was now his fourth interview with law enforcement, Mr. Cleary had completely changed his story, suddenly confessing that hours after the killing, he and Ms. Calciano had met with Mr. Giuca at his house on Stratford Road. Mr. Giuca, he said, told the two that he had given a gun to Mr. Russo, wanting him to show Mr. Fisher \u201cwhat\u2019s up.\u201d The testimony not only contradicted a polygraph test that Mr. Cleary had previously taken, showing he knew nothing about the murder; it also contradicted what Ms. Calciano said.\n\nIn her own testimony \u2014 the fifth time she had talked to the authorities \u2014 Ms. Calciano changed her story, too, admitting for the first time that she and Mr. Cleary had indeed met with Mr. Giuca after the murder. But her version of the meeting was different. She claimed Mr. Giuca had told them that Mr. Russo had approached him \u2014 not vice versa \u2014 asking for the gun because he wanted to rob Mr. Fisher. Mr. Cleary had also accused Ms. Calciano of hiding evidence after the shooting, a claim she denied.\n\nThis evidence, while far from ideal, was enough to secure indictments. And on Nov. 23, 2004, 13 months after Mr. Fisher\u2019s body was found, Mr. Russo was arrested. Mr. Giuca was arrested the following month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut before the case went to trial, a surprise witness emerged: John Avitto, a career criminal who met Mr. Giuca when they were housed together in a jail on Rikers Island. Mr. Avitto, who had a history of drug abuse, had just been released to a treatment center and almost immediately relapsed. When a warrant was issued for his rearrest, he called the police, telling them that Mr. Giuca, in a jailhouse buddy way, had confessed to the murder. Offering to help the investigation, Mr. Avitto said that Mr. Giuca had not only admitted to furnishing the gun that killed Mr. Fisher, but was actually present at the murder scene himself.\n\nTantalizing as it was, this new account had a curious problem: It was notably different from all of the other stories the prosecution had heard.", "title": "A Murder, a Conviction and a Never-Ending Case", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

And it must be soothing to know that as you travel the world you will find an Atelier waiting for you to climb up on a comfortable red leather stool, watch the cooks dressed in what look like black pajamas, admire the slightly supernatural colors of the vegetables and fruits submerged in water inside glass vases, recline into a menu filled with Robuchon classics and small variations on the same key ingredients (eggplant, quail, squab, lobster), all at prices that most people can\u2019t afford, but you can.\n\nLulling familiarity was not Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s aim when he built the first Atelier almost 15 years ago. Having won just about every honor the French gastronomic world offers at his first restaurant, he had officially retired, and when he came back it was only to knock the whole system on its side. His idea was a restaurant where the food, made to his excruciatingly precise standards, would be served not at tables but at a U-shaped counter. The format may have been borrowed from Japan or Spain, but in France the effect was radical, as were the late-night closing hours and no-reservations policy.\n\nThe proof of L\u2019Atelier\u2019s success is how un-shocking this sounds today.\n\nEarly on, as R.W. Apple reported in The New York Times, the prices could be modest \u201cif you avoid caviar and foie gras.\u201d This was less true by the time of L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s initial New York run, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown from 2006 to 2012, where Frank Bruni awarded it three stars.

Over the next four decades or so, shuttle services increased in frequency and, crucially, offered unlimited capacity on every departure.\n\nIf, for example, 100 people could fit on the plane at the gate in New York for the 8 a.m. departure to Boston but 101 passengers showed up, a second plane would be rolled out. \u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive proposition,\u201d Mr. Mann said, because airlines had to have planes and crews on standby. (Frequently, though, those standby aircraft never left the ground.)\n\nPhoto\n\nAirlines, however, still try to distinguish their shuttle flights to appeal to business travelers. \u201cThe word \u2018shuttle\u2019 has a really distinct meaning to our most frequent business travelers,\u201d said Vasu Raja, the vice president for network and schedule planning at American Airlines.\n\nAmerican\u2019s shuttles to Boston and Washington still follow a more consistent schedule than flights on other routes and tend to leave from the same gate. Passengers can also check in for the flights closer to departure time. Because of that consistency, Mr. Raja said, travelers \u201ccan be on autopilot\u201d while going through the airport.\n\nHe said the company had decided to expand its shuttle in response to customer demand. Chicago is a particularly strong market for business travel, he said, and the airline\u2019s frequent fliers in New York have long wanted the shuttle to fly there.\n\nDelta Air Lines is the only other airline that offers shuttle service. Like American, it operates out of La Guardia with flights to Boston, Washington and Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Delta shuttle caters to business travelers with similar in-flight amenities and check-in rules, and has dedicated security lanes at La Guardia. The schedule is aimed at accommodating travelers who want to fly round-trip in one day.\n\n\u201cThose shuttle markets are designed for a customer to leave in the morning and come back in the afternoon or evening,\u201d said Henry Kuykendall, Delta\u2019s senior vice president for Northeast airport operations. \u201cOther markets you have to overnight.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Trump in 1989, the real estate mogul doubled down on the idea of luxury service, installing faux marble counters in the lavatories and chrome-plated seatbelt buckles embossed with the airline\u2019s logo on the rebranded planes. Flight attendants wore faux pearls and served a cold meal and sometimes as many as two rounds of drinks on the 40-minute flights to Washington.\n\nThe company even had a concierge service during the week. Passengers could drop off their dry cleaning before departing in the morning and have it waiting for them when they returned in the evening. The concierge would even arrange a dinner reservation.\n\nThe Trump Shuttle was sold a few years later to USAir Group, which operated it as a separate entity for five years before folding it into US Airways. The shuttle moved to American Airlines when the two carriers merged in 2013. Delta acquired its early shuttle routes to Boston and Washington from Pan Am in 1991.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile flying is the fastest way to get to Chicago from the East Coast, shuttle flights face stiffer competition from Amtrak in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor. Frequent travelers tend to gravitate to one mode of transportation over another, and fans of the air shuttle are more than happy to make a case for their preferred way to travel.\n\n\u201cI definitely take the shuttle more than I take the train,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a co-founder and the president of the National L.G.B.T. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cI do both, but I definitely prefer the shuttle.\u201d He lives and works in Washington, but has to travel to New York about twice a month and, he said, most often takes the American shuttle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an American Airlines frequent flier, and part of that is just loyalty and doing good by companies that are doing good by you,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cI have found that the airlines fight hard for your business. They want to provide a service, and they\u2019re by no means perfect, but they\u2019re fighting for you as a customer.\u201d\n\nHe said he found the service on Amtrak to be more impersonal. He also likes that he can accrue frequent flier miles on the shuttle that apply to the airline\u2019s whole network. In addition, he said, American and Delta both support Mr. Nelson\u2019s organization.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEric Schwartz, the president and chief executive of Atavis Jet, a private plane charter company, also said he preferred to fly in the Northeast. \u201cThe shuttle is more efficient for my needs,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Schwartz lives in New York and frequently flies Delta to Washington for business or to visit family. \u201cI can get door to door from Manhattan to downtown D.C. in two hours,\u201d he said, adding that that\u2019s faster than the train.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Amtrak calls Acela a \u2018high-speed\u2019 train is silly to me,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cIt\u2019s slow, it\u2019s lumbering, you\u2019re stopping every 20 minutes or so in little towns that don\u2019t warrant high-speed service.\u201d\n\nAirlines and railroads have gone toe to toe to win over customers in the Northeast corridor for decades, boasting of their own unique efficiencies. Amtrak stresses how train stations are more centrally located than airports.\n\nBut many shuttle fans prefer the speed of flying over taking the train.\n\nMr. Schwartz said one ad he saw more than a decade ago really drove the point home.\n\n\u201cI remember maybe 10 to 15 years ago when Amtrak was really trying to push Acela,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthere was an advertising war on the tops of taxicabs, and Delta had one that said: \u2018Planes are faster than trains.

The thieves think you\u2019ll give it to them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe crooks, for example, will call victims and pretend they\u2019re a collection company for the I.R.S., which has deposited the funds in error. They then demand that victims transfer the money to a different account. \u201cThey say, \u2018We made a mistake; send it back to us,\u2019\u201d Mr. Lemons said.\n\nOr, they will leave voice messages threatening the taxpayer with criminal fraud charges or an arrest warrant if they don\u2019t call the number provided to return the \u201crefund.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt signifies the ingenuity of the fraudsters out there,\u201d said Russell Schrader, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, which promotes online safety and security.\n\nThe scam has the ring of truth for victims, as there is actually an erroneous deposit sitting in their bank account (or in some cases, a paper check in the mailbox). That can frighten victims into acting, especially if a caller is bullying them. But it\u2019s always best to hang up and independently check whether the information you were given is valid, said Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the nonprofit group Identity Theft Resource Center. \u201cAlways go to the source when you get these kind of contacts,\u201d she said. Look up a public number for the I.R.S. online, she advised, and contact the agency to ask if the call was legitimate. (The I.R.S. identity theft unit\u2019s number is 1-800-908-4490).\n\nHere are some questions and answers about tax refund fraud:\n\nWhat should I do if an erroneous tax refund is deposited in my account?\n\nIf it seems too good to be true, it probably is, Mr. Lemons said. Don\u2019t forward the money, he said, and don\u2019t spend it: \u201cDon\u2019t go out and make a down payment on a new car with the cash.\u201d\n\nIf the refund arrived as a direct deposit, the agency said that you should contact your bank\u2019s automated clearinghouse department and have the funds returned to the I.R.S. (Consumers may also need to close their account.) Call the I.R.S. to explain why the money is being returned, notify your tax preparer and file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nIn the case of paper checks, the next steps depend on whether you have cashed the check. The agency provides details on its website.\n\nWhat questions about security procedures should I have for my tax preparer?\n\nMr. Horn with the accountant association recommended that consumers ask whether their tax preparer uses encrypted email \u2014 standard email isn\u2019t secure and should never be used for sensitive financial information \u2014 and where the agency stores its paper files.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lemon offered his own suggestions: Do you update security protocols regularly? Do you train employees to recognize phishing attacks? How is information shared securely with clients?\n\nDavid Thomas, chief executive of Evident ID, an information security company based in Atlanta, suggested asking which employees have access to your files, and inquiring whether the firm offers extra login security. He particularly likes YubiKey, a token that authenticates a user\u2019s identity.\n\nThe tax preparation firm \u201cshould have confident answers\u201d to your questions, Mr. Thomas said.\n\nDoes a bogus refund in my account mean a fake tax return was filed in my name?\n\nMost likely yes, but you should contact the I.R.S. to verify if it has accepted a return using your Social Security number, Ms. Velasquez said. In some fraud cases overseas, she said, criminals have been known to mix and match stolen information. So it may be possible that criminals used one person\u2019s data to file a tax return, but someone else\u2019s bank account to deposit the refund. If a fraudulent return was filed in your name, she said, you\u2019ll probably have to file a special affidavit with the I.R.S. explaining that you are a victim of identity theft.

They enter the ballroom in neat, double-file lines, and when they are finished eating they line up again for the two-minute walk back to their rooms.\n\nSuch military precision has been one of the visual hallmarks of their visit this month. At the stadium on Monday, the North Koreans carried identical bags with cheering props, including the white-and-blue unification flag. They wore matching red snowsuits \u2014 which swished loudly as they walked in packs \u2014 and white sneakers that looked vaguely similar to Adidas. They yelled slogans about unity and sang old Korean folk tunes.\n\nThe North Koreans do not make a move without at least one other compatriot and a South Korean government monitor. Trips to the restroom before and after the hockey game, for instance, took place in groups.

The arena was never louder than it was after Sweden scored the first of eight goals and the North Korean cheer squad immediately sparked a rousing, flag-waving chant of \u201cCheer up!\u201d that was joined by nearly everyone in the stadium.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut at other times they seemed utterly oblivious, or indifferent, to their surroundings.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "A Diagnostic Consensus\n\nLike the patient herself, her doctors assumed all her symptoms were connected to the can she\u2019d dropped on her foot. Why hadn\u2019t that injury healed? And why was the entire right leg \u2014 and some of the left \u2014 so painful? None of the tests conducted in her nearly two weeks in the hospital explained it. Eventually her first Mass General doctors concluded that she had an unusual disorder called complex regional pain syndrome (C.R.P.S.). This disorder, which usually affects a limb after some trauma, is thought to be caused by injury to the nervous system. That damage in turn causes pain, swelling and changes in skin color and temperature. No one knows why the body has this extreme overreaction. Treatment has to focus on reducing pain rather than on treating the disorder. Recovery takes months, even years. Having made this diagnosis, the doctors sent the patient home to follow up with specialists to treat the pain.\n\nIn the days after this second hospitalization, the patient worsened. She felt exhausted and cold all the time. One morning upon waking, she felt so weak and tired that she couldn\u2019t stand. She scooched herself along the floor toward the bathroom. Halfway there, she was so incapacitated that she lay down and called her sister. I think I\u2019m dying, she told her. Her hand dropped weakly to the floor. Her sister asked for 911, and the E.M.T.s came and took her to the emergency room for the third time.\n\nLoss of Blood\n\nA blood test showed that she was bleeding internally again. She had less than half the blood she should have in her circulatory system. No wonder she was cold and tired and out of breath \u2014 these are classic signs of severe anemia. She was given more blood and then transported back again to Mass General.\n\nAs Naranbhai read through the records, he compiled a list of diseases that could bring this woman to the hospital three times over a month with severe pain and blood loss. It was a scary collection. At the top were cancers that could keep her from making blood. Next: diseases that interfered with her body\u2019s ability to form clots and stop bleeding. All were terrible possibilities.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Leigh Simmons, the internist supervising Naranbhai, usually waited to see patients until after the resident developed his own thoughts about the case. But it was late, and this patient sounded particularly sick, so Simmons and Naranbhai went to visit the patient together.\n\nSeeing the Patient Anew\n\nShe was a small woman, quite thin and pale beneath a dark Mediterranean complexion. Her 15-year-old daughter stood holding her hand. Simmons introduced herself and then stepped back to let Naranbhai lead the investigation. Rather than focus his questions on her foot and leg, he cast a much wider net. Tell me everything that\u2019s going on, he asked. She\u2019d had her period for nearly a month now, the woman said. That had never happened before. And, her daughter added, she had these weird dots on her legs. They just popped up a few weeks before. Naranbhai looked carefully at the mother\u2019s legs. They were covered with tiny freckle-size dots of blood trapped under the skin at the hair follicles.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Did her gums ever bleed when she brushed her teeth, he asked. All the time, she exclaimed.\n\nCan I see? the young doctor asked. Her gums were swollen and beefy red. He felt as if they might start bleeding just by looking at them. He looked up to Simmons, who smiled back encouragingly. He knew what she had. And so did Simmons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nClues in the Diet\n\nWhat kind of foods do you eat? he asked. Every morning she had two scrambled eggs. For lunch she had tuna on crackers. And for dinner she had more scrambled eggs and rice. Did she ever eat any fruits or vegetables \u2014 especially oranges or lemons? Never, she told him. They gave her wicked heartburn.\n\nShe had something known as gastroparesis, she explained. Her stomach and intestines didn\u2019t move food forward normally, and so food stayed in her stomach for hours. When food moves that slowly, you have to be careful that what you eat agrees with you.\n\nNo citrus for years. It was clear to Naranbhai that this modern woman had an ancient disease. She had scurvy \u2014 a disorder caused by a severe deficiency of vitamin C.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, a naval surgeon named James Lind proved that the juice of oranges and lemons would cure the bony aches, strange bleeding and sudden death of sailors afflicted with the illness, and the British Navy later mandated the use of lemon juice on all vessels. But it wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that researchers recognized that the cause of scurvy was the lack of a certain nutrient, which they named vitamin C. Without this organic chemical, new connective tissue, essential for the repair or replacement of damaged or dying cells, cannot be made, and that causes the bleeding, the bruising, the telltale little red dots and the terrible fatigue. Our bodies can\u2019t make vitamin C, and so we rely on the foods we eat to provide it. Avoiding these foods \u2014 as this woman did \u2014 can deplete the body\u2019s supply in just a few months.\n\nThe Miracle of Vitamin C\n\nThe doctors sent off a blood test to measure her vitamin C, and they started the woman on large doses of the required vitamin. The improvement was almost immediate: her gums stopped bleeding within days; her bruises started to turn yellow and fade. And she started to feel stronger and less fatigued.\n\nThat was two months ago. Now she feels great. She still can\u2019t eat oranges. But she takes her vitamin C tablets every single day.", "title": "A Painful Bruise Wouldn\u2019t Heal. It Took Several Hospital Visits to Discover Why.", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}

Michael Lewiecki, director of the New Mexico Clinical Research & Osteoporosis Center in Albuquerque and lead author of the study, said in an interview, \u201calthough almost all have osteoporosis and are at risk of another hip fracture.\u201d\n\nAlthough bone-sparing medication has been shown to reduce the risk of a second hip fracture, one study of 22,598 patients found that use of the drugs declined from \u201can already dismal 15 percent in 2004 to an abysmal 3 percent in the last quarter of 2013,\u201d Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a bone specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., wrote in an editorial in 2016 in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. He likened the situation to not treating patients for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol following a heart attack.\n\nCalling it \u201ca crisis in the treatment of osteoporosis,\u201d Dr. Khosla said, \u201cDespite the development of several effective drugs to prevent fractures, many patients, even those who unequivocally need treatment, are either not being prescribed osteoporosis medication at all, or when prescribed, refuse to take them.\u201d\n\nThe problem is hardly trivial, both for patients and society at large. Considering hip fractures alone, depending on how they are treated, average direct medical costs for the first six months range from $34,509 to $54,054, most of which is paid for by Medicare, the study authors wrote. Each year more than 300,000 people over 65, three-quarters of them women, are hospitalized with a fractured hip.\n\nThe personal costs are far greater. About 20 percent to 30 percent of patients die within a year following a hip fracture and, the researchers reported, \u201cOf those who survive, many do not regain their pre-fracture level of function. About 50 percent of patients with hip fractures will never be able to ambulate without assistance and 25 percent will require long-term care.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But most likely a leading factor, she and her co-authors believe, was the introduction in 1995 of the drug Fosamax, a bisphosphonate that slows or prevents the loss of bone density, resulting in stronger bones.\n\nFosamax is now available generically as alendronate, and has been joined by several other medications capable of promoting stronger bones. However, Dr. Siris said, \u201cThere is clearly a treatment gap. Prescriptions have fallen off, and even when people at risk are offered medication, they are refusing to take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMillions of prospective patients who could benefit from bone-preserving drugs are now afraid to take them. The fear probably has its roots in overly aggressive marketing and doctors who overprescribed bisphosphonates for every patient in the beginning stages of bone loss, a condition called osteopenia, with treatment often continued years longer than now considered appropriate.\n\nThen in the early 2000s, alarming news reports began to appear linking extended use of bisphosphonates to two uncommon bone problems: a very rare fracture of the femur and an even rarer condition called osteonecrosis of the jaw. A fear of these complications resulted in more than a 50 percent decline in bisphosphonate use from 2008 to 2012, Dr. Khosla said.\n\nAt the same time, Medicare reimbursements for bone density tests were sharply reduced, and doctors who did them in private offices could no longer afford to, which limited patient access and diagnosis and treatment of serious bone loss despite major improvements in treatment guidelines, Dr. Lewiecki said.\n\nIn the more than two decades since bisphosphonates were introduced, \u201cwe\u2019ve learned a lot about how to treat and whom to treat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re much wiser now about selecting patients for treatment.\u201d No longer is osteopenia a condition that by itself warrants medication unless other factors indicate the patient has a significantly increased risk of breaking a major bone.\n\nPatients should be treated if their bone density measurement indicates osteoporosis in the hip, spine or forearm, the experts said. But even if the test indicates only osteopenia, Dr. Siris said, \u201cpatients should be considered osteoporotic if they already sustained a nontraumatic fracture in the hip, spine, shoulder, pelvis and sometimes the wrist or if they score high enough on FRAX,\u201d an online fracture risk calculator to estimate one\u2019s risk of breaking a hip or other major bone in the next 10 years. Her advice is three-pronged: \u201cmedication when appropriate, an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, and don\u2019t fall.\u201d \u201cTreatment should be individualized,\u201d Dr. Khosla said. \u201cEach patient is different, with different family history, risk factors, how fast they\u2019re losing bone and their personal concerns. If the focus is on patients with a high risk of fracture, the evidence is clear that the benefits of drug treatment well outweigh the risks.\u201d", "title": "A Perfect Storm for Broken Bones", "authors": ["Jane E.

Mr. Acurio, Peru\u2019s most famous chef, with a global empire of 50 restaurants, kept the name and much of the design of the previous restaurant in order to evoke a classic Lime\u00f1a taberna. The walls are covered in old portraits of famous footballers and Peruvian celebrities. Classic rock \u2014 Sting, Clapton, the Beatles \u2014 plays in the background. Mostly local workers fill the intimate space, textured with dark wood, brick and marble tables, during a late lunch.\n\nWith nearly 50 dishes, the ever-evolving menu at Bodegon (which, in fact, opened in July) is a deep dive into casera home-cooking and Lima\u2019s multicultural cuisine. Over 20 years ago, Mr. Acurio lit the fuse for the boom in Peruvian cuisine, and here he is again, offering a new statement of possibilities. The chef said he is remembering and recovering the food from his childhood, \u201call the dishes that I lost in time because they were only made by my grandmother or my family or because they were just made in the \u201970s.\u201d While this effort could easily descend into an exercise in twee nostalgia, Mr. Acurio\u2019s playfulness and sincerity grounds things in the present: The menu follows seasonal, local ingredients and he solicits food memories from his customers and on social media.\n\nDuring a recent visit, baffled by options, we depended on the friendly and knowledgeable waiters to decipher the menu. We started with the salty and rich crab causa, poetically named \u201cmore crab than causa,\u201d which arrived as a Pop Art provocation of golden mashed potato layers overflowing with a crab and egg salad, drenched in a Pepto-Bismol-pink sauce.

Alastair Macaulay, the chief dance critic for The New York Times, wrote that the slap left a \u201cdisproportionately awkward aftertaste,\u201d and said that it raised troubling memories of a 1992 incident in which Mr. Martins was arrested and accused of assaulting his wife, the ballerina Darci Kistler \u2014 charges that were later dropped.\n\nCompany officials worried how the slap would be received this year, given the accusations of physical abuse that had been detailed against Mr. Martins in articles in both The New York Times and The Washington Post, not to mention the growing national conversation about the abuse of women. So Jonathan Stafford, a ballet master and former principal dancer with the company who is at the head of its interim leadership team, telephoned Mr. Martins. (The choreography for City Ballet productions is protected by contract, so changes must be authorized by the choreographer or the entity that holds the rights to the work.)\n\n\u201cIt seemed like he had definitely been thinking about it already, because he had a solution teed up and ready to go,\u201d Mr. Stafford said in an interview.\n\nThere will be no slap this year. When they came to the scene in the rehearsal last week, the dancer playing Juliet\u2019s father, Adrian Danchig-Waring, raised an arm as if thinking of slapping her \u2014 but did not strike. The Juliet, Lauren Lovette, touched her face and cowered.\n\nKathleen Tracey, the ballet master responsible for staging of \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d said that Mr. Martins\u2019s tweak echoes a piece of City Ballet history.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In that ballet, she added, Balanchine has an angry Demetrius prepare to kick Helena \u2014 but then restrain himself. \u201cThat\u2019s the same idea that Peter said we should do this season.\u201d\n\nCity Ballet is still associated above all with Balanchine, one of the all-time great choreographers, who co-founded the company in 1948 with Lincoln Kirstein. But it has now been a post-Balanchine company for as long as it was a Balanchine company \u2014 35 years. Now the company is once more at a turning point, just as it was when Balanchine died.\n\nBack then there were questions about whether the company would survive Balanchine. Mr. Martins, who had been a star dancer at the Royal Danish Ballet and then in New York under Balanchine, initially ran the company in tandem with the celebrated choreographer Jerome Robbins; Mr. Martins became its sole leader in 1990. He was widely credited with keeping its dancers strong in the core Balanchine repertoire; raising the quality of its dancing in recent years; and helping discover and establish some of today\u2019s most acclaimed choreographers, including Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon and Justin Peck. He also choreographed more than 80 ballets \u2014 though many failed to find favor with critics.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow the ballet world is pondering the fate of the Martins ballets in the post-Martins era. Mr. Stafford, who is leading the interim leadership team, said that more Martins works would be programmed in the 2018-19 season. Several of the company\u2019s biggest moneymaking story ballets were choreographed by Mr. Martins, including \u201cSwan Lake,\u201d and \u201cThe Sleeping Beauty\u201d \u2014 and Mr. Stafford said he could not imagine the Martins productions leaving the repertory. He also cited the power of other Martins works, including \u201cBarber Violin Concerto,\u201d \u201cHallelujah Junction,\u201d and \u201cFearful Symmetries,\u201d which is often used to test the mettle of young dancers to see of they can handle it.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs the company considers its future \u2014 and who the permanent successor to Mr. Martins should be \u2014 it is weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the company he is leaving behind. One area where City Ballet has not kept pace in recent decades is the diversity of its casts. More than 60 years after Arthur Mitchell became the company\u2019s first African-American dancer, there are few dancers of color in the company, and very few seen in certain kinds of roles. There have been signs of change in recent seasons under Mr. Martins, and Mr. Stafford said that a diversity effort begun several years ago by the School of American Ballet, a feeder school that trains nearly all the company\u2019s dancers, had helped put more young dancers of color into the pipeline. But he said that it was an issue that the interim leadership team had been discussing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to just make sure that the organization is really a place that anyone can feel safe working, and comfortable and confident that they\u2019ll be allowed to flourish,\u201d he said.\n\nThese days the dancers are keeping their noses to grindstone, and just trying to get on with the physically taxing work of rehearsing by day and performing by night in the spring season \u2014 without the only boss any of them have ever known. If some former dancers have cheered his departure, and said that the episode had begun a long-overdue discussion about power dynamics and abuse in the insular ballet world, some current dancers felt bereft when he left.\n\nSterling Hyltin, who premiered the role of Juliet in 2007 and will be in the opening night cast this week, said that it had been tough at her dress rehearsal last week not to be able to confer with Mr. Martins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tweaked acting things, I\u2019ve come up with new moments,\u201d she said. \u201cMy Juliet has changed as I\u2019ve matured, I would hope.

Suddenly, insurgents were in dozens of cities, in almost every province of South Vietnam. They were in the streets of Saigon, the capital. They were even inside the heavily guarded compound of the United States Embassy.\n\nIt was a shocking sight for Americans, who had been assured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and his top general in Vietnam, William C. Westmoreland, that the enemy was on its last legs.\n\nMeredith H. Lair, a Vietnam War expert at George Mason University, said the offensive \u201ccaused people to question whether they\u2019d been fed lies by the administration, and to question whether the war was going as well as they\u2019d been led to believe, and to question whether the war could be won if the enemy was supposed to be cowed and appeared so strong and invigorated.\u201d\n\nIf the broader Tet offensive revealed chaos where the government was trying to project control, Adams\u2019s photo made people question whether the United States was fighting for a just cause. Together, they undermined the argument for the war on two fronts, leading many Americans to conclude not only that it could not be won, but also that, perhaps, it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

McMahon, a historian at the Ohio State University. \u201cAnd I think more people began to question whether we were, in fact, the good guys in the war or not.\u201d\n\nA police chief had fired a bullet, point-blank, into the head of a handcuffed man, in likely violation of the Geneva Conventions. And the official was not a Communist, but a member of South Vietnam\u2019s government, the ally of the United States.\n\n\u201cIt raised a different kind of question to Americans than whether or not the war was winnable,\u201d said Christian G. Appy, a professor of history at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \u201cIt really introduced a set of moral questions that would increasingly shape debate about the Vietnam War: Is our presence in Vietnam legitimate or just, and are we conducting the war in a way that is moral?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the months after the Tet offensive, public opinion shifted more rapidly than at any other point in the war, Dr. McMahon said. Adams\u2019s photo won a Pulitzer Prize, and Time magazine called it one of the 100 most influential ever taken.\n\n\u201cYou can talk about \u2018the execution photograph from the Vietnam War,\u2019 and not just the generation who lived through it but multiple generations can call that image to mind,\u201d said Susan D. Moeller, the author of \u201cShooting War: Photography and the American Experience of Combat,\u201d and a professor of media and international affairs at the University of Maryland. \u201cIt was immediately understood to be an icon.\u201d\n\nYet the decisions on how to display this photo and other graphic Vietnam war imagery were matters of debate in the newsroom of The Times. \u201cI remember certain pictures,\u201d the influential photo editor John G. Morris, who died at 100 last year, said, \u201cwhich I was just determined to get on page one.\u201d This was one, as was the 1972 picture of a naked 9-year-old, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, fleeing a napalm attack. That ran at the bottom of the page.\n\nIn South Vietnam, the execution image resonated in a different way. To Americans in 1968, it conveyed that North Vietnam and the Vietcong were far stronger than they had been led to believe. To South Vietnamese, it conveyed the opposite: Those forces \u201cno longer had the kind of aura of omnipotence that they had had before,\u201d said Mark Philip Bradley, a historian at the University of Chicago.\n\nThen there was the fallout for the person for whom viewers had the least sympathy: General Loan, the executioner, who would eventually move to the United States. In 1978, the government tried unsuccessfully to rescind his green card. He died 20 years later in Virginia, where he had run a restaurant.\n\nAdams himself, before his death in 2004, expressed discomfort with the consequences of his photo. He noted that photographs, by nature, exclude context: in this case, that the prisoner had killed the family of one of General Loan\u2019s deputies.\n\n\u201cTwo people died in that photograph: the recipient of the bullet and Gen. Nguyen Ngoc Loan,\u201d he wrote in Time magazine. \u201cThe general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill photographs,\u201d Adams wrote, \u201care the most powerful weapon in the world.\u201d", "title": "A Photo That Changed the Course of the Vietnam War", "authors": ["Maggie Astor"]}

{"date": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "At least one million people in Ethiopia were internally displaced in 2017, according to the United Nations, amid widespread unrest and an economy in free-fall. In a December meeting, the party\u2019s executive committee blamed Mr. Hailemariam\u2019s poor leadership for the country\u2019s and the party\u2019s woes \u2014 thereby sealing his fate. As the humanitarian, political and security crisis turned into calamity, he took personal responsibility for failing to stabilize the country rocked by stubborn protests from Oromo and Amhara ethnic groups, who together make up two-thirds of the population.\n\nThese protests, initially started by the Oromo, Ethiopia\u2019s largest ethnic group, began in 2014 over opposition to a controversial plan to expand the jurisdiction of the capital, Addis Ababa. Security forces responded to peaceful protests with excessive force, provoking outrage and further protests, which eventually spread to the Amhara region. This culminated in the declaration in October 2016 of a state of emergency lasting 10 months. Tens of thousands were arrested in the ensuing crackdown. However, as soon as martial law was lifted in August 2017, the protesters, mostly young, returned to the streets, demanding regime change and the release of political prisoners, estimated to number in the tens of thousands.\n\nMr. Hailemariam resigned a day after some of these prisoners were released, including prominent opposition leaders and journalists. (More than 6,000 detainees have been freed in the past month in a government amnesty that Mr. Hailemariam and his party promised in January.) The pardoned leaders were met with euphoric freedom rallies and homecoming celebrations across the Oromia region and in the capital, Addis Ababa. The outpouring of support for the freed leaders showed that the country can no longer be governed as it has been for the past 27 years \u2014 in the palm of one party.\n\nMore than Mr. Hailemariam\u2019s departure, what is important is how the transition will shake out. The E.P.R.D.F. needs a leader who can unify the party, gain popular legitimacy and calm widening political and ethnic tensions. Moreover, beyond the change of guard at the top, a major policy shift is needed. Repression has outlived its usefulness. Unfortunately, the restoration of martial law suggests that the E.P.R.D.F. is still not prepared to learn its lesson. But continued authoritarianism in the face of fierce and determined protests will be futile.\n\nTo end the succession battle, the choice is clear: The new reformist leaders of the Oromo People\u2019s Democratic Organization, led by Lemma Megersa, enjoy substantial public support. Everywhere they go, Mr. Lemma and his entourage receive a hero\u2019s welcome, on a par with that received by the just-released opposition leaders \u2014 itself a significant change for a party whose support is often either bought or coerced. The O.P.D.O.\u2019s youthful leaders relate easily to a generation now in revolt. Their support base cuts across political, ethnic and religious fault lines partly because they adopted the demands of the protesters and made bold commitments to democratization and unity.", "title": "Opinion | A Placeholder Prime Minister Departs.

Not long after that story appeared, Mr. Dawkins received the court summons, demanding partial \u201creimbursement to the state for Defendant\u2019s cost of care while incarcerated.\u201d\n\nImage Kimberly Knutsen says the deal her partner, Mr. Dawkins, landed for \u201cThe Graybar Hotel\u201d has helped support their family. Credit Leah Nash for The New York Times\n\nMichigan is one of more than 40 states where prisoners can be forced to pay for the cost of their incarceration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Laws that allow the government to charge prisoners \u201croom and board\u201d or \u201ccost of care\u201d fees have proliferated in recent decades, as states charge inmates and parolees for everything from medical care, clothing and meals to police transport, public defense fees, drug testing and electronic monitoring.\n\nSince so many prisoners are impoverished to begin with, states typically don\u2019t raise much money by charging inmates room and board fees, and in some states, the enforcement of these laws is conditional on the prisoner\u2019s ability to pay. But as the cost of mass incarceration has soared, with more than 2.2 million adults in prisons and jails across the United States, some states have grown more aggressive in seeking money from prisoners and formerly incarcerated people.\n\nDuring the last fiscal year, Michigan collected some $3.7 million from 294 prisoners, who account for just a fraction of the state\u2019s nearly 40,000 inmates. Around the country, some 10 million people owe $50 billion in fees stemming from their arrest or imprisonment, according to a 2015 Brennan Center report.\n\nStates often take a percentage of the earnings inmates receive through prison work programs. But some states have also sought money from prisoners who have received larger sums, through an inheritance or legal settlements or, as in Mr. Dawkins\u2019s case, money they acquire through their own initiative. After an Illinois inmate who was serving a 15-month sentence for a drug conviction received a $31,690 settlement for his mother\u2019s death, he was forced to pay the state nearly $20,000 for the cost of his imprisonment, leaving him nearly destitute when he was paroled in 2015.\n\nIn Florida, a convict named Jeremy Barrett who received a $150,000 settlement from the Department of Corrections for negligence, after he was attacked in 2011 by another inmate who gouged out his eye, was forced to pay the state nearly $55,000 from the settlement as reimbursement for his three years in prison.\n\nWhen prisoners and former inmates fight such charges, courts often rule in the state\u2019s favor. In 2000, Connecticut\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Eric Ham, who was serving a 50-year sentence for murder, had to pay nearly $900,000 toward the cost of his incarceration, after he won a settlement of around $1 million from the city of New Haven for falsely arresting him for another crime that he didn\u2019t commit.\n\nProponents of such laws argue that convicted criminals should pay for their own imprisonment when they have the financial means to do so. But some prisoners\u2019s rights advocates say saddling inmates and parolees with fees can hinder their rehabilitation by making it harder for them to support themselves and their families, and could violate the Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.", "title": "A Prisoner Got a Book Deal.

Or pee in their pants. This novel is no austere orgy of minor-chord emotion. Vargas Llosa, now 81, is playing to the balconies.\n\nBelow and beyond the tragicomedy, in this translation from the Spanish by Edith Grossman, Vargas Llosa is pressing a familiar point. He has long been a critic of tabloid excesses in Latin America, particularly so when the tabloids are manipulated by authoritarian political leaders in order to silence their critics.\n\nVargas Llosa has himself felt the sting of tabloid headlines in recent years, after he left his wife of 50 years and picked up with Isabel Preysler, the pop singer Enrique Iglesias\u2019s mother, and when his name appeared (erroneously, he has argued) in the Panama Papers, which exposed international tax havens.\n\nNo deep soil is overturned in \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d but two things keep one turning the pages. For one, it\u2019s a confident book and confidence is contagious. It\u2019s filled with cliffhangers \u2014 when the journalist is murdered, Enrique is the prime suspect \u2014 and over-the-top incident. For another, it is warm to the touch, particularly as regards sex.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis novel chronicles, in detail as damp as the bad guy\u2019s handshake, an unexpected lesbian affair that develops between Enrique\u2019s wife and the wife of his best friend and lawyer. The author seems to agree with Eve Babitz, who wrote that having affairs is the only creative thing most people will ever do.\n\nVargas Llosa\u2019s novels have always been enlivened by earthy detail. I tend to think of him during flu season, recalling that John Updike praised one of his early novels for the way his characters caught colds realistically.\n\nIn \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d the sex is hot and the beer is cold. His characters happily consume ceviche and tripe and pork rind sandwiches with onions and chili peppers. They drink Campari and pisco sours. They eat at a seafood place called Seven Deadly Fins. In a novel as contrived and uneven as this one, the human touches go a long way.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He champions free speech and liberal democracies. He deplores homophobia and applauds laws to legalize marijuana.\n\nThis book is, sad to say, all but unreadable. Vargas Llosa\u2019s op-ed voice is not his best voice (it is few people\u2019s best voice) and these pieces, read years after they were composed, are essentially dead on the page.\n\nThere are a handful of alert moments in these essays, which have been translated by Anna Kushner. In a 2012 essay, he deftly sticks a hatpin into Julian Assange. In another essay he considers the effects his generation \u2014 the so-called Latin American Boom writers \u2014 had on the literary world. He notes, in a moving aside, that he\u2019s among the few members of that group still standing.\n\nVargas Llosa has been a frequent critic of Latin America, but he sorely misses it when he is away. In one essay, composed in Switzerland, he asks what that country has given us except cuckoo clocks and fondue.\n\nLatin America, on the other hand, has given the world \u201ca Borges, a Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, a Neruda, a Vallejo, an Octavio Paz, a Lezama Lima, a Lam, a Matta, a Tamayo, and we\u2019ve invented tango, mambo, boleros, salsa, and so many rhythms and songs that the whole world sings and dances.\u201d\n\nVargas Llosa is too humble, a rarity for him, to add his own name to this list of cultural treasures.

They attend 12-step groups; they have televisions removed from business trip hotel rooms so pay-per-view won\u2019t tempt them; they struggle for intimacy.

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "There was also some long-awaited pushback, as the players\u2019 union filed a grievance with Major League Baseball against four teams \u2014 the Miami Marlins, the Tampa Bay Rays, the Oakland Athletics and the Pittsburgh Pirates \u2014 charging that the clubs are not spending their revenue-sharing money on improving the on-field product, as they are required to do.\n\nThe Marlins, Rays and Pirates traded away their franchise players this winter \u2014 Giancarlo Stanton, Evan Longoria and Andrew McCutchen, respectively. Those three teams issued statements disputing the charges, which were first reported by the Tampa Bay Times. Pirates President Frank Coonelly dismissed the grievance as \u201cfrivolous.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe union\u2019s executive director, Tony Clark, who watched Tuesday\u2019s five-inning scrimmage, confirmed that the union had filed the grievance but declined to comment on it.\n\nBut earlier, while speaking to a handful of reporters, Clark said this was not a case of a select few teams doing a tear-down \u2014 a strategy the Astros and Chicago Cubs employed on their way to winning the last two World Series.\n\nClark said at least 10 of baseball\u2019s 30 teams were not trying to win in the coming season, suppressing the free-agent market. If the Marlins, for example, had not put Stanton on the trading block, the Yankees most likely would have dipped into the free-agent market for more offense, even though they have a mandate from the owner Hal Steinbrenner to stay below the $197 million luxury tax threshold.\n\nNearly one-third of the 166 players who became free agents after last season remain unsigned, and Clark said that 17 teams were at least $50 million below the luxury tax threshold.\n\nClark was asked if, given hindsight, he had seen any of this coming while negotiating the collective bargaining agreement, which was ratified in December 2016 and runs through the 2021 season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Clark said, \u201cif we had known that there was going to be upwards of a third of the league that may not be as interested in being the last team standing and therefore wouldn\u2019t value experience on some level, then I would say yes.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut that was never the assumption. The entire C.B.A. is grounded and fundamentally focused in on creating as many opportunities for all 30 teams as possible. I don\u2019t know how many years you heard competitive balance, competitive balance, competitive balance.\u201d\n\nIn the last two labor agreements, teams have won the right to cap how much they spend on the draft and on most international signings, essentially allowing them to peg the cost of a rebuild.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of not competing, yeah, that can be a huge issue,\u201d Clark said.\n\nAn increasing reliance on analytics has also reshaped how teams value players and construct their rosters, placing a premium on younger and cheaper players. But Clark and others at Camp Jobless, including catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Tom Gordon, the former pitcher who is coaching here, said that the qualities a veteran could provide \u2014 leadership and grooming \u2014 were not being accurately accounted for. That has led to a great deal of frustration among free agents still looking for work.\n\n\u201cThey start to lose hope, and it\u2019s humiliating,\u201d said Dave Gallagher, a former outfielder who is serving as a coach at the camp.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They played catch to warm up, took batting practice and prepared for a game \u2014 much the same way teams have at 30 sites around Florida and Arizona during spring training.\n\nAbout six scouts showed up to watch, their iPads and radar guns at the ready behind home plate. Familiar names like Luke Scott, Omar Infante, Chris Johnson and Nolan Reimold took their swings, and Clippard, Tom Gorzelanny and Jim Henderson pitched against Japan Railway East, whose coach, Horii Tetsuya, said his players were below Class AAA level.\n\nWhen the teams scrimmage again, on Thursday, Walker could be playing with them. A week ago, Walker \u2014 who last season played for the Mets and then the Milwaukee Brewers on a one-year, $17.2 million deal \u2014 thought he would end up with the Yankees as their second or third baseman. Then the Yankees acquired Drury, who will make the major league minimum this season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s something that\u2019s being lost in translation with teams \u2014 how are we valuing guys?\u201d Walker said. \u201cAre we strictly valuing them on numbers, or are we not able to quantify how they\u2019re making an impact, not only on the field but in the clubhouse? I\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve been somebody that\u2019s been a leader. I guess in terms of dollars and cents, teams are not seeing that as a value at this point.\u201d\n\nClippard, who made $6.15 million last season, said he had only received offers for a minor league contract so far, which he has rebuffed. He chafed at what he sees as a double standard.\n\n\u201cAs players, if we took a year off, we\u2019d be out of the game,\u201d Clippard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s O.K. for owners and organizations to take years off, and it\u2019s actually accepted.\u201d", "title": "A Reluctant Team of Free Agents Scrimmages at \u2018Camp Jobless\u2019", "authors": ["Billy Witz"]}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Instrument makers responded by building beautifully ornamented hurdy-gurdys that were often coveted by women; Marie Antoinette is known to have played one. (The French term is \u201cvielle \u00e0 roue\u201d; the English name imitates the instrument\u2019s sound.) There were virtuosos on the instrument who also wrote sophisticated dance arrangements and concertos for it.\n\nBut by the 19th century, hurdy-gurdys were predominantly seen in the hands of beggars. Certain regions, like Savoie in France and the area today belonging to Poland and Ukraine, produced large numbers of itinerant musicians \u2014 often blind \u2014 who played for a few coins.\n\nMr. Loibner said that many of the Eastern European hurdy-gurdy players spent the warm months playing on the streets of Austria and Germany and returned home for the winter with what little they had earned. For Schubert\u2019s audiences, then, the pathos of the Leiermann would not have been lost.\n\nA Master Reinvents the Hurdy-Gurdy\n\n\u201cIf you saw a hurdy-gurdy player on the ice in winter,\u201d Mr. Loibner said, \u201cyou knew he had no reason to go home anymore.\u201d\n\nBlind hurdy-gurdy players producing a ceaseless, penetrating sound also came to be endowed with clairvoyant powers in the popular imagination. Mr. Loibner recalled perhaps the darkest hurdy-gurdy story: Stalin, said to have been fearful of the subversive power of these itinerant musicians, invited hundreds of them to a festival, where he had them rounded up and sent to their deaths.\n\nElisabeth Harnik is working to overcome these tragic associations. She is one of the composers commissioned to write songs for Mr. Loibner and Ms. Mirkovic\u2019s song cycle. It was a challenge to create \u201ca light mood,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the instrument has an inherent melancholy.\u201d But through experimentation, she had hit upon a technique for producing seagull-like whoops in the instrument\u2019s high register that evoked a summer sky.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvances in instrument-making have helped expand the range of what\u2019s possible on a hurdy-gurdy. Robert Green, an American player and Baroque specialist, said in an interview that \u201cthe reason it survived so well is that it managed to reinvent itself.\u201d Part of its latest reinvention is an electronically enhanced version, which can function like a one-man band or sound like a whole posse of electric guitars. Mr. Loibner often partners with D.J.s and folk ensembles from different traditions, and with a trumpeter and percussionist in Brot und Sterne, a trio known for trancelike jazz improvisations.\n\nBut despite his crossover experiments, the iconic figure of Schubert\u2019s Leiermann remains at the core of his conception of the instrument. When he was 17, Mr. Loibner and a friend ran away from home, planning to busk their way to India. They only made it as far as Greece, but the experience of being a street musician living hand to mouth stayed with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor me, the closest thing to Schubert\u2019s Leiermann are the groups of punks you sometimes pass on the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may have a dog, and there\u2019s always one who plays the guitar. And he\u2019s so drunk he plays only one chord over and over \u2014 and the instrument is out of tune.

The review of the employee\u2019s allegations and the confidential agreement made with her were handled by Arabella Advisors, a philanthropy services firm that manages the New Venture Fund, one of the early nonprofit supporters of JustLeadershipUSA.\n\nAs part of the agreement, which The Times has reviewed, the woman had promised not to discuss the allegations or money she received. She said she agreed to termination and $25,000 in compensation after declining an offer to remain with the nonprofit but to work from home.\n\nWhen she learned of Mr. Martin\u2019s resignation, she suspected that there were other instances of misconduct. After she was contacted by The Times, she said she had decided to breach the nondisclosure pact because she wanted to support other women who had talked to The Times about their experiences with Mr. Martin.\n\nTwo of those women, both of whom work for criminal justice nonprofits, said in interviews that they were subjected to lewd acts by Mr. Martin \u2014 incidents that occurred after the confidential agreement with the former employee. In separate incidents, in 2016 and 2017, the women said, Mr. Martin masturbated in front of each of them.\n\nLike the former employee, the two other women said they wanted to preserve their privacy, and they agreed to be interviewed on the condition that their names not be published.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Martin, 47, through an attorney, denied any inappropriate conduct with the former employee or with the other two women.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cGlenn vehemently denies any of the allegations that are the subject of this article.

For about two hours, they talked about work over a bottle of wine.

Arabella referred questions to the New Venture Fund.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, a few days after the incident, Arabella\u2019s senior director of human resources responded, \u201cJust wanted to quickly let you know that I have received this email and will be circling back with you very soon. I also wanted to say that I\u2019m very sorry to hear this happened to you.\u201d\n\nThe next month, the woman officially left and agreed to accept the payment. In an email on Sept. 10, 2015, the senior human resources director said Mr. Martin would be informed that she was leaving and would inform other staff. \u201cAs discussed previously the communication will be neutral and absent any of the details about what happened or the terms of this agreement,\u201d the director wrote.\n\nAbout four months later in January or February of 2016, another woman, 35, said she met Mr. Martin at a panel discussion, and then he pursued her through direct messages on Facebook. Interested in talking to him about justice reform, she said she accompanied Mr. Martin to his apartment one evening.\n\nShe said she found him attractive, but a chat over wine took a lewd and unexpected turn after Mr. Martin went to his bedroom. She said he was lying on the bed and asked her to join him, which she said she declined to do. \u201cThe best way to describe it was a whining \u2018Why don\u2019t you want me?\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nHe then pulled out his penis and masturbated, she said. \u201cI felt paralyzed. I couldn\u2019t move or walk away. I couldn\u2019t.

She also tearfully told her new boss what had happened, because she feared Mr. Martin had spread a different story within the justice reform community.\n\n\u201cPeople would be drooling to hear him talk,\u201d the woman said. \u201cYou look at this man and there\u2019s a trail of women who have been harmed. You\u2019re hurting the women that are doing the work.\u201d\n\nIn February 2017, another woman, a 29-year-old social worker, met Mr. Martin when he visited her organization to talk about justice reform. He later encouraged her to apply for a job at JLUSA but almost immediately began to make unwanted advances, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe advances, which the woman said she now views as harassment, contributed to her decision to withdraw her application, she said. Mr. Martin continued to contact her, and in March, she went to confront him at the office in Harlem, she said. \u201cHe tried to kiss me. He grabbed my neck. He tried to pull my pants down,\u201d she said, noting that they were alone in the office.\n\nShe said she fended him off, but then he masturbated in front of her.

However, if you\u2019d rather make this with chicken breasts, choose the bone-in, skin-on kind if possible, and watch them carefully.

New year, new problem: A federal tax cut took effect in January, the unemployment rate is just 4.1 percent and investors are now worried that inflation might start rising too quickly. That, in turn, could prompt the Fed to accelerate the upward drift of its benchmark interest rate. So far, there\u2019s no sign that the Fed has adjusted its plans. The central bank, as expected, left the benchmark rate unchanged at its first meeting of the year, in late January. It will publish an account of that meeting on Wednesday, providing at least a little more information about its outlook and its plans for the coming year.

The building is poorly insulated, so I often hear neighbors moving around or playing music, which is tolerable. However, about a year ago, I began hearing the extremely loud and erratic snores of a neighbor in a bedroom directly above mine. This sound wakes me up \u2014 and keeps me up. Is there anything I can do? I\u2019m reluctant to approach a neighbor about what might be a medical condition. But I get headaches from wearing earplugs and want to sleep through the night without noise machines or sound suppressors.\n\nA. Why are you able to hear someone in another apartment snore? Snoring is a low-frequency noise. Even the loudest snore is not usually loud enough to reach another apartment unless the soundproofing is so poor that it raises questions about the habitability of the apartment, according to Alan Fierstein, the owner of Acoustilog, a Manhattan noise consultancy.\n\n\u201cThis might be considered a breach of the warranty of habitability,\u201d a state statute, said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants.\n\nWrite a letter to the landlord and ask that he or she install soundproofing materials in your apartment. If your landlord does not respond, you could start what is known as an HP proceeding in housing court, and a judge could order the landlord to fix the problem. Or, you could withhold rent as a way to demand a rent abatement. You would need to provide evidence, like a report from a noise consultant. (Such reports can cost thousands of dollars.)\n\nKeep your attention focused on the habitability of the apartment, not the noise. The courts are not generally sympathetic to residential noise complaints because the city is a loud place, and dealing with noisy neighbors comes with the package. \u201cThere is a long line of cases in New York, going back to the 1940s, which holds that tenants in an urban environment have to put up with the noises of ordinary living,\u201d Mr. Himmelstein said. Additionally, the snoring could be a medical condition, so any actions the landlord takes against your neighbor could violate the state Human Rights Law.\n\nIn the meantime, try out a few noise machines to see if they dampen the sound.", "title": "A Snoring Neighbor Causes Sleepless Nights", "authors": ["Ronda Kaysen", "Ask Real Estate"]}

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe Trump administration is seeking to withdraw the United States from the international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. It is trying to rescind regulations on the issue. It has even scrubbed mentions of global warming from government websites. Yet its attempt to suppress the facts has not entirely succeeded, with federal agencies continuing to issue warnings, including in a major climate report published last year.\n\nThe latest climate alarm came this week in a Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Here is what the document, issued by Daniel R. Coats, the director of national intelligence, said about climate change and other environmental problems, with my annotations:\n\nA real problem\n\nThe impacts of the long-term trends toward a warming climate, more air pollution, biodiversity loss, and water scarcity are likely to fuel economic and social discontent \u2014 and possibly upheaval \u2014 through 2018.\n\nOnly six weeks into the year, this is already coming true. Cape Town, the second-largest city in South Africa, is so low on water after an extended drought that it may be forced to shut off the taps in early April. Water scarcity is a factor in the violent conflicts in Syria and Yemen, and in both countries, control of water supplies is being used as a weapon of war.\n\nSocial disruptions\n\nThe past 115 years have been the warmest period in the history of modern civilization, and the past few years have been the warmest years on record. Extreme weather events in a warmer world have the potential for greater impacts and can compound with other drivers to raise the risk of humanitarian disasters, conflict, water and food shortages, population migration, labor shortfalls, price shocks, and power outages. Research has not identified indicators of tipping points in climate-linked Earth systems, suggesting a possibility of abrupt climate change.\n\nAfter running through an accurate summary of the warming trend and the risk it poses, the document appears \u2014 though the language is ambiguous \u2014 to suggest the possibility of sudden climate change of the sort that might cause global upheaval. Most scientists say that over the next few decades, at least, the likely prospect is a gradual worsening of climate-related problems. But beyond a few decades, they are less willing to rule out catastrophes like the disappearance of polar sea ice, which could potentially cause profound climatic disruption.\n\nThreats to political stability\n\nWorsening air pollution from forest burning, agricultural waste incineration, urbanization, and rapid industrialization \u2014 with increasing public awareness \u2014 might drive protests against authorities, such as those recently in China, India, and Iran.\n\nThe document does not explicitly mention the burning of fossil fuels, but that is a main cause of the poor air quality the plagues many cities in the developing world, and has even caused deteriorating air quality in places like London. Burning coal and oil not only causes climate change, it throws particles into the air that can cause asthma, heart attacks and other health problems. The World Health Organization estimates that three million people die prematurely every year because of outdoor air pollution, and over four million more because of indoor exposure to dirty fuels used for heating and cooking.\n\nCritical systems at risk\n\nAccelerating biodiversity and species loss \u2014 driven by pollution, warming, unsustainable fishing, and acidifying oceans \u2014 will jeopardize vital ecosystems that support critical human systems. Recent estimates suggest that the current extinction rate is 100 to 1,000 times the natural extinction rate.\n\nAs the document implies, scientists are not entirely sure how much the rate of extinction has sped up because of human activities, but they do think it has accelerated. Some of them fear that we have entered the early stages of what will become the sixth mass extinction of organisms in Earth\u2019s history.\n\nConflicts between nations\n\nWater scarcity, compounded by gaps in cooperative management agreements for nearly half of the world\u2019s international river basins, and new unilateral dam development are likely to heighten tension between countries.\n\nThe biggest thing missing from this document is any explicit attribution of the cause of global climate disruption. Scientists have largely ruled out any natural explanation, concluding that the human release of greenhouse gases explains basically all the warming that has occurred since the 19th century. The two great culprits are the burning of fossil fuels and the chopping down of forests.", "title": "A Spy\u2019s Guide to Climate Change", "authors": ["Justin Gillis"]}

But military life provides many obstacles to their budding relationship.\n\nNearly 40 percent of all Korean viewers tuned in to watch the finale of this intimate tale of love on the battlefield, and the show exposes a much deeper fault line in contemporary South Korean culture: the fierce militarism of the post-Korean War generation butting up against the waning nationalism of Korean millennials, whose ideals can tend toward mutual understanding and healing.

Unfortunately, Seung-jo gets full marks in standardized tests and is looking for a girl who can match him. Soon, Seung-jo is helping her study, and their growing closeness piques the jealousy of Jungu, a rockabilly kid with an earnest crush on Hani. Like quite a few K-dramas, the show is based on a Japanese manga. It also has a comparatively straightforward plot, which may explain its only moderate success in South Korea. If you\u2019re looking for a light and warm teen show, though, \u201cPlayful Kiss\u201d is a charming watch.\n\nIf You Like Superhero Tales With a Twist\n\nPark Bo-young in \u201cStrong Girl Bong-Soon.\u201d Drama House\n\n\u2018Strong Girl Bong-Soon\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix, Hulu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIf you\u2019ve binged your way through all of the superhero series Marvel has to offer, behold \u201cStrong Girl Bong-Soon.\u201d Petite, unassuming Do Bong-soon has a Hulk-like strength passed down through the XX chromosomes of her family line. This superpower can only be used for good, so Bong-soon lives a carefully mortal, caustically boring life.\n\nOf course, this can\u2019t last for long. Once others learn of her gifts, she helps form a crime-fighting team to counter a wave of neighborhood kidnappings, helping Bong-soon find meaning in her formerly purposeless life. This delightfully nerdy tale with comic book influences combines the moral core of Batman with the humor of \u201cIron Man\u201d and the love triangle of \u201cX-Men.\u201d\n\nIf You Like Your Ghost Stories Sexy\n\nJo Jung-suk, left, and Park Bo-young in \u201cOh My Ghost.\u201d Chorokbaem Media\n\n\u2018Oh My Ghost\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix, DramaFever, Viki\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nKorean TV\u2019s orientation toward family values has garnered it popularity with broadcast channels in predominantly Muslim countries like Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In K-drama, sexual desire is depicted mostly indirectly, with characters awakening from delicious dreams and with almost-kisses interrupted by buzzing cellphones. In \u201cOh My Ghost,\u201d the slant is slightly more supernatural.\n\nSoon-ae haunts the earth as a lascivious ghost until she has sex for the first time. In desperation, she seizes the body of a meek assistant cook named Bong-sun. This plot device performs the function alcohol usually does in K-drama, allowing the shy Bong-sun to talk back to her handsome boss. The series morphs from a supernatural romance to a spooky thriller, a perfect distraction from your earthly troubles.\n\nIf You\u2019re a Foodie\n\nA scene from \u201cLet\u2019s Eat 1.\u201d CJ E&M\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s Eat 1\u2019\n\nWhere to stream: Netflix, DramaFever\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSoo-kyung is a divorced woman who wants nothing more than to slurp noodles all day in peace.

She may have found it in a verbose neighbor, Dae-young, whose poetic soliloquies venture into mansplaining. She\u2019s starting to warm to his questionable charms when another neighbor, the winsome Jin-yi, comes on the scene. The three neighbors form an unlikely supper club.\n\nAs usual in K-drama, side plots abound, from a neighborhood crime story to unrequited workplace crushes. But it\u2019s the food that keeps you bingeing.

The robot malfunctions, and so the real woman it was modeled after ends up pretending to be the robot, and sparks fly (pun intended.)\n\nThe series can be read as commentary on the trend in which many young Koreans are waiting much later than their parents did to get married, if they get married at all. Included is a not-so-subtle message to millennials that it\u2019s better to settle for a mate with a warm body than to search for cold perfection.\n\n\u2014\n\nAnd for a deeper dive into K-drama, check out:\n\n\u201cWeightlifting Fairy,\u201d available on DramaFever and Viki.\n\n\u201cMy Love From Another Star,\u201d available on DramaFever and Viki.\n\n\u201cWinter Sonata,\u201d available on Netflix and DramaFever.\n\n\u201cGu Family Book,\u201d available on DramaFever and Viki.\n\n\u201cAll in,\u201d available on DramaFever.\n\n\u201cBoys Over Flowers,\u201d available on Netflix and Hulu.\n\n\u201cAutumn in My Heart,\u201d available on DramaFever and Viki.", "title": "A Starter Guide to Streaming Great South Korean TV Drama", "authors": ["Dakota Kim"]}

Someone died, and Emma still feels considerable guilt over what happened. (The novel relies on the kind of heavy foreshadowing that a writer like Liane Moriarty, in her \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d handles more nimbly.)

On paper, at least.\n\nEach show centers on a pair of high school outsiders, a boy and a girl, each of whom has one absent parent. (In the 10-episode American series \u201cEverything,\u201d the boy\u2019s father and the girl\u2019s mother are gone; in the eight-episode British \u201cEnd,\u201d it\u2019s the other way around.) The missing moms are dead, the missing dads are deadbeats. Each show plays teasing games of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they, finding endless last-minute ways to forestall kisses or worse. Each boy gallantly takes full responsibility for a crime the corresponding girl was complicit in.\n\nBut no matter how many standard features of the teenage comedy the two series share, they\u2019re as different as night and day, and there\u2019s no question which one\u2019s the dark one.

In \u201cEnd,\u201d the boy takes the rap for an extremely bloody killing committed with a hunting knife.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that \u201cEnd,\u201d which is jarring, aggressively morbid and by far the better of the two shows, was originally made for good old broadcast television \u2014 it was shown on Britain\u2019s Channel 4 last year before arriving on Netflix in January.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEverything\u201d was made directly for Netflix (it was created by Ben York Jones and Michael Mohan), but it doesn\u2019t make much use of the license that allows, beyond some strong language.

That\u2019s because the tiny outpost near Homer, where the Allbrights homestead (in real life, Hannah\u2019s family runs a travel lodge in the same general area) has citizens who help one another and show up to share the work. This setup suits Ernt for about five minutes. Then he starts bonding with Mad Earl (\u201cfolks call me Mad Earl\u201d), the biggest paranoid white supremacist survivalist nut around, whom Ernt will soon best when it comes to crazy. Ernt also starts hating Tom Walker, the local rich person, who has no discernible bad qualities and does his best to help the Allbrights. Walker\u2019s big crime is that Cora finds him attractive.\n\nPhoto\n\nNow to the main event: Ernt goes from intimidating his wife and daughter to seriously beating Cora. And in a one-room log cabin, Leni can\u2019t not see what\u2019s going on. Hannah presents a sickeningly codependent marriage in which Mama makes excuses for Dad\u2019s violence and refuses to tell anyone what\u2019s happening to her, no matter how bad it gets. Cora is covering for Ernt for emotional, not practical, reasons. Still, she wouldn\u2019t get anywhere by going to the police; as the book points out, 1974 was a time when a woman with a job couldn\u2019t get a credit card without a man\u2019s permission.\n\nHannah manages to keep all this from getting too repetitive by steadily raising the stakes. By the middle of the book, Leni is 17, and there is a boy \u2014 Tom Walker\u2019s son, of course. (In this backwater, there\u2019s only one boy around anyway.) But Dad would prefer that Leni jump out of bed in the middle of the night and clean her gun than socialize with anybody, ever. So she begins to face the major questions of if or how she will ever have a life of her own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Great Alone\u201d is packed with rapturous descriptions of Alaskan scenery, which are the most reliably alluring part of it. Hannah remembers and summons an undeveloped wilderness, describing a gloriously pristine region in the days before cruise ships discovered it. One of the fighting points in the book is whether the little enclave the Allbrights call home should be opened up to tourists. Hannah presumably has mixed feelings about this, what with her family\u2019s travel lodge. But she keeps it simple in the book, making Ernt the purist and Tom Walker the guy who sees tourism as inevitable. Tom shuts Ernt down by saying, \u201cI got boots that have covered more ground in Alaska than you have.\u201d\n\nHannah also uses an oversupply of Alaskan hokum: \u201cTwo kinds of folks come up to Alaska, Cora\u2026\u201d And: \u201cYou know what they say about finding a man in Alaska...\u201d And: \u201cI think it was Jack London who said there were a thousand ways to die in Alaska.\u201d And: \u201cMarge, you got a mouth on you like a king salmon.\u201d Worst of all: \u201cThis is our home. We want it to stay wild and free.\u201d The book takes its title from \u201cThe Shooting of Dan McGrew,\u201d a poem by Robert W. Service, also known as the \u201cBard of the Yukon.\u201d\n\nCharacters are good or bad in \u201cThe Great Alone,\u201d happy or miserable. Ernt\u2019s PTSD consists of nightmares, violence, paranoia and excessive drinking. Cora says that his capacity for love has been destroyed by war, but that\u2019s it for nuance. Large Marge, the African-American woman who runs the local grocery, is always a force for good, and she can be counted on to help the Allbright women whenever they need her. And Leni\u2019s problems are dramatic enough to keep readers hooked, but she herself is good every minute of the day. Hannah gives her a kind of afterword, in which Leni writes: \u201cSomeone said to me once that Alaska didn\u2019t create character; it revealed it.\u201d Maybe so.

As little as possible is wasted. What a resident of Windhoek drinks today she will drink again in recycled form tomorrow.\n\nFor its long-term survival, Cape Town could adopt the Windhoek method.

But the newspaper now faces a painful reality: No matter how strong its journalism, no publication is immune to the economic pressure on the industry.\n\nOn Monday, staff members learned that the newspaper was filing for bankruptcy ahead of a sale, ending the Chilton family\u2019s century-long role in shepherding its journalism. A prospective buyer is lined up, but the move raises questions about the future both of a relentless local watchdog and its more than 200 employees, including Eric Eyre, who accepted the Pulitzer last year for his reporting on the state\u2019s opioid crisis.\n\n\u201cNever in a million years would I think that eight months later we would be in bankruptcy and I\u2019d be reapplying for my job,\u201d said Mr. Eyre, who plans to remain in West Virginia no matter the outcome. \u201cBut I guess life is full of highs and lows, and obviously now we\u2019re at a low.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came at the end of a tumultuous period for the publication, which had weathered drawn-out legal battles stemming from a 2004 transaction in which the left-leaning Charleston Gazette acquired a controlling interest in the right-leaning Charleston Daily Mail. The newspaper \u2014 which has about 32,000 daily subscribers, according to a court filing \u2014 has also suffered circulation and advertising losses over the past decade that its publisher, Susan Chilton Shumate, described in a letter on Monday addressed to the staff as \u201cdevastating to the bottom line.\u201d", "title": "A West Virginia Newspaper Won Journalism\u2019s Top Award.

The associate attorney general stepped down. The chief of staff offered to quit. And that was just Friday.\n\nAll of that came after the departure of Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary who cleared out his office last week amid accusations of spousal abuse. The White House had overlooked reported problems with his security clearance last year in part, officials said, because of a reluctance to lose yet another senior aide, particularly one seen as so professional and reliable.\n\nMore than a year into his administration, President Trump is presiding over a staff in turmoil, one with a 34 percent turnover rate, higher than any White House in decades. He has struggled to fill openings, unwilling to hire Republicans he considers disloyal and unable to entice Republicans who consider him unstable. Those who do come to work for him often do not last long, burning out from a volatile, sometimes cutthroat environment exacerbated by tweets and subpoenas.\n\nTo visit the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the granite, slate and cast iron edifice across West Executive Avenue from the White House where most of the president\u2019s staff works, at times feels like walking through a ghost town.

Her list of projects includes Gurls Talk, a charity she set up with the intention of raising awareness around mental health and female empowerment; working with Times Up and Save the Children; art directing, alongside the photographer Juergen Teller, the Burberry campaigns in which she stars; writing a monthly column for British Vogue, where she is a contributing editor; and, over the next few weeks, walking in the fashion shows of both emerging and established designers. In London, many of them are her friends.\n\nFresh from the podium, she\u2019s ready for a day of fittings and shows, taking opportune moments to nap in her car in between. First up is the emerging designer Ashley Williams, a friend of Aboah\u2019s, who is hosting fittings in her Hackney home because of a flood in her studio. After Aboah arrives, the stylist Julia Sarr-Jamois pulls out a tie-dye hoodie printed with the words \u201cDon\u2019t Know, Don\u2019t Care.\u201d \u201cThat is so you right now,\u201d teases Sian Steel, Aboah\u2019s agent, as the model stifles yawns. A sequin jacket catches her eye. \u201cCan I wear this to the reception at the palace on Monday?\u201d she asks Williams. \u201cThe last time I went to the palace I came straight from the Tate gift shop in a yellow tracksuit.\u201d\n\nNext, Aboah departs for the industrial Truman Brewery in Shoreditch for a fitting with the York-based designer Matty Bovan. Both Bovan\u2019s and Williams\u2019s shows are later that day, but before that, Aboah will also squeeze in a visit to Burberry HQ (stopping at Pret a Manger on the way) for a final fitting before the big show the following night, Christopher Bailey\u2019s last as creative director of the house. Inside Burberry\u2019s corporate-looking building, giant pictures of Aboah line the slick reception area. She pauses to pose for a picture with herself.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "There was more to Peter\u2019s crise than his worry about Patsy or growing distaste for his surreptitious assignment. He was 25, almost 26. Impatiently, he reflected that his life didn\u2019t make sense to him, a feeling that had gnawed at him for a long while. What was he doing here? He began a second novel, called \u201cPartisans.\u201d The protagonist is a journalist working under cover in Paris on an investigative story about an elusive Communist. The journalist\u2019s name is Barney Sand \u2014 initials B.S. Listening to the sound of his own voice, Sand broods that it \u201cbelonged to a man in mirrors whose face seemed more foolish every day.\u201d Waiting to undertake the next move in his mission, Sand thinks: \u201cTo wait, to wait, as it now seemed to him he had waited all his life: for graduation from school, for enlistment in the Army, for combat that never came, for the war to end, for college to end, for promotion in two jobs he did not want, for a love that did not exist \u2014 waiting for a raison d\u2019\u00eatre which never arrived because he could not recognize it.\u201d\n\nMy grandparents were wealthy. Like the etiolated hero of \u201cPartisans,\u201d my uncle believed that his privileged background and private schooling had stunted his personal growth. To use today\u2019s psycho-parlance, Peter didn\u2019t like himself very much. Before he married and went off to Paris, he was often in one sort of trouble or another without really knowing why. He dodged a court-martial while in the Navy. He blew up his own engagement party \u2014 insulting Patsy\u2019s mother and making out with a bridesmaid. To paraphrase St. Augustine on his own bad-boy phase, Peter became to himself a place of unhappiness in which he could not bear to be, but he could not escape himself. Time and again he would bring himself to the lip of a crisis and, meaning to leap over, leap in.\n\nBut at this juncture he acted wisely. Quitting the C.I.A., Peter took his wife and newborn son, my cousin Lucas, back home. He settled in Sagaponack, on Long Island, still and always a footloose man but more focused. In midlife he produced two fine novels, \u201cAt Play in the Fields of the Lord\u201d and \u201cFar Tortuga,\u201d and a glorious spate of nonfiction about the natural world. His best nonfiction works are \u201cUnder the Mountain Wall,\u201d \u201cThe Tree Where Man Was Born\u201d and especially \u201cThe Snow Leopard,\u201d which appeared in 1978. Matthiessen is the only writer to win National Book Awards in both nonfiction, for \u201cThe Snow Leopard,\u201d and fiction, for his 2008 novel, \u201cShadow Country.\u201d\n\nIf he were alive, he might voice one regret about his sterling career. His time in Paris kept bobbing to the surface, both the good part about The Paris Review, as the magazine\u2019s stature among intellectuals increased, and the negative part about his role in the C.I.A. Well before the C.I.A. story became public, Peter had acknowledged the connection to Plimpton and Humes, and after the revelation he tried to placate other friends for having been less than candid. He protested that he was young and had no politics to speak of, other than a vague, Ivy League sense of patriotism. \u201cPeople tend to forget,\u201d he wrote in his memoir notes, \u201cthat 60 years ago, at the start of the Cold War, the C.I.A. had not yet earned the evil repute it has today, and I look back on my own brief participation with more chagrin than shame.\u201d He also wrote, \u201cI was no good at this low work and hated the deception that went with it, which I found nerve-racking and disagreeable and made worse by the fact that it all seemed petty and pointless as well as an idiotic waste of public money.\u201d\n\nPutting on a pained smile, Peter would observe that by introducing him to socialists the C.I.A. had educated him in the wrong direction. My uncle, don\u2019t forget, became a champion of left-wing causes. He wrote books in support of the farmworkers leader Cesar Chavez and the Native American activist Leonard Peltier, and he regularly chastised big corporations and the government for harming the environment. The occasionally shrill vein in his writing cost him both money and credibility.", "title": "A Writer\u2019s Controversial Past That Will Not Die", "authors": []}

To hone my voice, I read everything, from books to cereal boxes, three times: once for fun, the second time to learn something new about the writing craft, and the third time was to improve that piece. I woke up early every day and basically did \u201cliterary dress up,\u201d where I\u2019d wear another writer\u2019s voice like clothing and move onto the next one, until I\u2019d gone through a stack of 10 different books. I wore ephemeral versions, copying their sentence constructions, verbiage, and tones. Then I\u2019d step out of them and choose the best characteristics of those styles, until I created a voice that was mine.\n\nThis was before I started thinking about publishing, which came in early high school when I started attending free poetry workshops at Beyond Baroque and the nonprofit WriteGirl.\n\nWhat is it that gets you started on a poem? Is it an idea, an image, a rhythm, or something else? Do you rely more on your ears or your eyes?\n\nBoth the external and the internal trigger me. If I\u2019m writing about something internal, say past experiences, I\u2019m writing about it in relation to an external reality, like the ocean. When that connection happens in my mind, I grab a pen and find the closest excuse for sunlight. I usually begin with a word cloud, where I write down the best words I\u2019ve heard that week \u2014 like plum, stone, spoon \u2014 I don\u2019t know why but I love words like that.\n\nI then take those words and begin to write. I think about the content of what I\u2019m writing first, just getting the lines out and choosing the most necessary ones. Only then do I think about a shape that comes out of that meaning. Where do I want this line to break? Do I want the stanzas to be shaped like a girl, or a house? Maybe it\u2019s because of an auditory processing disorder, but I depend a lot on sight. But that also means I\u2019m hypersensitive to sound \u2014 I just see it, rather than hear it, if that makes sense. For example, in order to write, I must have music. Without. Music. I. Can. Not. Write. I\u2019ll play an instrumental track that speaks to my mood, usually something by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ludwig G\u00f6ransson or Michael Giacchino, and then my poem becomes a visualization of that sound.", "title": "A Young Poet\u2019s Inspiration", "authors": []}

This is a place where everything is seen, reported, judged, which is one reason Ireland is such a good setting for an adultery novel. When Alice tells a new acquaintance that she\u2019s married, it\u2019s as if Meghan Markle were explaining to an attendant at Kensington Palace that she\u2019s the American actress who\u2019s engaged to Prince Harry: \u201cThere are few things on earth smaller than this country.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne day Alice meets Cauley, a young playwright who is both ambitious and puppy-soft. Almost immediately, she knows she\u2019s going to sleep with him; she just doesn\u2019t know what it will mean: \u201cI had imagined that it would bring me to my senses, remind me that I was a grown-up now, with a cupboard full of wedding china and candlesticks that matched.\u201d Instead, it turns her into someone \u201cferal, like an addict, all stealth and unreason.\u201d\n\nYet the love affair whose rhythms she describes \u2014 sitting on her front steps, savoring the arrival of a letter from Cauley; engaging in furtive sex on a bus \u2014 recalls nothing so much as a teenage passion.

The circumstances are seedy: Cauley is scrounging money from his mother, a disreputable figure because she\u2019s living with the lover for whom she broke up her marriage.

They meet in a suburban pub, Alice and Cauley painfully hung over, the mother and her boyfriend \u201cdeeply and committedly alcoholic. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t only the drink, though, that dishonored them, it was the legal limbo of the undivorced. They had about them a fugitive air, and an uncertainty about how much their transgressions mattered.\u201d When Alice and Cauley make their escape, Cauley says, \u201cWell, there\u2019s us in 30 years!\u201d and they laugh \u201cas though the voicing of it had rendered it impossible.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This woman is instantly familiar: a mixture of the na\u00efvely wonder-struck and the old-lady ordinary (happy evenings watching \u201cJeopardy\u201d in her retirement condo; a compulsion to keep her new cellphone charged, accompanied by fear of actually using it). But although Alice feels perhaps excessively adored by her mother, she\u2019s never been able to compensate for her lack of a father. \u201cStraying,\u201d it turns out, means straying not just from one\u2019s partner but from a parent who, for all her delight in the world\u2019s possibilities, couldn\u2019t give her child the stability she craved.

And while there\u2019s considerable evidence that ex-convicts have a low turnout rate, they don\u2019t need to have a very high turnout rate to make a difference if there\u2019s roughly 1.5 million of them.\n\nFlorida is one of a few states with a permanent voting ban for people with felony convictions, a policy that goes back to the Jim Crow era. A discharged felon can apply individually for clemency to a board that includes the governor, but Florida\u2019s rules are restrictive. (On Thursday, a federal judge declared unconstitutional the state\u2019s clemency system; the governor\u2019s spokesman hinted at an appeal.)\n\nThe ballot initiative would automatically allow felons to vote once they completed their sentences, except those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense.\n\nEx-convicts tend to have very low educational attainment, and they tend to be young and nonwhite, with low incomes \u2014 all factors that correlate with a low turnout. The ex-convict turnout rate might not be expected to be much higher than 30 percent, based strictly on demographic characteristics.\n\nThere\u2019s evidence the actual turnout rate among this group is even lower. Over the last decade, several studies have matched discharged felons to voter registration files in the states where they\u2019re permitted to vote. Most studies find that around 20 percent of them turn out in battleground states in presidential elections.\n\nMany of these studies were conducted with data from the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, when black and youth turnout were particularly high and Democratic registration rates were particularly high as well. On the other hand, these studies were of recently discharged felons, who might be less likely to register and vote than the broader felon population.\n\nA 20 percent turnout rate is pretty low, but it could produce a meaningful effect over 1.5 million newly eligible voters.

So she and Mr. Ostermeier \u2014 whose explosive \u201cRichard III\u201d was at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in October \u2014 devised a radical adaptation.\n\nIn the play, Ms. Hoss, 42, takes center stage as Katy, an actress recording the voice-over for a documentary based on Mr. Eribon\u2019s book. About 45 minutes in, she starts questioning the decisions of the film\u2019s director (played by Bush Moukarzel), who has been hovering in the sound booth. The book, the fake movie (which includes footage of Mr. Eribon chatting with his mother, filmed by Mr. Ostermeier and S\u00e9bastien Dupouey) and Ms. Hoss\u2019s own life merge as she brings her father, Willi Hoss, into the story.\n\n\u201cEverybody who read the Eribon book ended up talking about their own family, background or history, so I thought it might be a good idea to make that fruitful in the production,\u201d Mr. Ostermeier said. \u201cNina was happy to do it, even though it took her a lot of work and energy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA key difference between Mr. Eribon\u2019s upbringing and Ms. Hoss\u2019s is that his was miserable, and hers decidedly less so. \u201cI had a fantastic childhood,\u201d she said. \u201cI had two parents who had a lot of belief in humanity and people, and always fought with enthusiasm \u2014 never for themselves but always in a group.\u201d Her father started as a welder and trade unionist, then was elected to Germany\u2019s Parliament and was a founder of the Green Party. Her mother, Heidemarie Hoss-Rohweder, ran a theater company.\n\nIn the play, Ms. Hoss makes this activism come to life by showing pictures and home videos of her father, including some from trips he made to help save the Brazilian Amazon\u2019s rain forest. In a recent telephone conversation, Ms. Hoss described spending several summers there as a teenager, watching her father take measurements for pipes or wells.\n\nEventually, though, she took her mother\u2019s route and attended drama school. Her association with Mr. Ostermeier dates to 1999, and \u201cReturning to Reims\u201d is their third collaboration at the Schaub\u00fchne, following Yasmina Reza\u2019s dark comedy \u201cBella Figura\u201d and a revival of Lillian Hellman\u2019s \u201cThe Little Foxes.\u201d\n\nIn a move indicative of Ms. Hoss\u2019s process, a mix of research and intuition, she tweaked her take on the wicked Regina Giddens nightly in \u201cThe Little Foxes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSometimes I felt the world is really mean to her,\u201d Ms. Hoss said with a chuckle \u2014 she laughs a lot in conversation, as if happy to be taken on a ride by her own quicksilver mind. \u201cHer brothers treat her horribly, so she becomes a horrible person. Other nights, she\u2019s like the men: She just wants it the way she wants it, and that\u2019s horrifying. Women can be horrible, too, and they should be allowed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of Ms. Hoss\u2019s greatest strengths as an actor is a deceiving calm that somehow suggests both confidence and vulnerability. \u201cEven when she whispers, she captures the audience,\u201d Mr. Eribon said by telephone. Early in \u201cReturning to Reims,\u201d he said, \u201cshe speaks low to herself, rehearsing the reading, yet we\u2019re fascinated.\u201d\n\nThis quality allows Ms. Hoss\u2019s presence, at once cryptic and warm, to resonate even in small roles. It was such a supporting part, in fact, that led to \u201cHomeland.\u201d That series\u2019s showrunner, Alex Gansa, first spotted her alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman in the spy thriller \u201cA Most Wanted Man\u201d (2014), then confirmed his hunch by watching her carry the period melodrama \u201cPhoenix\u201d (2015), and cold-called her.\n\n\u201cOne of the things Nina loved about Astrid, more than anything, is that she had a sense of humor,\u201d Mr. Gansa said by telephone. \u201cWe spent a lot of time in the writers\u2019 room giving her that color because she can be so wry and funny in the most understated way.

Its top litigator, Mr. Petrocelli, defended Mr. Trump in a lawsuit involving Trump University. Time Warner has hired Christine A. Varney, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s Antitrust Division.\n\nThe decision by Mr. Delrahim, a former White House counsel, to deny a merger of two companies that do not directly compete was unexpected given that similar deals have previously been approved. The Justice Department has argued that the merger of two giant companies that both produce content and distribute those shows will lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nAT&T has claimed that Mr. Delrahim unfairly singled out its deal. The company described the government\u2019s decision as \u201cselective enforcement\u201d and as evidence, it pointed to a 2011 decision by the Justice Department to approve a similar deal, Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal.\n\nAT&T is expected to also claim Mr. Delrahim has flip-flopped on his views of the deal. Before he was appointed to the Justice Department, Mr. Delrahim said in an interview with a Canadian broadcaster that he did not see clear problems with the deal. The company may present a video of that interview in the trial.\n\nMr. Delrahim has said Comcast had a much smaller reach into American homes than AT&T\u2019s nationwide wireless and satellite television network. He has added that Comcast and NBC were allowed to merge with several so-called behavioral conditions that were hard to enforce. Mr. Delrahim has vocally opposed such conditions that constrain a company\u2019s business practices, saying he prefers selling off assets to solve competition concerns.\n\nAT&T\u2019s strategy of putting Mr. Delrahim on the witness stand is risky.\n\n\u201cIf AT&T\u2019s strategy is to call Delrahim to testify for the purpose of showing political motivation, it could blow up in their face if the assistant attorney general is a credible witness for the legitimate challenge of the merger,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official in the Justice Department who has been critical of the deal. \u201cUnless they have a smoking gun, I think Delrahim has a convincing argument.\u201d", "title": "AT&T Is Said to Want Antitrust Official on Witness List for Trial", "authors": []}

The Justice Department has argued that consumers would be harmed by the deal, saying it would stifle competition and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nIn a hearing on Friday, AT&T agreed to remove Mr. Delrahim from its witness list on the condition the company could call him to testify during the trial if evidence emerged to support its arguments of political interference.\n\nThe blockbuster trial will begin March 19. It is expected to help set the course for mergers and acquisitions in coming years.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s suit to block AT&T\u2019s merger with Time Warner was unexpected, because the government has a history of allowing mergers between companies that don\u2019t directly compete. Those deals, including Comcast\u2019s merger with NBCUniversal in 2011, contained several conditions to resolve competition concerns.

Much of that money was likely spent on online and social media advertising.\n\nOther spending included $361,000 on campaign merchandise, presumably including the red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats that became the symbol of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nLegal fees were among the biggest expenses detailed in Wednesday\u2019s reports, accounting for about 25 percent of all the $4.7 million spent by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and its two joint committees with the Republican National Committee.\n\nThe legal bills highlight the degree to which Mr. Trump\u2019s preparations for a re-election bid in 2020 have been shadowed by the investigations being pursued by congressional committees and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and connections between Russia, Mr. Trump and his associates.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe legal spending had spiked sharply from July through September as those investigations intensified, and then remained consistent through the end of the year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nElection law permits campaigns to pay legal costs that stem from issues related to the relevant campaigns.\n\nIt is not possible to determine definitively how much of the legal spending by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign went toward responding to the Russia inquiries.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It represents the campaign in matters related to election and campaign finance law, as well as litigation stemming from the campaign.\n\nBut Jones Day also represents the campaign in connection with the investigations, helping to respond to requests for tens of thousands of pages of documents and interviews with campaign officials.\n\nThe second biggest recipient of legal fees in Wednesday\u2019s reports \u2014 McDermott Will & Emery, which was paid $214,000 \u2014 is representing Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer and adviser, in the Russia investigations.\n\nMr. Cohen referred a question about the legal fees to the Trump campaign. Michael Glassner, the executive director of the Trump campaign, did not respond to an email asking whether the campaign was covering Mr. Cohen\u2019s legal costs.\n\nThe Trump campaign also paid $29,000 for legal consulting to the Trump Corporation, among several payments to Trump companies.\n\nAn additional $3,900 in rent went to Trump Plaza, presumably for office space, and another $11,000 in rent to Trump Restaurants, as well as more than $10,000 in travel costs to the Trump International Hotel here. The hotel has become a hot spot for donors and others seeking to rub elbows with Trump family members and insiders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother notable disbursement was a $5,000 payment for research consulting to an organization in New York called Confidential Global Investigations, whose website says it is made up of former law enforcement and intelligence officials who specialize in financial investigations and finding hidden assets.\n\nThe company\u2019s president, Robert W.

But the evidence on that remains murky.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Winick also found in the archives lyrics collected in 1926 by a high school student outside of Gullah territory for a song similar to \u201cCome By Here.\u201d That raised the possibility, Mr. Winick said, that the song might not have originated with the Gullah Geechee, though he maintains that it is quite possible that they could be its creators.

Mr. Kelly again said Mr. Porter needed to leave, the people said. Mr. Porter agreed and told colleagues that he planned to resign without setting a departure date so he could help with the transition.

One official said he at first discussed one divorce, and then two. Initially, he said that he had been verbally abusive but that his wives had been too.\n\nWhile Mr. Kelly and Mr. Porter have been characterized as close allies, some White House officials said over the weekend that that was exaggerated. Mr. Kelly found Mr. Porter competent and did not want to find someone new, one official said, but he never entirely trusted Mr. Porter, in part because Mr. Kelly\u2019s longtime deputy, Kirstjen Nielsen, was not a fan of his.\n\nMs. Nielsen has since left the White House to become secretary of Homeland Security. Her absence and Mr. Kelly\u2019s reluctance to trust and promote people he does not know well have also been cited in some of the chaos surrounding Mr. Porter.

He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.\n\nMr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.\n\n\u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.\n\n\u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.\n\nThe process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.\n\nOfficials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.\n\nVideo\n\nBackground checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.\n\nBut several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.\n\nMr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.\n\nWhite House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nIn November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.\n\nOne person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.\n\nIn Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.\n\nMr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "title": "Accusations Against Aide Renew Attention on White House Security Clearances", "authors": ["Michael D.

Tourism Australia \u2014 the Australian government agency responsible for attracting international visitors to the country \u2014 decided last April that it would buy a Super Bowl spot as part of a broader campaign geared toward drawing more visitors from North America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe form it took: a big movie campaign for \u201cDundee,\u201d a sequel to the movie \u201cCrocodile Dundee,\u201d starring the actors Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth.\n\nThe catch: \u201cDundee\u201d isn\u2019t actually being made, despite the entertaining trailers that have been released for the film, its movie website and IMDB page, and a cast introduction video that includes appearances from a host of famous Australians, including Hugh Jackman, Margot Robbie, Isla Fisher and Russell Crowe.\n\n\u201cWe did a scan around things like the Grammys and the Academy Awards and other sporting events like the N.B.A. Finals and the World Series, but the event that really stops this country is the Super Bowl,\u201d said John O\u2019Sullivan, the managing director of Tourism Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s such a spectacle, right? If you look at it from a foreigner\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s this massive event which I think surpasses things like the Grand Slams in tennis and the Champions League final.\u201d\n\nNorth America is the second-most-valuable market for Australian tourism after mainland China, and one that the agency has decided to focus on in the last six months, Mr. O\u2019Sullivan said. While many people want to visit Australia, he said, the trick for the country is moving up from a \u201cbucket list\u201d destination to a place that people will go in the near future.\n\nThe concept for the campaign was created by the ad agency Droga5, whose founder, David Droga, is Australian. Content tied to the pretend movie will morph after the Super Bowl ad and will continue to use Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth, Mr. Droga said.\n\n\u201cThe beauty is there\u2019s also a lot of content that moves with Chris and Danny that\u2019s sort of them exploring the country as friends \u2014 as an Aussie showing around a mate,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Droga also noted that the campaign for \u201cDundee\u201d benefited from the support of \u201cAussiewood\u201d stars like Mr. Jackman and Ms. Robbie, who worked on it for \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we had to pay commercial rights for those people,\u201d then it \u201cwould be the most expensive ad in the Super Bowl maybe ever,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo\n\nOne final Super Bowl connection: Mr. O\u2019Sullivan noted that he spent a year of high school in Lebanon, Pa., making him a Philadelphia Eagles fan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSlow start for ads, though some bring smiles.\n\n\u201cTypically, you see the great work is front-loaded, and I guess my hope is that the better work is coming,\u201d Wendy Clark, the chief executive of DDB North America and a former marketing executive at Coca-Cola, said at the start of the game\u2019s second quarter. \u201cAt the end of the day, a Super Bowl ad is about epic, over-the-top production value,\u201d and the first quarter \u201cwas a little quiet in the end.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There\u2019s no bigger stage for advertisers \u2014 last year\u2019s game drew more than 111 million viewers \u2014 and that\u2019s why they\u2019re willing to shell out millions of dollars to be on it for 30 seconds.\n\nLast year, commercials with social and political messages stole the show, but this year\u2019s crop of advertisers seemed to steer clear of such commentary and aimed for laughs and nostalgia.\n\nOf course, they\u2019re paying the same high-ticket prices: The average cost of a 30-second ad in the Super Bowl is more than $5 million this year, according to ad buyers, roughly in line with last year. And that doesn\u2019t count all the expenses tied to making and promoting an ad, like the star power. Cindy Crawford, Peter Dinklage and Danny DeVito are among the famous faces who will make commercial appearances this year.\n\nWhile some ads focused on philanthropy, the tone seemed to have shifted from last year, when Airbnb and 84 Lumber ran spots that were viewed as responses to President Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and Audi broadcast a commercial advocating equal pay for women. Some industry experts had expected at least one major ad focused on women this year, perhaps tied to the #MeToo movement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit surprised,\u201d Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business, said. \u201cSome of the best ads over the last 10 years have focused on female empowerment, like the Audi daughter ad.\u201d\n\nWomen are generally much less visible in Super Bowl ads than men, even as Nielsen data shows that women were 47 percent of the audience for last year\u2019s game. Mr. Taylor, who recently studied Super Bowl ads from 2008 to 2017, found that 76 percent of the commercials showed a man as a principal character, while 43 percent featured a woman as a principal character.\n\nSusan Credle, the global chief creative officer at the agency FCB, said Super Bowl advertisers may be \u201cconcerned about looking opportunistic versus supportive.\u201d And humor, she noted, was particularly appealing given the social and political climate.\n\n\u201cSometimes when the world is troubled or America is feeling a little \u2014 well, I wouldn\u2019t say it was an up 2017 for everybody \u2014 I think there is a tendency to want to balance out the energy,\u201d Ms. Credle said. \u201cLightheartedness and a little fun and joy is probably a good antidote to the reality that we\u2019re sitting in.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 reference and a Jeff Bezos cameo.\n\nFans of HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d have been buzzing about a commercial for Doritos and Mountain Dew that stars the actors Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman, as well as the musicians Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes. The brands, owned by Pepsi, cast Mr. Dinklage to represent fire, for a new spicy Doritos flavor, while Mr. Morgan plays ice for a new kind of Mountain Dew.\n\nGreg Lyons, the chief marketing officer of Pepsi\u2019s North American beverage unit, said the casting was not a reference to Mr. Dinklage\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d character, who advises a queen who owns dragons. The actor, he said, is \u201cfiery on his own.\u201d\n\nMr. Lyons said, \u201cHe was in \u2018Elf\u2019 \u2014 he was pretty fiery in that as well.\u201d\n\nIn another kind of pop-culture moment, Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, who has become far more visible in recent months at Hollywood and charity events, will appear in his first ad for the company, which promotes its Echo device.\n\nHalf a billion dollars in commercial time.\n\nWhile it has never been easier for advertisers to reach vast numbers of people around the world, thanks to the internet, the lure of the Super Bowl is the one huge audience it provides. Advertisers spent a combined $534 million on ads before, during and after the game last year, according to the research firm Kantar. The company said that the roughly $5 million a 30-second commercial cost last year compared to $2.5 million for 30 seconds in the National Football Conference championship game and $1.9 million for the same time in the Academy Awards.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a finite amount of inventory,\u201d Gibbs Haljun, managing director of media investment at GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP. \u201cThere\u2019s only one game, it\u2019s only on once a year, the ratings are relatively stable and it is what it is.\u201d\n\nStill, it appeared that NBC was selling at least some spots down to the wire, as illustrated by a last-minute buy from Wix.com that the company announced on Friday. In January, Wix.com was promoting its decision to sit out of this year\u2019s game and arranging press interviews with its chief marketing officer about alternative plans for the money.\n\nNBC said in an email late Friday that it had sold all of its ads for the game.\n\nThe network, which is owned by Comcast, has had the dual challenge this year of selling ads for both the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics, which will begin on Friday.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time that occurred,\u201d Mr. Haljun said, \u201cso this is kind of an odd challenge for them and continues to make the negotiations a little more interesting and robust.\u201d", "title": "Advertisers Eschew Politics for Humor in Super Bowl Commercials", "authors": ["Sapna Maheshwari"]}

Last year, the Alliance for Securing Democracy, in conjunction with the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, created a website that tracks hundreds of Twitter accounts of human users and suspected bots that they have linked to a Russian influence campaign.\n\nThe researchers zeroed in on Twitter accounts posting information that was in step with material coming from well-known Russian propaganda outlets. To spot an automated bot, they looked for certain signs, like an extremely high volume of posts or content that conspicuously matched hundreds of other accounts.\n\nThe researchers said they had watched as the bots began posting about the Parkland shooting shortly after it happened.\n\nAmplified by bot swarms, Russian-linked Twitter accounts tried to foment discord before and after the election. Hundreds of accounts promoted false stories about Hillary Clinton and spread articles based on leaked emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter have, to varying degrees, announced new measures to eliminate bot accounts, and have hired more moderators to help them weed out disinformation on their platforms.\n\nBut since the election, the Russian-linked bots have rallied around other divisive issues, often ones that President Trump has tweeted about. They promoted Twitter hashtags like #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee after some National Football League players started kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice.\n\nThe automated Twitter accounts helped popularize the #releasethememo hashtag, which referred to a secret House Republican memorandum that suggested the F.B.I. and the Justice Department abused their authority to obtain a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The debate over the memo widened a schism between the White House and its own law enforcement agencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bots are \u201cgoing to find any contentious issue, and instead of making it an opportunity for compromise and negotiation, they turn it into an unsolvable issue bubbling with frustration,\u201d said Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. \u201cIt just heightens that frustration and anger.\u201d\n\nIntelligence officials in the United States have warned that malicious actors will try to spread disinformation ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. In testimony to Congress last year and in private meetings with lawmakers, social media companies promised that they will do better in 2018 than they did in 2016.\n\nBut the Twitter campaign around the Parkland shooting is an example of how Russian operatives are still at it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Exploiting the issue of mental illness in the gun control debate, they propagated the notion that Nikolas Cruz, the suspected gunman, was a mentally ill \u201clone killer.\u201d They also claimed that he had searched for Arabic phrases on Google before the shooting. Simultaneously, the bots started other hashtags, like #ar15, for the semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, and #NRA.\n\nThe bots\u2019 behavior follows a pattern, said Mr. Morgan, one of the researchers who worked with the German Marshall Fund to create Hamilton 68, the website that monitors Russian bot and fake Twitter activity. The bots target a contentious issue like race relations or guns. They stir the pot, often animating both sides and creating public doubt in institutions like the police or media. Any issue associated with extremist views is a ripe target.\n\nThe goal is to push fringe ideas into the \u201cslightly more mainstream,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. If well-known people retweet the bot messages or simply link to a website the bots are promoting, the messages gain an edge of legitimacy.\n\nAn indictment made public on Friday by Mr. Mueller as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the election mentioned a Russian Twitter feed, @TEN_GOP, which posed as a Tennessee Republican account and attracted more than 100,000 followers. Messages from this now-deleted account were retweeted by the president\u2019s sons and close advisers including Kellyanne Conway and Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe indictment also described how fraudulent Russian accounts on Twitter tried to push real Americans into action. The indictment said the fake Twitter account @March_for_Trump had organized political rallies for Mr. Trump in New York before the election, including a \u201cMarch for Trump\u201d rally on June 25, 2016, and a \u201cDown With Hillary\u201d gathering on July 23, 2016.\n\nBy Friday morning, the bots that pushed the original tweets around the Parkland shooting had moved on to the hashtag #falseflag \u2014 a term used by conspiracy theorists to refer to a secret government operation that is carried out to look like something else \u2014 with a conspiracy theory that the shooting had never happened.\n\nBy Monday, the bots had new targets: the Daytona 500 auto race in Daytona Beach, Fla., and news about William Holleeder, a man facing trial in the Netherlands for his suspected role in six gangland killings.

So were Michael and Nancy Fisher, the parents of the victim in the case, Mark Fisher, a 19-year-old college student who was shot to death after a raucous house party in Brooklyn in October 2003.\n\nMr. Fisher, a student at Fairfield University in Connecticut, had been barhopping on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with his college buddies on the evening before he was killed. After the woozy night \u2014 and a string of fateful coincidences \u2014 he ended up largely among strangers at the party at Mr. Giuca\u2019s house in Prospect Park South, an enclave of sweeping front porches and large Victorian homes. Shortly after 6 a.m. the next day, Mr. Fisher was found dead, wrapped in a blanket from Mr. Giuca\u2019s house, at the foot of a driveway across the street from the home of another person from the party.\n\nProsecutors claimed at trial that Mr. Giuca and a co-defendant, Antonio Russo, were members of a loosely organized gang called the Ghetto Mafia and went after Mr. Fisher for street credibility, seeing him as a rich teenager and \u201can easy target.\u201d They also said that Mr. Giuca might have been jealous about a woman Mr. Fisher had been flirting with that night, and was angry at his drunken behavior.

School administrators are scrutinizing students and their backpacks closely; the day after the Florida attack, a student at Clarksburg High School in Montgomery County, Md., was found to have a loaded Glock 9-millimeter handgun in his bag at school, the police said. A student at Pasco High School in Dade City, Fla., was arrested on Friday after a staff member conducting a routine sweep of vehicles in the parking lot discovered an AR-15 rifle and ammunition in the student\u2019s truck.

And the question of whether the senator\u2019s actions were official acts added another level of complexity for the jury.\n\nEarly in the trial, Judge Walls made it clear that he was not going to let any of the salacious rumors work their way into his courtroom, nor what he viewed as loaded references to Mr. Menendez\u2019s decisions to stay in luxury hotels with a female friend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a tabloid trial, and I am not going to let you just swish and swash nonsensical, you know, nonsensical substances \u2014 not substances, scenarios that really don\u2019t even make for a good pulp fiction story,\u201d he told a prosecutor at one point.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It had its seamy underside with the Melgen girlfriends, but it was kind of a bloodless case once Walls cut all the sex out of it.\u201d\n\nFederal prosecutors saw their case slip away. The jury was deadlocked. Judge Walls tried to encourage them to reach a decision but eventually had to declare a mistrial. Jurors told reporters afterward that they were stuck at 10-2, with the majority for acquittal. It was unusual insight into a jury\u2019s deliberations, and it made some in the Justice Department unenthusiastic about a retrial.\n\nThe government was facing other hurdles.\n\nJudge Walls had said he would not preside over the retrial, and the case was expected to go to Judge William Martini. Reflecting Mr. Menendez\u2019s long and deep involvement in New Jersey politics, every other federal judge in Newark, where the first trial was held, had either passed or recused from the case; Mr. Menendez had helped sponsor several of the judges for the bench.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProsecutors had reason to feel anxious about arguing the case before Judge Martini. A former Republican congressman \u2014 he served in the House with Mr. Menendez in the mid 1990s \u2014 he has been an outspoken critic of government overreach.\n\nIn one of the most prominent public corruption cases in the state\u2019s recent history, against Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, Judge Martini questioned whether Mr. James\u2019 actions had been different than what any public official would do for a constituent. He sentenced Mr. James to 27 months in prison, a fraction of what the United States attorney in the case \u2014 a future governor named Chris Christie \u2014 had sought.\n\nJudge Martini, too, decided to pass on the case, which would have moved it to Trenton. That move might have hurt the defense, because the pool of jurors would be less likely to include many Hispanics, who were considered sympathetic to Mr. Menendez.\n\nThe government risked looking small with a case based primarily on a relatively lesser offense, of failing to report trips and gifts on disclosure forms. There was the chance that jurors would have decided the matter was not a federal crime, and better handled by the Senate Ethics Committee, which is conducting its own investigation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they thought \u2018small potatoes,\u2019 or they would look petty if all they got out of it was a false statements case,\u201d Mr. Krovatin said. \u201cYou have to believe that Judge Walls\u2019s decision became the tipping point in terms of their decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knocks out the six-figure dollars in the case,\u201d Mr. Krovatin said. \u201cThey must have thought that made a retrial much more consistent with the defense theme of friendship and exchange of mutual friendship-related favors as opposed to bribery.\u201d\n\nAfter the years of headlines, months of courtroom battles and the surprising decision to retry the case, federal prosecutors delivered the news to the defense that they were abandoning all the charges almost casually.\n\nPeter Koski, the lead prosecutor, walked over to the defense table during a procedural hearing, out of earshot of the judge, leaned over and said they were dropping the case.\n\nAs much as Judge Walls\u2019s decision to toss some of the charges hobbled the prosecution, it also handed the government a public relations lifeline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe case got harder, and the politics of dismissing it got a lot easier,\u201d said Matt Miller, a former spokesman for the Department of Justice who also closely counseled Mr. Menendez during the investigation. \u201cNow you have a graceful exit.\u201d", "title": "After Years of Investigation, a Sudden Folding of the Case Against Menendez", "authors": ["Nick Corasaniti", "Kate Zernike"]}

I don\u2019t know what I would do. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAlready, Mr. Finkelstein\u2019s office has offered a way to avoid a trial: Mr. Cruz\u2019s guilty plea in exchange for a punishment of 17 consecutive life sentences without parole. But Mr. Finkelstein recognizes that for some victims, that might not be enough: \u201cI\u2019m a father.

And it is not clear where Michael J. Satz, Broward County\u2019s prosecutor, is in his deliberations. He declined to comment.\n\nMr. Satz, who was elected state attorney when Gerald R. Ford was president, is regarded as a hard-edged prosecutor, but he is still likely to consider an array of factors, including the odds of persuading a jury.\n\nAlthough jurors condemned men for massacres in Charleston, S.C., where nine churchgoers were killed, and at Fort Hood, Tex., where there were 13 fatalities, they spared the life of the Aurora gunman who killed 12, citing his history of mental illness. In the Huntsville shooting, the prosecutor said his conversations with the families of the victims were a reason he did not seek execution.\n\nGeorge Brauchler, the lead prosecutor in the Aurora case, said he had engaged in \u201cserious soul-searching\u201d about whether to pass up a plea deal and seek the death penalty. \u201cThis is as much a moral decision as it is a decision about justice, and that is not an easy decision to make,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cUntil you are signing your name to a piece of paper that starts the machinery of government against another human being to take their life, whether it\u2019s deserved or not, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Brauchler said he had met with his Roman Catholic priest, and conferred with family members of the victims as well as survivors of the attack.

Bruck, said only: \u201cMs. Sheppard, I\u2019m so sorry. I have no questions.\u201d\n\nA crucial consideration in potential capital cases, prosecutors and defense lawyers said, is whether failing to seek the death penalty in a mass shooting would set a precedent, making it more difficult to seek it in cases with lower death tolls.\n\nIn Charleston, the federal government had a sharp internal debate, and met with resistance from family members of victims, before it decided to seek the death penalty against Dylann S. Roof.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe death penalty itself becomes a participant in the decision, almost as if the death penalty is given a seat at the table,\u201d said Mr. Bruck, who represented Mr. Roof during the guilt phase of his trial but was sidelined by the defendant during the penalty phase, when jurors decide whether a death sentence is appropriate. \u201cThere are plea agreements in a lot of cases,\u201d Mr. Bruck said. \u201cWhen there are, it\u2019s usually because the prosecution recognizes \u2014 and sometimes the larger community recognizes \u2014 that there are things to consider outside of just whether or not we can kill this person.\u201d\n\nFor defense lawyers seeking to spare their client\u2019s life, an appeal to efficiency is one of the few cards they can play \u2014 particularly when, as Mr. Finkelstein says, the \u201ccase is not a whodunit.\u201d\n\nExpecting that Mr. Satz will seek the death penalty, Mr. Finkelstein and his deputies are already preparing for a \u201clong, arduous legal battle\u201d and intend to concentrate on jury selection. Because juries must unanimously recommend death sentences in Florida, a single juror could prevent execution. Mr. Finkelstein said the defense would likely focus on mental health and the accumulation of failures by government agencies to stop Mr. Cruz from opening fire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMelisa McNeill, the assistant public defender who has appeared with Mr. Cruz in court and would likely be the lead lawyer if there is a trial, did not respond to a message on Friday.\n\nIn Florida, where 347 people are on death row after an execution on Thursday night, state law spells out a roster of aggravating factors and mitigating circumstances that jurors may consider in capital cases. Aggravating factors, at least one of which must be proven for someone to be eligible for a death sentence, include a finding that a defendant \u201cknowingly created a great risk of death to many persons\u201d or that a homicide was \u201ccommitted in a cold, calculated and premeditated manner.\u201d\n\nMitigating circumstances, like a defendant\u2019s age and whether he or she was under the \u201cinfluence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d at the time of the crime, can legally tilt jurors toward a punishment of life in prison.\n\nMr. Finkelstein made plain that he is dreading any trial here, and not just for legal reasons. In his dimly lit office, he raspily declared a hope that \u201cdivine intervention\u201d would persuade Mr. Satz to avoid a trial and an airing of the tragic details.\n\n\u201cThis is the most awful thing, not only that I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 that I\u2019ve even imagined in some sick movie or imagination. This was hell on earth,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s awful because of what was done to these poor kids. It\u2019s awful because of the families that will never be the same.

Although it is loosely based on the story of the famous 1841 classic, Mr. Khan updates the story to a world of migrant workers and powerful landlords.\n\nThe production, set to music by Vincenzo Lamagna, was an immediate success with both critics and the public, and recently returned for an equally applauded second run at Sadler\u2019s Wells Theater in London.\n\nPatricia Barretto, the president and chief executive of the Harris Theater, said that although she had not seen a live performance, she had been following the work\u2019s success online. \u201cI was enthralled by how stunning it was, with the melding of traditional kathak dance and ballet,\u201d Ms. Barretto said in a telephone interview. \u201cI felt we had to do it.\u201d", "title": "Akram Khan\u2019s \u2018Giselle\u2019 Coming to Chicago", "authors": []}

But he added: \u201cI think we needed a different voice, a younger voice, a connectivity voice between the manager and the players, with everybody. We have a lot of young guys, and the ability to connect even deeper than what we did in the past, in the clubhouse, I think is important.\u201d\n\nYoung managers are nothing new, even in Boston. Joe Cronin, a longtime player-manager, was 39 when he guided the Red Sox to the 1946 World Series. Dick Williams was 38 when he did so in 1967. Both are in the Hall of Fame. So is Tony La Russa, now a special assistant to Dombrowski, who will be available as a resource for Cora. (He also will have a veteran bench coach in Ron Roenicke, the former Milwaukee Brewers manager.)\n\nLa Russa got his first major league managing job at 34, with the 1979 Chicago White Sox. He survived, he said, by following the advice of a team executive, Paul Richards: \u201cTrust your gut and don\u2019t cover your butt.\u201d\n\nLa Russa said he believed in Cora, Boone and others in that mold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s high-profile and people are paying attention, so that\u2019s an obstacle to overcome,\u201d La Russa said. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve got an open mind and your instincts are good, that, to me, is why I would bet on these young guys, that they\u2019ll make it. Their gut, based on their experiences, is going to carry them, and they\u2019ll just get better and better.\u201d\n\nHinch saw progress in Cora throughout last season. At the start, he said, Cora was mainly a liaison to players, and helped with infield positioning. As the season went on, he expanded his role to revamp the Astros\u2019 base running and scout pitchers\u2019 tendencies. In the postseason, Hinch said, Cora was vital to his in-game decision-making.\n\n\u201cWhen you see him interact with players and you see the buy-in that he gets, it\u2019s very easy to see why he was a good teammate, and why he\u2019s beloved around the league,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cAnd he has such a great baseball mind, he\u2019s ahead of the inning the game is in. He can see all the things a manager would.\u201d\n\nThe task now is to hold off the Yankees in the division, and then try to unseat the Astros.

Some of these came through Birdsong, his Brooklyn-based anti-racist, queer-positive collective and micropress. In 2011 Mr. Pico became an inaugural fellow with Queer/Art/Mentors, an organization founded by the filmmaker Ira Sachs, and was paired with Pamela Sneed, a performance poet and activist. \u201cShe really helped me ferry the work from what had been mostly zines into something more polished,\u201d Mr. Pico said. \u201cShe also directly influenced my performance acumen.\u201d\n\nLatest Project In 2017, Mr. Pico started Food 4 Thot, a boisterous, intellectual and sometimes profane round-table podcast with three other gay writers: Fran Tirado, Joseph Osmundson and Dennis Norris II.

Without a job, he spent his days sleeping. I scoured the internet and took out stacks of books on depression from the library. I gave him numbers of mental health hotlines and contacts for support groups, which lay untouched on the counter. I cooked big-batch dinners, hoping he would eat \u2014 if not today, the next day while I was at work. I cleaned the house frequently, trying desperately to shake off the cobwebs of sadness.\n\nAs his world became smaller, so did mine. I spent evenings gently cajoling him to come with me to the gym, walk with me to the park. Please, I begged, just circle the block. Just step outside. But as hard as I tried, I couldn\u2019t make him do anything. He withdrew further and further, a cloudy film dimming his blue eyes.\n\nMy husband had always been my best friend, my primary confidant, my sounding board, and my greatest source of support.

It took me years to realize that regardless of whether or not my husband wants to share his story of mental illness, I need to share mine.\n\nToday, my husband is no longer depressed. He is open about his history of mental illness and he has challenged the stigma himself.

It\u2019s $10 round-trip for this makeshift ferry, which hauls its tiny load of camera-wielding tourists back and forth all day during official crossing hours. Once on shore it\u2019s up the hill by foot, burro, or bed of pickup truck to a trailer, where your passport is stamped and you\u2019re granted formal entry into Boquillas del Carmen, the colorful, sparsely settled remains of a former mining town.\n\nBorders are always porous, particularly the riverine kind, and so it goes for this one. \u201cMaps that split country into zones of topography, climate, vegetation, and such things have much more neatly sweeping lines of demarcation than nature has usually been willing to go along with,\u201d wrote John Graves, Texas\u2019s beloved chronicler of land and lore, and that goes for people too. For decades the Boquillas border crossing was decidedly informal, illegal but never monitored, a conduit for supplies, a lifeline for loved ones residing on opposite sides, a day\u2019s amusement for tourists. But it always was an international boundary and as such subject to the day\u2019s prevailing sociopolitical anxieties. The crossing was shut down in 2002, in response to Sept. 11, and reopened 11 years later, this time with automated passport control. And now looms another threat.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Boquillas proper, the specter of the wall seems to be just that, haunting the dish towels and koozies for sale on every corner, their hand-embroidered wildflowers, roosters, and javelinas accompanied, in slightly crooked letters, by a simple phrase: \u201cNo wall.\u201d A succinct \u201cTrump no bueno\u201d was all we got from a congenial gentleman who walked us into town, that and the declaration in small black letters on his white baseball cap: \u201cThe border makes America great\u201d (that message brought to you by El Paso\u2019s Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic congressman running against Senator Ted Cruz in November). The people here exhibit a sort of seen-it-all-before serenity, which seems appropriate, as this battle royal is going down a few miles from rock formations whose strata reveal the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, i.e., a visible record of the extinction event 66 million years ago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExistential musings aside, a visit to this village of a few hundred people feels much as it has for years. We perused the blankets and molcajetes at the shop at Jos\u00e9 Falcon\u2019s, then took a seat on the colorful patio of the adjoining restaurant for cheese enchiladas, clay copitas of sotol and sweeping views of the Sierra del Carmen range (and, incidentally, a fellow skinning rabbits and goats next door). The joy in a trip to Boquillas, other than its old-world charm, is the hospitality of the people, allowing a visitor brief proximity to the kind of community you\u2019d expect to find in a remote, only recently electrified town 150 miles away from the nearest city. At Boquillas Restaurant, the proprietor offered to give us the souvenirs we happily picked out before realizing we had run out of cash (had too many of the excellent margaritas).

In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.\n\nOver its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.\n\n\u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.\n\nIn part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.\n\nMr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.\n\nAnd its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.\n\nYet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.\n\nAn Amazon spokesman declined to comment.\n\nIt may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.\n\n\u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)\n\nThe reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.\n\nMr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days.

That has left American air power to pick up the slack.\n\nThe development is another major consequence of the fighting that has rapidly unfurled in recent weeks in Syria\u2019s tumultuous northwest.\n\nIt threatens not only to slow progress against several hundred Islamic State fighters who are hiding along the Euphrates River or in nearby deserts, but also could allow battle-hardened foreign fighters to escape deeper into western Syria and eventually into Turkey or Jordan \u2014 and possibly to return home to Europe or Africa to commit mayhem there, American commanders and analysts said.\n\nThousands of foreign fighters have already fled unfettered to the south and west through Syrian Army lines, these officials said.\n\n\u201cThe campaign to defeat the Islamic State is at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Cafarella, a senior intelligence planner with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. \u201cThe S.D.F. is unlikely to clear remaining ISIS-held areas of the Euphrates River and could even begin to take losses due to the shift in Syrian Kurds\u2019 main effort.\u201d ISIS is another name for the Islamic State.\n\nThe turn of events has the potential to upset a triumph that President Trump has held out as one of his administration\u2019s signature national security accomplishments so far.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cISIS land has been largely recaptured \u2014 almost 100 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said last week during a news conference with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. \u201cThey are on the run.\u201d\n\nYet senior Trump administration officials and American commanders have been watching, with growing trepidation, as Kurdish troops and commanders divert from the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nInitially, they sought to play down its significance. On Feb. 11, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the development \u201ca distraction\u201d and said it was \u201cnot a significant number right now.\u201d\n\nMaj. Gen. Jamie Jarrard, the Special Operations commander for the American-led coalition in Iraq and Syria, said in an interview in early February that the elimination of the entire caliphate was \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that disrupts us or takes our eye off that prize is not good,\u201d General Jarrard said.\n\nMr. Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, all have met with Turkish officials in recent days to seek an end to the clashes with Kurdish militia in northwest Syria and prevent the fighting from spreading.\n\nBut by last week, Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, acknowledged to reporters on Feb. 22 that \u201cwe can no longer fight ISIS the way that we would fully like to be able to do.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe diversion of Kurdish fighters and lower-level commanders, who play a pivotal role in directing battlefield operations against the Islamic State, has increased from a trickle to a torrent, according to five American military officials who are monitoring the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity. It is difficult to estimate precisely how many Kurdish fighters have withdrawn.\n\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces number about 50,000 Kurdish and Arab fighters throughout eastern and northern Syria, American military officials have said. Several thousand have been fighting the Islamic State in the Euphrates River Valley, with Arabs making up as much as 80 percent of that force, reflecting the demographics of the region.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut as they have elsewhere in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, the Kurds have taken on a disproportionate role in front line fighting and command skills, American officials said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As of two weeks ago, Kurdish officials said more than 20,000 Kurdish defenders had rallied to Afrin to confront Turkish troops. That number includes fighters who were already there, as well as newly arrived reinforcements.\n\n\u201cThe Turkish invasion to occupy Afrin has terribly influenced our fight against ISIS,\u201d Shahoz Hasan, co-president of the Syrian Democratic Union party, said in an interview on Monday. \u201cAfter we managed to get ISIS in a choke hold,\u201d he said the Turks \u201care attacking our forces in that region.\u201d\n\nFor many Kurdish militia and their commanders, the call to defend family and friends in Afrin and a Kurdish enclave in the city of Manbij that is also threatened by Turkish troops has taken precedence over what many consider to be an American war against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThose fighters find it more urgent to be in their areas on the Syrian-Turkish border rather than on the front lines with ISIS,\u201d said Arin Sheikhmos, a Kurdish journalist based in Qamishli. The city is the de facto capital of Kurdish areas of northern Syria, which the Kurds call Rojava.\n\n\u201cTo them, it is a priority to defend their land rather than liberating others\u2019 land,\u201d Mr. Sheikhmos said.\n\nThe American-led coalition appears to have intensified airstrikes on the Islamic State in areas east of the Euphrates River to fill the battlespace the Kurdish fighters had left, Mr. Sheikhmos said. The approach was not working, he said.\n\nHe said the Islamic State carried out a car bombing in Qamishli a few days ago, resulting in the deaths of four civilians, including a child. It was the first bombing in the city by ISIS in over a year, he said.\n\nShervan Derwish, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, said 250 Kurdish fighters had arrived in the ethnically mixed area in just the past few days. He said they came from Deir al-Zour, an Arab-majority city and former Islamic State stronghold in the Euphrates River Valley that is now contested by Russian-backed Syrian government soldiers and the American-backed Arab-Kurdish coalition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our fighters who joined the rest of S.D.F. on the front lines with ISIS in Deir al-Zour had to retreat to Manbij upon hearing the Turkish threats of attacking us here, doing ISIS a favor,\u201d Mr. Derwish said. The military council is a Kurdish-led component of the Syrian Democratic Forces in Manbij.\n\nAs late as Feb. 8, there were still S.D.F. forces in Deir al-Zour, according to the coalition, which bombed pro-Syrian regime forces who had attacked an S.D.F. base and its American advisers there. The airstrikes, it later turned out, killed dozens of Russian mercenaries in the process, American officials said.\n\nSome analysts, including Ms. Cafarella, have assessed that the Russian-backed attackers gave the Kurdish fighters safe transit to Afrin across government-controlled territory and exploited their departure to strike the less experienced Arab partners in the S.D.F.\n\nAgid Ahmed, commander of the Northern Sun battalion of the Manbij council, said he and his fighters were ordered to return from the front lines in Deir al-Zour on Feb. 6. That, in turn, freed up other S.D.F. fighters defending Manbij to reinforce Afrin. Mr. Ahmed fought with American forces in 10 offensives in northern and eastern Syria, including retaking of Raqqa from the Islamic State.\n\nSome of the S.D.F. and Manbij council leaders expressed disappointment with American forces for not preventing last month\u2019s Turkish attack on Afrin.\n\n\u201cAmericans on the ground do a good job and we learned a lot from them, data sharing, GPS techniques, but politically we\u2019re not very sure about them. Especially since the situation in Afrin,\u201d said Maher Al Ony, who has four Manbij council brigades \u2014 about 2,500 fighters \u2014 under his command. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the coalition would allow the Turks to attack Afrin.\u201d\n\nMuhammed Abu Adel, the Manbij council\u2019s top commander, insisted the commitment to fight the Islamic State remains strong, even as his forces have left Deir al-Zour.\n\n\u201cWe sacrificed thousands of lives of our soldiers, we sacrificed so many to finish ISIS,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now this, while fighting the most terrible terrorist group, and suddenly there is a state member of NATO come to fight you.\u201d", "title": "Amid Turkish Assault, Kurdish Forces Are Drawn Away From U.S. Fight With ISIS", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Rod Nordland"]}
{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "Even some of his top advisers sounded surprisingly passive this week on different issues. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said that Russia was already trying to interfere in the midterm congressional elections this year, but there was not much the United States could do to stop it. \u201cIf it\u2019s their intention to interfere, they are going to find ways to do that,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cWe can take steps we can take, but this is something that, once they decide they are going to do it, it\u2019s very difficult to pre-empt it.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who is in South Korea for the opening of the Olympics, likewise sounded relatively detached from the spending debate involving his former colleagues in Congress back home. Asked whether he had called any lawmakers, he said he had only talked with the White House unit that lobbies Congress. \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with the legislative office and the president and I have talked frequently,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cbut we\u2019re on standby as the vote approaches.\u201d\n\nOther presidents have discovered that there can be benefits from staying on standby. When President Bill Clinton assigned Hillary Clinton to lead an effort to pass universal health care, she and a task force crafted a highly detailed plan that died on Capitol Hill. The lesson that Mr. Clinton and his successors took from that is that sometimes it is better to set a broad goal but let Congress figure out how it wants to proceed. President George W. Bush did that with his No Child Left Behind education program and President Barack Obama did that with health care and some spending fights.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has proved a divisive force so that even his broad direction is now sometimes ignored. Just this week he declared that he wanted Congress to let the government shut down rather than pass spending measures if there were no agreement on immigration. But Senate leaders of both parties disregarded him altogether and drafted their own deal without immigration.\n\n\u201cThe other players in Washington, whether it\u2019s Congress or the Senate leadership, really have come to the conclusion: Let\u2019s ignore him, because we have things to do,\u201d said Maria Echaveste, a former deputy White House chief of staff under Mr. Clinton. \u201cThe budget deal is a perfect example of that. He\u2019s not constructive so they\u2019re ignoring him.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after reaching the budget deal with his Republican counterpart, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said he had learned to proceed without bothering with the president. \u201cOften times we can get a lot more done working with one another and let the White House just sit on the sidelines, because you don\u2019t know what their positions are,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s hands-off approach on the budget deal worked for him to the extent that it included the boost in military spending that he has been demanding, but it also included a large increase in domestic spending as well.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At one point during the campaign, Mr. Trump even promised to eliminate not just the annual deficit but the entire national debt accumulated over decades and now totaling more than $20 trillion. Instead, at this rate, he will pile up trillions of dollars of additional borrowing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservatives complained that he should have played a more active role in the negotiations to avoid that. \u201cI think it would have made a big difference if Trump had pushed hard for lower spending numbers, particularly if he had pushed a consistent message,\u201d said Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. He noted that Democrats backed down during the last government shutdown. \u201cThat would have given Trump power,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House was, again, not engaging on Friday. It held no news briefing and a spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the president\u2019s approach. But on Twitter, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for the spending increases in the budget deal. Even though Republicans control both chambers, they need Democratic votes to end filibusters in the Senate.\n\n\u201cWithout more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cSadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!\u201d\n\nStill, some Republicans said Mr. Trump may be most successful by setting the larger goals and then backing off. \u201cDifferent presidents have different interest levels in being in the weeds on policy details,\u201d said J. Scott Jennings, who was a special assistant to Mr. Bush and is now a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics. \u201cThis one, it seems to me, works best when he lays out broad priorities \u2014 more defense spending, cut taxes \u2014 and then allows the tacticians to engage and make it so.\u201d\n\nAfter a fractious first year between Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, Mr. Jennings said the president seemed to have finally found traction in the relationship, trusting the leader to manage legislative strategy. \u201cOnce they found their groove, things started working,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump\u2019s job approval has gone up, the numbers on the economy have improved and the generic ballot has begun to shrink.\u201d\n\nStill, there is the danger of looking as if he is too removed. He did not sound particularly aggressive about domestic violence after his staff secretary, Rob Porter, was accused of physically abusing two former wives and resigned. Instead, his only public comment was to praise Mr. Porter and express sadness for him. In private, advisers said Mr. Trump was angry both that he had not been informed earlier about the allegations and that he had not been consulted on the initial White House response.\n\nHe likewise remained generally quiet about the tumble of the stock market, which has now reached an official correction, after lauding its increases for a year. Critics said he could not have it both ways, claiming credit when share prices rise while avoiding blame when they fall.\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans said Congress is dysfunctional enough without Mr. Trump getting involved. \u201cI am absolutely convinced that at this point in time the best thing for everyone involved is for this president to stay as far away as possible,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former top Democratic aide in the Senate. \u201cThe last thing this chaotic institution needs is for him to wreak more havoc by getting involved.\u201d\n\nThe one exception, he added, would be immigration, where Mr. Trump should play more of a role. \u201cThe issue is so toxic,\u201d he said, \u201cthat they\u2019re never going to get anything done unless he leans in and gives some cover to the Republicans.\u201d", "title": "Amid Turmoil From Washington to Wall Street, a Surprisingly Passive President", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

I actually didn\u2019t intend for \u201cBattle Hymn\u201d to be a parenting book either. I had totally different hopes for the book. I\u2019ve always loved books with wacky unreliable narrators.

And it will be his first ever aimed largely at a worldwide audience.\n\nUntil recently, Mr. Mergia, 71, was hardly known outside of his home country, where he is seen as a musical pioneer. For most of the past 20 years, he has lived in the Washington area and driven a taxi, picking up passengers at Dulles Airport and toting an electric keyboard in his trunk. He still drives the cab for extra cash. In idle moments, he hauls out the keyboard and sits alone in the back seat, his eyes closed, improvising.\n\nMr. Mergia had long given up performing publicly when the 2013 reissue of \u201cHailu Mergia and His Classical Instrument,\u201d a mostly forgotten gem from 1985, turned him into a cult celebrity among music obsessives across the globe, and set him off on tours of the United States and Europe. He has kept up a consistent schedule of international performances ever since.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, Mr. Mergia sat in an easy chair at his home here, describing how he relates to the audience he\u2019s garnered in the past few years. \u201cThe idea of \u2018Lala Belu\u2019 is, it\u2019s a composition you can sing with everybody,\u201d he said, referring to the new album\u2019s title track. \u201cIt\u2019s simple.

In the 1960s and \u201970s he led the Walias Band, one of the country\u2019s best-known groups and a guiding force in Addis Ababa\u2019s freshly invigorated music scene. The Walias Band welded the slanted minor modes and hovering grooves of Ethiopian music onto a wriggling, electrified sound. In it you could hear the funk of the Meters, the Afro-Latin rock of Santana, the Afrobeat blowing over from Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe band graduated from Addis Ababa nightclubs to a coveted residency at the city\u2019s Hilton, which it held for roughly 10 years. In 1977 it recorded \u201cTche Belew,\u201d an album that became an Ethiopian classic. But the band broke up in the early 1980s, at the end of its only international tour, and Mr. Mergia settled in the Washington area, home to the world\u2019s largest expatriate Ethiopian community.

Money that should have gone to hospitals and medicine has been spent on futile confrontation with Israel and digging tunnels that the Israelis are now spending a small fortune to block.\n\nBut holding two million people hostage is not the way to fight Hamas, and the suffering only nurtures more rage and militancy.

When Mr. Rosenstein recognized Mr. Dozier and saw him heading toward a bathroom, he followed him inside, figuring Chief Illiniwek might also be there.\n\n\u201cI was done with the urinal, headed over to the sink, and at some point I look up and there\u2019s Jay Rosenstein at the end of the bathroom with his camera rolling,\u201d Mr. Dozier said in an interview.\n\nThey argued.

He said he wanted to see if university employees were helping the chief to appear at the basketball game, which, he said, would be \u201ca very big story.\u201d\n\nThe incident has added fuel to a larger fight that seems far from over. Mr. Rosenstein was placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation, prompting dueling calls for him to be fired and to be reinstated. Chief Illiniwek supporters touted plans to \u201cstand together and show how many of us there really are\u201d at a basketball game later this month.\n\n\u201cThere will be some discourse at that event,\u201d said Raneem Shamseldin, the student body president, who helped organize the protest of the chief during the homecoming parade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a threat. That is a promise.\u201d\n\nThough changing a Native American nickname or mascot almost always sets off debate, some institutions move on. At the University of Louisiana at Monroe, where sports teams known as the Indians were renamed as the Warhawks more than a decade ago, the issue long ago faded from the headlines. Lisa Miller, an administrator, said the new name was popular and that some current students might even be unaware of the old one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult for a university to have a mascot that you can\u2019t 100 percent embrace,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cYou\u2019re always being cautious about doing things that may be offensive to others.\u201d\n\nSuzan Shown Harjo, a Native American activist who has sought to get such nicknames and mascots changed all over the country, said Illinois might have had more success if it had picked a replacement mascot and dropped its nickname: the Fighting Illini. Instead, there is no official mascot. The team logo, once an image of the chief\u2019s face, is now an orange letter \u201cI.\u201d\n\nShe said the Cleveland Indians should also have gone further by changing the team name instead of just removing Chief Wahoo from uniforms.\n\nHere in Illinois, the chief\u2019s vehement opponents and steadfast defenders seem to agree on one thing: They believe the university\u2019s leaders have repeatedly failed to act decisively on Chief Illiniwek, making matters worse. A university spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for an interview with an administrator.\n\nMr. Dozier, the former Chief Illiniwek, said everyone ought to be able to air their views more openly on campus.

And the future is, well, the future. And since the people, events and objects of our little histories are never commonly agreed upon \u2014 I saw it one way, you saw it another \u2014 the past becomes endlessly interesting, as changeable and unnerving as any work of art. Perhaps childhood never leaves us because we were pure artists then, unfettered by much personal history. Childhood fascinates Banville because it\u2019s \u201ca state of constantly recurring astonishment.\u201d When the astonishment ebbs, the past clouds over into itself. \u201cThe process of growing up,\u201d he writes, \u201cis, sadly, a process of turning the mysterious into the mundane.\u201d Only when the adult artist revives it are we excited at the prospect of what is long behind us.\n\nYet memory is oddly selective. \u201cI recall so many trivial things,\u201d Banville proclaims, \u201cand forget so many very momentous ones.\u201d In memory, the seemingly insignificant becomes so insistently prominent, who can tell if we have any idea of what is really important? One of the points of Bruegel\u2019s\u201cLandscape With the Fall of Icarus,\u201d perhaps the main one (pace Auden), is that the ordinary townspeople who ignore the divine hotshot\u2019s spectacular plunge are also suffering. To Banville, an apostle of the ordinary, the deep appeal of city life is that here the ordinary may be made magical.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis book is about the past, and about people worth bringing back. Not just the members of his family but figures like the kind and sympathetic assistant librarian Miss Flushing, \u201cwith her magnificent conical breasts poking against a pale-blue angora jumper.\u201d And, most movingly, the actor Micheal MacLiammoir, who, along with his partner, Hilton Edwards, a theater impresario, founded the Gate Theater, where Orson Welles got his start. The two men went about as \u201cthe most prominent, not to say the most flagrant, representatives of the homosexual life of Dublin.\u201d The city, Banville says, was unusually accepting of gays, and MacLiammoir and Edwards were beloved public figures. In an age like ours, when the streets are paved with eggshells, Banville does something that\u2019s both touching and embracing \u2014 especially with MacLiammoir, who never went out in public without wearing \u201cmakeup and a black wig that glistened like wet coal.\u201d He shows the actor\u2019s brilliance and wit within his gayness, not apart from it.\n\nOf all the people Banville has given us, Cicero, though omnipresent, exhibits the least personality. He is introduced as a sort of scholar-about-town, with his little car and his arcane knowledge of the city. There\u2019s not enough of him to suggest any personal importance to the author, so it\u2019s possible that he\u2019s merely a handy means of delivering information. Yet just when one begins to suspect that Cicero doesn\u2019t exist at all, who shows up in a photograph toward the end of the book but Cicero \u2014 seen from the back, sitting next to Banville on the driver\u2019s side of the two-seater, parked at a beach and aimed at the sea. Then again, it might be a dog in a sweater. Is Banville playing with us? I mean, who outside ancient Rome is called Cicero? It says a lot about Banville\u2019s ability to hold our attention that we accept his companion for whatever or whoever he is. Or if he is.\n\nPhoto\n\nPity the fool who\u2019s reading this book to get a clear and orderly picture of Dublin. But oh, what a topographical map has been drawn by Paul Joyce\u2019s evocative photographs and Banville\u2019s observant eye. Like Max Morden in his Man Booker Prize-winning novel, \u201cThe Sea,\u201dBanville remains willfully and gloriously disorganized. The tour he takes us on, while offering a handful of interesting facts about Dublin, is more about moods and states of mind and how they shape, even create, the so-called real world. \u201cI have never in my life paid much attention to my surroundings,\u201d Banville writes, alert, in the way of Joyce, not to what people do but rather to \u201cwhat they are.\u201d As he puts it, \u201cArt is a constant effort to strike past the mere daily doings of humankind in order to arrive at \u2026 the essence of what it is, simply, to be.\u201d\n\nSo, like the more thoughtful Romantics, Banville sees into the life of things. Autumn, he concludes, is more expectant than spring because the \u201cstealthy tumult of the dying season\u201d causes it to tremble with love. A fringe of gray curls on the head of a nearly bald man looks like \u201ca fallen-down halo.\u201d Standing by the canal at Lower Mount Street Bridge, he watches a heron, \u201cawe-struck by the clean sharp dangerous lines of the thing.\u201d (He makes \u201cthing,\u201d that most unmoored of words, sound precise.) On a May morning, \u201cthe pale sky shines and shimmers like the inner skin of a vast soap bubble.\u201d He recalls Stephanie, an alluring young woman whom he spotted when he too was young. She was \u201cslight, with an almost boyish figure,\u201d and her long dark hair was parted in the middle. It was love at first sight \u2014 his, alas, not hers. Years later, when he meets her again, his swain\u2019s heart gives an \u201canguished quack.\u201d And once again he feels \u201cthe unutterable enormity of love pressing hotly behind one\u2019s breastbone like a hot lump of lead.\u201d\n\nBanville\u2019s soarings, like a hawk\u2019s, are both wild and comprehensive, taking in everything and imagining more. One can\u2019t distinguish his descriptions from the things described, the dancer from the dance. See how he gives us the Great Palm House of the Botanic Gardens with its walkways \u201chigh above our heads, among the upflung fronds, narrow, perforated metal platforms that must surely lead to diving boards.\u201d One \u201cwould not be surprised should there come a sudden splash followed by a swimmer streaking down in an arc and skimming past us, making fish-mouths with his hands \u2014 his palms! \u2014 pressed together above his head.\u201d In that same Palm House, the philosopher Wittgenstein is commemorated by a plaque for the time he lived in Dublin in the 1940s. Banville cites him on several occasions in \u201cTime Pieces.\u201d Wittgenstein believed that language isn\u2019t separate from reality.\n\nThe better memoirs tend not to be principally about the suffering of the author but rather about what the author has noticed in his or her life, what is cherished or abhorred \u2014 often about pure information worth imparting. The better memoirs are the more generous, looking outside the self.

Within the limits of The Times\u2019s strict rules and sometimes stiff house writing style, she managed to impart some flavor to her coverage.\n\nIn reporting on an outdoor swim meet in Manhattan Beach in 1935, she wrote, \u201cIt was not a water hazard but a mental hazard that Miss Rawls had to face in the medley race.

No one sent Vinson to write about a glamorous event like a bowl game, a prize fight or the World Series (although Carroll says she often attended such events with her male colleagues).

On Jan. 13, 1936, she reported a squash story from the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan. On the 15th, she sailed for Germany and the Winter Olympics on the liner Washington. (It was an era when boat sailings were big news.

On Feb. 22, Paul Jacobs, himself a grand New York institution, will play concertos by Poulenc, Christopher Rouse and Mr. Wachner, who will also conduct Novus NY, Trinity\u2019s contemporary-music ensemble.\n\nAs Lower Manhattan grows ever more residential, Trinity has become more intimately entwined with the life of its neighborhood.

But its contents were coated with dust, grime and debris, and in the case of the Schlicker organ, with its intricate inner workings and its use of degradable materials, like leather, the damage proved disabling.\n\nThough slightly farther from ground zero, the Aeolian Skinner organ in Trinity Church, dating from 1923, suffered similar damage, and it lay idle and dismantled for several years as the church awaited an insurance settlement. Finally, realizing that reconstruction or the manufacture of a new pipe organ could take another five years, Trinity Wall Street, which was in constant use, arrived at a radical solution: the manufacture of a new digital instrument by Marshall & Ogletree, with sampled sound reproduced by ranks of large speakers, 74 in all, hidden behind dummy pipes in the choir loft. The instrument was developed quickly, at a cost of $300,000.\n\nElectronic organs have been slow to gain respect from pipe organ enthusiasts. The sound emerging from speakers can be tacky, flat and superficial, and typically lacks the gut-wrenching impact of the roar that mighty pipes can produce. Avi Stein, the associate organist and chorus master at Trinity Wall Street, allows that the Marshall & Ogletree \u201cfakes a pipe organ very well\u201d but adds that it \u201clacks some of the tangible singing quality that turns a machine into a work of art.\u201d He agreed with Mr. Wachner that playing the instrument is, in a way, like listening to a recording.", "title": "An Organ \u2014 and Soon Another \u2014 Lands on Broadway", "authors": []}

I recently spoke with him about how the film has helped shift his lifelong grief, and his hope that other transgender people will be more accepted as a result of his nomination. Here are excerpts from our phone chat this month.\n\nWhat kind of feedback are you getting to the film?\n\nI\u2019m hearing from people who were former students of my mother at Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York in the \u201970s and \u201980s [where she was the principal], and from school at Rikers [where she started a school for women]. I\u2019m hearing from people who were friends of my brother in high school who didn\u2019t realize he was dead. Friends of mine from elementary school and high school.\n\nNetflix opened the door for the rest of the world to see the movie. It just so happened the rest of the world includes people who have written to say my mother changed their lives.

It does take the pressure off me in a way. I definitely feel like I\u2019m more present than the 1992 Yance or the 2012 Yance, when I walked away from a very stable job into what felt like a great unknown. Being out as a trans man isn\u2019t new in my personal life, but it\u2019s new in the public sphere. I started part of my transition before the film was complete, and now I\u2019m further along in my transition. I\u2019m also more comfortable in my skin.

I\u2019m taking Yance to everything, prom, this thing, that thing.\u201d It reaffirms that my brother saw me for who I was. I can with this nomination remind people that trans people in general and trans people of color in particular are subject to violence at higher rates than most any other group. There was just an article about how trans women feel targeted by the N.Y.P.D., and were assumed to be engaged in sex work. If my nomination helps people at all think about the transgender folks in their lives, in their communities, and treating them as humans and equals deserving of protection, I\u2019m happy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The former district attorney faces charges of trying to derail a federal investigation.] I haven\u2019t heard a peep, and I honestly didn\u2019t expect to. One thing I learned in making the film is that the people involved think they asked all the questions. They think they\u2019re right. This is what happens with not having a mechanism for review of the grand jury system, when you have a system that assumes every decision is correct, that doesn\u2019t include a mechanism for review no matter how many studies reveal racial bias.\n\nDoes the film\u2019s release and success ease the weight of your grief, or change it at all?\n\nGrief for me is a moment-to-moment experience. I wish my parents were here to see it. I wish my mother were here to see this because she participated in the film. I have a lot of surrogate parents, but there\u2019s no one like your mother.

Authorities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have already been ramping up their scrutiny of Chinese deals.\n\nAny slackening in the pace of buying could cool deal making and disappoint investors who have reaped windfalls thanks to profligate Chinese spenders.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese money has helped drive up the prices of real estate, oil fields, hotels and just about any other asset that big companies buy and sell. The purchases have included the strategic (global agribusinesses and energy companies) and the prosaic (movie theaters and video games). Anbang\u2019s corporate empire includes major financial firms in South Korea and the Netherlands, as well as properties worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe buying binge could not last. Many of China\u2019s deals in recent years depended on cheap money, and Chinese officials have become increasingly nervous about debt. China borrowed heavily to fuel a decade of growth, accumulating trillions of dollars of debt that put it on a level comparable to the United States, relative to overall size of the two countries\u2019 economies.\n\nChinese officials appeared reluctant to pare back at the risk of curbing growth and provoking unrest \u2014 until now at least.

Begun as a modest car insurance company in 2004, it used cheap debt and financial engineering \u2014 sometimes borrowing directly from individuals with promises of big returns \u2014 to build a juggernaut in just a few years. Risk may have built Mr. Wu\u2019s empire, but it also led to the company\u2019s downfall.\n\nAnbang has personified a freewheeling type of Chinese deal maker like Dalian Wanda Group, Fosun International and HNA Group. The push appeared to enjoy official approval initially. Mr. Xi stayed at the Waldorf Astoria during a stop in New York three years ago.\n\nNow, under official pressure, many of the companies \u2014 a group referred to as the \u201cgray rhinoceroses,\u201d big problems that are ignored until they start moving fast \u2014 are unloading assets. Dalian Wanda last year shed billions of dollars worth of property investments. HNA is paring properties amid analysts\u2019 questions about how it will meet its heavy debt obligations.\n\nAs official skepticism of Anbang grew, so did public skepticism.\n\nA month ago, a lacerating commentary entitled \u201cGoodbye Anbang\u201d spread widely on Chinese financial news websites and on social media platforms. \u201cThe biggest problem here is not the pursuit of profit by capital, it\u2019s how you were able to grow so fat overnight,\u201d said the commentary. \u201cThis is not playing by the market rules. It\u2019s the scams of privileged wealth.\u201d\n\nBut many Chinese regulators had been hesitant to act aggressively, and the pace of enforcing discipline had been slow. With Anbang, the Chinese government may have hoped to set an example, by seizing control rather than engineering a quiet injection of cash from a pliant state company.\n\n\u201cXi\u2019s concern about financial risk has had a lot of impact on the behavior of a lot of banks, regulators and companies,\u201d said Victor Shih, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies Chinese politics and finance. \u201cYou have seen the regulators being very cautious, and being maybe more pre-emptive than they would have been without this political pressure from the highest levels.\u201d\n\nDespite the government pressure, Chinese deal making is unlikely to completely end, given the country\u2019s vast sums of money and global ambitions. China has continued to support acquisitions in strategic areas like energy and technology. Fosun, widely considered a \u201cgray rhino,\u201d or a large and visible problem that is ignored until it starts moving fast, said this week it had acquired a majority stake in Lanvin, the French fashion house.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina\u2019s ambitions, though, are likely to attract renewed scrutiny. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have been asking tough questions about the ownership and stability of acquisitive Chinese companies. Some lawmakers and White House officials support broadening the authority of regulators who review takeover offers.\n\n\u201cAnyone who knows anything about China knows the nature of the party and state and the opacity of company ownership,\u201d said Fraser Howie, a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. \u201cThere was never any excuse for not asking the difficult questions. A lot of foreign regulators just skipped over them and were far too relaxed in their approach.\u201d\n\nMore than $4 billion worth of deals by Dalian Wanda, HNA and Fosun, including some in China, await approval, according to Dealogic, a data provider.\n\nIt is not clear what will happen to Anbang\u2019s overseas properties, including the Waldorf Astoria, which is undergoing an expensive renovation. Anbang spent $15 billion on high-profile overseas deals from 2009 to 2017, according to Dealogic. The acquisitions included well-known hotels in London, Manhattan, Mexico and Paris; insurance companies in South Korea and the Netherlands; and even a stake in Woori Bank, once among South Korea\u2019s largest lenders. Woori could not be reached for comment.\n\nOne of the companies snapped up in the spree is Vivat, a Dutch insurer that Anbang bought from the Dutch government for 150 million euros in 2015. As part of the deal, Anbang pledged to pump up to 1 billion euros into Vivat and to take on 552 million euros of debt, a move hailed by Chinese media at the time as a heroic step toward bringing the insurer back from the brink of bankruptcy.

And why camels?\n\nMore Reporting on Archaeology\n\nDr. Charloux suspects the engravers were influenced by Nabatean art, which came from an ancient nomadic people in the area, as well as the Parthians from what is now Iran. The Camel Site, he said, may have served as a border that signaled the edge of the Nabatean territory. It also could have been a rest stop for caravans crossing the desert to trade, or a spot to worship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Charloux said based on its similarities to other works, it most likely dated to about 2,000 years ago. But the site is currently on private land that has been damaged by bulldozers, and it is difficult to scientifically date.\n\nLaila Nehme, an archaeologist also from the French National Center for Scientific Research but not involved in the paper, said the work was unique because it was carved in relief, but added that she wasn\u2019t ready to associate the work with the Nabateans or any other group in the region.\n\nPeter Magee, an archaeologist from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania said the finding shows the ingenuity of those who lived in ancient Arabia.

And his belief in the natural world\u2019s transcendence, Mr. Cole said, linked him to Thoreau and Emerson.\n\n\u201cWhat defines his work,\u201d Mr. Cole said in a telephone interview, \u201cis that it is not only attentive to the forms of the natural world, but all his subjects seem to be alive. Even his plants seem to be pulsating.\u201d\n\nMr. Harvey, who died on Feb. 6 at 76 in Wilmington, produced one last sculpture about a year and a half ago: an oversize study of a daddy longlegs spider. On his website, where he described his sculptures, he wrote, \u201cEarly daddy longleg encounters stick in our brain and remain so embedded that, as adults, we can time-travel the long, dusty road back to our childhood.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHis wife, the former Roberta Rush, said the cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nMr. Harvey\u2019s wildlife models included a group of pigs at the New Bolton Center School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Kennett Square, where Ms. Harvey was a laboratory technician. He plied the pigs with corn so that they would be accustomed to his presence in their pen. One especially friendly sow routinely sat near Mr. Harvey and his portable sculpting table as if she were a paid model.\n\nThat cooperative pig inspired the creation of \u201cPortrait Sitter,\u201d a tabletop 15-pound sculpture. It was followed by \u201cHelen,\u201d another sitting pig that weighed in at 400 pounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for some of my larger subjects to take over a year to make,\u201d Mr. Harvey told the website Town Square Delaware in 2011. \u201cI guess the reason I study my subjects so closely for so long is I want to capture more than their look. I want to get their more elusive feel. To me, that is when a sculpture is successful, be it animal, human or object.\u201d\n\nMr. Harvey produced limited editions of all his sculptures. One of his 25 \u201cHelens\u201d was stolen from the front of the Brandywine River Museum of Art in Chadds Ford, Pa., in 1995. \u201cWe were afraid that it might have ended up in the Brandywine,\u201d Ms. Harvey recalled in a telephone interview. \u201cAndr\u00e9 said, \u2018I\u2019ll bet it was a bunch of drunk kids.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe statue was rescued from a nearby barn several days later, and Pennsylvania state police arrested three teenagers.

His father, Edmund, was a conservationist who founded Delaware Wild Lands, a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the state\u2019s land and water resources. His mother, the former Jeanne Bright, was a homemaker.\n\nMr. Harvey\u2019s rural upbringing near a creek provided some inspiration for his art: A farmhouse on his family\u2019s property had a cow and chickens, and he and his brother Rusty enjoyed playing with snakes.\n\nYears later, Rusty brought his pet raccoon to his brother\u2019s studio as a model for a sculpture of a raccoon with a fish in its mouth.\n\nMr. Harvey did not study art in high school. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in English at the University of Virginia, became a writer for Scholastic magazines and later taught at two schools in Delaware.\n\nPhoto\n\nLooking to change their lives, the Harveys took off for Europe and Morocco in 1969.

She smiled, waved and beckoned the rank and file to help her guide the party and the country.\n\nIt was familiar stagecraft, except for one thing: The woman basking in praise from the Christian Democratic Union was not Angela Merkel but the politician seen as her chosen heir apparent, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. Dubbed \u201cmini-Merkel\u201d by the German news media, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer was elected general secretary of the governing party, a post once occupied by the chancellor herself, and one considered a potential steppingstone to becoming chancellor.\n\nLong criticized for not grooming successors during 12 years in power, Ms. Merkel seems to have embraced the task after an election in which her party bled voters to both the liberal Free Democrats and the far-right Alternative for Germany. In tapping Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, she found a candidate widely seen as having the mix of liberalism and conservatism to unite a restive party base.\n\nEven as the chancellor works to patch together another governing coalition, which party delegates approved on Monday, the ascension of possible successors offers the latest sign that the Merkel era is approaching its end.

Following the 2007-08 financial crisis, Mr. Sch\u00e4uble became the face of the German-led austerity policies imposed on debtor countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal and, especially, Greece. Even as the Obama administration and an array of economists called for looser policies, the Germans held firm.\n\nBeyond economics, Ms. Merkel has been the rock of European foreign policy, demanding a tough line on maintaining economic sanctions against Russia after the conflict in Ukraine while other European countries were far less enthusiastic.\n\nAnd it has been Ms. Merkel who has pointedly stood up to President Trump, to the cheers of many Europeans and others who have embraced her as a defender of the liberal order.\n\nBut now the political landscape has shifted, not only in Germany, but also elsewhere in Europe.\n\nThe rise of Mr. Macron in France, if celebrated by those who support a stronger European Union, is also being interpreted as a rebalancing of power away from Berlin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut France still needs Germany, not least to help bridge a growing rift between east and west on the Continent.

Not all of Mr. Macron\u2019s most prominent proposals, like a European finance minister, are featured in the coalition document.\n\nBut Germany will increase its contribution to the European Union budget, the paper pledges. And it will cooperate with Europe on defense and migration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time that Europe is the first chapter in a German coalition treaty,\u201d said Henrik Enderlein of the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. \u201cThis is a clear signal that the government wants to work with President Macron on reforming and strengthening Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the open-to-closed spectrum, this was a signal for openness,\u201d he added.\n\nBut unlike in France, where Mr. Macron ran on a transparently pro-European platform, campaigning with a European flag and playing the European anthem on election night, Europe hardly featured on the German campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that this was never tested in a real election,\u201d Mr. Leonard said.\n\nAlternative for Germany immediately dismissed Wednesday\u2019s deal as proof that Europe\u2019s elites were ignoring the concerns of ordinary voters once again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOne wonders, why Mr. Macron doesn\u2019t just move into the Chancellery,\u201d scoffed Alexander Gauland, a former member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives who became a lawmaker for Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD. Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives, he said, had betrayed their values and become \u201can empty shell.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the Interior Ministry\u2019s portfolio was broadened to include a \u201cheimat\u201d \u2014 homeland \u2014 department to address issues of identity and integration did nothing to appease the AfD. Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, a well-known far-right firebrand in the party, called the coalition deal \u201cun-German.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday afternoon, a tired-looking Ms. Merkel praised the deal as the \u201cbasis of a good and stable government, which our country needs, and which many around the world expect from us.\u201d\n\nFor many, the coalition deal represented a bittersweet success, a sort of short-term fix with potentially steep political costs: a backlash in the making that could push ever more voters to the extremes.\n\nIn the two years since Ms. Merkel opened Germany\u2019s door to more than a million migrants, the country\u2019s political landscape has changed drastically, and much of the chancellor\u2019s ability to forge consensus has eroded.\n\nAll three parties now returning to government had their worst election results since the 1940s.\n\n\u201cThe Merkel era is synonymous with a strong and stable Germany; that\u2019s what we had for the last decade,\u201d Mr. Enderlein said. \u201cThat era is coming to an end. And we don\u2019t yet know what comes after.\u201d\n\nThere is no guarantee that this coalition will last a full term, he said. There is not even a guarantee that it will happen: The unhappy grass roots of the Social Democratic Party still need to approve it by postal ballot and many balk at the thought.\n\nTwo stints as Ms. Merkel\u2019s junior partners saw the party\u2019s vote share slump from 34 percent in 2005 to 20 percent in September. Recent polls give it 17 percent support, just two percentage points more than the AfD. Some worry that another four years in a coalition could see the AfD overtake the Social Democrats.\n\nBut the alternative may be no better: If the coalition collapses and Germany is forced to call a snap election, the extremes will benefit \u2014 both inside and outside the main parties, analysts predict.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is the worst possible outcome,\u201d said Mr. Leonard of the European Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cexcept for all the other ones.\u201d", "title": "Angela Merkel Strikes New Deal With Old Partners, at a High Cost", "authors": ["Katrin Bennhold"]}

We may have hit it \u2014 we don\u2019t know. But if we did, it\u2019s because of them.\u201d\n\nStill, veterans of both sides said the fundamental dynamics of Washington have not changed. If President Barack Obama could not pass gun control in a Democratic-majority Senate in 2013, months after Sandy Hook, they said, it was unlikely that Mr. Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress would.\n\nThe N.R.A. remains as potent as ever, and the debate resumes as Republicans head into a primary election season when many worry about challenges from the right. In December, the House passed a bill to bolster criminal background checks before gun purchases, but Republicans paired it with a provision requiring states to allow anyone to carry a concealed weapon if they are allowed to carry one in their home state, essentially making it a national right, anathema to Democrats, who have their own liberal base to satisfy.\n\nGun rights advocates also plan to focus on the failure of the F.B.I. to pursue tips about the suspected Florida gunman, arguing that blame should be on the federal authorities, not the firearms.", "title": "Another Shooting, Another Gun Debate.

The law\u2019s individual mandate, the rule that anyone who can afford insurance must obtain it or pay a penalty, was effectively repealed in last year\u2019s tax bill. A few weeks ago, Congress suspended or postponed enactment of several unloved taxes raised by the bill, including one on expensive employer health plans.\n\nThis week, Congress did away with another unpopular provision: the law\u2019s Independent Payment Advisory Board. The IPAB, which has been unfairly labeled a rationing board or \u201cdeath panel,\u201d was designed to help tame runaway Medicare costs, should they ever arise. (The legislation explicitly precluded rationing, and the board would have had no authority about any individual\u2019s health care choices.

Medicare spending has grown at record-low rates in the years since the bill passed, meaning that its use has never been triggered. (The trend of low Medicare spending growth is so profound, and so mysterious, that we put it on a mug.)

The plight of those immigrants was walled off from the spending agreement and will now be the subject of a coming Senate floor debate, with the outcome highly uncertain.\n\nThe final two-year deal that must be approved by the House and Senate delivered tangible benefits to both sides while easing tight spending restrictions instituted when Republicans were insisting on austerity for the Obama administration.

When Mr. Schumer assumed power after the 2016 elections, he told Mr. McConnell he wanted a better, more candid relationship and the two, while attacking each other on the floor, have managed to cooperate behind the scenes.\n\nBut the recent shutdown tested their ability to work together, and Mr. McConnell still remembers a couple of Schumer slights \u2014 a 2008 campaign ad against him that the Republican leader considered unfair, as well as Mr. Schumer\u2019s decision last year to vote against Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, for secretary of transportation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Schumer acknowledged that relations had been antagonistic given the go-it-alone Republican push on health care and the tax law and differences on immigration.\n\n\u201cWe had serious disagreements, but instead of just going to our separate corners, we came together,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. For his part, Mr. McConnell thanked his counterpart for the \u201cproductive discussions that generated this proposal.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the spending increases, Democrats said that Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to allow an open immigration debate without putting his thumb on the scale for a particular proposal at the start also helped seal the deal with Mr. Schumer.\n\nAfter the debilitating partisanship of recent months, the breakthrough was a relief to some lawmakers who credited the two men with coming to a resolution.\n\n\u201cHats off to Senators McConnell and Schumer for working toward this agreement,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.\n\nOthers weren\u2019t so pleased by the new comity. Some conservatives in the House and Senate will no doubt oppose it, and Democrats unhappy that immigration policy was left out \u2014 including Ms. Pelosi, who occupied the House floor for hours Wednesday \u2014 were also balking at the deal. But it was drawing broad support from other factions, including Republicans on the Armed Services Committees in the House and Senate, Mr. Ryan, the Pentagon and the White House.\n\nThe agreement was reminiscent of an initial spending compromise struck in the spring when lawmakers cut a deal among themselves and for the most part cut the White House out of the process.\n\nGiven the breadth of the agreement, it would essentially clear the decks for Congress this year once underlying spending bills are put forward. The midterm implications were obvious as Mr. Schumer, in outlining the proposal on the floor, credited multiple Democratic senators facing potentially tough re-elections for their efforts while Mr. McConnell promoted the benefits for the military and national security.\n\nThe two parties will still fight it out in midterm elections that will determine control of Congress as well as the future ability of the Trump administration to enact its agenda. But passage of the budget agreement means Republicans and Democrats could have the opportunity to square off over substantive differences rather than just defending themselves against charges of Washington dysfunction underscored by regular threats of government shutdowns.", "title": "Antagonists Days Ago, McConnell and Schumer Find Common Cause", "authors": ["Carl Hulse", "On Washington"]}

The decrease in assaults was \u201cthe one piece of good news in this report,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said.\n\nFor the first time in at least a decade, incidents were reported in all 50 states. And, unusually, K-12 schools had more reports than any other location. (Typically, public areas have the most.)

The company\u2019s average revenue per European user in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.86, well below the $26.76 that Facebook rakes in per user in the United States and Canada.\n\nFacebook should be able to move that European number a lot higher in the coming years. Europe\u2019s economy is only a bit smaller than the United States\u2019, and the Continent contains prosperous nations whose citizens are just as addicted to social media as Americans. Indeed, Facebook has more daily active users in Europe than in the United States and Canada (277 million versus 184 million.) What is more, total European daily active users grew in the fourth quarter, while the United States and Canada number edged lower.\n\nAll this helps explain why the growth in European revenue per user, at nearly 50 percent in the fourth quarter versus the year-earlier period, is significantly higher than the 35 percent rate for the United States and Canada.\n\nWhat does this mean for Facebook as European countries introduce measures aimed at protecting their citizens that may go beyond what the company is used to in the United States?\n\nGiven how lucrative Europe is and will be to Facebook, it may be willing to spend what it takes to comply with new regulations, and even tolerate any inefficiencies the rules impose on its advertising business. Indeed, Facebook itself says it wants to make its network safer for users and democracies. But if there is any slip in that stance, Europe\u2019s leaders, seeing how important their countries are to Facebook\u2019s bottom line, arguably have considerable leverage to respond.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s slump continues.\n\nIts price on Thursday: $8,915\n\nIts all-time high hit on Dec. 18: $19,511.\n\nThat\u2019s more than a 50 percent slide, and it marks it lowest price since November.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subpoenaed the company, whose Tether digital token is often used to buy other virtual currencies.\n\nMore from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:\n\nHundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex. \u201cThis became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,\u201d said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. \u201cIt could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real.\u201d\n\nWhere we stand: According to CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin is trading at $9,545, down almost 7 percent over the last 24 hours, Ethereum\u2019s Ether at $1,099, and Ripple\u2019s XRP at $1.05, down 7 percent.\n\nThe digital money flyaround\n\n\u2022 How Goldman Sachs was rushed into supporting Bitcoin.

Audiophiles will appreciate that it has a woofer with a custom amplifier and seven tweeters. The result is a speaker with a deep bass and rich treble that is loud enough to fill a large room with superb sound. HomePod makes the Amazon Echo and Google\u2019s Home sound muffled and tinny in comparison.\n\nBut Siri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it. Siri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.\n\nFor Apple, that\u2019s unfortunate. The company was the first to bring virtual assistants to the mainstream with Siri on the iPhone in 2011, but it has since fallen behind Amazon and Google with smart speakers. Apple announced HomePod last June \u2014 but then delayed its release until this year.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven now, Apple is shipping the HomePod unfinished. On Day 1, the device will lack some cool features, like the ability to link several HomePods to create a multiroom sound system that Apple says will fill an entire home with music. That feature will come in a software update later this year.\n\nAnd there are other limitations: The HomePod requires an iOS device, like an iPhone, an iPad or an iPod Touch, to set it up. To use your voice commands to play music, you will also need to subscribe to Apple\u2019s streaming music service, Apple Music.\n\nSo how exactly did I reach my conclusion on HomePod? I tested it side by side with Echo and Home smart speakers, grading them on their ability to accomplish 14 tasks across several categories, including music, productivity, commuting, home automation and cooking. Let me walk you through the process and results.\n\nChoosing the Tests\n\nI started picking the 14 tasks by reading up on research studies that looked at how people use virtual assistants in the home. Activate, a management consulting firm, found the majority of people turned to virtual assistants to play music, get the weather and set a timer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nApple also provided statistics on smart speaker usage from the research firm Parks Associates. That report also found that playing music and getting the weather were the top uses of smart speakers, while roughly 20 percent of people enjoyed using them for tasks like accessing a calendar and searching for recipes.\n\nAmazon says most of its Echo customers use at least one \u201cskill,\u201d or third-party app. So I added the ability to use Uber, the most popular ride-hailing service, as a test.\n\nNow onward to the tests themselves.\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nI set up a HomePod, an Echo and a Home in my house and began with a battery of question-and-answer sessions. First up: traffic.\n\nAll the speakers gave a similar traffic estimate for a drive to San Jose, Calif. \u2014 roughly a one-hour drive on the freeway. But when I asked HomePod to summon a car from Uber, Siri responded, \u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t help with rides here.\u201d\n\nThe other speakers were happy to help \u2014 so I followed up with: \u201cHey, Siri, what gives?\u201d HomePod\u2019s colorful touch screen lit up to show it had heard my question, but Siri remained silent.", "title": "Apple\u2019s HomePod Has Arrived.

That was when I met Julius, a villager who guided me through the five villages around Tasiilaq, which with around 2,000 inhabitants is the largest town on Greenland\u2019s east coast. It quickly became obvious I would focus my film on Julius\u2019s own village, Tiniteqilaaq. The village has only around 60 inhabitants and is isolated from the rest of the world by ice for about nine months every year. Over the course of the next year, I spent several months there and learned to share the lifestyle of its inhabitants: I went hunting and fishing with the men, shared family dinners of seal and narwhal, and attended baptisms and funerals. Little by little, I was accepted by Julius\u2019s friends and family. After all, we shared more in common than it might have seemed: Since I come from a village of 250 in Jura, there is nothing less exotic to me than a village half that size.\n\nUltimately, I wound up using my time in Julius\u2019s town to make my fourth feature film, \u201cA Polar Year,\u201d from which this short documentary is adapted. Just as my feature film traces the village\u2019s life over one year, through the changing seasons and rhythms of life and death, for this short I followed one of its young residents during the routine of a single day.\n\nThe result is a portrait of Asser Boassen, an 8-year-old Tunumiit boy who wants to become a hunter. Like many children of his village, Asser has not been raised by his biological parents. Instead, he lives with his grandparents, Thomasine and Gert Jonathansen. In many ways, Asser\u2019s daily life as a young boy, fed by the hunting tradition passed on by his grandfather and by the mythical stories told by his grandmother, represents challenges many in modern Greenland are navigating. When Asser turns 12, he will have to leave his village to attend middle school in the city, far away. When he returns to his village, he will be 16, effectively an adult, and uprooted from the traditions and knowledge he spent his childhood absorbing from his grandparents. Across the country, Inuit children are torn between two conceptions of education, one rooted in their native identity and the other imposed by a globalized world \u2014 knowledge that is essential for navigating that very world. The outcomes are often problematic. But for now Asser is just a child dreaming to become a great hunter.

Banks get the money they use to make loans and trade from two main sources: They borrow it from depositors and creditors (who can demand their money back), or they get it from shareholders (who cannot demand repayment).\n\nThe more a bank relies on shareholder funds, or equity, the less leveraged it is. And, crucially, it is also at less risk of the sort of bank runs that threatened the global financial system in 2008. The good news is that banks are using a lot more equity these days. As the Fed noted after conducting stress tests of large lenders last year, banks had common equity capital, a metric regulators use to assess the strength of a lender\u2019s balance sheet, that was equivalent to 12.5 percent of their assets, which was more than double the 5.5 percent they had at the start of 2009.\n\nSomething to watch: Regulators are thinking about loosening a regulation that limits leverage.\n\nCompanies may be the weak point. Corporations have gorged on debt since the financial crisis. Corporate bond issuance is up over $3.5 trillion, or 67 percent, since the end of 2007, according to calculations using data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Sifma. All other types of debt issuance, excluding United States Treasury debt, are either down or more or less flat over the period. Bank lending to companies and commercial real estate projects is up $1.2 trillion, or 40 percent, since the end of 2007, according to Fed data.\n\nOne of the reasons investors have kept buying corporate bonds is that, while some measurements of indebtedness flashed warnings, plenty of others did not. But there are signs that the binge had gone too far, even for these easy money times.", "title": "Are Debt Problems Lurking Below the Surface?", "authors": []}

If so, have you noticed any animals in the passenger cabin, or have you brought an animal on the plane yourself?\n\nWhat do you think about pets riding with their owners? Have you ever witnessed or experienced any problems with animals on a plane?\n\nIn \u201cIt\u2019s Time to End the Scam of Flying Pets,\u201d David Leonhardt writes:\n\nOne day, we may all owe a debt of gratitude to Dexter the peacock. At Newark Airport last weekend, a woman tried to board a United Airlines flight with Dexter. She described him as her emotional-support animal. But given that peacocks are large birds and there is not much evidence of their therapeutic benefits, United said no, Dexter could not board. A predictable social-media storm ensued, both pro- and anti-peacock. By late last week, United Airlines decided it had enough of making ad hoc decisions about traveling animals and announced a tighter new policy. Dexter, unwittingly, may have struck a blow for sanity. If you spend any time on planes, you\u2019ve probably noticed the surge of animals. There have been pigs, monkeys, turkeys, snakes and oh-so-many dogs, often sprawled across crowded cabins. Delta alone flies about 250,000 animals a year \u2014 not even counting those tucked inside carry-on bags or checked in cargo holds \u2014 more than double how many it flew in 2015. The number of problems is rising, too. A large part-Labrador mauled a man on a flight to San Diego last summer. A recent Delta news release included some words that don\u2019t normally appear in a corporate news release: \u201curination/defecation\u201d and \u201cbarking, growling, lunging and biting.\u201d According to a labor union for flight attendants, more passengers are suffering allergy attacks, and more are arguing, or worse, over animals. I\u2019m not going to claim that flying pets are one of the country\u2019s biggest problems right now. That\u2019s a high bar, after all. But I do find this situation to be a fascinating case study of how mass cheating can become acceptable \u2014 and how decent people can make decisions that are more selfish than they realize. It is one of the downsides of a modern culture that too often fetishizes individual preference and expression over communal well-being.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Do you agree or disagree with Mr. Leonhardt\u2019s argument about flying pets? Why?\n\n\u2014 In your opinion, are emotional-support animals a scam? Do you think people are too often gaming the system? Or do you think, for the most part, that those who bring animals on a plane need them? Why do you think so?\n\n\u2014 How do you think airlines should determine which pets can fly with their owners? Should there be stricter rules? Or should it be a trust-based system?

Now much better anti-nausea medications and more tolerable oral instead of intravenous treatments have made a hospital admission for chemotherapy unusual. Similarly, hip and knee replacements once required days in the hospital; many can now be done overnight in ambulatory surgical centers. Births outside of hospitals are also increasing, as more women have babies at home or at birthing centers.\n\nStudies have shown that patients with heart failure, pneumonia and some serious infections can be given intravenous antibiotics and other hospital-level treatments at home by visiting nurses. These \u201chospital at home\u201d programs usually lead to more rapid recoveries, at a lower cost.\n\nAs these trends accelerate, many of today\u2019s hospitals will downsize, merge or close. Others will convert to doctors\u2019 offices or outpatient clinics. Those that remain will be devoted to emergency rooms, high-tech services for premature babies, patients requiring brain surgery and organ transplants, and the like. Meanwhile, the nearly one billion annual visits to physicians\u2019 offices, imaging facilities, surgical centers, urgent-care centers and \u201cdoc in the box\u201d clinics will grow.\n\nSpecial interests in the hospital business aren\u2019t going to like this.

Indeed, long before Mr. Trump electrified Republican audiences by proposing a border wall financed by Mexico, Senator John McCain overcame a 2010 primary challenge with a vow to \u201ccomplete the danged fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like the rest of the country is waking up to what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last dozen years or so,\u201d said January Contreras, a Democratic candidate for state attorney general who is vying to be Arizona\u2019s first Latina elected statewide.\n\nWith Mr. Flake retiring and Senator John McCain undergoing treatment for brain cancer, Republicans could be defending two Arizona Senate seats, enough to determine the majority in a chamber where they have just a single-seat advantage. A race between Ms. McSally and Representative Kyrsten Sinema, a well-funded Democrat who has the blessing of her national party, may be the marquee open-seat Senate election in the country.\n\nAnd there may be as many as three competitive House races across a mix of rural and urban terrain here that reflect the types of districts that Democrats will need to keep and pick up if they are to reclaim the House.\n\nFar from the caricature of being a sleepy, cactus-filled preserve of Midwestern snowbirds with a penchant for golf and dry heat, this booming and increasingly diverse state spotlights the opportunities and pitfalls both parties are grappling with nationally. As Republicans veer between a hard-line primary electorate and a very different one that will show up in November, Democrats have to hold down their losses in the rural areas and win over suburban centrists \u2014 who routinely supported Mr. McCain and a procession of Republican presidential nominees. That means offering some measure of support for immigration restrictions without depressing the state\u2019s Latinos.\n\nThe roiling dispute over the border and illegal immigration in Arizona, is largely why Mr. Trump won here by less than four percentage points in 2016 and the hard-line county sheriff Joe Arpaio was ousted from his post the same year. A coalition of Hispanics and some right-leaning whites, including many of the state\u2019s Mormons, proved deeply uncomfortable with the incendiary language and scapegoating that is a rhetorical hallmark of both men.\n\nAnd that split seems baked in to the demography of Arizona, which has the widest so-called racial generation gap of any state in the country: Just 19 percent of the population over 65 is nonwhite; 60 percent of those under 18 are nonwhite.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose numbers \u2014 and the tension between the demands of Republican primary voters and those of the wider electorate \u2014 will eventually prove their party\u2019s undoing, some Republicans worry. There is a sharp divide between native-born white Arizonans, who grew up around Hispanics and hearing Spanish, and transplants to the Southwest from more heavily white states.\n\n\u201cThe Arizona Republican Party, they\u2019re just slitting their own throats,\u201d said John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, which has a larger population than St. Louis. \u201cThey are pushing and doing everything they can to offend the Latino population.\u201d\n\nMr. Flake, like Mr. Giles, is a native-born Arizonan, and he shares the same alarm about both immigration and embracing Mr. Trump. He is worried that Ms. McSally is going overboard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be a lot more careful now in how much you cozy up,\u201d Mr. Flake said of his would-be successor, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a balance she\u2019s got to strike. I cringe a little \u2014 I think a lot of people do.\u201d\n\nMr. Flake said he had encouraged Ms. McSally to be more careful. But in a sign of how toxic the senator has become with Arizona Republicans since he wrote a blistering book denouncing Mr. Trump, Ms. McSally said she did not recall having any such conversation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not seeking his political advice,\u201d she curtly added.\n\nThe degree to which Mr. Flake and Mr. McCain have become pariahs among conservative activists was on display during a weekend of state party dinners and organizing events in which Gov. Doug Ducey avoided even mentioning their names. One party regular who showed up in Revolutionary War garb and offered only his first name, articulated the challenge for Trump-skeptic Republicans.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t support Trump, that\u2019s it, 100 percent,\u201d said Arthur, a transplant to Scottsdale, explaining his disdain for his senators. As for immigration, he had a blunt message for would-be migrants: \u201cFix your country. Don\u2019t come here and mess up mine.\u201d\n\nSo for now, Ms. McSally, who enjoys the quiet support of the state and national party establishment, is working to bolster her relationship with Mr. Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer primary race at the moment features two immigration hard-liners: Mr. Arpaio, who says he wants to deport children brought to the country illegally before letting them apply for legal status, and a former state senator, Kelli Ward, who garnered just under 40 percent of voters in a 2016 primary election against Mr. McCain.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But should the McCain seat come open, or should Mr. Arpaio, 85, not go through with his bid, she may face a more daunting one-on-one race with one of the anti-establishment candidates, both of whom sound Trumpian notes.\n\nThe president pardoned Mr. Arpaio last year for criminal contempt, and Ms. Ward said in an interview that she met with the president in December and discussed the race. (She cornered him at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida during the holidays, according to one Republican familiar with the encounter.)\n\nMs. McSally has been helped by an aggressive backstage effort from Republican officials in and out of the White House to keep the president from backing Mr. Arpaio or Ms. Ward. Before she entered the race, Ms. McSally won assurances from an intermediary that Mr. Trump would not endorse her rivals, according to a Republican directly familiar with the conversation, and she and her advisers met last week in the White House with the president\u2019s political team, an opportunity not afforded the other candidates.\n\nTo further inoculate herself from the right, Ms. McSally is declining to say whether she would support a comprehensive measure that offers legal status to undocumented immigrants and is publicly showering Mr. Trump with praise, though she will not reveal whom she voted for in 2016 or any election.\n\nIs he a good man? \u201cI think he has done a lot of amazing things in his life,\u201d she said.\n\nIs he a role model? \u201cI think he is, yeah. I mean, look, everybody has got their strengths and weaknesses,\u201d she offered.\n\nAnd about that report that Mr. Trump had an affair with a porn star shortly after his wife gave birth and later paid her more than $100,000 to stay quiet? \u201cAlleged this and alleged that,\u201d she replied.\n\nMs. McSally also said \u201csure, absolutely\u201d she would campaign with Mr. Trump in the general election, a step Mr. Flake said offered far more risk than reward.\n\n\u201cYou create ads that will be run,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd particularly if there happens to be two senatorial elections, you\u2019re going see just a wave of money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet Ms. Sinema, who began her career in politics as a Ralph Nader supporter and has become a member of the centrist Blue Dog coalition, is stepping gingerly around Mr. Trump in ways that may irritate the left.\n\nIn a brief phone interview, she declined to offer even the most gentle of criticism of a president who many in her party believe is a threat to American democracy.\n\nMs. Sinema noted that she and Mr. Trump \u201cworked together very well\u201d on veterans\u2019 issues and sidestepped questions about his character.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m happy to work with anyone at any time,\u201d she said with a nervous laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t spend my time worrying about, you know, personality stuff. That\u2019s not my issue.\u201d\n\nAs for her own politics, Ms. Sinema would not say whether she was a progressive or a moderate. \u201cI would say I\u2019m an Arizonan,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is a risk-averse approach that her allies believe could pay dividends in a state that still leans Republican, should Democrats enjoy a wave election year.\n\nBut to some Arizona liberals, Ms. Sinema\u2019s pragmatism is bitterly disappointing.\n\n\u201cWe already know that we can\u2019t trust her,\u201d said Tomas Robles, who led protests at Ms. Sinema\u2019s office to push her to stand up for the so-called Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.\n\nThe perennial challenge for Democrats here is that Hispanics do not vote anywhere near to the level of their population.\n\nMr. Robles said his and other groups intended to register 200,000 new voters this year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to have to really work to earn those votes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re alienating the largest minority group in Arizona, you\u2019re going to have a tough time winning an election as a Democrat.\u201d", "title": "Arizona G.O.P.

Joy comes in the form of family. Her mother is a survivor focused on the well-being of her children; her birth father, Gabriel, whose stints in prison leave him often unable to participate in her life, encourages everyone to \u201cchoose love\u201d; and her older brother Monte, who will later be imprisoned and told he has schizoaffective disorder, has a \u201cginormous heart.\u201d But love cannot save her family from external forces, and Khan-Cullors does her best to contextualize their circumstances. \u201cIn 1986 when I am 3 years old, Ronald Reagan re-energizes the drug war that was started in 1971 by Richard Nixon by further militarizing the police in our communities,\u201d she writes.

At 12, she is arrested for smoking weed even though students at her suburban school \u201clight up in the bathroom\u201d and \u201cno one gets in trouble.\u201d\n\nPart 2 introduces Khan-Cullors the organizer and activist. Titled \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d these chapters outline her partnership with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, the other founders of the network. After the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin in 2012, Khan-Cullors logged onto Facebook and responded to a post Garza had written. Her message, \u201c#BlackLivesMatter,\u201d catalyzed the now international movement against police violence and racism. But while the title of this section (and the subtitle of the book) promises an insider account, the details of their partnership are sparse, mostly concentrated at the end of one chapter. While Khan-Cullors outlines the reasons for some of Black Lives Matter\u2019s tactics, particularly its emphasis on inclusivity and a decentralized organization, readers won\u2019t find Situation Room-style play-by-plays here.\n\nIn \u201cWhen and Where I Enter,\u201d an influential history of black female activists in the United States, Paula Giddings, a professor of Africana studies at Smith College, wonders about those women \u2014 from Anna Julia Cooper to Ida B.

Many had belonged to Jewish families whose homes were raided during the Nazi occupation, or who were forced to sell art to survive or to flee the country.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1949, over 61,000 of those objects were returned to France, and about 45,000 were claimed by their owners. Many of the unclaimed pieces were sold at auction.\n\nBut the French state kept 2,143 of them \u2014 even today, experts say it is unclear how they were chosen. The government placed them in an inventory called the Mus\u00e9es Nationaux R\u00e9cup\u00e9ration, or M.N.R., and entrusted them to museums. The Louvre has 807 such paintings.\n\nA little over 100 looted objects, including about 50 paintings, have been returned to their legitimate owners or their descendants, since the 1950s, after the first wave of restitutions. The French authorities acknowledge the pace is slow.\n\n\u201cIf you just look at the number of restitutions, there is obviously still a lot to do,\u201d said Thierry Bajou, a curator at the Culture Ministry who works with a small team to identify the origins of looted art by combing through museum collections and archives, and by looking for markings, notes or labels on the backs of paintings.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cFor a long time, the administration merely waited for the beneficiaries to claim a given work of art,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we try to study the origin of the works and to identify who was despoiled at the time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAuthorities collaborating on that effort include museums, the Culture and Foreign Ministries and the Commission for the Compensation of Victims of Spoliation, which was established in 1999 to examine reparation claims made by victims of France\u2019s anti-Semitic laws during the war.\n\nIn 2015, the French government also struck a deal with a national organization of genealogists to help track down the heirs of despoiled families.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "As the political stalemate drags on, and with business leaders issuing ever more urgent alarms about the threats to the economy, growing public doubts are beginning to register in some opinion polls. And opponents of Brexit are quietly cultivating what they see as that rising sentiment in their campaign to soften, if not reverse, the whole process.\n\nThey even picked up support from an unexpected quarter when Nigel Farage, the former U.K. Independence Party leader and the leading proponent of Brexit, recently suggested that there might be a second referendum.\n\nProminent \u201cleavers,\u201d as supporters of Brexit are known, dismiss that possibility out of hand, but it may not be as far-fetched as they would have people believe.\n\nSome time later this year Parliament is likely to face a fateful vote on the actual terms of any agreement Mrs. May can reach with the European Union on Britain\u2019s withdrawal. A defeat in Parliament would prompt a political crisis, very likely topple Mrs. May and possibly prompt a general election. Potentially, that could open the way to a rethink, to new Brexit options, or to a second referendum.\n\nThat is what people like the local Swansea lawmaker, Geraint Davies, from the opposition Labour Party, are banking on. He believes the tide is turning against Brexit in Wales, where a majority opted to quit, although Wales is a big recipient of European development aid, and has several industries that might lose from Brexit.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat I am sensing is that people who voted Brexit in good faith are now saying, \u2018Hold on, that\u2019s not what I voted for, and I want a final say,\u2019\u201d Mr. Davies said, listing promises made during the 2016 referendum, including one \u2014 later ruled misleading by the country\u2019s statistics authority \u2014 that quitting would free up 350 million pounds a week, or about $486 million, for health spending.\n\n\u201cYou should have the right to look again, and say: \u2018You ordered a steak and you ended up with a bit of chewed up bacon. Do you want to accept that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Davies added, arguing that Britain faces higher inflation and slower growth, and that, far from getting money back, it has offered around 39 billion pounds, or about $54 billion, in divorce payments to the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Davies and others have also pounced on recent reports that the areas in Wales and central and northern England that voted most strongly for Brexit are set to suffer the greatest economic harm from the rupture.\n\nExperts say they have detected a subtle shift, in Wales and elsewhere. Though few people admit to changing their views, there is growing support for a vote on the terms of any Brexit deal, according to Roger Awan-Scully, a professor of political science in the Wales Governance Center at Cardiff University.\n\n\u201cThere is some change on whether there should be another referendum on the issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen a move towards the idea of the public having a greater say.\u201d\n\nHard-line supporters (and opponents) of Brexit remain steadfast in their views, but many of the less committed have yet to fully focus on what it will mean and have been turned off by the stream of complex, sometimes contradictory, reports emerging from the tortuous negotiations. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like the O.J. Simpson trial: It keeps going on and on and people tune out of it,\u201d Mr. Awan-Scully added.\n\nAnd with signs that public opinion is volatile and could be shifting, the political ice is starting to crack.\n\nWhen Tony Blair, a former prime minister, called last month for another plebiscite, Brexit supporters derided him as a pillar of a failed, elitist, pro-European establishment.\n\nBut it was hard to say the same when Mr. Farage suggested there should be another vote. Though Mr. Farage appeared later to retreat on the idea, Arron Banks, a big financial supporter of one of the Leave campaigns, endorsed it as well. For hard-line leave supporters, a referendum is a chance to once and for all kill off the argument to stay, and precipitate a clean break with the bloc.\n\nPro-Europeans, by contrast, would like a plebiscite on the specific terms of any deal negotiated by Mrs. May\u2019s government, with the option to remain in the bloc if voters prefer.\n\nPhoto\n\nSeveral things would have to happen to make that a reality, including a change of government policy and, almost certainly, of prime minister.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome say it is too late to rethink the withdrawal, given that Britain has invoked its two-year exit clause. Others say that to date the shift in British public opinion, if any, is simply not big enough, and that Brexit support remains strong outside the big cities and in many working-class communities.\n\nBut the logic of having a second referendum is compelling. The 2016 vote was a choice between leave and remain, yet was silent on the path that Britain should take thereafter.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A so-called soft Brexit could keep Britain integrated within the European Union\u2019s economic model and part of its single market and customs union, accepting all its rules, albeit without having a say over them.\n\nA hard Brexit might cut most of those ties, and take the country toward a low regulation, low tax economy \u2014 \u201cEurope\u2019s Singapore\u201d \u2014 for example.\n\nThe problem is that there is no specific democratic mandate for either option, or even for Mrs. May\u2019s preferred (though probably unobtainable) idea of something in between. So any outcome is likely to be contested for years to come.\n\nWithin Mrs. May\u2019s government, the implications of Brexit are causing concern, even as hard-line Brexit supporters step up their campaign for a clean break from the bloc.\n\nFollowing the leak of a government analysis that predicted the British economy would suffer under all of the most likely scenarios, one minister, Phillip Lee, wrote on Twitter that, if the figures were anywhere near right, \u201cthere would be a serious question over whether a government could legitimately lead a country along a path that the evidence and rational consideration indicate would be damaging.\u201d\n\nOne obstacle to another referendum is the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a lifelong Euroskeptic, who currently rejects the idea \u2014 despite arguing that, unlike Mrs. May, he would negotiate a withdrawal that would protect British jobs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet, if Mrs. May reaches a Brexit deal that takes Britain out of the bloc\u2019s economic structures, Mr. Corbyn would face overwhelming pressure to oppose it, a move that, if successful, could bring down the government.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Davies argues that the Labour Party\u2019s large number of youthful members \u2014 the bedrock of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s support \u2014 are strongly pro-European and want a second referendum.\n\nCalls for a reconsideration of Brexit have come not only from Labour\u2019s centrist lawmakers, but from some of Mr. Corbyn\u2019s allies on the left, like Paul Flynn, a leading Labour member of Parliament from Wales.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it time to rethink this whole nonsense and plan for a second referendum where the nation comes to its senses?\u201d Mr. Flynn recently asked at a parliamentary committee hearing.\n\nLen McCluskey, a union leader and a close ally of Mr. Corbyn, wants Labour to oppose any Brexit deal that Mrs. May puts to Parliament, and has not ruled out supporting another referendum.\n\nOf course, even if there were a second vote, it is far from clear that it would reverse the original verdict.

During his 205-minute speech last October at the start of the Communist Party\u2019s twice-a-decade national congress, Mr. Xi received his loudest, most enthusiastic applause \u2014 particularly from army generals in uniform among the delegates \u2014 when he declared, \u201cWe will never allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi conspicuously failed to say, as past Chinese leaders sometimes have, that unification should be achieved by working with the people of Taiwan. But he did say that unification should be peaceful, and he did not mention a previous commitment by Beijing to use armed force should Taiwan ever declare formal independence.\n\nBeijing officials have pursued a more confrontational policy toward Taiwan ever since Ms. Tsai, of the Democratic Progressive Party, was elected president two years ago. Her party has a long history of favoring formal independence for Taiwan, although Ms. Tsai herself is a technocrat who has emphasized trying to strengthen the economy.\n\nBut Beijing officials have been biding their time about confronting Taiwan too publicly this year as they await the results of Taipei\u2019s mayoral election in November. The race is likely to be closely contested by the Nationalist Party, which favors a more cooperative relationship with the mainland, and which Beijing officials are eager to see back in power in Taiwan.", "title": "As China Puts Pressure on Taiwan, Signs of a U.S. Pushback", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher"]}

That law had become unpopular because of its emphasis on testing and prescriptive mandates, though it is still widely praised for unmasking the nation\u2019s achievement gaps, particularly for black, poor and special education students.\n\nMs. DeVos has drawn criticism from both parties for her department\u2019s approach to the new law, particularly from its chief architects, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Ms. Murray has criticized Ms. DeVos as a rubber stamp for plans that fail to execute the law\u2019s intent to hold schools accountable for struggling students, even while Mr. Alexander balked at what he saw as the Education Department\u2019s heavy hand in attempting to enforce the new law.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Maryland, the law has become a political football.

The bill also said academic indicators such as test scores could account for no more than 65 percent of a school\u2019s performance rating, among the lowest percentages proposed in the country.\n\nMr. Hogan vetoed the bill, but the Legislature overrode his veto.

That\u2019s a problem given that, in the last four downturns, the Fed has cut rates by an average of 5.5 percentage points to stimulate renewed growth.\n\nDuring the last downturn, the Fed reduced the benchmark rate to nearly zero in 2008, and then supplemented its efforts by pledging to keep interest rates at a low level and by purchasing large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds.\n\nFed officials have said that those policies benefited the economy, and could be used again during a future downturn.

Interest rates include expected inflation, so higher inflation would raise rates.\n\nEmbracing higher inflation, however, could cause political problems for the Fed.\n\nAlternatively, the Fed could tolerate higher inflation on a temporary basis. For example, the Fed could aim to maintain average inflation at 2 percent over some specified period, meaning that it would compensate for periods of lower inflation, as during the last six years, by allowing periods of higher inflation, thus maintaining a 2 percent average.\n\nLast year, the Fed began to include a comparison between its actual management of interest rates, and the results produced by alternative approaches to monetary policy.\n\nThe report on Friday included an inflation-averaging approach among those alternatives for the first time.", "title": "As Economy Grows, Federal Reserve Frets Next Downturn", "authors": ["Binyamin Appelbaum"]}

Given that Emma Ann had known him her entire life, he was almost like family, an intimacy reflected in the half-dozen photographs of her that he displayed in his treatment room.\n\nDr. Nassar first molested her when she was 10, she recalled. She remembered the pants she was wearing \u2014 black leggings with white flowers, from A\u00e9ropostale.

That did not end it. She said he continued to abuse her while positioning himself so that her mother couldn\u2019t see what he was doing. He would grope the girl beneath a white towel meant to convey propriety, all the while chatting with her mother, a kindergarten teacher.\n\nHow\u2019s your class going?\n\n\u201cI knew that he had helped my mom, so I had to persuade myself into thinking that he also helped me,\u201d Emma Ann said. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t really sure.\u201d\n\nEmma Ann now knows that she was not alone.

And Ms. Maroney lived in California.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to Mr. Abbott, his agents in Indianapolis did not have the case for long. \u201cWhen we consulted with the U.S. attorney, we knew right away that we would not have venue,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was never really our case.\u201d\n\nMr. Abbott said that his agents conducted some interviews, but he declined to say with whom. He also said written reports were sent within weeks to F.B.I. offices in Michigan and Los Angeles.\n\nThe retired agent emphasized how the sensitivities and difficulties of child-exploitation cases can contribute to the length of investigations. \u201cYou are dealing with victims who sometimes don\u2019t want to be interviewed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is extremely delicate. And you also have the parents of minors who are sometimes not comfortable with interviews.\u201d\n\nAsked why federal law enforcement officials did not notify people \u2014 other gymnasts, parents, coaches \u2014 that a potential child molester was in their midst, Mr. Abbott said, \u201cThat\u2019s where things can get tricky.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is a duty to warn those who might be harmed in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everyone is still trying to ascertain whether a crime has been committed. And everybody has rights here\u201d \u2014 a reference to both the alleged victims and the person being accused.\n\nThe Nassar case might have been further complicated, he said, by the fact that \u201cthere was a vigorous debate going on about whether this was a legitimate medical procedure.\u201d\n\nU.S.A. Gymnastics officials said that around this time they were told that pertinent interviews had been completed and that the case had been transferred to another jurisdiction. Indeed, on Sept. 12, Ms. Maroney was directed by U.S.A. Gymnastics to contact the F.B.I. East Lansing office.\n\nAccording to Mr. Manly, the retired gymnast\u2019s mother, Erin Maroney, \u201ccalled repeatedly,\u201d but received no follow-up response.\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo weeks later, on Sept. 27, Dr. Nassar announced on Facebook that he was retiring from the women\u2019s national team staff, notwithstanding a note he had posted in late June saying he would remain with the team through the summer of 2016.\n\nHe did not elaborate.\n\nIn April 2016, Ms. Raisman shared a gold medal with the national team at the Pacific Rim Championships in Seattle, while Ms. Nichols damaged a knee during training, underwent surgery, and was out for several weeks \u2014 a reminder of the physical toll of the sport. Meanwhile, neither she nor her parents heard anything about the federal investigation that U.S.A. Gymnastics had instructed them to remain silent about.\n\nThe Raisman family was similarly frustrated. According to a person close to the family, Ms. Raisman and her mother, Lynn, repeatedly reached out to Mr. Penny to find out about the status of the federal investigation, only to be told that an F.B.I. agent would be getting in touch with them.\n\nFinally, the absence of information about the federal investigation \u2014 and the increasing concern of the victims and their families \u2014 prompted Mr. Penny and Mr. Parilla, the U.S.A. Gymnastics officials, to visit the F.B.I.\u2019s Los Angeles bureau in early May. Mr. Parilla lives in Southern California, as does Ms. Maroney, and Mr. Penny stopped in Los Angeles while returning from an overseas trip.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs time passed, concern about a perceived lack of development prompted Board Chair Paul Parilla and C.E.O. Steve Penny to report the matter a second time to a different F.B.I. office,\u201d U.S.A. Gymnastics said in a statement to The Times on Friday.\n\nThrough a lawyer and a spokeswoman, Mr. Parilla and Mr. Penny declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe visit appears to have jump-started the federal investigation into Dr. Nassar. Agents asked for more information, including a list of the members of the national women\u2019s gymnastics team. And on May 17, the F.B.I. finally interviewed Ms. Maroney in person.\n\nIt had been 294 days since the F.B.I. was first notified of accusations against Dr. Nassar.\n\nA few weeks later, on June 13, Gina Nichols received an email from Michael Hess, an F.B.I. agent then based in Los Angeles. \u201cI am looking into a complaint that was filed involving alleged misconduct by an individual associated with U.S.A. Gymnastics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen you have a moment, please give me a call at the below numbers.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was a stressful time: Her daughter was preparing for the Olympic trials. But several days later, the gymnast went to a suburban Minneapolis building, not far from her home, to meet Mr. Hess, who had flown in from Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition, a person close to the Raisman family said that the F.B.I. also contacted Ms. Raisman in the summer of 2016. While Mr. Manly \u2014 who represents Ms. Raisman, Ms. Nichols and Ms. Maroney \u2014 applauded the diligence of Mr. Hess, he expressed amazement that so little had been done for so long.\n\n\u201cGiven who these women were, all competing for their country, and given that these assaults had occurred in different states and countries, there was an obvious need to have a multilayered, multijurisdictional investigation,\u201d Mr. Manly said.\n\nGina Nichols, who had been instructed by U.S.A. Gymnastics not to talk about the matter, recalled that while venting in a subsequent telephone conversation with Mr. Hess, the agent told her:\n\nYou can talk to anybody you want.\n\nLasting Scars\n\nThat August, in Rio de Janeiro, Ms. Raisman had an Olympics for the ages, demonstrating poise and leadership as she won three medals, including gold. But Ms. Nichols, returning from her knee injury, was ultimately not invited to join the Olympic team \u2014 even as an alternate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, Emma Ann Miller continued to keep her treatment appointments with Dr. Nassar. But the abuse had worsened, and she no longer felt like the bubbly teenager she had been only a year before. She stopped taking selfies because she felt ugly and fat. She\u2019d cry if she received an A-minus on a paper or test, thinking it was evidence of her stupidity.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even want to order a drink at Starbucks because I was so scared I\u2019d mess it up,\u201d Emma Ann said.\n\nHer mother, Leslie Miller, struggles now with her rage. \u201cLook at what he did to my happy girl,\u201d Ms. Miller said, in tears. \u201cLook at all the people who could\u2019ve stopped him earlier. My goal is to find every single one of them in the haystack \u2014 expose them all, so this will never happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Story Becomes Public\n\nIt was only a matter of time.\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2016, The Indianapolis Star published an in-depth investigation detailing allegations that Dr. Nassar had repeatedly molested two gymnasts when they were young. One woman had filed a criminal complaint with the police in Michigan. The other, initially described only as an Olympic medalist, had filed a lawsuit against the doctor and U.S.A. Gymnastics in California. Neither was involved in the F.B.I. inquiry.\n\nSuddenly, the Nassar case took on urgency. As other girls and women began calling the Michigan State University Police to file complaints, their numbers eventually growing into the dozens, their abuser did what he could to mask his behavior, including throwing hard drives containing more than 37,000 images and videos of child pornography into the trash for pickup in the morning.\n\nBut trash pickup in his neighborhood was late that day, allowing a police officer to find the horrifying material while executing a search warrant on behalf of the university police.\n\nBy the close of 2016, Dr. Nassar was in custody. By the close of 2017, he had been convicted of myriad state charges, as well as federal child pornography charges, based in large part on that state search warrant. Given that he has been sentenced to nearly two centuries in prison, Dr. Nassar will likely die there.\n\nIn recent weeks, a communal catharsis has played out, as dozens and dozens of empowered victims or their proxies have confronted the doctor at sentencing hearings. The angry but resolute words of Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney and Maggie Nichols have echoed in the courtrooms of Michigan.\n\nSo, too, have the words of the lesser-known accusers, those girls and young women who report they were abused in the year after allegations were first presented to the F.B.I. in Indianapolis: the likes of Alexis Alvarado and Hannah Morrow \u2014 and Emma Ann Miller, who in November turned 15.", "title": "As F.B.I.

By most measures, the hockey team\u2019s inaugural season has been a smashing success \u2014 one the Raiders hope to duplicate when they move to the city from Oakland for the 2020 N.F.L. season.\n\nWith 41 wins and 87 points through Monday, the Golden Knights have been extending the record for most wins by an N.H.L. expansion team week after week. In first place in the Western Conference, they are the second-highest scoring team in the league and look poised for a playoff run.\n\nA big reason for the Golden Knights\u2019 success is their play at T-Mobile Arena, where they are 24-5-2. Through the first 31 home games, the team averaged 17,969 fans, or 103.5 percent of the arena\u2019s capacity, when including standing room tickets. All 44 luxury suites have been rented. The team sold its entire allotment of 12,500 season tickets, and Kerry Bubolz, the team president, told LVSportsBiz.com this month that about 2,500 fans had paid deposits to be part of the season-ticket waiting list.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to Fanatics, the largest online seller of licensed sports goods, the Golden Knights have ranked fourth in N.H.L. merchandise sales this season \u2014 and first since the start of 2018.\n\nThe fast start by the Golden Knights has, for now, allayed fears that the N.H.L.\u2019s decision to put another team in a desert city would lead to financial trouble. (See: Coyotes, Arizona.) Commissioner Gary Bettman has for years pushed for new teams in the Sun Belt, with mixed success, and aiming for Las Vegas, in particular, seemed like an overreach.\n\nIt is the country\u2019s 40th largest television market, best known as a destination for tourists and gamblers, and has a population heavy on retirees and service industry workers, who are unlikely candidates to spend thousands of dollars on season tickets. The city had little hockey tradition; it has hosted minor league teams but has few ice rinks or youth leagues.\n\nBut an influx of out-of-town fans has complemented the Golden Knights\u2019 fast start on the ice and at the box office. This is good news for local hotels, restaurants and casinos, which host 43 million visitors a year, and for the team as it gets its bearings in the market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther N.H.L. teams in areas that attract transplanted retirees \u2014 like the Arizona Coyotes and the Florida Panthers \u2014 also tend to have strong crowds supporting the opposition. The Golden Knights, though, appear to have specifically designed their game nights like most things in their city: as tourist attractions.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Zambonis that drive on the ice have jousts mounted on their sides to simulate a duel. The arena includes a 24-foot knight\u2019s helmet and three castle structures, including one for cheerleaders with pompoms. Catapults are used to launch T-shirts into the crowd.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to focus on Vegas as the entertainment capital of the world,\u201d Bubolz said.\n\nThe Golden Knights\u2019 success, camp and all, is an encouraging sign for the N.F.L., which last year approved the Raiders\u2019 plan to relocate to Nevada. (The San Antonio Stars of the W.N.B.A. moved to Las Vegas in the off-season, and will begin play as the Las Vegas Aces in May.)\n\nBut the definition of success will be far different. While the Knights play in a privately built arena, Nevada promised to use $750 million in hotel taxes to help pay for a new, domed stadium for the Raiders. The bonanza of public money persuaded the league\u2019s owners to let the team move, and melted the N.F.L.\u2019s long-running objections to playing in Las Vegas \u2014 based on the presence of legal sports gambling.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Raiders hope to double down on the Knights\u2019 success at drawing out-of-town visitors. In most N.F.L. markets, roughly 5 percent of fans at a typical game are from out of town. Yet according to the Raiders\u2019 projections, about half the fans at the 10 Raiders home games will come from outside Las Vegas, including many from neighboring California.\n\n\u201cAs far back as a decade, we all believed teams would travel very well to Las Vegas,\u201d said Bill Hornbuckle, the president of MGM Resorts International and a member of the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, which has negotiated specifics of the stadium deal with the Raiders.\n\nSporting events in Las Vegas, he added, \u201cmake what is normally a three-hour experience into a three-day experience.\u201d\n\nHornbuckle said that of the 48,000 fans who had paid a deposit for personal seat licenses, which will probably cost between $4,000 and $6,000, 48 percent were from Southern Nevada. But nearly 30 percent were from Southern California, and the remainder from elsewhere in the country.\n\nBut while the Golden Knights moved into a pre-existing arena, the Raiders are responsible for construction of their stadium. The team, though, will have to cover only about one-third of the estimated $1.8 billion price tag. The rest will come from the hotel tax, an N.F.L. contribution of $200 million and an estimated $250 million from the fans\u2019 seat license fees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Raiders will operate the stadium and keep all revenue from every event there, not only football games. An existing monorail, which was privately financed, may be extended to reach the stadium and ease concerns about traffic and a lack of parking.\n\nJim Nagourney, a former sports executive in New York who now lives in Las Vegas, has repeatedly criticized the arrangement with the Raiders, which could require taxpayers to cover any shortfall in the hotel tax revenue. He said the number of available parking spaces was too small, and he questioned whether half of the stadium\u2019s 65,000 seats could be filled with out-of-town fans. Attendance for preseason games is notoriously spotty, and if the Raiders play poorly, their fans from outside Las Vegas may be less likely to travel long distances to see them, he said.\n\nNagourney also said the assumption that fans would stay for nearly three days was based on visitors for conventions, not sports events. He does not believe it was necessary to bring the Golden Knights and the Raiders to Las Vegas to validate the city\u2019s status.\n\n\u201cIt was a prestige thing,\u201d Nagourney said. \u201cBut find me a map that doesn\u2019t already have Las Vegas on it.\u201d", "title": "As Golden Knights Soar, Las Vegas Stakes Its Claim as a Sports Town", "authors": ["Ken Belson"]}

He had no real answers, one American guest said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Trump, in fact, had supported intervening in Libya before he took to the campaign trail and began calling the military operation a \u201cdisaster\u201d that left the nation in \u201cruins.\u201d\n\nThere appeared to be some sense of urgency early on. American officials working out of the Libya Embassy in Tunis said they had been assured that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis would make Libya a top priority, several officials said in interviews. And then there were the warnings from some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top military advisers, including General Waldhauser\u2019s testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lack of sustained attention caused consternation in some quarters not just because of the terrorism threat but also because Libya remained a primary transit route for refugees and human traffickers.\n\n\u201cYou had this country that was the topic of a lot of campaign rhetoric, and at the same time those of us who had been working on Libya issues in government felt an urgency to build pockets of stability,\u201d said Joshua A. Geltzer, a former senior counterterrorism official at the National Security Council under Presidents Obama and Trump. \u201cBut over the past year, I haven\u2019t seen much momentum to do that.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLast spring, two months after General Waldhauser testified on Capitol Hill, a suicide bomber detonated a shrapnel-laden explosive device during a concert in Manchester, England, killing 22 people and injuring 250 others. The bomber was of Libyan descent and had recently traveled to Libya to meet with an Islamic State commander.\n\nBy early summer, there were ominous signs that the Islamic State was recovering from a B-2 bomber attack that, according to the Pentagon, killed more than 80 militants at a Libyan training camp just days before Mr. Trump took office. Amanda J. Dory, who had just stepped down as the Pentagon\u2019s top Africa policy official, warned that \u201cwe\u2019re seeing some signs\u201d that the Islamic State was further \u201cregrouping in Libya.\u201d\n\nSome aides urged the president to increase the modest number of military advisers in Libya \u2014 roughly two dozen Special Operations soldiers at any given time. But the effort was stymied by Stephen K. Bannon, then Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nMr. Bannon clashed frequently with Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, who, Mr. Bannon said, kept pushing for more American involvement in a variety of places, including Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen. \u201cEvery day there was a new ask with no overarching strategy,\u201d Mr. Bannon recalled in an interview after leaving the White House but before his recent public break with Mr. Trump over his comments in a book about the administration\u2019s first year. \u201cLibya was what pushed me over the edge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bannon was more open to an idea pitched by Erik D. Prince, a founder of the private security firm Blackwater Worldwide whom he had gotten to know when he oversaw the conservative website Breitbart News. Mr. Prince had proposed relying on contractors to tackle Libya\u2019s security problems. It seemed, at least to Libyan officials, that the idea was gaining steam: One said Mr. Prince had approached them about it at a conference in London where he was seen with Sebastian Gorka, a Bannon ally and White House adviser at the time.\n\nHow was sending American troops to Libya in America\u2019s interest? Mr. Bannon wanted to know.\n\nAt a wide-ranging Saturday morning meeting on July 8, Mr. Bannon took his complaints to Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general. The country was a mess, Mr. Bannon said he told the secretary, and greater American involvement could only backfire.\n\nMr. Mattis listened politely, Mr. Bannon said, but pointed out that Libya, along with parts of Syria and the Philippines, was a critical battlefield in the global fight against the Islamic State. Mr. Bannon responded that if the president was going to be asked to get more deeply involved in Libya, he at least wanted Mr. Trump to have a \u201cstrategic overview of U.S. commitments around the globe, everything from military to trade agreements, so that all these requests could be put in a larger context.\u201d\n\nA three-hour follow-up meeting with the president took place on July 20 at the Pentagon. As Mr. Bannon had hoped, once the National Security Council convened to discuss hot spots around the world where the Pentagon might need to bolster its presence, Libya fell farther down the priority list.\n\nAt least for the moment, Mr. Bannon had won the day.\n\nBut if Mr. Trump\u2019s Libya policy seemed unintelligible to some, the president of another world power had a far clearer vision.\n\nPhoto\n\nOil and Arms\n\nMr. Putin has had Libya in his sights for years. Ever since he became convinced that the United States, and specifically Mrs. Clinton, then the secretary of state, had double-crossed Russia by toppling Colonel Qaddafi in what had been billed as a limited, humanitarian intervention, the Russian president has been working to regain influence there.\n\nBasit Igtet, a Libyan oil entrepreneur married to the Seagram heiress Sara Bronfman, recalled in an interview that, after announcing in 2014 that he would run for prime minister, he was invited to meet privately at a conference in Greece with Vladimir Yakunin, then the head of the state-owned Russian Railways.\n\nDuring the Qaddafi era, Libya signed a deal to have the Russians build a high-speed rail between Benghazi and Tripoli, one segment of an envisioned North African corridor. But the project had stalled after the 2011 intervention and, Mr. Igtet said, Mr. Yakunin pressed him to move it forward if elected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Igtet said Mr. Yakunin seemed \u201cdesperate,\u201d even offering what appeared to be a bribe to restart the project. \u201cThey offered to give me a percentage of the contract as a commission,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to offend anyone, but I just wanted to leave.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Yakunin, Grigory Levchenko, said that while Mr. Yakunin could not comment on specifics of confidential talks, he denied \u201cthe suggestion of any wrongdoing or ethical misconduct related to those discussions.\u201d He added: \u201cMr. Yakunin never offered Mr. Igtet anything that \u2018appeared to be a bribe to restart the project,\u2019 nor did he ever offer Mr. Igtet \u2018a percentage of the contract as a commission.\u2019 These claims are simply false.\u201d\n\nThe same year, the Russians also approached Ibrahim Jathran, a militia leader who controlled Libya\u2019s key oil ports before General Haftar. United States Navy SEALs had recently boarded a North Korean-flagged ship and disrupted a plot by Mr. Jathran to bypass Libya\u2019s government and sell oil directly on the international market.\n\nTwo of Mr. Jathran\u2019s top deputies, who asked that only their first names, Osama and Ahmed, be used, for fear of reprisals, described how the Russians then stepped in with a \u201creally amazing\u201d proposal to help Mr. Jathran sell the oil \u2014 and arm his militia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe Russians, Osama and Ahmed said, would market the crude oil, moving it through Egypt to Russia. Mr. Jathran would be paid in weapons for the first six months, and in cash thereafter.\n\n\u201cThe weapons included everything we have, plus armored cars, antiaircraft missiles, heat-seeking shoulder-held weapons, light weapons and comm gear including Hetra wireless,\u201d Osama said.\n\nBut when the Russians demanded exclusivity, Ahmed and Osama said, their boss balked. Fearing that the Russians could not be trusted, Mr. Jathran, who is now in hiding and could not be reached for comment, walked away from the deal.\n\nThe next year, in 2015, the Russians came back, Ahmed and Osama said. The same weaponry was on the table, but this time they wanted Mr. Jathran to throw his support behind the Russians\u2019 choice for defense minister: Libya\u2019s ambassador to Saudi Arabia at the time.\n\nOfficials in the U.N.-backed Libyan government convinced Mr. Jathran that it would be far more productive to align himself with the West. A meeting was set up between Mr. Jathran and Jonathan Powell, then the British envoy to Libya, after which \u201cIbrahim instructed me to close the file on Russia,\u201d Osama said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, in September 2016, General Haftar\u2019s Libyan National Army seized the oil terminals from Mr. Jathran\u2019s forces. Ahmed, who served as a commander during the fighting, recalled being stunned by the sophistication of the weapons General Haftar seemed to have acquired overnight.\n\nFast-moving desert vehicles. Self-guided heat-seeking missiles. A newfound ability to launch airstrikes by day and night. Osama and Ahmed, who said he was injured by Russian-made munitions, came to believe that the Russians had begun facilitating arms shipments to General Haftar after their boss turned them down.\n\n\u201cYou could notice the difference, and it definitely tilted the balance,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nThat assessment, based on anecdotal evidence and informants, was backed up by American and British intelligence reports. A former senior American national security official and a former senior British official said evidence gathered in late 2015 and 2016 indicated that the United Arab Emirates were cooperating with Russia to provide Russian weaponry to General Haftar\u2019s forces with Egypt\u2019s help.\n\nThe British official recalled landing at the airport in Tobruk, controlled by the Haftar-allied Eastern government, in late 2014 or early 2015. A giant Antonov cargo plane was on the runway, and people were unloading crates of what looked like military equipment, he said, adding that the pilot said the mat\u00e9riel was from Belarus.\n\nThe official described the weapons shipments as a way for the Russians to expand their influence, and tweak the United States, without being too deeply involved.\n\nFor its part, Russia has maintained that it is in compliance with a United Nations embargo on transferring weapons into Libya. Only the United Nations-backed government, which General Haftar refuses to recognize, can import weapons, and only with the approval of the United Nations.\n\nTo be sure, Russia\u2019s involvement in Libya pales in comparison to that in Syria, where punishing Russian airpower has been deployed to crush rebel factions fighting to oust Mr. Assad, and Russian and American aircraft are jousting in the eastern skies at cross purposes.\n\nIn Libya, the heavy lifting of providing military support to General Haftar has fallen largely to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which are engaged in a proxy war for regional influence with Qatar, which supports Islamic factions in the country that the general has vowed to eradicate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, it wasn\u2019t until after Mr. Trump\u2019s election that the Russians were brazen enough to give General Haftar a full-dress parade aboard their aircraft carrier.\n\nOver the last year, Russian assistance has generally been subtler. Russian military advisers and intelligence officers have regularly gone in and out of General Haftar\u2019s area of control, American intelligence officials said. Other Russian support personnel have provided spare parts, equipment repairs and medical care.\n\nPrivate Russian contractors have guarded factories in Benghazi and provided demining equipment to General Haftar\u2019s troops, the officials said. Russian special forces are using an air base in western Egypt, just over Libya\u2019s border, in an early sign of recent basing agreements between Russia and Egypt.\n\nIn August, General Haftar said he had raised the issue of Russia\u2019s providing military assistance with Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. And last month, Aguila Saleh Issa, the speaker of the Tobruk-based House of Representatives and an ally of General Haftar, told the Russian news agency Sputnik that Russia had in fact provided military training to Haftar\u2019s army.\n\n\u201cPutin is pushing the envelope, and will keep pushing and pushing until he is stopped,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, who was the State Department\u2019s second-ranking diplomat for Middle East policy from 2013 to 2016.\n\nAppearing to hedge his bets on Libya\u2019s political future, Mr. Putin has also reached out to the Government of National Accord, welcoming its prime minister, Mr. Serraj, in addition to General Haftar, to Moscow.\n\nAccording to Western officials, Russia is seeking a political settlement \u2014 a central government favorable to its economic interests, especially on arms contracts, energy deals and a railway project.\n\n\u201cIf they can give the E.U. a black eye along the way, so much the better,\u201d said Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Burning Shores: Inside the Battle for the New Libya.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, despite evidence in Syria and elsewhere that Russia and the United States have sharply divergent interests in the region, some senior administration officials have appeared open to the idea that Russia could be part of the solution in Libya.\n\nAri Ben-Menashe, a Canada-based Israeli security consultant who has a contract to lobby on behalf of General Haftar and his ally Mr. Issa, helped arrange the aircraft carrier visit.\n\nHe said he had spoken to several top administration officials and his impression was that they believed Moscow could play a useful role.\n\n\u201cWhere they are, at least my sense is, is that any settlement is a good settlement and they are kind of happy if someone gets that done,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel the Russians could help.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that explains the reaction of several officials the administration made available for this article. When asked about Russian interference in Libya, a senior State Department official refused to condemn or even comment on it, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a topic I don\u2019t really want to get into today.\u201d\n\nThat official referred questions to White House national security aides, who also refused to comment. Then, just days ago, another State Department official suggested Russia was being more helpful in \u201cpromoting a stable, unified and prosperous Libya.\u201d\n\nBut at least in some quarters, suspicions linger about Moscow\u2019s intentions. \u201cWe remain concerned, and it should be no surprise Russia is trying to develop relationships in their best interests,\u201d General Waldhauser said in response to questions from The Times.", "title": "As Trump Wavers on Libya, an ISIS Haven, Russia Presses On", "authors": ["Jo Becker", "Eric Schmitt"]}
{"date": "2018-01-31 00:00:00", "text": "Desperate for a strong regional ally in the fight against the Islamic State, both the Trump and Obama administrations eagerly worked with Kurdish forces in Syria, even though allies of those forces were waging an insurgency across the border in Turkey, a NATO ally.\n\nNow, American successes against the Islamic State are threatened by Turkish attacks on the Syrian Kurds. The clash, long feared, could provoke a wider war and a division of Syria into zones of influence. But stopping it would require a diplomatic commitment on all sides that has so far been lacking.\n\nThe confrontation began last week when Turkish forces crossed the border into Syria and attacked Kurdish troops, who control the northwestern town of Afrin. Since then, events have escalated, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatening to take the fight to the Kurdish-controlled town of Manbij, where American Special Operations forces are based. He is also talking about expelling the Kurds and resettling the area with Syrian refugees.\n\nThe Kurds, known as the People\u2019s Protection Units, dominate the Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella organization that receives American training, weapons and air support. The Turks consider them terrorists, indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party that has waged a separatist war in Turkey for more than 30 years. While the Syrian group plays down its ties to the organization in Turkey, and there are differences, links do exist. The two groups have common roots, but experts say the Syrian contingent has largely kept a 2012 promise not to provide material support to the Turkish Kurds, who are formally recognized as a terrorist group by the United States and Europe.", "title": "Opinion | As U.S. Allies Clash, the Fight Against ISIS Falters", "authors": []}

She moved to New York City in 2000 to be a visual artist after finishing her master\u2019s degree at Rutgers University. To pay the rent, she worked with nonprofit organizations that sent artists into schools. DreamYard Project was one of them.\n\n\u201cI got to see so many different schools and had to collaborate directly with teachers,\u201d Ms. Wargo said. \u201cI got to see what a well-run classroom looks like, and what a not-well-run classroom looks like.\u201d\n\nWhen DreamYard Project was starting a school, the founders suggested she become its visual arts teacher. She thought she would stay for a year, she said, but loved it. At the end of her second year teaching, her principal asked if she would like to become an assistant principal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought about it before, but I said yes immediately,\u201d Ms. Wargo said as she sat in her office, where the standard-issue education department desk and computer were augmented by a colorful rug and a purple beanbag chair. She said she did not miss painting \u2014 people ask her all the time \u2014 because running a school requires plenty of creativity.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taught to really think outside the box when you\u2019re educated in the arts,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it teaches you to take criticism very well. In grad school in particular, you put your painting on the wall you just get ripped to shreds. So I\u2019m able to listen when people say this is or isn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nWhen Ms. Wargo took over as principal in the spring of 2012, the young school had yet to find its footing. Just a few months later, DreamYard was designated one of the lowest-performing schools in the state, so Ms. Wargo was not surprised when the de Blasio administration put it into the Renewal program.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs part of Renewal, Ms. Wargo and her staff were trained to use a Harvard University method of analyzing student data. A nonprofit group, Counseling in Schools, began helping to push students to come to school regularly, though attendance remains a challenge. DreamYard and its partner organizations were able to start paying students minimum wage for internships. And crucially, Ms. Wargo said, school was extended by an hour every day. Three days a week, that time is spent on academics. The other two days a week, students experiment with professional and vocational possibilities that interest them, while their teachers work with one another to improve instruction.\n\nOn a recent afternoon during that added hour, a group of students heated noodles on a hot plate in cooking class. Down the hall, six of their classmates sat in a circle discussing how they might sell a sugar scrub to manicure customers. In another room, a music production instructor played two clips of music, one with an additional effect, and asked students if they could hear the difference.\n\nThere has been concern among some educators that the Renewal program might become an albatross for schools. Once they were branded as troubled, would teachers and families avoid them? At DreamYard, enrollment has fallen since the school was placed in the program. But students and teachers say the issue predates Renewal: Families are wary of any school in the Taft building, which has a long and troubled history. Teachers there threatened to walk out in 2002 because the school was so violent, according to the InsideSchools website. In 1997, a Taft teacher was tortured and shot to death in his home, and a former student was convicted of the murder.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen I was an eighth grader and told people I was going to Taft, people said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to get jumped!\u2019\u201d said Carlos Abreu, a senior theater major who started wearing ties to school every day this year, even though the school has no uniform. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like that at all. If you ever hear someone say don\u2019t go to DreamYard, don\u2019t listen to them.\u201d\n\nOf the 94 schools originally in the Renewal program, the education department has decided to close or merge 32 of them; 21 have made enough progress to graduate into Rise.\n\n\u201cRenewal isn\u2019t a formula,\u201d Ms. Wargo said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like if you do this and do this and do this, your school will be better \u2014 you\u2019re dealing with real people. A curriculum doesn\u2019t turn around a school, a community does.\u201d\n\nThe big question now for schools like DreamYard is whether they can continue to improve. As a Rise school, not much will change at first. The school will be funded at the same level as when it was in Renewal, and will be able to keep its extra hour per day \u2014 time that, at DreamYard, will cost $170,615 this school year alone. For now, the main differences will be a bit more independence, and things like instructional support will come through regular Education Department channels rather than the Renewal Schools office.\n\n\u201cMy understanding of being a Rise school is that it\u2019s a vote of confidence: You have enough systems and supports in place to maintain improvement,\u201d Mr. Wargo said.\n\n\u201cOur data is what it is; I know we\u2019re not a perfect school,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are a lot of challenges.

Paul Schechter, an M.I.T. astronomer involved in the work called it Wfirst, for Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope. The acronym had a double meaning: \u201cW\u201d is the name for a crucial parameter that measures the virulence of dark energy.

Shortly after the academy\u2019s deliberations, the space agency admitted that the Webb project had been mismanaged. The telescope, which had been set for a 2014 launching, would require at least another $1.6 billion and several more years to finish. The Webb will search out the first stars and galaxies to have formed in the universe, but is not designed for dark energy. It is now on course to be launched next year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWfirst would have to wait.\n\nTo take up the slack until 2025 \u2014 or whenever the American mission can finally fly \u2014 the space agency bought a share in a European dark-energy mission known as Euclid, now scheduled to launch in 2021. But Euclid is not as comprehensive as Wfirst would be; it will not use supernovas, for example.\n\nThe story took another dramatic twist in June 2012, capturing headlines when the National Reconnaissance Office, which operates spy satellites, offered NASA a leftover telescope, essentially a close relative of the Hubble, that had been designed to look down instead of up.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt had a wide field of view, which could enable inspecting large areas of the heavens for supernovae.\n\nIts primary mirror \u2014 like the Hubble 94 inches in diameter \u2014 is twice as big as the one that was being contemplated for Wfirst, giving it four times the light-gathering power and a deep reach into the cosmos.\n\nThe gift would save them the cost of fashioning a whole new telescope, but it was not without strings. As several astronomers pointed out, using a bigger telescope would mean a bigger, more expensive camera and more complicated back-end optics would have to be built. Nevertheless, the Academy bought into the idea.\n\nLately another controversial element has been added to the mission, a coronagraph, which could be used to block the light from a star so that faint planets near them can be discerned.\n\nLast summer an independent review panel appointed by NASA and led by Fiona Harrison, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, endorsed the mission\u2019s basic science goals and methodology while cautioning against mission creep that could cause its costs to balloon.\n\nThe ball is now in Congress\u2019s court.\n\nMichael Turner, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said, \u201cWhile one never wants to hear that someone important has recommended cancellation of your favorite project, I believe that like last year, Congress will be doing the budget writing.

It also threatens to overshadow some of the trial\u2019s testimony, which to this point has been focused on the behind-the-scenes deal making and name-dropping that prosecutors have said typified Albany for far too long.\n\nMr. Percoco is charged with accepting bribes in return for official actions on behalf of upstate developers; Mr. Howe claims he facilitated the bribes.\n\nBoth knew the sway that the governor\u2019s name held over the other. As federal prosecutors tell it, as Mr. Percoco and Mr. Howe hatched a complicated corruption scheme, both bandied Mr. Cuomo\u2019s name to spur the other to action or to press their own advantages.\n\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has not been accused of any wrongdoing, and he has distanced himself from Mr. Percoco \u2014 the man he had once called his father\u2019s third son \u2014 since his arrest in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the governor\u2019s omnipresence in the testimony suggests that both men were highly cognizant of the power of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s name, and of how even the suggestion of his approbation could help get the results they wanted.\n\nIn 2013, one of Mr. Howe\u2019s clients, an executive with the energy firm Competitive Power Ventures, was eager to win a state contract. Mr. Howe reached out to Mr. Percoco, asking him to try and ensure the client\u2019s success. (The executive, Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr., is one of Mr. Percoco\u2019s three co-defendants.)\n\nMr. Howe told Mr. Percoco that a competing firm had enlisted \u201csome former Pataki guy\u201d to lobby on its behalf \u2014 an apparent reference to someone with ties to former Gov. George E. Pataki. It was well-known that Mr. Pataki, a Republican, was a persona non grata in the Cuomo world, having unseated the governor\u2019s father, Mario M.

At an appearance on Long Island on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said he had \u201ca great deal of respect for the legal process\u201d and would not comment on continuing testimony.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Percoco used Mr. Cuomo\u2019s name to nudge Mr. Howe to help him find a lucrative job in the private sector.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Howe testified that when he seemed to equivocate on finding Mr. Percoco a position with Whiteman Osterman and Hanna, the Albany-based lobbying firm for which Mr. Howe worked, Mr. Percoco told him that \u201che had gotten approval from the governor himself\u201d to work for the firm.\n\nWhen Mr. Howe suggested that his firm in particular might not be the right fit, Mr. Percoco tried a different tack.\n\n\u201cThe governor said it was O.K. for me to be hired by your clients,\u201d Mr. Howe said Mr. Percoco had told him.\n\nAsked about Mr. Howe\u2019s claims, Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, pointed to a news conference in 2016 in which Mr. Cuomo said that he had known Mr. Percoco might take private consulting work after leaving the executive chamber in 2014, but that he did not know with whom or the nature of the work.\n\nMr. Howe has testified repeatedly to the financial and professional benefits he saw in highlighting \u2014 and, according to the governor\u2019s office, exaggerating \u2014 his ties to Mr. Cuomo. He would often forward emails that he received from Mr. Percoco to his clients, but not before editing them to make it seem as if Mr. Percoco had described Mr. Howe\u2019s importance to the governor.\n\nIn May 2010, for example, when Mr. Percoco sent Mr. Howe an email asking him to join Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign for governor, Mr. Howe forwarded it to several associates, but only after doctoring it to make it seem as if Mr. Percoco had also written, \u201cI need to tell A.C.

He has a curious family connection to Manchester United: His maternal grandmother, Doreen Carling, is mentioned in Alex Ferguson\u2019s autobiography as the great manager\u2019s \u201cfirst steady girlfriend.\u201d\n\nThey dated for 18 months or so as teenagers in Glasgow \u201cbefore it suffered the fate of most first romances and petered out,\u201d Ferguson wrote, and ended completely when Carling moved to New York and married.

But it was not until 2013 that United decided that Twitter was not just \u2014 or not only, anyway \u2014 a self-indulgent fad. It was the last team in both the Premier League and the Champions League to join.\n\nIt waited five more years to decide that YouTube, too, is here to stay. Quite why United has been so reticent to enter this brave new world is not clear, though the most obvious explanation may also be the most convincing: If something does not directly drive revenue, the club\u2019s hierarchy \u2014 and the Glazer family that sits at its head \u2014 has tended not to be especially interested.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt last, though, United has taken the plunge. Its channel is already replete with the staples of social media: videos offering exclusive access and behind-the-scenes footage, as well as a raft of famous matches \u2014 wins, all of them, obviously \u2014 condensed into two-and-a-half-minute highlight reels. Like all social media, YouTube prizes brevity, immediacy, punchiness. The world United has finally entered is one of bite-size content, easily shared hits of pleasure.\n\nWhether that is a world this United vintage is suited to is a different matter. As soccer, and sports in general, pivot toward the bright digital horizon, it is worth considering Marshall McLuhan\u2019s adage that the medium is the message. Clubs cannot hope simply to exploit the power and reach of social media without being shaped by them in some way, too.\n\nThe way audiences consume soccer \u2014 and everything else \u2014 is changing. Fans no longer have to watch a whole 90-minute match. Often, they do not even need to see extended highlights. United\u2019s audience, and those of its peers, may be time-rich, but it is attention-poor. The minute we are not entertained, there is a powerful temptation to skip forward.\n\nYou can see goals, in clips of no more than a few seconds, on Twitter. The best tricks or the most egregious errors are replicated in the form of even briefer GIFs. A player can now be reduced to a YouTube compilation lasting barely a couple of minutes. This is the future, and in the future, nobody will pay attention to anything for 15 minutes.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat is significant for the way all clubs \u2014 and superclubs like United, in particular \u2014 are run. Fans and owners of soccer\u2019s great names have always demanded not just success, but style, too.

Neither is an attacking coach in the same way that Pep Guardiola, of Manchester City, or even Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Tottenham\u2019s Mauricio Pochettino is.

But watching United recover to beat Chelsea, 2-1, on Sunday, it was hard not to wonder if this was enough, now, given how much soccer\u2019s priorities have changed. Is it enough, as Mourinho said, for a club of United\u2019s scope and scale to have a \u201chumble attitude,\u201d to be diligent and determined, to eke out victory through gritted teeth?\n\nIt might be, of course, if the reward at the end was a polished silver trophy with ribbons attached. In the Premier League, at least, though, it will not. United\u2019s win here returned Mourinho\u2019s team to second place in the table, above Liverpool, but it remains far adrift of City. Defeat meant Chelsea fell behind Tottenham Hotspur, into fifth.\n\nThere are still prizes to play for, of course: Both United and Chelsea might soon reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League; one or both might return to that stage next year, too.\n\nBut if the worst happens, then what can Mourinho and Conte fall back on? For Klopp and Pochettino \u2014 neither of whom, it should be said, has won a trophy with his current team \u2014 there is a style and a swagger, a sense that these are teams fans want to watch, teams that make waves, and go viral.\n\nNeither United nor Chelsea can say the same.

And a striking contrast to the designer\u2019s all-black gowns worn by Kerry Washington and Issa Rae at the Golden Globes in January, in solidarity with the recently formed Time\u2019s Up movement. \u201cWhen I see women wearing all black, I respect that solidarity. But I also don\u2019t ever want to forget the power of color. It can be quite impactful,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs this week marks the first fashion season in the wake of the #MeToo movement, there\u2019s been much speculation over how designers would address the current climate. But for Gurung, feminism and female empowerment have always been core ideas since before the launch of his brand in 2009.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His fall 2013 collection, for example, drew inspiration from Ukraine\u2019s Asgarda, a modern-day tribe of female warriors. On Saturday, he wore a sweatshirt printed with the phrase \u201cLove is the resistance,\u201d similar to the T-shirts bearing feminist slogans worn down the runway for his finale last season. This time around, the models would hold white roses, a gesture to invoke the act of listening as a necessary counterpart to vocal declarations. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been asking if I\u2019m going to do another T-shirt,\u201d Gurung said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve already done it. Especially this time around, especially as a man, my job is to listen. If any man or men are to learn anything from this, it is to really listen to women. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nIt is now Sunday evening at Spring Studios in TriBeCa. As frenzied hair and makeup preparations take place upstairs, Gurung is seated in the main gallery where the show will take place, silently watching the sand artist Joe Mangrum, create the show\u2019s only set design: three intricately detailed \u201csand paintings\u201d sprawled across the runway floor. \u201cIt\u2019s about the idea of impermanence, which I\u2019m really fascinated by,\u201d the designer says. \u201cBuddhist monks spend hours and days creating something like this, and once it\u2019s done, they blow it away.

Sixteen years later, I had come for the forests of Lothlorien, the peaks of the Misty Mountains, the hills of the Shire. But it was in the huts that I immersed myself in the culture of those landscapes and spent time with the people who know and value them most. New Zealand\u2019s wild spaces deserve their fantastical reputation, but it is the country\u2019s commitment to this vast network of public huts that fosters something unique: a community of strangers even in the most remote backcountry.\n\nApproaching Cameron Hut, I wondered what I would find inside. No two huts are the same. Some are blaze orange, others beige. Some are over a century old, others less than a decade.

That night in Cardiff, Real completed what P\u00e9rez would later describe as \u201cthe best season, in terms of title triumphs, in our 115-year history.\u201d To the European Super Cup, the World Club Championship and the Spanish title was added a second consecutive Champions League crown. Real Madrid became the first team in the modern era to retain the trophy. To P\u00e9rez, it was \u201cthe latest symbol of our legendary status: achieving something that had previously seemed impossible.\u201d\n\nQuite how abnormal that season was has been laid bare in the months since. When Real Madrid returns to Champions League action on Wednesday, it will do so with its season in ruins: Zidane\u2019s team sits fourth in La Liga, 17 points adrift of Barcelona. A spokesman for the Asociaci\u00f3n de Socios de Real Madrid (SRM) \u2014 an advocacy group representing the 100,000 member-owners of the club \u2014 described it as \u201cpossibly the worst season in the club\u2019s history, an absolute failure of monumental proportions.\u201d\n\nThis time, Europe, as it so often has under P\u00e9rez, provides no balm. Real\u2019s whole season may hinge on its Round of 16 tie against a surging Paris Saint-Germain and the usual bulletproof confidence that Ronaldo and the rest will deliver in the Champions League has melted away. Defeat, and elimination, is a real possibility.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt Real Madrid, that would mean only one thing: change. In P\u00e9rez\u2019s two spells as president \u2014 from 2000 to 2006 and from 2009 onward \u2014 he has transformed his club into a sort of sporting Disneyland, a Panglossian paradise where everything is for the best, an endless victory parade. The image has to be maintained at all costs. \u201cAny voice that is critical of his thinking is crossed out immediately as \u2018anti-Madridista,\u2019 \u201d SRM said of P\u00e9rez in an email. It is a mentality that also applies to fans and journalists.\n\nDefeat, meanwhile, simply does not exist. Real Madrid TV, available for free to viewers throughout Spain, covers every Real game but does not hold live broadcast rights. It shows games Real has won in the days that follow. Footage of defeats \u2014 and sometimes ties, too \u2014 is quietly forgotten.\n\nP\u00e9rez\u2019s view of Real simply does not countenance the idea that it might lose games, at least not deservedly. When he first met Aleksander Ceferin, the then-recently installed president of UEFA, P\u00e9rez\u2019s opening gambit was to ask why Real Madrid endured so many injustices at the hands of referees. Any setback, in P\u00e9rez\u2019s eyes, could only be attributed to officials\u2019 incompetence or to dark conspiracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, fostering this ruthless, relentless culture has brought Real \u2014 and by extension its president \u2014 no little reward: the European trophies; the title, bestowed by Forbes, of the most valuable sports brand on the planet; more than 200 million followers on social media.\n\nBut it all comes at a cost. Failure is not tolerated. Players who do not perform are replaced. Managers who do not deliver are fired. The question that lingers, ahead of the game against P.S.G., is whether the same goes for presidents.\n\nEven within his Disneyland, there are those who feel that would not be a bad thing. Throughout P\u00e9rez\u2019s reign, there has been a constant murmur of dissent from a small but significant section of Real\u2019s socios, who look beyond the glistening trophies to see a disturbing future ahead.\n\n\u201cThere is a perception that Florentino\u2019s cycle has come to an end,\u201d said Eugenio Mart\u00ednez Bravo, a leader of Plataforma Blanca, one of a number of groups that has sprung up in recent years to defend the interests of the socios.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There is a lack of democracy and of transparency. Florentino has been in power for nearly 10 years, and nobody has ever voted for him.\u201d\n\nWhen P\u00e9rez returned as president in 2009, he did so unopposed (and to widespread popular acclaim). He has since called elections in 2013 and 2017, but again, has not had to face a rival candidate.\n\nSome socios argue that was by design; Real\u2019s statutes have been tightened under P\u00e9rez\u2019s aegis, and now dictate that any candidate for president has to have been a member of the club for more than 20 years \u2014 P\u00e9rez is socio 2486 \u2014 and must provide a bank guarantee for personal wealth of \u20ac75 million (more than $92 million).\n\nPhoto\n\nIn theory, the changes were designed to protect Real from being taken over by a foreign owner; in reality, Mart\u00ednez Bravo joked, the effect has been that now \u201cto be president of Real Madrid, you have to be called Florentino.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you ask outside Madrid who owns Real, probably 70 percent would say Florentino, and not its members,\u201d said a spokesman for another socios group, Movimiento Ambar, which was formed in 2015 to press for P\u00e9rez\u2019s resignation and new elections.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNone of these groups dispute that P\u00e9rez has brought Real considerable success; Steven Mandis, author of \u201cThe Real Madrid Way,\u201d even argues that the stability brought about by P\u00e9rez\u2019s infallibility has been a root cause of that success, inuring Real to the uncertainty \u2014 experienced by Barcelona, for one \u2014 brought about by executive power shifts.\n\nThe fear, though, is that P\u00e9rez is now so firmly ensconced that Real Madrid is no longer, in any real sense, a club owned by its own fans. \u201cIn practice, that has been completely forgotten,\u201d a spokesman for SRM said. Movimiento Ambar\u2019s spokesman was even more emotive. \u201cWe have gone from being members to being customers and viewers,\u201d he said.\n\nRumors swirl that P\u00e9rez plans to take the club out of the hands of the socios entirely, to list it on the stock exchange; Movimiento Ambar said it \u201cwill fight until the last moment\u201d to prevent that happening.\n\nEven if it does not, Mart\u00ednez Bravo fears what will happen to Real Madrid when P\u00e9rez, 70, decides to retire, since there is no evidence of a succession plan. None of P\u00e9rez\u2019s opponents hold out any great hope for immediate change, however: no elections are scheduled until 2021.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken to big businesses, to banks, to see if they would back a candidate to run against him,\u201d Mart\u00ednez Bravo said. \u201cBut they all said the same thing: he is too powerful.\u201d\n\nA glance at the directors\u2019 box at the Bernabeu at almost any game bears that out: the seats are filled by owners and editors of news media outlets and television stations, politicians, captains of industry. One newspaper has described it as \u201cthe Court of King Florentino.\u201d\n\nJust how widespread the disaffection actually is may be hard to assess. Movimiento Ambar claims to speak for \u201cthousands\u201d of fans, but Mart\u00ednez Bravo, for one, admits that the pressure for change has eased in recent years, thanks to all those Champions League victories.\n\nHe knows \u2014 though he takes no pleasure in saying it; he is a Real Madrid fan, after all \u2014 that losing to P.S.G. might change that. Early elimination from the Champions League, and failure on the domestic front, might draw more rebels to his cause.\n\n\u201cThis year may be a turning point,\u201d he said. P\u00e9rez has retained his power by achieving things that are simply not normal.

Mr. Khan\u2019s lawyers say the university covertly influenced the police inquiry, working hand-in-glove with officers in a way that has compromised Mr. Khan\u2019s right to a fair trial. They argue that Yale, under fire for not taking sexual assault on its campus seriously, blurred the line between school and law enforcement in the name of proving that it did.\n\nAs universities across the country face mounting pressure \u2014 if not from the federal government, then from public opinion, amid the #MeToo movement \u2014 to act on sexual misconduct, that line may become even blurrier.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about which institution is better,\u201d said Janet Halley, a Harvard Law School professor who has written about the legal implications of Title IX enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s about what happens when you put two institutions into the same process and they have different rationalities, different institutional cultures \u2014 but above all different rights attached to them.\n\n\u201cThis is oil and water flowing in together.\u201d\n\nAccording to an affidavit signed by a Yale police officer, Mr. Khan and his accuser, who is identified only as \u201cthe victim,\u201d were seniors who lived in the same dormitory. She considered him an acquaintance, the victim said, and they had never been in a romantic relationship.\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2015, the victim ate dinner with Mr. Khan, then attended an off-campus party, where Mr. Khan was also present. After the party, the victim and her friends returned to campus to watch the student orchestra\u2019s Halloween show, a school tradition.\n\nBy that point, the victim said, she had at least four drinks and was so drunk that Yale staff asked her to step out of line after she struggled to pull up her orchestra ticket on her cellphone. When she rejoined the line, her friends had disappeared. Mr. Khan was by her side instead.\n\nThey sat together during the show, during which she vomited several times. Afterward, Mr. Khan walked her back to her dorm room, where she vomited again.

The plodding pace of prosecutions is a frequently cited deterrent to reporting. The trial has also made the incident far more public than an internal investigation would have. Public court records lay out in stark detail the victim\u2019s account of the night, her friends\u2019 names, and details such as how much she had to drink and what she was wearing.\n\nJennifer Long, chief executive officer of AEquitas, a group that advises prosecutors on trying accusations of violence against women, said victims often fear that those details, if publicly disclosed, would invite attacks on their credibility.\n\nThe debate around who should handle investigations seems unlikely to fade.

The doctor would be tailoring our treatments after identifying our dosha \u2014 the Sanskrit term used for a person\u2019s biological constitution, which is made up of a combination of elements: vata (air and ether), pitta (fire and water) and kapha (earth and water).\n\nPhoto\n\nNicole and I checked into our room, one of 24 clustered Konkan villas made with local laterite stone, clay tiles and thatched roofs. Our villa had its own mini grass courtyard, a bathroom and shower open to the sky, an enclosed air-conditioned bedroom and a second-floor deck ideal for practicing yoga, napping or taking in the black-faced langur monkeys that catapulted from tree limb to limb. Unpacking our pricey leggings and fitted tank tops, we answered the door for a hotel worker who delivered two pairs of off-white cotton drawstring pants and matching boxy tops \u2014 a yoga apparel set for each of us.

After taking my pulse and blood pressure, he asked me if I had any \u201cbody disturbances.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mean injuries, I have a few,\u201d I answered, a bit confused.

Reaching for the questionnaire I\u2019d completed on the bus ride, Dr. Varun marked in all capital letters: Pitta-Kapha.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo beat the intense heat, our days began with yoga at 6 a.m. Mats were waiting when we entered the yoga shala, Sanskrit for house, and Ms. Carlson led us in breathing exercises, meditations, chanting and poses to awaken our bodies. She encouraged us to pause and be mindful of the sounds \u2014 we heard many chirping kingfisher birds \u2014 smells and sights outside the open windows. For cooling down the body\u2019s temperature, Ms. Carlson taught us sheetali breathing, during which we exhaled through a curled tongue or gritted teeth. Her teaching and crisp voice were a consistent, calming presence in a place where the heat, aromas, sounds and flavors felt, at times, overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019m here to invite in reminders to be and not just do, to pause and take time to reflect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an invitation to slow down and taste test India with some Kripalu-style yoga.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith more limber bodies and quieter minds, we went each morning from yoga to breakfast at the Cocum, the open-air dining room at the center of the resort \u2014 named after the reddish-purple fruit used in aruyvedic medicine to treat sores, improve digestion and lessen arthritis pain. All meals were included in our retreat, and breakfast included a daily selection of eggs to order, oatmeal and freshly cut fruit. In an effort to stay hydrated, I refilled my water bottle frequently from the large water tanks located at the yoga shala and domed meditation hut. I quickly learned, though, that ayurvedic doctrine recommends lukewarm water for optimal absorption into the body, so at meals, the water is served slightly warm with added natural flavors, such as fenugreek or cumin, that changed daily.\n\nPhoto\n\nFood \u2014 what, when and how much \u2014 plays an important role in ayurveda. Lunch and dinner at SwaSwara \u2014 served at either the Cocum or by the beach in a shady grove called the Beach Grill \u2014 began with a juice of the day (blueberry-lime blast anyone?), followed by an appetizer such as cucumber peanut salad or garden almond gazpacho, a choice of two main dishes, like fish curry cooked in Indian spices and cocum, or vegetable korma made with mixed vegetables, coriander, mint and coconut paste. Desserts were lacking in chocolate for my taste, but some, like ginger-baked banana and date squares, went over well with guests. The food is organic and every meal consisted of fresh, locally grown or sourced ingredients \u2014 mainly vegetables and fish \u2014 with a plated amount meant to leave you satiated, but not full, which, according to ayurveda, is easier on digestion.\n\nOur days at SwaSwara were unhurried and spacious, sprinkled with yoga, a late-morning group activity \u2014 bird-watching, nature walk, boat ride \u2014 a body treatment, a swim in the pool, or a walk along Om beach, where cows amble aimlessly, leaving hoof prints in the sand alongside those of vacationers\u2019. Gathering in the meditation hut in the late afternoon, our Kripalu group \u2014 save for those who were napping \u2014 sat for a guided meditation or a gentle yoga class, led by Ms. Carlson or a resident teacher. I tried hard not to doze during a yoga nidra class led by Jayalakshmi Moily, whose melodic voice brought me right to the intended dreamy state of consciousness between waking and sleeping.\n\nOn Thursday morning, we left the hotel grounds for an outing to Gokarna village, a 15-minute ride via tuk-tuk, a three-wheeled motorized rickshaw. Our guide, Matthew Raj \u2014 who doubles as SwaSwara\u2019s art teacher \u2014 led us to Mahabaleshwar, a sacred 4th-century Hindu temple and pilgrimage site; to the Koti Tirtha, a sacred water tank used for ritual bathing; and to some shops where we could buy mala bead necklaces, traditionally used in prayer and meditation, and pretty fashionable in yoga and meditation circles.\n\nThursday is market day, and we joined the meandering cows and throngs of locals, perusing the fresh fruits, vegetables and mounds of ginger piled atop tarps on the ground. Mr. Minhas Singh gave each of us 100 rupees (about $1.50) to buy some fresh ingredients, which the SwaSwara chef would use later that afternoon in a cooking demonstration. I spent 60 rupees on a kilogram of purple eggplants, and the rest on crisp, white daikon radishes. Nicole and another guest, Dana Rhoden, a publicist from Miami, pooled their cash to buy some cauliflower, a pricier choice than mine, costing about 150 rupees, or $2.30.\n\nAfter our morning in the crowded village, returning to SwaSwara was a chance to fall back into serenity. That afternoon, I was scheduled for a rejuvenation body treatment, with the addition of murivenna oil, made from a blend of herbs, which Dr. Varun selected because, he said, it increases circulation, and would help heal my muscle and joint soreness. All three of my treatments were given with four hands by Anchu Ajikrishna, a petite 20-year-old massage therapist, and an assistant. I held in my laughter as the assistant farted loudly \u2014 in ayurveda, passing gas is encouraged for colon health \u2014 while heating herbs and oil over a small flame. Ms. Ajikrishna tied a disposable undergarment around my waist and guided me to sit on a stool, before placing her hands over my head to chant a Sanskrit prayer, which, translated by Dr. Varun, asks \u201cthe unknown supreme God and great physician to heal the body from all miseries, body and mind.\u201d\n\nThe four hands swept in unison up and down my body \u2014 front and back \u2014 in what felt like a choreographed dance during each treatment. Once the oil rubbing or salt scrubbing part was over, Ms. Ajikrishna instructed me to wash my face and body in an outdoor shower with green mung bean powder, an herbal exfoliant used to cleanse the skin without removing the oil\u2019s benefits. Dry and wrapped in a green robe, I was led back to the stool where Ms. Ajikrishna had recited the prayer. While I sipped a cup of herbal tea with honey, she rubbed rasna churna powder \u2014 a mix of plant roots and herbs \u2014 into my scalp to maintain the temperature of my body. To finish off the treatment, she placed an orange bindi (a dot, in Sanskrit) made from sandalwood paste, at the center of my forehead, an additional ayurvedic strategy for cooling down the body in the summertime heat.\n\nOur group had its final gathering in the meditation hut on Saturday afternoon, where Ms. Carlson asked us to reflect on our experience and share what we hoped to take home with us. \u201cI\u2019d like to make regular space for a yoga practice that is gentle and nurturing, and not one where I am pushing my body too hard,\u201d I said. A few of us shed tears, touching on feelings of loss and resilience. \u201cAs the baby of the group, I\u2019ve gained so much from the wisdom of these women who have shared some of their life experiences with me,\u201d said Nicole, the youngest guest by nearly two decades.\n\nOn the morning of our departure from SwaSwara, I unintentionally woke up at 4:30 a.m. Like the dolphins who leapt from the water earlier in the week, I felt some sort of magnetic pull from the outside. Trying not to awaken Nicole, I put on clothes, grabbed a flashlight and made my way along a path in the darkness to Meditation Hill, an open-air cliffside structure with straw mats and a view overlooking the Arabian Sea and Om beach. I sat down, closed my eyes, and listened to the waves, thinking of my brother, and the healing and nurturing this place provided.

Two of the women ended up on top of an Olympic podium at these Games and two more came close.\n\nThey also worked together to persuade the International Ski Federation to support them. Randall and Finland\u2019s Aino-Kaisa Saarinen were able to get federation officials to provide credentials for caregivers and to find space for baby rooms \u2014 stocked with diapers and toys \u2014 that doubled as a warm place for children and the people watching over them during long events.\n\n\u201cMen can have families, and they don\u2019t ever have to miss a single race,\u201d said Randall, who has pink highlights in her blond hair and is as ripped as a ninja warrior. \u201cKnowing we were all having babies, we lobbied to have some support for moms that first season back. It\u2019s the first time the international federation has provided that kind of support.\u201d\n\nWhile those changes helped, all of the other mothers lived in Europe and didn\u2019t face the same challenges Randall did in packing up her family and traveling for six months out of the year. For Randall, the only way to make the ski season successful as both an athlete and a parent was to enlist the support of her teammates.\n\nTheir buy-in was never in doubt. Randall has long been at the elite level of cross-country skiing, and several of her current teammates idolized her when they were teenagers. The goal was for Randall to spend time training with the team and still be there for her family. It helped that her husband, Jeff Ellis, a former Canadian ski racer, worked as a media coordinator for the International Ski Federation.

{"date": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "One thing that is clear to me following the special counsel\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians and three companies for interfering with our election is that the black vote was specifically under attack, from sources foreign and domestic. And this attack appeared to be particularly focused on young black activist-minded voters passionate about social justice: The \u201cWoke\u201d Vote.\n\nThe tragic irony is that these young people, many of whom already felt like the American political system was failing them, were encouraged to lay down one of the most powerful political tools they have, thereby ensuring an amplification of their own oppressions.\n\nThe indictment proclaims that the defendants acted as Americans to create social media pages and groups \u201cwhich addressed divisive U.S. political and social issues.\u201d But that is a phrase so broad and bland as to obscure the piercing truth that the indictment reveals: Referencing actual voter suppression, it says that \u201cin or around the latter half of 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, through their personas, began to encourage U.S. minority groups not to vote in the 2016 U.S. presidential election or to vote for a third-party U.S. presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the indictment includes some examples of that effort to suppress:\n\n\u201cOn or about October 16, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used the Instagram account \u2018Woke Blacks\u2019 to post the following message: \u2018Particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u2019 \u201d Coincidentally (or not!) this was the exact same tack being taken by the Trump campaign during that time. Just before the election, a senior Trump campaign official told Bloomberg Businessweek, \u201cWe have three major voter suppression operations under way,\u201d in which Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201c1996 suggestion that some African-American males are \u2018super predators\u2019 is the basis of a below-the-radar effort to discourage infrequent black voters from showing up at the polls \u2014 particularly in Florida.\u201d This suppression may well have worked better against black people than other targets.", "title": "Opinion | Attacking the \u2018Woke\u2019 Black Vote", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "Auction houses such as Christie\u2019s, Sotheby\u2019s and Phillips are companies with high overheads whose way of doing business hasn\u2019t changed that much since the 18th century. Their challenge is to keep up with the growth of global wealth \u2014 and make money out of it. Each of the three is pursuing a distinctively different strategy.\n\n\u201cIt is a key moment for auction houses, which have struggled for significant profitability,\u201d said Edward Dolman, chief executive of Phillips. Mr. Dolman was referring to the way that in recent years, auction houses have sacrificed large portions of their fees to sellers in order to secure high-value consignments.\n\nMr. Dolman said that Phillips, owned by the Mercury Group, a luxury goods distributor based in Moscow, had decided to \u201cfocus on areas of the market showing significant lines of growth that follow the evolution of taste.\u201d\n\nTwentieth-century and contemporary art is the company\u2019s key selling category, raising $421.8 million at auction in 2017, or 60 percent of the annual total. The top auction price was the $28.8 million given in May in New York for the 1991 painting \u201cRosedale,\u201d by the Scottish-born artist Peter Doig.\n\nPhillips\u2019s art auctions are complemented by sales of 20th- and 21st-century design, photography and prints, with further revenue generated by luxury items such as watches and jewelry. In October, the company set a record for a wristwatch sold at auction when Paul Newman\u2019s Rolex Daytona sold for $17.8 million.\n\nPhillips is banking on live auctions of art and of luxury goods from the past 100 years to deliver growth from the global 0.1 percent. The company has preferred to invest in high-profile specialists, such as its new chairman, Cheyenne Westphal, formerly worldwide head of contemporary art at Sotheby\u2019s, than in technological innovation. Last year, Phillips held just two online-only auctions, both in collaboration with the web platform Artsy.\n\nBy contrast, Christie\u2019s, owned by Artemis, a company controlled by the French luxury retail magnate and art collector Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, looks to its own well-established program of online-only auctions to attract new buyers. It held 85 digital sales of luxury goods and lower-value collectibles in 2017, raising \u00a355.9 million, or about $80 million. This represented 1 percent of annual overall sales, but 37 percent of Christie\u2019s new buyers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last year Christie\u2019s sales were fairly evenly spread across the Americas, Europe and Asia. Looking to expand its global client base to places where new wealth is being generated, Christie\u2019s opened a gallery in Los Angeles in April. It then closed its second London salesroom in July. Underperforming categories have been rationalized. Christie\u2019s decorative arts departments have lost 45 employees worldwide, Mr. Cerutti said, 38 percent of their work force, and no longer hold traditional specialist auctions of English or French furniture.\n\nLast year, auctions generated about 90 percent of sales at both Christie\u2019s and Phillips. How can this market expand significantly when traditional collecting areas are falling out of fashion and when just 25 artists generate almost half of all auction sales of contemporary art?\n\nObviously, valuable, one-off consignments will always boost the figures. Christie\u2019s estimates that its forthcoming estate sale of the collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller will raise about $500 million.\n\nOtherwise auction houses \u201chave to be very creative,\u201d Mr. Cerruti said, pointing to Christie\u2019s inclusion of Leonardo\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d in a New York postwar and contemporary art sale. Nineteen minutes of bidding duly confirmed that this had been a marketing masterstroke. But it was also significant to note that last year, Christie\u2019s regular auctions of old master, 19th-century and Russian art were down 11 percent at \u00a3205.4 million, or about $293 million.\n\nAnd, of course, the market can also grow by buyers simply paying more. An extreme case in point occurred in May at Sotheby\u2019s, when the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa gave $110.5 million for a 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat painting of a skull.\n\n\u201cNew buyers are attracted by well-known brands,\u201d said Anders Petterson, managing director of the London-based analysts ArtTactic. \u201cHigh prices signal a sense of quality, which reinforces the brand, creating a circuit at the top end of the market,\u201d he added.\n\nIn December, Sotheby\u2019s said that it sold $4.7 billion of art and collectibles at auction in 2017, a 13.1 percent annual increase. That was short of the $6.6 billion of auction sales achieved by Christie\u2019s. But unlike its longtime rival, Sotheby\u2019s has diversified into areas such as financial services; art advice, including managing artists\u2019 estates; and even image recognition technology. Forthcoming full-year results will reveal how much of its revenue is now derived from such 21st-century business models.\n\nBut for the moment, the 18th-century model of live auctions continues to do nicely, tracking global economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe market has rebounded in all categories and all geographical areas,\u201d said Mr. Petterson of ArtTactic, which published a review last month of auctions worldwide in 2017. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t know how technology is going to change things.

He said trade-ins, in particular, could be tricky (something Audemars Piguet does not allow now).\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t impose their will on the secondary market like the primary market; they can\u2019t set the prices,\u201d Mr. Hallock said. \u201cWhat if you bring in your watch to A.P. and it\u2019s worth 30 percent of retail value? Do they tell you they\u2019re not interested? Do they give you 60 percent and eat the rest of it?\u201d\n\nMr. Bennahmias shared few details about the experiment, but emphasized that as an independent brand, Audemars Piguet could take its time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep doing it in Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cThen maybe a little in Japan, then in Singapore, then in New York, in a very subtle and discreet way.\u201d", "title": "Audemars Piguet Says \u2018Be Our Guest\u2019", "authors": ["Victoria Gomelsky"]}

From the moment the First Fleet arrived in Botany Bay in 1788 in what is now Sydney, security was provided by the British Army.\n\nThe indigenous population was displaced by force of arms, disease and appropriation of land, crimes for which many Australians still feel guilty. Prosperity, universal health care and unemployment benefits helped suppress crime.

They weren\u2019t worried about government oppression.\n\nOver time, Australians came to view firearms with suspicion. Most Australians have never held one.

Unlike many Americans, who might proudly show off their latest pistol or rifle, Australians who own and enjoy using firearms, like me, try to be discreet.\n\nAfter working in the same office for almost a decade, I\u2019ve never admitted to colleagues that I enjoy hunting, although I\u2019m always happy to discuss my last beach vacation.

Lawrence\u2019s book, to the scandalized delight of readers wily enough to score early samizdat copies. But now that anything goes, now that we\u2019ve seen it all, now that we have PornHub to amuse us on demand, is there anything left to get excited about? Should novelists try to counteract the numbing aspects of porn, as Gurganus advised in an interview, by giving the characters the gift of more active sex lives?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inverse ratio between the abundance of pornography and the scarcity of sex in modern fiction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talk about where people live, what they earn, what they eat, what they drive, but we\u2019re leaving out the question of their sexual pleasure, and that\u2019s depriving them of something extremely important.\u201d\n\nSex is notoriously tricky to describe. A writer\u2019s tumescent member is a reader\u2019s risible euphemism. \u201cNo throbbing manhoods,\u201d declared Jennifer Weiner, who wants her fictional sex to be consistent with what her characters would normally do and say: \u201cYou try to make the way people behave toward one another when they\u2019re in bed line up with the way they behave when they\u2019re out of bed.\u201d\n\nIn a climactic sex scene in the novel \u201cGolden Hill,\u201d set in mid-18th-century Manhattan, Francis Spufford\u2019s narrator briefly steps outside the story to grumble to the reader. \u201cHow hard it is to describe a desirable woman without running into geography! Or the barnyard. Or the resources of the fruit-bowl,\u201d he complains. \u201cI do not want to write this part of the story.\u201d\n\nStephen King agrees. \u201cEvery part of writing a novel is daunting, but very few novelists deal with sex very well,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cThe act is usually far better than writing (or reading) about the act.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it was better in the old days, he added. \u201cWhen I was a kid, reading my first adult paperbacks, the guy would take off the gal\u2019s blouse \u2026 they would kiss \u2026 then there would be a double space, after which the story would resume the following morning.\u201d\n\nNot so much now. As luck would have it, lots of writers are up for writing about sex \u2014 even, or maybe especially, when the sex isn\u2019t that good. (With her short story \u201cCat Person,\u201d Kristen Roupenian has perhaps created a new vernacular for expressing the particular ways it can be not-good for women who think they want it, but who become repelled mid-encounter by the weird or sloppy or selfish or alarming behavior of the men they go home with.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Meanwhile, Anthony Marra\u2019s story collection \u201cThe Tsar of Love and Techno\u201d includes a scene between a pair of desperately-in-love teenagers who have sex as if they were the first to discover it. Their age \u201callows for a little descriptive leeway, because so much of adolescent life is overwrought to begin with,\u201d Marra said in an email.\n\nWriting with pungent frankness about sex in \u201cJeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi,\u201d Geoff Dyer was inspired by the lyrical yet matter-of-fact gay eroticism in such Alan Hollinghurst novels as \u201cThe Line of Beauty.\u201d \u201cI was struck that he was writing this classical prose and then without any change of register suddenly he was writing in this very explicit, up-to-date way,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cI wondered whether it was possible to do a heterosexual version of that.\u201d\n\nHe also wanted to be sure everyone knew who was doing what when, how and to whom. \u201cGenerally speaking, I get frustrated and irritated when I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s happening\u201d in a novel, Dyer said. \u201cI want to know who\u2019s speaking and where they\u2019re going and all that.\u201d So for his sex scenes, \u201cI wanted it to be, \u2018This goes there and he does this. \u2026\u2019 Just the sort of mechanics of it.

The first is that Poland, by far the largest of the formerly Communist Central European nations that joined the European Union and NATO, has gone from poster child of liberty to standard-bearer of nationalist reaction, propelled by the phantasms of migrant waves and European Union \u201cinterference\u201d manipulated by Kaczynski. It is an extraordinary volte-face. It is also testimony to how illusory the triumph of liberalism in 1989 has proved under the pressure of globalization.\n\nThe second is that Donald Trump\u2019s United States, potentially the chief bulwark against illiberalism\u2019s rise, has gone AWOL. He gave Kaczynski and the nationalists a pass during his visit to Poland in July. Indeed, the president has been conducting his own campaign against an independent judiciary. He\u2019s called the American criminal justice system a \u201claughingstock\u2019 and \u201ca joke,\u201d dismissed the legal system as \u201cbroken,\u201d insulted judges, called for quick \u201cstrong justice\u201d (read the death penalty), and labeled courts as \u201cpolitical.\u201d The impression Trump leaves is that he\u2019d be happy with Vladimir Putin\u2019s law courts, Xi Jinping\u2019s press, and Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s war on drugs.\n\nAll this, of course, has empowered the likes of the Polish government. Anyone who seriously believes Trump is innocuous through incompetence on the world stage should think again.\n\nThe third is that Poland and Hungary, countries for which the European Union was a sanctuary from oppression as they emerged from Communism, now pose a direct challenge to a Union that rests on the principles of \u201cdemocracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.\u201d\n\nA formal European procedure has been initiated that could lead to the loss of Poland\u2019s voting rights within the Union; it should be pursued with vigor. Poland and Hungary cannot be allowed to sabotage without cost the club of which they have been, and remain, such conspicuous beneficiaries.\n\nThe fourth is the most serious. Independent courts (like a free press) hold power to account; they establish facts and truth. In their absence, the way is opened to Michnik\u2019s \u201cguillotine and the gulag.\u201d When truth goes, so does freedom.\n\nPoland\u2019s grotesque \u201cDeath Camp\u201d law, signed this month by President Duda, must therefore be seen as of a piece with a broader assault on truth.

But a measure passed by the House and being considered in the Senate to expand the National Instant Criminal Background Check System would not only fail to fix major flaws in the system but would also probably introduce new ones.\n\nLawmakers from both parties acknowledge that errors in the background check system let felons obtain guns, as we saw when a deranged man, Devin Kelley, killed 26 people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November. The killer, while in the Air Force, had been convicted of domestic violence in 2012, involuntarily committed to a mental health care center and given a bad conduct discharge. Yet the Air Force failed to follow policies to ensure that his conviction was reported to federal law enforcement, which allowed the killer to pass the check. The military has failed to report other such cases.\n\nThe background check measures before Congress aim to improve enforcement of existing law and increase such reporting by imposing financial penalties on government officials whose agencies fail to provide required information. That\u2019s a good goal, but any proposal should also fix another major problem with the background check system: false positives that stop law-abiding people from getting weapons that they might need to protect themselves and their families.\n\nThe background check system confuses the names of law-abiding individuals with those of criminals, resulting in thousands of \u201cfalse positives\u201d every year.

That means banks would mainly make the loans through online and mobile banking applications, and may need to factor in criteria other than traditional credit scores. For instance, banks might consider the length of the customer\u2019s relationship with the bank and the frequency of the customer\u2019s deposits.\n\nSpeed is crucial, Mr. Horowitz said, because unless the loans are available quickly and easily, borrowers will go elsewhere, since they typically seek payday loans when they are in distress. \u201cBorrowers will choose payday loans,\u201d he said, \u201cif banks aren\u2019t fast.\u201d\n\nBanks are in a good position to offer such loans, if regulators approve, Pew suggested.

Mr. Fraudener said he had searched for a way to collaborate with the elder Mr. Trummer for a number of years. The new restaurant has a dramatic painting on the ceiling, a drift of theatrical drapery and a large central bar with vintage scales, beakers and bottles, artifacts that have become Mr. Trummer\u2019s trademark. Mr. Frauneder\u2019s food will include small plates, like tea-smoked trout, deviled eggs, chicken liver mousse and homemade dill tofu. More substantial fare will include Wiener schnitzel and hanger steak with pumpkinseed chimichurri. Paired with the food will be Mr. Trummer\u2019s Freudish cocktails, like the Dream Interpreter, made with absinthe, saffron elixir and Cognac; and the Dreamer, with Champagne and elderflower essence: 506 LaGuardia Place (Houston Street), 212-777-0327, bar-freud.com\n\nOpening\n\nBASEMENT Capitalizing on the space beneath his new TriBeCa restaurant, Tetsu, Masayoshi Takayama has turned it into an intimate enclave for special kaiseki dinners served Wednesday, Thursday and Friday evenings, at $350 per person plus tax, tip and beverages.

(Miss Fanny\u2019s mother, the story noted, had been named Funny Girl.)\n\nPhoto\n\nIf the possibility of cloning your dog intrigues you, there is good news: You do not have to be an incredibly famous and highly acclaimed actor, director, producer and writer to have it done.\n\nYou do, however, need at least $50,000. But first, a little context.\n\nWe can clone dogs? Since when?\n\nEven if you are not a close follower of clones, you may recall Dolly the Sheep, who was born in 1996. Since then, researchers have cloned about two dozen other mammal species, including cattle, deer, horses, rabbits, cats, rats \u2014 and yes, dogs.\n\nSouth Korean researchers announced that they had cloned a dog for the first time in 2005, after almost three years of work and more than 1,000 eggs. With help from a yellow Labrador retriever who served as the surrogate mother, a cloned male Afghan hound named Snuppy was born. (Snuppy, of course, stood for \u201cSeoul National University puppy.\u201d)\n\nBy 2008, a California company had partnered with a South Korean laboratory and made plans to auction off chances to clone five dogs. Later that year, The New York Times reported that the first three puppies from the group had been born in South Korea.\n\nTwo 2015 reports \u2014 from Business Insider and NPR \u2014 detail the work of Sooam Biotech, a lab in South Korea, and said the lab, on its own, had cloned more than 600 dogs.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nBoth articles say Sooam Biotech charged about $100,000 to attempt the process. ViaGen Pets, a company based in Texas, says it charges $50,000 for the cloning or $1,600 to merely preserve your pet\u2019s genes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReports and information on ViaGen\u2019s website suggest that the cloning process \u2014 specifically a dog\u2019s pregnancy \u2014 usually takes about 60 days.\n\nIt was not clear which company Ms. Streisand used to create her clones. A publicist for Ms. Streisand did not immediately respond to an email or phone message on Tuesday night.\n\nMore Reporting on Dogs\n\nBut will the cloned dog actually be similar?\n\nThat depends.\n\nSooam told Business Insider that it can clone any dog, regardless of age, size or breed. NPR, though, reported that cloned animals aren\u2019t exact replicas of original dogs.\n\nResearchers at the South Korean lab told the station that the dogs it had cloned have been healthy \u2014 and had almost always looked and acted like the dogs they were cloned from.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Eventually, the egg develops into an embryo; and that embryo is then transferred to the surrogate, who surgeons hope will give birth.\n\nAt the Korean lab, the process requires operating on the egg donor and the surrogate mother \u2014 two dogs rented from a lab-animal provider. And, at least in the case of Sooam Biotech, it\u2019s not clear what happens after those dogs are no longer needed.\n\nThe company also told the media outlets that the cloning process works only about 33 to 40 percent of the time, which means there is strong potential for miscarriages.\n\nFar from the medical labs, Ms. Streisand told Variety that she loves sharing her Malibu home with Miss Violet and Miss Scarlett. At least from that vantage point, the process seemed to work out just fine.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBoras has a long history of securing lucrative deals for his clients, and of waiting for teams to provide them. He recently told The Times that too many owners were deliberately trying to lose, taking advantage of a collective bargaining agreement that gives the worst teams the most money to spend on amateur talent while imposing penalties for payrolls over $197 million.\n\n\u201cIt has created an incentive to lose, and we now have a process where teams are not seeking competitiveness and therefore they\u2019re not seeking players to be competitive,\u201d Boras said.\n\nThree times in the 1980s, owners were found to be guilty of colluding against free agents, essentially robbing players of nearly $300 million. Suspicions of collusion are again bubbling just beneath the surface, and while many free agents have switched teams this winter, only one has signed for more than three years: Lorenzo Cain, who left the Kansas City Royals for a five-year, $80 million deal with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe landscape of front offices is changing across baseball, as owners are increasingly relying on bright, young executives who are well-versed in analytics. Few, if any, statistical models would recommend extravagant salaries for players whose performance is likely to decline.\n\nPlayers need six years of service time to reach free agency, and the union could push to reduce that requirement in hopes that the most coveted players get the most money. But the collective bargaining agreement runs through 2021, limiting the union\u2019s short-term options. The league has reopened the C.B.A. to strengthen the drug program, but not to adjust the game\u2019s financial structure.\n\nOf course, some players do perform well after free agency, like Max Scherzer, a Boras client who has won two Cy Young Awards in the three seasons since the Washington Nationals gave him a seven-year, $210 million contract.\n\nYet many others have been busts, including Carl Crawford, who did not play last season but collected $21.9 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers to finish a seven-year, $142 million deal he got from the Boston Red Sox. Josh Hamilton has not played since 2015, but the Los Angeles Angels paid him $26.41 million last season to finish the five-year, $125 million contract they gave him after the 2012 season. (The Angels had traded Hamilton to Texas in 2015.)\n\nLast season seemed to underscore the pre-eminence of younger players. None of the top seven finishers in 2017 Most Valuable Player Award balloting, in either league, have ever been free agents. Only two players had even accumulated enough service time to be eligible for free agency, and both \u2014 Giancarlo Stanton and Joey Votto \u2014 had signed long-term deals before hitting the open market.\n\nThis market still has players who could clearly help teams; a rotation of Arrieta, Yu Darvish, Alex Cobb, Lance Lynn and Jason Vargas would win a lot of games.

Ten months later, the two were married.\n\nThat young woman, McKinley Agee, 29, is fiercely loyal to her mother-in-law and said she could never shake the caricature of a manipulative home wrecker who had tried to insert herself into the old boys\u2019 club of corporate America.\n\n\u201cI think the narrative we continue to see is that of a scandalous affair, but ultimately it was a great love story,\u201d McKinley Agee said.\n\nThat is not how Mr. Agee\u2019s three children with his first wife, Diane Weaver, see things.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, they had almost no contact with their father and blame Ms. Cunningham Agee\u2019s controlling nature for the estrangement. Suzanne Agee said she believed that her father \u201chad a lot of remorse\u201d over not keeping in close contact with his first family but that he couldn\u2019t do so \u201cwithout breaking ties with Mary.\u201d\n\nIn response, Ms. Cunningham Agee said she had urged her husband to reconnect to his first family, but couldn\u2019t persuade him. \u201cEvery Christmas, I begged him to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nIn October, less than two months before he died, a frail Mr. Agee, who suffered from scleroderma, a degenerative disease of the immune system, reconnected with his first family. Legal documents show that he gave Suzanne Agee power of attorney (along with his 32-year-old daughter with Ms. Cunningham Agee, Mary Alana Kurz), filed for divorce and rewrote his will to divide his assets among Ms. Cunningham Agee and his five children. (Previously, the will had left everything to Ms. Cunningham Agee.)\n\nMs. Cunningham Agee attributes his erratic behavior to dementia. She said doctors had diagnosed Alzheimer\u2019s in 2014. His health deteriorated, and in mid-October she put him in an assisted living facility. She said that her husband \u201cwas very conflicted and paranoid\u201d and that he had used the divorce filing \u2014 which would\u2019ve divided up the couple\u2019s assets and allowed Mr. Agee to alter his estate planning \u2014 as \u201ca good tool to get out of assisted living.\u201d (The divorce was never finalized, which means the proceeding would be legally nullified.)", "title": "Before There Was #MeToo, There Was Mary Cunningham", "authors": []}

And then there were the reports on Saturday that more than 150,000 people had entered a lottery for tickets to a pair of performances next week by a 140-member North Korean art troupe.\n\nThe zeal with which the local press has pursued the North Korean visitors could be seen late Friday at the skating rink, where the short-track speedskaters Choe Un-song and Jong Kwang-bom were working out alongside skaters from France, Italy and Latvia.\n\nWhen the North Korean skaters and their coach huddled along the railing to talk, a dozen reporters crept as close as possible to observe the interactions and snap pictures. Minutes later, when the North Koreans regrouped farther down the rink, the pack sidled that way, too.

It found that the Democratic share of the presidential vote dropped by an average of 3.5 percentage points after the passage of so-called right-to-work laws allowing employees to avoid paying union fees. That is larger than Democrats\u2019 margin of defeat in several states that could have reversed their last three presidential losses.\n\nAnd that is clearly on the mind of Republicans. In a recent interview, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, acknowledged the potential of the Janus case to hurt Democratic fund-raising for the coming midterm elections. \u201cIn states where they got rid of the automatic deduction and employees figured they could keep their own money, they did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it could have an impact.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren\u2019t alone in locking arms to advance an ideological agenda. For decades, liberal donors and foundations, sometimes working together through coalitions like the Democracy Alliance, have promoted liberal goals in a variety of ways. Some backed groups, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, that used litigation to move American society leftward.\n\nBut the extent of the coordination on the right often dwarfs liberal efforts. Especially on the state level, conservative groups are \u201cdoing different things, mobilizing different constituencies,\u201d Mr. Hertel-Fernandez said. \u201cBut they\u2019re all working with one another. You don\u2019t see the same thing on the left.\u201d\n\nAs the percentage of unionized private-sector workers has collapsed in recent decades, public-sector unions, which have held steady in the mid-30s since the early 1980s, have increasingly become a target.\n\nConservatives chafe at the unions\u2019 political influence, which they believe not only props up the Democratic Party but also drives up government spending and skews public policy on issues like education.\n\nIn 2011, Wisconsin rolled back the right of most public unions to bargain over anything other than wages and eliminated the requirement that nonmembers pay fees.

And some independent organizations have been taken over by pro-Beijing members, who then change the club\u2019s mission.\n\nBeijing\u2019s domination of the conversation in the Chinese community gives the wider public a skewed view of Chinese-Australians.

Instead, it is owned on paper by a succession of shell companies controlled by a handful of obscure names. Such ownership arrangements are common in China, where the wealthy and politically connected often own properties under the names of others.\n\nA New York Times investigation two years ago found that many of those owners were family or acquaintances of Mr. Wu, often hailing from his home region, in China\u2019s Zhejiang province. Anbang has said it is owned by a number of shareholders who made the proper disclosures under Chinese law.\n\nThe takeover of Anbang will put the Waldorf Astoria, for decades a symbol of New York elegance, under the control of the Chinese government. In addition to hosting celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Elizabeth Taylor, for years it had been the lodging of choice for presidents and other world leaders.\n\nThat changed in 2014, when Anbang said it would buy the hotel for nearly $2 billion. President Barack Obama declined to stay there over security concerns. The hotel is currently closed as it undergoes renovations that will shrink the hotel and add condominiums.\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria purchase ushered in the rise of a new breed of Chinese deal makers. The companies, which also included Dalian Wanda Group, HNA Group and Fosun International, bought up everything from hotels to banks to movie production companies. Though the companies are privately owned, their leaders often benefited from their political connections, and they were often backed by cheap debt provided by China\u2019s state-run banks.\n\nThe deals made the companies truly global players. For example, in a financial disclosure last spring, shortly before the police detention of its chairman, Anbang said that nearly three-fifths of the assets of its main business, life insurance, were overseas.\n\nProperty was a big focus for Anbang. In 2016, it spent more than $6 billion for a group of hotels in the United States, buying it from Blackstone Group, a private equity giant. That gave it marquee properties including the Westin St. Francis hotel in San Francisco, the Loews Santa Monica hotel in California and the Fairmont Chicago hotel.", "title": "Beijing Takes Over Anbang, Insurer That Owns Waldorf Astoria", "authors": []}

He went on to kick for the 1961 champion Green Bay Packers and in the young American Football League.\n\nAfter his playing days, he tutored kickers for Tom Landry\u2019s Dallas Cowboys, advised other N.F.L. teams on their kicking games and taught thousands of young kickers at his camps and clinics in Southern California.\n\nA pair of his shoes went on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, in 1974.\n\nAgajanian himself was not inducted into the hall, though Landry recommended him in 1994, saying Agajanian had \u201cdone more for the kicking game in both college and the pros in the past 50 years than anybody I know.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBenjamin James Agajanian was born on Aug. 28, 1919, in Santa Ana, Calif., to James T.

Here\u2019s what it is, and you may know this because it\u2019s also an old hostess trick: White wine can be used to remove red wine stains from clothing, carpet and upholstered furniture by applying a small amount of the white to a white or light-colored cloth or rag, then tamping at the red.

Cola can also be used with a scrub brush to lift oil and grease stains from a driveway.\n\nSugar\n\nIf you have the unfortunate experience of knocking a bottle nail polish over on a hard surface like tile or hardwood, pour some sugar on it.

Spread it on the stain and allow it to sit for 30 to 90 minutes before flushing with cold water and laundering as usual.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "What makes this particularly puzzling for scholars reared on the classical models of competitive economies is that all this happened despite a persistent decline in real interest rates. In a more orthodox economy, declining rates on corporate bonds would encourage a surge in corporate investment. As companies invested more and more capital, the returns on investments would gradually decline until companies\u2019 returns matched their cost of capital: the interest rate they pay to borrow.\n\nIn the United States, neither has occurred. Investment has been stuck at stubbornly low rates. And even as interest rates have fallen, the average return on productive capital has stayed roughly constant.\n\nIn a nutshell, the United States has built an economy where businesses don\u2019t invest even though it has rarely been cheaper to finance investment. Still, they reap spectacular profits that warrant runaway share prices.\n\n\u201cThese are not your father\u2019s growth facts,\u201d wrote Gauti Eggertsson, Jacob A. Robbins and Ella Getz Wold of Brown University in an analysis published this week by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. The puzzling facts of contemporary America suggest an economy poised to fail.\n\nWhat happened? It turns out that there is one straightforward reason for the American economy\u2019s unorthodox behavior. As Mr. Eggertsson and his colleagues argue, the standard economic theory based on competitive markets cannot apply when markets are not competitive. And competition, in the United States, is shriveling.\n\nThe scholars argue that the American economy is afflicted by \u201crents\u201d \u2014 returns in excess of what investments would yield in a competitive economy, where fat margins are quickly whittled away by competition.\n\nThese rents don\u2019t fall from the sky. Companies free of competitive pressures, with the power to set prices more or less at will, squeeze them from their customers and their workers. They pad corporate profits and send stock prices sky high.\n\nExecutives love it. The critical question is what these rents hold in store for the rest of us.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, by the way, that the corporate landscape has been taken over by evil monopolists that resort to illegal tricks to keep competitors out. High-tech titans like Google and Facebook may just have the ability and the deep pockets to out-innovate everybody \u2014 delivering wonderful new experiences to consumers along the way, and maintaining monopoly control over their latest innovations. One intriguing theory is that the globalized economy is reorganizing the business landscape, encouraging the rise of corporate superstars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot everybody agrees that competition is waning. Hal Varian, Google\u2019s chief economist, argues plausibly in a recent study that the case to worry about market concentration across the economy is weak. Even as concentration has increased in many sectors, there is plenty of competition in most industries and markets. Carl Shapiro, an antitrust scholar from the University of California, Berkeley, who served in President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department, worries that the new populism infecting American politics could prompt antitrust policy to take aim at all big successful companies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nStill, there are good reasons to worry about rising rents, no matter where they come from. Mr. Shapiro argues that while some measures of market concentration may not be meaningful, persistently high profits are of themselves a cause for concern.\n\nProfits as a share of output have risen by half over the last 30 years. Combined with evidence that large corporations are accounting for an increasing share of revenue and employment, Mr. Shapiro writes, \u201cit certainly appears that many large U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing so for at least 10 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly true in the tech sector, where a handful of dominant companies \u2014 you know the ones I\u2019m talking about \u2014 have sustained spectacular profits for years. Their sky-high stock prices suggest that investors expect high profits to continue as well.\n\n\u201cThey probably are geniuses; what they are doing is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Shapiro told me. \u201cStill, you would expect competition to erode away the excess profits over time.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHere is why we should worry.\n\nMr. Eggertsson and his colleagues built an alternative model of the American economy by doing away with the assumption of perfect competition. They contend that there are barriers to entry that stop competitors and allow rents to persist.\n\nIn this economy, stock prices don\u2019t just reflect the future stream of normal economic returns that would accrue to a company\u2019s capital investment. They also include a claim to a stream of rents that generate \u201cpure profits.\u201d These profits can\u2019t be replicated by another company\u2019s capital investment. They are owned by a specific company.\n\nSo what features might an economy like this possess? Wages are unlikely to rise much in a job market dominated by a few big employers. As I speculated last week, markets dominated by a few businesses will most likely deter start-ups from appearing on the scene.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRising rents will take larger shares of the nation\u2019s income. That will bolster the proportion of income that goes to corporate profits but squeeze the share that flows to workers \u2014 in wages and benefits \u2014 and to productive capital. This will discourage both work and capital investment. It will weigh on overall economic growth.\n\nRents interfere with incentives in a big way. Companies will spend more time and effort trying to preserve those rents \u2014 often by working to block rivals from their markets. Rivals will fight to grab a share of those rents for themselves, perhaps through lobbying. Amid all this jockeying, investment in productive capabilities will most likely be neglected as a secondary consideration.\n\nAnd inevitably, inequality will rise: The owners of the shares in the powerful corporations capturing the economy\u2019s growing monopoly rents will peel further and further away from the average Jane and Joe, who own little but their labor.\n\nThis is not the kind of economy proposed by classical economic theory. It is not the kind of country portrayed by evangelists of the American dream.

Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, will discuss the Magic Kingdom\u2019s state of affairs and plans for its future for the first time since striking a $52.4 billion deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Iger will probably not offer many details about the merger, which government regulators still must approve. But he may discuss the multiple streaming services that Disney is building \u2014 and hopes to supersize with Fox assets. Mr. Iger could also mount a defense of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise (the last film flopped in China and took in $612 million in North America, less than some people would have liked) while facing questions about the future leadership of ESPN, where the hunt for a new president is underway.

Believed to be the largest in the world, the foundation gave away more than $41 billion from its inception in 2000 through the end of 2016, now spending $4 billion to $5 billion a year to combat malaria, reduce poverty and improve education.\n\nThis is the 10th annual letter the Gateses have published, which they\u2019re marking by answering 10 \u201ctough questions\u201d they frequently get. In addition to Mr. Trump, they address topics like why they team up with corporations and whether they\u2019re imposing their values on other cultures.\n\nThe first Gates letter was inspired by the annual update the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett writes to shareholders of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. In 2006, Mr. Buffett, a longtime friend of the couple\u2019s, pledged the majority of his fortune to the Gates Foundation, where he is a trustee. In philanthropic circles, the annual Gates letter is read as avidly for tidbits about giving trends as Mr. Buffett\u2019s letter is by investors.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThere have been some interesting tip-offs about where they\u2019re heading or their perspectives on things,\u201d said David Callahan, the founder and editor of Inside Philanthropy, a news site about charitable giving.\n\nWhile the mood in many parts of the world seems to have darkened, Mr. and Ms. Gates say in their letter that they remain militantly optimistic about global progress.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe headlines are filled with awful news,\u201d they write in the letter. \u201cEvery day brings a different story of political division, violence or natural disaster. Despite the headlines, we see a world that\u2019s getting better.\u201d\n\nThey expanded on some of those themes and fielded questions about other topics in the recent interview. It was held at bgC3, a company that oversees many of Mr. Gates\u2019s independent projects, including for-profit investments in clean energy.\n\nThrough her own private company, Pivotal Ventures, Ms. Gates has advocated for greater participation by women in STEM fields and other gender equity issues. Pivotal recently helped fund Aspect Ventures, the largest venture capital firm led by women. Not long ago, she moved Pivotal to its own private office near her husband\u2019s.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs one of the founders of the modern tech industry, Mr. Gates is often looked to for technical answers. For instance, while running for president, Mr. Trump floated the idea of asking Mr. Gates to help close \u201cthat internet up in some way\u201d to curb communications by terrorists online.\n\nBut when asked about the growing criticism that big technology companies like Facebook and Twitter have faced over their role in spreading misinformation, Mr. Gates said he hadn\u2019t \u201cseen great solutions,\u201d though \u201cI\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole tech world should look at these criticisms, look at these effects, you know, try to make sure that without giving up what\u2019s good about that, that we can reduce some of it,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked if the national reckoning over sexual harassment had affected her investments through Pivotal, Ms. Gates said that it hadn\u2019t so far, but that it had encouraged her to use her voice to encourage more women to speak out.\n\n\u201cI want to make it O.K. for women to talk about their real experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a long time coming that the sexual harassment stuff worldwide comes out.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Gates has made family planning a focus of her work with the foundation. She said the Trump administration\u2019s decision last year to expand a ban prohibiting American aid to any health organizations that provide or discuss abortion in family planning had caused \u201cchaos\u201d in the field \u2014 forcing them to stall their work as they figured out how to adhere to the rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd in their annual letter, Ms. Gates, 53, is blunt in her view of the way Mr. Trump communicates.\n\n\u201cI wish our president would treat people, and especially women, with more respect when he speaks and tweets,\u201d she writes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Gates wrote, \u201cWhen I get really enthusiastic about something, I count on her to make sure I\u2019m being realistic.\u201d\n\nMs. Gates said they tended to avoid hashing out their disagreements in front of bigger groups at the foundation, saving them for private discussions, which they have on walks.\n\n\u201cHaving a little bit of grist in the system is actually a good thing,\u201d she said.", "title": "Bill and Melinda Gates Tackle \u2018Tough Questions\u2019 and Trump", "authors": ["Nick Wingfield"]}

Before the funeral, Mr. Graham\u2019s body is lying in repose at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, N.C., on Monday and Tuesday, and then will be moved to the Capitol rotunda in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nIn his lifetime, Billy Graham shepherded evangelical Christianity from the margins of American life to its center. His massive revivals, magnetic presence and media stardom earned him entree to President Harry S. Truman and every president since, both Republican and Democrat.\n\nHis funeral is expected to draw politicians from both political parties, showcasing Billy Graham\u2019s success at bipartisanship. The eulogy is to be delivered by his son, Franklin, who has honed a reputation as a polarizing partisan.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was president, Franklin Graham fanned the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy that claimed the president was not an American citizen. He falsely suggested that Mr. Obama was not a Christian and might secretly be a Muslim.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Franklin Graham held rallies in 50 states to pump up evangelical turnout on what he called a \u201cDecision America Tour.\u201d Once Mr. Trump landed the Republican nomination, Mr. Graham avoided explicit endorsements at those rallies, but left no doubt about his preference.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Graham said that Mr. Trump\u2019s victory was evidence that \u201cGod\u2019s hand was at work.\u201d He was one of the six clergy members chosen to offer prayers at the inauguration, and is among the evangelical pastors who serve as informal advisers to Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn doing so, Franklin Graham has become a prominent leader of the evangelical faction that is white, older, conservative on immigration, L.G.B.T. issues and guns, and loyal to the Republican Party and Mr. Trump. Some 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBut there is another wing of the evangelical movement whose members are more moderate politically, many of them black, Latino, Asian, or city dwellers, or young. Some of these evangelicals have grown increasingly discomfited by the close association with the Republican Party, and now, with Mr. Trump.\n\nFor years, there had been muted criticism of Franklin Graham by some evangelicals. It began after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Mr. Graham branded Islam a \u201cvery wicked and evil religion,\u201d and escalated during Mr. Graham\u2019s stoking of the \u201cbirther\u201d slander. But given his status as evangelical royalty and respect for his charitable work, the misgivings mostly remained private.\n\nBilly Graham chose not to pass judgment on his son, at least in public. When asked in an interview at his home in 2005 whether he agreed with his son\u2019s words about Islam, he would only respond, \u201cLet\u2019s say, I didn\u2019t say it.\u201d\n\nNow with some evangelical leaders concerned about the direction of their movement, the concerns about Franklin Graham have begun to emerge.\n\n\u201cI think that Franklin Graham has failed as a Christian leader, both for what he endorses and for what he has failed to criticize. I speak for a lot of people on that one,\u201d said Richard J. Mouw, president emeritus and professor of faith and public life at the evangelical Fuller Theological Seminary, the nation\u2019s largest full-time seminary.\n\n\u201cA lot of us were deeply grateful to Billy Graham for acknowledging that he aligned himself in unhelpful and actually non-Christian ways with a person in power,\u201d Dr. Mouw said in an interview last week. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that he said, \u2018I was wrong, that was a dangerous thing to have done.\u2019 And now, here we see the same patterns repeated, even by his own son.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

There\u2019s a difference between defending the faith and living the faith.\u201d\n\nHe said the media has lied about Mr. Trump, but when asked whether Mr. Trump has told any lies, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know of any.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham was dismissive of questions surrounding Mr. Trump and Russian government interference in the 2016 race. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. This whole thing on Russia? I don\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t believe he has collusion with the Russians,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cAnd I think if somebody in his campaign was involved, the president would have fired him.\u201d\n\nWilliam C.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "In the last few decades, a new generation of evangelists, including Mr. Graham\u2019s elder son, Franklin Graham, began developing their own followings. In November 1995, on his 77th birthday, Mr. Graham named Franklin to succeed him as head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. His daughter Anne Graham Lotz and his grandsons Will Graham and William Graham Tullian Tchividjian are also in ministry.\n\nFranklin Graham has drawn criticism since the Sept. 11 attacks for denigrating Islam. His father, however, retained the respect of vast numbers of Americans, enough to earn him dozens of appearances on Gallup\u2019s annual list of the world\u2019s 10 most admired men and women.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepent and Be Born Again\n\nWith a warm, courtly manner that was readily apparent both to stadium crowds and to those who met him face to face, Mr. Graham could be a riveting presence. At 6-foot-2, with a handsomely rugged profile fit for Hollywood westerns, he would hold his Bible aloft and declare that Scripture offered \u201cthe answer to every human longing.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham drew his essential message from the mainstream of evangelical Protestant belief. Repent of your sins, he told his listeners, accept Jesus as your Savior and be born again. In a typical exhortation, he declared: \u201cAre you frustrated, bewildered, dejected, breaking under the strains of life? Then listen for a moment to me: Say yes to the Savior tonight, and in a moment you will know such comfort as you have never known. It comes to you quickly, as swiftly as I snap my fingers, just like that.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham always closed by asking his listeners to \u201ccome forward\u201d and commit to a life of Christian faith. When they did so, his well-oiled organization would match new believers with nearby churches. Many thousands of people say they were first brought to church by a Billy Graham crusade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the dedication of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, N.C., in June 2007, former President Bill Clinton said of Mr. Graham, \u201cWhen he prays with you in the Oval Office or upstairs in the White House, you feel like he is praying for you, not the president.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham was by no means unique in American history as a popular evangelist. George Whitefield in the mid-18th century, Charles G. Finney and Dwight L. Moody in the 19th century, and Billy Sunday at the turn of the 20th were all capable of drawing vast crowds.\n\nBut none of them combined the ambition, the talent for organization and the reach of Mr. Graham, who had the advantages of jet travel and electronic media to convey his message. In 2007, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association estimated that he had preached the Gospel to more than 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories since beginning his crusades in October 1947 in Grand Rapids, Mich. He reached hundreds of millions more on television, through video and in film.\n\n\u201cThis is not mass evangelism,\u201d Mr. Graham liked to say, \u201cbut personal evangelism on a mass scale.\u201d\n\nBall-Playing Dreams\n\nWilliam Franklin Graham Jr. \u2014 Billy Frank to his family and friends as a boy \u2014 was born near Charlotte on Nov. 7, 1918, the first of four children of William Franklin Graham and Morrow Coffey Graham. He was descended on both sides from pre-Revolution Scottish settlers, and both his grandfathers were Confederate soldiers.\n\nThough the Grahams were Reformed Presbyterians, and though his father insisted on daily readings of the Bible, Billy Frank was an unenthusiastic Christian. He was more interested in reading history, playing baseball and dreaming of becoming a professional ballplayer. His worldliness, his father thought, was mischievous and devilish.\n\nIt was the Rev. Mordecai Ham, an itinerant preacher from Kentucky, who was credited with \u201csaving\u201d Billy Graham, in the autumn of 1934, when Billy was 16. After attending Mr. Ham\u2019s revival sessions on a Charlotte street corner several nights in a row, Billy walked up to Mr. Ham to make a \u201cdecision for Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that I felt anything spectacular,\u201d Mr. Graham recalled years later. \u201cI felt very little emotion. I shed no tears. In fact, when I saw others had tears in their eyes, I felt like a hypocrite, and this disturbed me a little. I\u2019m sure I had a tremendous sense of conviction: The Lord did speak to me about certain things in my life, I\u2019m certain of that. But I can\u2019t remember what they were.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReturning home with a friend that night, Mr. Graham said, he thought: \u201cNow I\u2019ve gotten saved. Now whatever I do can\u2019t unsave me. Even if I killed somebody, I can\u2019t ever be unsaved now.\u201d\n\nAfter he graduated from high school in 1936, Mr. Graham spent the summer selling Fuller brushes door to door before spending an unhappy semester at Bob Jones College, then an unaccredited, fundamentalist school in Cleveland, Tenn. (It is now Bob Jones University, in Greenville, S.C.) He then went to another unaccredited but less restrictive institution, the Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College), near Tampa.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was there, he wrote in his 1997 autobiography, \u201cJust as I Am,\u201d that he felt God calling him to the ministry. The call came, he said, during a late-night walk on a golf course. \u201cI got down on my knees at the edge of one of the greens,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThen I prostrated myself on the dewy turf. \u2018O God,\u2019 I sobbed, \u2018if you want me to serve you, I will.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cAll the surroundings stayed the same,\u201d he continued. \u201cNo sign in the heavens. No voice from above. But in my spirit I knew I had been called to the ministry. And I knew my answer was yes.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA Wife, Then a Pulpit\n\nAfter graduating from the Bible Institute, Mr. Graham went to Wheaton College in Illinois, among the nation\u2019s most respected evangelical colleges. At Wheaton, from which he received a degree in anthropology in 1943, he met Ruth McCue Bell, a fellow student whose father was Dr. L. Nelson Bell, a prominent Presbyterian missionary surgeon who had spent many years in China.\n\nSoon after marrying Ms. Bell in 1943, Mr. Graham accepted the pulpit of the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Ill., a Chicago suburb. (It later changed its name to the Village Church.) He imbued his sermons with the brand of interdenominational appeal that was to be his hallmark.\n\nIt was also in 1943 that he was invited to take over \u201cSongs in the Night,\u201d a Sunday hour of sermonizing and gospel singing broadcast by a Chicago radio station. The program introduced him to electronic evangelism. Its principal singer, the baritone George Beverly Shea, who died in 2013, would earn fame as a member of the \u201cBilly Graham team.\u201d\n\nIn the mid-1940s, Mr. Graham became the chief preacher for the Youth for Christ rallies organized by the Rev. Torrey M. Johnson, a radio evangelist, and George W. Wilson, the owner of a religious bookstore in Minneapolis and a lay leader of the First Baptist Church there. With them, he established the Graham Youth for Christ, which found moderate success holding \u201ccrusades\u201d across North America and in Britain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Graham\u2019s fortunes took a career-building turn in 1949, thanks in no small measure to the power of the Hearst press. He was holding a three-week \u201cmammoth tent crusade\u201d in downtown Los Angeles inside a 6,000-seat \u201ccanvas cathedral\u201d pitched on a vacant lot. The newspaper ads proclaimed him \u201cAmerica\u2019s sensational young evangelist.\u201d But what really caught the attention of the aged newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst was that Mr. Graham was preaching a fiery brand of anti-Communism.\n\nFrom his retreat in San Simeon, Calif., Mr. Hearst is said to have issued a terse directive: \u201cPuff Graham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Hearst newspapers gave me enormous publicity, and the others soon followed,\u201d Mr. Graham said years later. \u201cSuddenly, what a clergyman was saying was in the headlines everywhere, and so was the box score of commitments to Christ each night.\u201d Time, Newsweek and Life magazines followed suit.\n\nPhoto\n\nFlocking to His \u2018Crusades\u2019\n\nMr. Graham began taking his \u201cCrusade for Christ\u201d on the road. In 1957, he drew more than two million people to a series of rallies, extended to 16 weeks, at Madison Square Garden in New York. The crusades became international: One, in West Germany, was televised live in 10 other European countries. In 1966, he preached to nearly one million people in London.\n\nAs Mr. Graham\u2019s popularity grew, so did his stature with Christian critics who had dismissed his interpretation of Scripture as overly literal. He told his audiences, for example, that heaven was a physical place, though not necessarily in this solar system.\n\nEarly on, he abandoned the practice, common among Southern fundamentalists, of speaking only before racially segregated audiences. He refused to \u201cpreach Jim Crow,\u201d as he put it, and in the turbulent 1960s he made several \u201cvisits of racial conciliation\u201d to the South.\n\nMr. Graham pledged to local church sponsors that all donations would be used for crusade expenses, with any excess going to his Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. His own compensation, he said, would be limited to his expenses plus \u201cthe salary of a fairly well-paid local minister,\u201d or about $50,000 in 1980 (the equivalent of almost $160,000 today). The association\u2019s books were always open to inspection.\n\nBy maintaining fiscal integrity and personal probity \u2014 he stuck to his rule never to be alone with a woman other than his wife \u2014 Mr. Graham kept himself untarnished by the kind of sex and money scandals that brought down evangelists and religious broadcasters like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart in the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Grahams lived on a 200-acre mountain retreat in Montreat, N.C. His wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in 2007. He is survived by his sons, the Rev. William Franklin III and the Rev. Nelson Graham, known as Ned; three daughters, Virginia Tchividjian (known as Gigi), Anne Graham Lotz and Ruth Graham McIntyre; and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Kinship With Presidents\n\nRecognizing his influence, presidents made a point of seeking friendly relations with Mr. Graham; Lyndon B. Johnson did so assiduously. Mr. Graham was a frequent guest of Ronald Reagan, and in January 1991, George H. W. Bush invited him to spend the night at the White House the day before American-led forces began bombing Iraq. Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Graham to offer prayers at his inauguration in 1993.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Bush said that it was after a walk with Mr. Graham at the Bush family\u2019s compound in Kennebunkport, Me., that Mr. Bush, as a younger man, decided to become more serious about his faith and quit drinking. President Barack Obama visited Mr. Graham at his North Carolina home in 2010.\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter released a statement on Wednesday saying that he had counted Mr. Graham among his advisers and friends, adding that the minister had \u201chad an enormous influence on my own spiritual life.\u201d And President Trump tweeted: \u201cThe GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.\u201d\n\nOf the presidents, Mr. Graham was most closely associated with Nixon. The two had met in the early 1950s, when Nixon was a senator from California. As vice president, Nixon addressed a capacity crowd at Yankee Stadium for the closing meeting of Mr. Graham\u2019s New York crusade in 1957.\n\nIn the 1960 presidential campaign, Mr. Graham, a registered Democrat, was strongly sympathetic to Nixon, a Republican, and offered him advice in his campaign against Senator John F. Kennedy, a Roman Catholic. At one point, concerned that a Kennedy administration would be influenced by the Vatican, Mr. Graham invited more than two dozen Protestant leaders to a meeting to discuss ways to defeat him.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe went on to endorse Nixon in the 1968 presidential race and allowed that endorsement to be used in television commercials. He gave the invocation at Nixon\u2019s 1969 inauguration and came to be described as Nixon\u2019s unofficial White House chaplain.\n\nMr. Graham said he had been \u201cinnocently unaware\u201d of the storm gathering over Watergate. But when the extent of the scandal became known \u2014 disclosures of the break-in and the subsequent cover-up orchestrated by the White House \u2014 Mr. Graham tended to look the other way, his critics said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1982, Mr. Graham displeased the Reagan administration when, after a visit to the Soviet Union, he spoke in favor of universal nuclear disarmament. He also visited Russian churches, and his comment that he had seen no evidence of religious repression by the Soviet authorities created a furor among conservative church members in the United States.\n\nIt was during this period, in his sixth decade as an evangelist, that Mr. Graham and his organization experimented with new technologies. In 1986, in Paris, he used direct satellite transmissions to carry his sermons to about 30 other French cities. With his crusade in San Juan, P.R., in 1995, he expanded his satellite reach more than sixfold.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Graham also broke ground by going to places where religious activity was officially restricted, including China and North Korea. The first of his 30 books was \u201cPeace With God,\u201d published in 1953; his last was \u201cNearing Home,\u201d in 2011.\n\nMr. Graham, like most conservative preachers of his age and era, regarded same-sex relationships as \u201csinful.\u201d But unlike the culture warriors who succeeded him, Mr. Graham rarely spoke about homosexuality, and condemning it was not a staple of his preaching.\n\nPressed to weigh in on same-sex marriage, he said he preferred to stick to the Gospel. But once, preaching in Ohio in 1993, he said he thought that AIDS could be \u201ca judgment of God,\u201d and added, \u201cI could not be sure, but I think so.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later he walked it back, saying: \u201cI do believe God stands in judgment of all sins ... but AIDS is a disease that affects people and is not part of that judgment. To say God has judged people with AIDS would be very wrong and very cruel. I would like to say that I am very sorry for what I said.\u201d\n\nThe Billy Graham Evangelistic Association continues to organize crusades. It also produced Mr. Graham\u2019s \u201cHour of Decision\u201d global radio program and prime-time television specials, trains thousands of evangelists and missionaries, and publishes Decision magazine. A rapid-response team deploys chaplains to disaster areas.\n\nWhy it all came about remained a puzzle to Mr. Graham. In his autobiography, he wrote: \u201cI have often said that the first thing I am going to do when I get to Heaven is ask: \u2018Why me, Lord? Why did You choose a farm boy from North Carolina to preach to so many people, to have such a wonderful team of associates, and to have a part in what You were doing in the latter half of the 20th century?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI have thought about that question a great deal,\u201d he added, \u201cbut I know also that only God knows the answer.\u201d\n\nPhoto", "title": "Billy Graham, 99, Dies; Pastor Filled Stadiums and Counseled Presidents", "authors": ["Laurie Goodstein"]}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Graham insisted that his German crusades were apolitical, but his sermons suggested otherwise. In Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium, he elevated the city\u2019s geospiritual significance in an emerging world order. \u201cBerlin is prayed for in the world more than any other city,\u201d he declared, calling the city \u201ca battleground, a continent for conquest\u201d \u2014 not for earthly power, as the world wars had been, but a new battle \u201cfor the hearts and minds of the people.\u201d\n\nIn so many words, Mr. Graham was talking about the Communists. Amid rising Cold War tensions and debates over German remilitarization, he affirmed that West Germans were his \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d literally as well as spiritually. To strengthen a Christian democratic West against a godless Soviet East, he cast his weight behind German rearmament.\n\nHe spoke for most Americans, but also for leading politicians like President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany. Adenauer made a point of meeting with Mr. Graham in 1963 as he steered his country westward. In the aftermath of the war and the American-led Marshall Plan for Europe\u2019s reconstruction, ordinary West Germans experienced Americanization in various forms, and for many, Mr. Graham portended a similar Americanization of German religion with its emphasis on conversion and its use of modern communication technologies for evangelism. Mr. Graham\u2019s crusades offered German Protestants the chance to experience these modern, American religious developments. Many looked to Mr. Graham not only as a promise against secularization, but also as a means of aligning themselves with the West.\n\nThough his German Crusades were astoundingly well-attended and supported by leaders like Adenauer, they also met with plenty of criticism. Some Germans deemed Mr. Graham a Hollywood huckster who, as the German news media put it, \u201cadvertised the Bible like toothpaste and chewing gum.\u201d Others sensed an unnerving parallel between his mass gatherings and Germany\u2019s fascist past. The June 1954 issue of Der Spiegel featured Mr. Graham on the cover with mischievous eyes and a mouth pursed in what could be a sales pitch as much as a sermon. The magazine\u2019s feature was disparagingly titled \u201cReligion for Mass-Consumption,\u201d and argued that Mr. Graham\u2019s real goal was to steer souls away from Communism more than toward God. Unsurprisingly, the East German press was even more critical, one paper characterizing the crusades as tools of \u201cAmerican propaganda in the psychological Cold War.\u201d\n\nLiberal Protestants in the United States and Germany felt themselves caught in the middle of Mr. Graham\u2019s bifurcated world. While prominent theologians like the German Lutheran pastor Martin Niem\u00f6ller and the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr supported Germany\u2019s democratization, they protested Mr. Graham\u2019s equation of Christianity with America, anti-Communism and free-market capitalism. If many mainline protestants had used similar language in the immediate aftermath of World War II, by the mid-1950s they had departed drastically from seeing socialism as anathema to Christianity. Mainline liberals accused Mr. Graham of raising international tensions by identifying Berlin as the beacon of the West in a sea of Communist red. His call for spiritual armament risked a new military conflict.\n\nAfter the Watergate scandal, Mr. Graham withdrew from political debates and returned to his early focus on simply \u201cpreaching the gospel.\u201d Yet his role in provoking a global debate about the shape of democracy, capitalism, nationalism and secularism in the modern world remains one of his lasting legacies. If the Cold War is gone and the evangelical culture wars have lost much of their steam, we remain ensconced in similar debates today, and \u2014 despite recanting his theopolitics in the end \u2014 the alliances that Mr. Graham forged and the battle lines he drew have endured. In this respect, God\u2019s Machine Gun was tragically prophetic of our modern world.", "title": "Opinion | Billy Graham, Cold Warrior for God", "authors": []}

A lot of young people like myself today have witnessed how many Christian leaders got lost in the partisanship and the power that accompanies politics. What advice could you offer to a new generation of Jesus-followers? How can we be more like you?\u201d\n\nMr. Graham gathered his breath, his eyes searching the ceiling for the right answer.\n\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d say, don\u2019t try to be like me, because I didn\u2019t always get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also, with one exception, I never asked to meet with them. They always asked to meet with me.\u201d\n\nIt was a staggering admission and one that, looking back, I can\u2019t imagine coming from the many preachers and religious opportunists who now elbow their way to our current president\u2019s side. Mr. Graham never sought out presidents or those with political power, and he refused many of the requests they made of him throughout the years.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Graham was often critical of the conservative Christian right. When he was asked in 2007 why he never affiliated with Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority, Mr. Graham replied: \u201cI\u2019m all for morality, but morality goes beyond sex to human freedom and social justice. We as clergy know so very little to speak with authority on the Panama Canal or superiority of armaments. Evangelists cannot be closely identified with any particular party or person. We have to stand in the middle in order to preach to all people, right and left. I haven\u2019t been faithful to my own advice in the past. I will be in the future.\u201d\n\nHis criticism of the religious right for its narrow agenda and raw thirst for power seemed harsh then, but observers of the partisanship among evangelical leaders today might call them prophetic.\n\nAny reflection on Mr. Graham\u2019s legacy would not be complete without mention of his flaws.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Niebuhr presents a revealing contrast to Mr. Graham. Mr. Niebuhr was a key leader of the so-called Protestant establishment, the complex of liberal, ecumenical denominations that dominated the public face of Christianity in the United States until the 1970s. Mr. Graham was the most conspicuous leader of the rival, evangelical Protestantism that gradually but decisively seized control of the symbolic capital of Christianity from the Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Lutherans and other mainstream groups within the Protestant establishment.\n\nFrom the 1970s onward the Grahams of American religion triumphed over the Niebuhrs, largely because the evangelicals continued to espouse a cluster of ideas that remained popular with the white public while the liberal, ecumenical leadership abandoned these same ideas as indefensibly racist, sexist, imperialist, chauvinistic, homophobic and anti-intellectual.\n\nProminent among these ideas was the assertion that the United States was a \u201cChristian nation,\u201d rather than one in which persons of many faiths, and of no faith at all, were civic equals. Another such idea was that claim that the heterosexual, nuclear, patriarchal family was God\u2019s will. Yet another was that faith in Jesus was the only road to salvation.\n\nMr. Graham had a choice as to where he would urge his followers to come down on these issues. Consistently, he distanced himself from the efforts of ecumenists to revise Christianity in cosmopolitan directions. He encouraged his vast and devoted following to believe that God\u2019s word was unchanging and that liberals were substituting their own ideas for those of a supernatural, unchanging deity revealed in the Bible. He dumbed down his inherited faith instead of helping it to address the challenges of modern times.\n\nThe memory of Mr. Graham is rightly honored by those who shared his values and the goals for which he mobilized evangelical Christianity.

{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "Sometimes, when I looked at the list I had made, it seemed entirely possible that our direct connection to whiteness \u2014 through immediate and extended family \u2014 had contributed to a certain familiarity with, and therefore accessibility to, the white norms, traditions and power structures that so many of us depend on for opportunity and success. The common denominator in the Loving Generation wasn\u2019t necessarily so much white proximity as white acceptance and, in many cases, familial love and close connection to white people. It seemed as if this could indeed have created real opportunities for us. It\u2019s likely, for example, that Barack Obama was able to imagine himself as president not just because he saw himself reflected in the white people around him, but because they saw themselves reflected in him.\n\nAbout President Obama. Though I made that first \u201cLoving\u201d list before I\u2019d ever heard of him, if you had told me back in 2003 that the United States would soon have a black president and that president would be the son of a white woman, I wouldn\u2019t have batted an eyelash. Mr. Obama, born in 1961, is at the leading edge of the \u201cgeneration\u201d I was looking to define, and the journey that led to his becoming the first black president was impossible to separate from his adjacency to whiteness. Ta-Nehisi Coates probably put it best in his January 2017 Atlantic magazine article \u201cMy President Was Black.\u201d He explained how Mr. Obama\u2019s direct connection to, and intimate familiarity with, white people \u2014 his mother, Ann Dunham, and her parents \u2014 helped fuel his sense of possibility, of not only who and what he could be but also what he could mean to others.\n\n\u201cThe first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that few black people of that era experienced,\u201d Mr. Coates wrote.\u201cObama\u2019s early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had.\u201d He also noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s lens, \u201cborn of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country\u2019s first black president.\u201d\n\nThere are other firsts within the Loving generation. Like Halle Berry (1966), the first black woman to win a best actress Oscar. And Amy DuBois Barnett (1974), the first black woman to run a major mainstream consumer magazine. And Jordan Peele (1979), the first black writer-director whose debut movie earned more than $100 million at the box office. And let\u2019s not forget Meghan Markle (1981), who is about to become the first black British royal (of the 21st century, that is).\n\nI used to wonder whether people like Ms. Berry, or others in my particular and uniquely American generation, had ever made this specific observation, and been disturbed by it.

The possible concessions would include allowing the Brazilian government to retain veto rights over strategic decisions and military programs, and creating a distinct subsidiary with firewalls that would safeguard defense projects and technology.\n\nBoeing has not abandoned hope of getting a controlling interest, according to sources at both companies familiar with the negotiations, and it is contemplating structuring the deal in a way that would leave Embraer with significant autonomy.\n\nOn Friday, a prominent Brazilian columnist wrote that Boeing had a new proposal to create a separate company with Embraer\u2019s commercial aviation business, splitting it from the military business. In a securities filing, Embraer responded that it had not received a new proposal from Boeing, but that \u201cthe parties involved are analyzing possibilities to enable a combination of their businesses, which could include the creation of other companies.\u201d\n\nJoining forces would give Embraer the global reach of Boeing at a time when Chinese and Russian manufacturers are encroaching on its market. It would also cut its supply-chain costs.\n\nEmbraer was privatized in 1994, and foreign investors now hold 85 percent of the company\u2019s shares, but the company remains one of Brazil\u2019s most iconic and beloved brands.

Scores of companies, including some of the country\u2019s biggest employers, are handing out bonuses, announcing with a flourish that they are sharing the windfall from corporate tax cuts with their workers.\n\nA look at the fine print, though, shows that some of the largess is not nearly as large as company news releases suggest.\n\nConsider retailers like Walmart, Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot. They\u2019ve tied the size of bonuses to tenure, so that only employees who have been with the company for 20 years or more will receive the $1,000 maximum that was highlighted in their announcements.

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "The moral of this story is that unless the economy is deeply depressed, there will always be some companies, somewhere, raising wages and offering bonuses. Which brings me to the Trump tax cut and the very bad, no good job much of the media initially did of covering its effects.\n\nEvery card-carrying economist agrees that cutting corporate tax rates will have some trickle-down effect on wages \u2013 in the long run. How much of a trickle-down effect depends on a bunch of technical factors: what share of corporate profits represents monopoly rents rather than returns to capital, how responsive inflows of foreign capital are to the U.S. rate of return, what share of the capital stock is even affected by the corporate tax rate. Enthusiasts claim that the tax cut will eventually go 100% to workers; most serious modelers think the number is more like 20 or 25 percent.\n\nWhatever the number, however, it\u2019s about the long run. It requires a chain of events: lower taxes -> higher investment -> higher stock of capital -> higher demand for labor -> higher wages. And this chain of events should take a number of years, probably decades, to fully work itself through. Even in the most favorable analyses, there is no reason to expect any wage gains in the first few months after a tax cut.\n\nYet for a while there the news was full of stories about companies announcing that they were giving their workers bonuses thanks to the Trump tax cut. Why were they doing this?\n\nWell, the tax cut provided no immediate incentive to raise wages. It did, however, give companies that benefited from the tax cut a strong political incentive to claim that the tax break was the reason for bonuses or wage hikes they would have given in any case. Why not? They want the tax cut to look good, since it\u2019s good for them. And hyping its benefits is a cheap way to make a de facto campaign contribution to an administration that can do a lot to help companies it likes, say by removing pesky safety or environmental regulations.", "title": "Opinion | Bonuses and Bogosity", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Brown\u2019s statements highlight California\u2019s distinction as a state of high highs and low lows. From the recession of the early 1990s to the 2001 dot-com crash to the housing collapse of a decade ago, downturns often end up being more pronounced in the state than elsewhere. The next recession, whenever it comes, will almost certainly land harder here than it does in the rest of the country. And that boom-bust pattern is especially tough on California\u2019s budget \u2014 something that Mr. Brown, who was first elected governor more than four decades ago, knows well.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2009, as the last recession took hold, California state revenue fell 19 percent, versus 8 percent for state revenues nationwide, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics. There has been a strong rebound since then, but the gains are unlikely to last. That is because California\u2019s government relies on a heavily progressive income tax that generates most of its revenue from a relatively small number of wealthy taxpayers whose incomes are erratic.\n\nEven a blip in the stock market can punch holes in the state\u2019s budget. And because stock prices have more than doubled during Mr. Brown\u2019s term, it seems like a good bet that whoever succeeds him will face challenges. If and when that day comes, any proposal to increase taxes will probably be unpopular. Mr. Brown already raised income taxes to address the state\u2019s last budget mess, and California taxpayers took a further hit as a result of the new tax bill, which curbed the deductibility of state and local taxes on federal returns.\n\n\u201cHis successor gets a world in which revenues are more volatile,\u201d without the option of raising taxes, said David Crane, a lecturer in public policy at Stanford University and a former adviser to Mr. Brown\u2019s predecessor, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cThat\u2019s a really tough world to operate in.\u201d\n\nBig Swings The economy and job market are more volatile in California than in the nation as a whole. The state\u2019s job losses are more severe in bad times, and the gains are more pronounced in good times. California\u2019s employment volatility, relative to the U.S. average INDEX: U.S. = 100 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 \u201980 \u201985 \u201990 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915 California\u2019s employment volatility, relative to the U.S. average INDEX: U.S. = 100 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 \u201980 \u201985 \u201990 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915\n\nA recession would also further expose problems that have festered for decades. Across California, cities and school districts are having trouble keeping up with ballooning pension obligations, squeezing teacher salaries and state services. In warning about budget troubles to come, Mr. Brown was making a case for adding more of today\u2019s surplus to the state\u2019s rainy day fund to cushion the blow of the next downturn.\n\nMr. Brown\u2019s final State of the State speech also included plenty of optimistic notes and pushes for big spending in the future on items mostly outside the state\u2019s general fund. He talked about \u201csetting the pace for the entire nation\u201d and embracing big infrastructure projects like a high-speed rail line despite doubts about its viability as costs mount.\n\n\u201cYou have all of these projects that he wants to do,\u201d said Stephen Levy, the director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, an independent research organization. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, this year may be rosy, but watch out, it ain\u2019t going to continue. And I agree.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven in prosperity, California has plenty of problems. The bulk of its recent gains have flowed to wealthier coastal cities, leaving inland areas behind, and a severe housing shortage has led to punishing rent increases and rising homelessness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, economists generally agree that the state\u2019s long-term prospects are bright. It is home to many of the world\u2019s most valuable and innovative companies, and it attracts an outsize portion of the skilled work force and venture capital financing, helping it create new industries as old ones slow down or fade away.\n\nAnd recession forecasting is a tough business even for those whose livelihoods depend on it, like Ed Del Beccaro, a senior managing director in the Walnut Creek office of Transwestern, a commercial real estate brokerage. He manages a team of brokers and travels around the Bay Area giving speeches and forecasts to chambers of commerce and other business groups.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Last year he caused a stir before the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference by publishing a lengthy essay on his Brexit vision. More recently, he made headlines with calls for higher health spending, perhaps seeking to justify his widely debunked claim that quitting the European Union would free up around $500 million a week for the National Health Service.\n\nYears ago, Mr. Johnson\u2019s famously dismissed his prospects of becoming prime minister as being \u201cabout as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars, or me being reincarnated as an olive.\u201d\n\nBut more recently \u2014 and plausibly \u2014 he admitted his ambitions, likening his approach to becoming leader to grabbing a football if it \u201ccame loose from the back of the scrum,\u201d a term from Rugby football akin to a fumble in American football.\n\nIn 2016 that ball slipped, agonizingly, from his grasp after the Brexit referendum, when Mr. Johnson was abandoned by key allies and forced to withdraw from the contest to replace the former prime minister, David Cameron, who quit after the plebiscite. Theresa May went on to take the crown.\n\nBut Mr. Johnson may be sensing another moment of opportunity, as Mrs. May struggles to control her cabinet amid calls from some of her own lawmakers for her to step aside.\n\nBrexit has caught her in an unforgiving political vise.

He has been weakened by his performance as foreign secretary, which has been criticized as accident-prone and lightweight.\n\nMeanwhile, he has encountered unexpected competition for the Brexit spotlight in the form of Jacob Rees-Mogg, a caricature patrician with impeccable manners, a socially conservative philosophy and hard-line pro-Brexit views.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d\n\nDrury\u2019s reason for optimism is the changes he made to his swing over the winter.\n\nHe drove from his off-season home in Las Vegas to the Los Angeles area about six times to work with the hitting coaches Craig Wallenbrock, Tim Laker and Robert Van Scoyoc, who have transformed the swings \u2014 and careers \u2014 of Boston\u2019s J. D. Martinez, his former teammate in Arizona, and the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Chris Taylor.\n\nThe idea: to turn some of the 37 doubles he hit last season \u2014 more than any Yankee, despite having only 445 at-bats \u2014 into home runs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a line drive up the middle all day,\u201d Drury said. \u201cBut when I\u2019m getting a 3-1 fastball or looking for a certain pitch, I don\u2019t want that to be what I\u2019m settling for. I want to drive the ball and be able to hit some home runs.\u201d\n\nThe changes have resulted in Drury\u2019s getting the bat head into the hitting zone early and carrying it through longer so that he has greater margin for error, and also changing the plane of his swing, so it has an upward tilt, which he hopes will result in more fly balls that carry over the fence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand how to hit certain pitches that I was trying to get,\u201d Drury said. \u201cI was just trying to get big with my swing, and that doesn\u2019t work.

One example was an article falsely claiming that Mr. da Silva had said he would ascend to the presidency even if it meant trampling the federal judge who convicted him of corruption and money laundering last year.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro is the rare Brazilian public figure who is the subject of more fake news stories that cast him in a positive light than a negative one, according to Veja\u2019s analysis.

{"date": "2018-02-05 00:00:00", "text": "A researcher read aloud the words that were printed in a bubble beside the image. In one experimental group, the children followed gender stereotype: \u201cHello! My name is Sarah, and my favorite toy is My Little Pony! I have lots, and play with them every day.\u201d \u201cHello! My name is Thomas, and every day I like to play with my cars. They\u2019re my favorite toys!\u201d For the other experimental group, Sarah had the car and Thomas had My Little Pony; the language was otherwise identical.\n\nAfter they had seen the pictures, the children in the study were shown a set of toys, chosen to be stereotypically masculine and feminine (baby doll, jet fighter, tool kit, tea set) and asked who should play with which toy, and the children who had seen the counter-stereotypic pictures were more flexible in their answers, more open to the idea that both girls and boys might like toys from both sides of the conventional aisle.\n\nThey were also less rigid when they were asked which children from the pictures they wanted to play with; exposure to Sarah-with-the-car and Thomas-with-the-pony meant that children were more open to playing with representatives of the other gender. So the toys in the pictures affected who the children wanted as playmates.\n\nDr. Spinner pointed out that seeing the photos did not open up the children\u2019s preferences for what toys they themselves wanted to play with; they were more likely to say that other boys and girls could play with a variety of toys, but the two experimental groups were equally unlikely to make those counter-stereotypic choices themselves. On the other hand, she said, it was only one exposure, and it\u2019s possible, if there were more of those counter-stereotypic images around, that children might become more open to enjoying the whole spectrum of toys.\n\nLaura Zimmermann, a developmental psychologist who is a professor of psychology at Shenandoah University in Virginia, was the first author on a study published last year in the Journal of Children and Media, which looked at preschool children\u2019s responses to toy commercials. Children are showing more flexibility than they used to, she said, in terms of who they thought the ads were meant for, responding that both boys and girls, for example, could like Batman, or like the \u201cfemale\u201d line of Lego building blocks.\n\n\u201cTheir behavior got much more stereotypical when they were asked their own preferences,\u201d she said, and the boys especially were unwilling to say that they liked any of the ads aimed at girls.\n\nBut the ads themselves, she said, continue to reflect the same old stereotypes. \u201cMy concerns are that children\u2019s ads shape and reinforce stereotypes,\u201d Dr. Zimmermann said. \u201cThey are obviously not working alone; we have wider societal influences at work, but ads are powerful.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Traditionally masculine toys like blocks and puzzles, Dr. Spinner said, encourage visual and spatial skills, while traditionally feminine toys encourage communication and social skills.\n\n\u201cIf children only play with one, then they are missing out on a whole host of skills,\u201d she said.\n\nThey are also limiting their own interests and the scope of their futures.\n\n\u201cWe know that these stereotypes that are being shaped and reinforced can be linked to a lot of different things from educational and occupational goals to academic ability to social development,\u201d Dr. Zimmermann said. \u201cIt is really important to have children get this broad range of experiences.\u201d\n\nAs children grow up, Dr. Spinner said, they do tend to become more flexible about what boys and girls can do; 7-year-olds are less rigid than 4- or 5-year-olds. But the messages they get from their environment are important, and so is the chance to play with toys \u2014 and with other children \u2014 in ways that don\u2019t box them in too tightly.\n\n\u201cMixed gender play is really important, getting boys and girls to play with one another and recognize behavioral similarities,\u201d Dr. Spinner said. \u201cChildren can overcome their anxieties about playing with other-gender children if you can get them to understand there are a lot of similarities in what they like to play with, rather than focusing on the gender of the child.\u201d\n\nSomewhere between the ages of 2 and 3, children figure out whether they are boys or girls, developmental psychologists say, often citing Lawrence Kohlberg\u2019s theory of gender identity development; they go on from there to identify the people around them as male or female, and to create rules and categories of what behaviors and interests and habits go with which identity.\n\n\u201cThe good news or bad news is, experience makes a difference,\u201d Dr. Zimmermann said. The images children see can reinforce stereotypes and limit their horizons, but they can also open up possibilities and lead kids to believe that they have more choices. Children are actively seeking clues about what their gender identities mean; toys and play should give them space, not narrow their choices.\n\nMany parents have stories of a girl who insisted on rocking a toy train to sleep, or a boy who pushed a doll along the floor, making train noises, foiling well-meaning parental attempts to foster non-stereotypic play. And parents don\u2019t have to \u201ceradicate\u201d all stereotypical play, Dr. Zimmermann said in an email message.\n\n\u201cAfter all, a princess can play with worms.

{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "I usually read books that are actually in the form of books, with paper, covers and binding. I like the weight of the book in my hands and I prefer the experience of actually turning pages. I like the smell of books as well. I usually have two books that I am reading simultaneously. One is normally a paperback that fits into the back of my pants and is easy to travel with when I\u2019m heading out. The other is often a hardcover and it stays at home waiting for me by my bed. That said, I do love audiobooks. I listen to audiobooks while I\u2019m drawing. For example, I\u2019ve listened to books by St. Augustine, Oliver Sacks, Jane Austen, Emily Bront\u00eb, Patti Smith and Carrie Fisher. In fact, I might even argue the last two authors have audiobooks that are better than the physical books, since Patti Smith and Carrie Fisher actually read their own books to you. And two years ago, I experienced all of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books as read by Jim Dale. They were glorious.\n\nWhat book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nI have a lot of Bibles. Several years ago I read both the Old and the New Testament as research for a speech I was giving in D.C. and I was very moved by the humanity of many of the stories. King David and his son Absalom especially got to me. Here was a story about a child who spends his entire adult life trying to usurp his father, yet in the end the father loves his son no matter what and mourns him deeply when he dies. Isn\u2019t there a lesson here for all parents about the meaning of love without conditions? I was also surprised to discover that the story of Onan isn\u2019t actually about onanism, and that King Solomon, the wisest of all the kings, ended his days turning against God. Who knew? Plus, there\u2019s a talking donkey like in \u201cShrek.\u201d\n\nWho is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?\n\nI\u2019ve always been drawn to stories about orphans: Pip from \u201cGreat Expectations,\u201d by Charles Dickens; Mary Lennox from \u201cThe Secret Garden,\u201d by Frances Hodgson Burnett; and of course Harry Potter from the series by J. K. Rowling. If pressed, however, I\u2019d add a few children with living parents, like Lyra Belacqua from the \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d trilogy by Philip Pullman; Max from \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d by Maurice Sendak; and Douglas Spaulding from \u201cDandelion Wine,\u201d by Ray Bradbury.\n\nAntiheroes or villains include Humbert Humbert from \u201cLolita,\u201d by Vladimir Nabokov; Mrs. Coulter from \u201cHis Dark Materials\u201d; and the particularly terrifying Dolores Umbridge from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d series. I\u2019d also add Edward Gorey, who is responsible for the deaths of 26 children in \u201cThe Gashlycrumb Tinies.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\n\nSome years ago I received a fan letter from Ray Bradbury that simply said, \u201cI love Hugo Cabret!\u201d I was floored, particularly because I\u2019d loved his books since high school. I wrote him back and ended up in a phone conversation with one of his daughters, who told me that I should stop by if I\u2019m ever in Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be in L.A. next week,\u201d I lied. When I arrived at his house his daughter met me at the door and ushered me into a tiny room where Mr. Bradbury was sitting in a recliner surrounded by VHS tapes of old movies, piles of books and papers, and a model of the Nautilus from \u201c20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\u201d Around his neck was a medal, which he said had recently been given to him by the president of France. We talked for a while, and I asked him if it was true that he wrote every single day. He pointed to a nearby box and told me to bring it to him. He opened the box and inside was a manuscript he\u2019d just finished typing for a new book of short stories to be called \u201cWe\u2019ll Always Have Paris.\u201d One of the short story titles jumped out at me. \u201cRemembrance, Ohio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful title,\u201d I said to him.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, \u201cI made it up.\u201d\n\nSometime later a package arrived at my home. It was a copy of his new book. I\u2019ve only now realized it was Paris that had brought us together in the first place, since it was the setting for \u201cHugo Cabret.\u201d So I guess it\u2019s true for me and Mr. Bradbury: We\u2019ll always have Paris.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\n\nI usually watched the movies of books I should have read. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d are all movies I loved based on books I did not read (I\u2019ve read all of them since). The most influential book I did read was probably \u201cThe Borrowers,\u201d by Mary Norton, with exceptional line drawings by Beth and Joe and Krush. It\u2019s about a family of tiny people who live under the floorboards of a boy\u2019s house, and I basically read this as nonfiction. I made miniature furniture and left it for the Borrowers who lived in my house.", "title": "Brian Selznick: By the Book", "authors": []}

She reminded me of myself in some ways. She\u2019s probably 10 years younger than I am, and she\u2019s an example of all these young women in the Arabic world who are pursuing their own studies, not just waiting to get married. When I first met her she had finished her studies in Damascus, where she lived far from her family. She loved the theater and was working in film, dubbing Turkish voices into Arabic with a Syrian accent.\n\nIn the text she talks about how she\u2019s more of a Damascus person, though she\u2019s really from Sweida [a city close to the Jordan border]. It\u2019s like someone saying they\u2019re from New York, even when they didn\u2019t grow up near there.\n\nThe orange splotches I added to suggest wind. And you can see a hint of that in her clothes too. I\u2019m not a big believer in the idea or ideal of the finished drawing. The series is really performative \u2014 it\u2019s about the moment of sitting down with someone, facing each other, sharing something. The moment of making the drawing is really what matters to me.\n\nAli, Kassel, 2016\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen I was in Kassel, Germany, preparing for Documenta, I was introduced to Tamim, a Syrian restaurant owner. His restaurant, which has maybe 10 tables, became my studio. He would give us coffee or tea and we could sit for an hour or more.\n\nThat\u2019s where I met Ali, who is from Al Zabadani, a Syrian town close to the Lebanese border where there was a big battle. He told me that 60 percent of his friends in Zabadani died, and his home was destroyed. He said there\u2019s not a single stone left standing in Zabadani.\n\nI used black ink for this but I put some green watercolor on the brush. I was trying to evoke the color of ash, the feeling of when a city is burned out. We sat for a few hours, a very long meeting. He was confident and open and ready to share.\n\nThis is something I found more with the men I met in Europe than the women \u2014 the men more urgently needed to speak. While the women I met had children or husbands to take care of and were too busy to talk, these men were mostly on their own, away from family in Syria or Jordan. They carried the stigma associated with being a refugee in Europe but of course they\u2019re not supposed to cry or say they\u2019re in trouble when they call home, so this became a great platform for them. I had men telling me: It\u2019s been five years since I\u2019ve seen my children; I\u2019ve missed out on their lives.\n\nAnd some men had lost the people they love, which was very heavy.

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "It is important for the book\u2019s readers to be aware that Holiday, the college dropout, is also a huge believer in Stoicism, an ancient Greek and Roman philosophy that preaches suffering, humility, acceptance and endurance without complaint. He became a zealot while at college after reading Marcus Aurelius\u2019 \u201cMeditations\u201d four times in a row and then affixing his favorite passages from the book to the walls of his dorm room. Holiday is nothing if not erudite; every time you turn around in \u201cConspiracy,\u201d he is trying to make profound points by quoting from a vast range of philosophers, statesmen and Great Thinkers \u2014 everyone from Machiavelli and Seneca to Kierkegaard and George W.S. Trow, and on and on.\n\nBut incessant name-dropping aside \u2014 which tends to detract from his gripping narrative \u2014 Holiday has written one helluva page-turner. He documents how, starting in 2007, the secretive Thiel sought to take revenge on Denton for outing him on Gawker just because Denton could, and because he figured the news would generate the clicks and the kind of attention Denton and his erstwhile enterprise craved. Thiel, rightly offended, began a stealth campaign to punish Denton for his callous and cavalier behavior.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a chance meeting in Germany, Thiel enlisted the help of someone Holiday refers to only as \u201cMr. A,\u201d and then Charles Harder, the Los Angeles attorney who recently represented Donald Trump in his wildly unsuccessful legal effort to stop the publication of Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury.\u201d Armed with $10 million or so from Thiel, Mr. A. and Harder dug up everything they could find about Denton, his colleagues at Gawker, Gawker itself, its parent company Gawker Media and some of the other people Gawker offended. They also needed a novel legal theory about what Denton had done, figuring that the First Amendment would protect Denton and Gawker.\n\nWhen, in October 2012, Gawker made the momentous decision to publish without permission excerpts from a sex tape involving Hogan and his former best friend\u2019s wife, Thiel not only had the perfect protagonist in an equally angry and determined Hogan but also a legal theory based on the idea that Hogan\u2019s privacy had been invaded (as had Thiel\u2019s five years earlier). Unbeknown to Denton and his company\u2019s lawyers, Thiel had decided to bankroll Hogan in his legal battle against Gawker and Denton. In classic David and Goliath fashion, Denton tragically underestimated his foes and paid the iron price: As has been well documented elsewhere, Denton lost the five-count lawsuit in a Florida courtroom and was slapped with a $140 million verdict. Gawker Media had no choice but to file for bankruptcy; its carcass was sold to the highest bidder.\n\nTo his considerable credit and for reasons that aren\u2019t entirely made clear, Holiday decided to write \u201cConspiracy\u201d after both Thiel and Denton approached him separately, wanting to share with him their views of the blockbuster case. He\u2019s less successful, it seems to me, in pushing his view throughout the book that Thiel, Mr. A, Hogan and Harder were involved in an old-fashioned \u201cconspiracy\u201d \u2014 in the Stoical sense of the word \u2014 to bring down Denton and his crew. Yes, they triumphed wildly, and beyond anything they could have expected. But couldn\u2019t that just be chalked up to having the better and more sympathetic legal argument rather than to having better tactics, strategies and a morally superior way of living?\n\nOf course, this Occam\u2019s razor approach to the Gawker case would not lend itself as easily to a public relations mastermind\u2019s skills. \u201cConspiracy\u201d was embargoed for reasons that aren\u2019t clear either \u2014 much of its contents are already publicly known \u2014 and each page of the uncorrected proof was stamped with an annoyingly large confidentiality notice. Holiday is nothing if not a new kind of clever. In keeping with Stoicism\u2019s tenets about self-effacement, in Holiday\u2019s Twitter profile photo his face is completely covered by his two hands. But make no mistake, the genius is at work, already promoting: A recent Observer column is about Harder and \u201cthe insane backstory behind the lawyer who shook down Donald Trump (and Hulk Hogan).\u201d", "title": "Bringing Down a Media Empire", "authors": ["William D.

Yet annual spending on larger-size apparel accounts for only 16 percent of the $112 billion market in the United States because the inventory was not available.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting bigger, but the business hasn\u2019t gotten bigger,\u201d Marshal Cohen, a retail industry analyst at the NPD Group, said.\n\nThat has begun to change. Spurred by an underserved market, along with a heightened emphasis on inclusiveness in the fashion industry, new retailers are sensing an opportunity. E-commerce businesses that rent, as well as sell, larger sizes have grown. With some focusing on moderately priced clothes and others concentrating on the designer market, these sites are finding an eager audience. Social media influencers like Jordyn Woods and Tess Holliday and actresses like Rebel Wilson and Chrissy Metz have also raised the profile of this market.\n\nPhoto\n\nRetail giants are also expanding their presence in this market. In March, for example, Walmart acquired Modcloth, an e-commerce site that sold clothing in a range of sizes. Other e-commerce sites, like Stitch Fix, have also begun to offer larger sizes. But industry experts say large retailers lack the personal touch that shoppers seek.\n\n\u201cWhile Walmart and Amazon could be formidable competitors, this customer wants a company that understands her, and isn\u2019t just selling to everyone,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\n\nSo some retail start-ups are trying to meet those demands. Christine Hunsicker, a tech entrepreneur, and Jaswinder Pal Singh, a computer science professor at Princeton, started Gwynnie Bee, a subscription-based clothing rental service.\n\n\u201cWe became interested in apparel because of the size of the market and the need,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Gwynnie Bee model, women who wear sizes 10 to 32 receive regular shipments of clothing. Once it\u2019s worn, no laundering is required; clients simply return the options to the company for a fresh selection. If the customer loves an item, she can buy it, Ms. Hunsicker said.\n\nIn contrast, Eloquii is a reincarnation rather than a start-up. The company was originally a brick-and-mortar retailer owned by the Limited, which, despite protests from a loyal customer base, shut down the brand in 2013, Ms. Chase said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe founder and chairman, John Auerbach, who has held a number of e-commerce positions, bought Eloquii\u2019s assets from Sun Capital in 2013, including intellectual property and the customer list. Ms. Chase joined the same year. The company has already been through two rounds of venture capital financing, and now has backing of close to $40 million, Ms. Chase said.\n\nMost of these businesses are focused on online customers, but some are experimenting with physical stores. Eloquii has opened three, in Chicago; Columbus, Ohio; and Washington. Two of them are pop-ups.\n\nMost physical stores with plus-size apparel do not \u201coffer a great experience,\u201d Ms. Chase said, so Eloquii is focusing on fitting-room aesthetics and other amenities\n\nPhoto\n\nGwynnie Bee had a pop-up store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan that \u201cwent really well,\u201d Ms. Hunsicker said, adding that her company is trying to determine what role a store plays in its business model.\n\nA bigger challenge for the companies is finding inventory. Designers have become more accommodating, spurred both by an untapped market and the desire to appear inclusive. But entrepreneurs are not waiting for manufacturers to make the first move.\n\nNew York Fashion Week, which officially began Thursday, offers an opportunity for these entrepreneurs to get noticed. Dia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times during New York Fashion Week last February, encouraging designers to look anew at the market with the line \u201cFashion she can\u2019t wear is becoming a bit unfashionable.\u201d The gamble paid off: Ms. Boujarwah said the ad had led to two new lines, one with Ms. Wilson, the actress, and the other with the designer Nanette Lepore.\n\nEntrepreneurs are learning to be more flexible, too. For instance, Gwynnie Bee will add smaller sizes to its lineup after determining that designers would be more willing to work with it if it offered a wider range. The site, Ms. Hunsicker said, will include only items that are available in all sizes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet fabrication remains a hurdle for some. As a result, founders like Ms. Boujarwah of Dia, which counts Sequoia Capital among its investors, are designing their own products. Similarly, Ms. Hunsicker said Gwynnie Bee had, \u201cfor a number of vendors, taken on a lot of pattern design,\u201d in addition to offering the site\u2019s private label clothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their aesthetic and vision, and we\u2019re helping to make it fit,\u201d she said.\n\nMany, but not all, of the sites primarily feature moderately priced clothes; as a result, those seeking designer apparel in larger sizes remained underserved. Enter 11 Honor\u00e9, which opened in August, shortly before New York Fashion Week last fall. The site was created by Patrick Herning and Kathryn Retzer, whose mothers wear larger sizes and often had difficulty finding higher-end clothing.\n\n\u201cWe were adamant about building a luxury brand and bringing the best designers we could, including Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Badgley Mischka, Monique Lhuillier and Prabal Gurung,\u201d Ms. Retzer said.\n\nAs they began formulating their idea, friends encouraged him to reach out to Kirsten Green, the Silicon Valley venture capitalist known for her retail investing acumen. They pitched their idea and obtained seed financing from Ms. Green\u2019s firm, Forerunner Ventures, as well as from several others, for a total of $3.5 million.\n\nMost of the companies do not yet offer intimate apparel, although Eloquii plans to offer lingerie in the future. To reach that market, Deborah A. Christel, a co-author of the study on women\u2019s sizes, left her position as an assistant professor at Washington State University to start a company that would encompass all sizes for lingerie.\n\nMs. Christel said her company, Kade & Vos, would begin selling next summer. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that one day, women\u2019s clothes will just be women\u2019s without referring to plus size,\u201d she said.", "title": "Bringing a Personal Touch to Plus-Size Fashion", "authors": ["Ellen Rosen"]}

Carillion collapsed in part because it had underbid for contracts that became unsustainable when it ran into delays and cost overruns.\n\nThat pattern seems to have played out at Millbrow, which has been taken over by the local council while the company restructures.\n\nClients in the British system fall into two broad categories: those who are self-financed, and those whose care is paid by the local council. But providers and health care experts said that local governments typically fund little more than half the actual cost, forcing providers to charge higher rates to self-funded residents.\n\nFour Seasons, the provider, says it had trouble recruiting and retaining staff, forcing it to rely on temporary workers. \u201cThe home had not been financially sustainable and had been making a loss for some time,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cSo we were effectively paying to provide care.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs conditions deteriorated, both care givers and the relatives of residents said in interviews, a revolving door of managers led to frequent breakdowns in communication, to the point that no one was aware the home was nearing collapse.\n\nStaffing levels on a floor caring for residents with dementia were \u201chorrendous,\u201d said Lisa Riley, a 39-year-old care giver. At one point, she said, there were only four employees to look after 35 people. This meant some could not be supervised around the clock and would wander, sometimes tripping and falling. \u201cWe tried, that\u2019s all we can say,\u201d she said.\n\nPublic inspectors found residents at risk of choking because they were not made to sit upright when they ate. Staff members were seen handling soiled laundry without wearing gloves, the inspectors added in the government report, and cushions and other material were \u201cheavily contaminated, and had a strong malodor.\u201d\n\nIn the last year, at least 13 nursing homes run by Four Seasons have either closed or, like Millbrow, been taken over by local councils.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne home in South Hampshire that closed had to transfer its elderly residents. Within a month, five had died, according to a former employee.\n\n\u201cSome of these people should not be moved because they\u2019re not going to last,\u201d said the employee, Lynne Wells. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t.

Qualcomm shareholders vote on the board on March 6.

That model generated an outsize flow of profits that Qualcomm poured into developing new generations of wireless chips, as well as microprocessors that handle calculations in mobile devices.\n\nThose chips helped Apple turn the iPhone into one of the most lucrative products in high-tech history. But Qualcomm also helped South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics and many Chinese competitors, which churned out a flood of low-priced iPhone rivals and made smartphones affordable to many more people. Apple sued Qualcomm a year ago, attacking patent licensing practices that have also been opposed by regulators in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\nBroadcom went after Qualcomm\u2019s business model on Monday in a voluminous set of slides, and has indicated it would seek to make peace with Apple, which is a major Broadcom customer for other types of wireless chips. But some major Chinese manufacturers have expressed concerns about the deal, reflecting Broadcom\u2019s track record of cutting spending on research and raising chip prices. Samsung also now appears to be siding with Qualcomm, which last week announced a new patent deal with the South Korean company and Samsung\u2019s agreement to stop opposing Qualcomm in court proceedings in the country.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.\n\nBut the revised offer may entice shareholders to demand that Qualcomm\u2019s executives begin negotiations.

ITheatrics\u2019 charges customers about $200,000 for its two-year-long adaptation process and has around 18 musicals in some phase of adaptation at any given time. (The adaptation kits then sold to schools usually cost between about $400 for elementary schools and $1,000 or more for high schools.)\n\nToday nearly every licensing company offers musicals tailored to this market.

Until 2015 Mr. Mount was an anonymous Broadway stage manager. Now he is a star, at least among the tween theater crowd. He interviews Broadway personalities for a show he distributes on YouTube. More than 3 million people have viewed his show.\n\nLast February, he began partnering with Playbill. The 134-year-old theater publication saw an opportunity in Mr. Mount\u2019s audience: 12- to 24-year-olds who live for Broadway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have Tyler and his energy aboard,\u201d said Alex Birsh, vice president of Playbill. \u201cHe helps us communicate with the next generation of theater-obsessed people.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPlaybill is not just hoping for future readers. It created a website called Playbillder that lets schools and theater groups create a Playbill for their shows. Schools can use it to sell ads to raise money and bring in services. In 2017, according to the company, about 2 million Playbills were produced using its software. About 85 percent of its licenses are sold to schools and about 40 percent of those are middle and elementary schools.\n\nA broad range of businesses target this youth market. According to the Educational Theatre Association, about 27 percent of a school\u2019s budget goes toward licensing the material. Sets are another 19 percent. Costumes are 17 percent. Last year nearly 4,000 high school students attended the organization\u2019s International Thespian Festival, which featured vendors offering everything from a costume inventory database to stage makeup, lighting and ticketing software.\n\nBroadway Media Distribution, a company that provides projected digital scenery, works directly with Music Theatre International and Theatrical Rights Worldwide to create backgrounds tailored to their shows. They can cost anywhere from $250 to $995 depending on the production. About 85 percent of the company\u2019s customers are middle and high schools.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn a Saturday evening at the festival, young actors from Spotlight Theatre Productions in Sarasota, Fla., wearing purple and blue billowing pants and golden vests, held hands in a circle. They passed a hand squeeze from one to another as they prepared to go on stage. They were about to perform songs from a new version of \u201cAladdin JR.\u201d in front of nearly 6,000 theater-obsessed students, parents and theater directors.\n\n\u201cAladdin JR.\u201d had an unusual path to its debut here. \u201cAladdin,\u201d the highest grossing movie of 1992, was adapted as a school musical in 2004. Its success there inspired Disney to stage it on Broadway in 2014. Now it has again been adapted for schools.\n\nThe success of musicals in this market is upending traditions in theatrical licensing, said Mr. Flahaven. Historically, musicals would not be released to the educational market until the Broadway production closed. Licensers were afraid that it would cannibalize business. But that is changing. \u201cAladdin JR.\u201d is available even though the original show remains on Broadway. And at the direction of Andrew Lloyd Webber, licenses for his production of \u201cSchool of Rock\u201d are available to schools while it too is still on Broadway. \u201cThe idea is to put it out there and to see if it drives business toward seeing the Broadway show or the tour,\u201d said Mr. Flahaven.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nEducational licensing has reversed the fortunes of some shows. \u201cSeussical: The Musical\u201d lost $10 million in six months when it debuted on Broadway in 2000. The writers reworked it and it had a successful national tour. Mr. McDonald adapted it for schools and it remains one of the most-produced school musicals in the country. In the 2016-17 season, Music Theatre International issued more than 2,500 licenses for middle and elementary school \u201cSeussical\u201d adaptations.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor a show like \u2018Seussical,\u2019 the educational market is the most important piece of the marketplace,\u201d said Mr. Weissler, one of the show\u2019s producers. Thanks to licensing revenue, he said that he has paid back millions in loans and paid down some of the show\u2019s original investment.\n\nBut musicals don\u2019t sell themselves. In the beginning, Mr. McDonald flew to teacher conferences to pitch these shows. But his approach has changed. \u201cThe more we can make the marketing experiential, the more successful it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAnd so this conference is a rousing celebration of theater. Crowds participate in mass singalongs to songs from \u201cShrek The Musical.\u201d Students perform songs from musicals and are critiqued by company representatives. Students congratulate each other on their performances, talk shop and shriek at the sight of Stephen Schwartz, the composer for \u201cGodspell\u201d and \u201cWicked.\u201d All that excitement is woven into education, marketing, networking and tween dance parties.\n\nStudents from Bravo, the performing arts program at Gwendolyn Brooks Middle School in Oak Park, Ill., who performed songs from \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang JR.,\u201d also workshopped the production last year for iTheatrics, which was adapting the musical for the educational market. (The school has worked on about a dozen plays for iTheatrics). Executives from the company traveled to the school, watched the students perform and incorporated feedback into the adaptation.\n\n\u201cThe people here are tastemakers,\u201d said Mr. Scott. \u201cThey go back to their communities, people say, \u2018Hey, what is Bravo doing?\u2019 And they say \u2018Wow, we want to do that.\u2019 It has a trickle-down effect.\u201d\n\nPhoto", "title": "Broadway Hits the Middle School Circuit", "authors": ["Jim Rendon"]}

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Over the past couple of months Republicans have passed or proposed three big budget initiatives. First, they enacted a springtime-for-plutocrats tax cut that will shower huge benefits on the wealthy while offering a few crumbs for ordinary families \u2014 crumbs that will be snatched away after a few years, so that it ends up becoming a middle-class tax hike. Then they signed on to a what-me-worry budget deal that will blow up the budget deficit to levels never before seen except during wars or severe recessions. Finally, the Trump administration released a surpassingly vicious budget proposal that would punish not just the vulnerable but also most working families.\n\nLooking at all of this should make you very angry; it certainly infuriates me. But my anger isn\u2019t mostly directed at Republicans; it\u2019s directed at their enablers, the professional centrists, both-sides pundits, and news organizations that spent years refusing to acknowledge that the modern G.O.P. is what it so clearly is.\n\nWhich is not to say that Republicans should be let off the hook.\n\nTo be sure, American history is full of politicians and parties that pursued what we would now call nefarious ends. After all, the pre-Civil War Democratic Party \u2014 which shares nothing but a name with today\u2019s Democrats \u2014 was largely devoted to the cause of preserving slavery.

In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our own.\u201d\n\nBerkshire vs. S.&P. 500\n\nMr. Buffett has long set the goal of beating the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index and in 2017, Berkshire did just that.\n\nThe company\u2019s book value rose 23 percent, while its stock price climbed 21.9 percent. The S.&P. 500 climbed 21.8 percent.\n\nFor years, Berkshire\u2019s book value was Mr. Buffett\u2019s preferred measure for comparing Berkshire\u2019s performance to the S.&P. 500 and he highlighted the comparison on a table on the first page of the letter. But outperforming the S.&P. 500 has become more difficult as Berkshire has grown and shifted to buying whole companies.

The insurance segment of Mr. Buffett\u2019s letter contains an interesting discussion on hurricane losses. It says that the hurricanes that hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico last year will lead to $100 billion of losses for insurers. Berkshire estimates that its hit will total $2 billion after taxes, or less than 1 percent of its net worth. That percentage, according to Berkshire, is far below the 7 to 15 percent losses suffered by some reinsurance companies.\n\nIntroducing the mega-catastrophe.

Cook, the chief executive of Apple, acknowledged recently that a new imperative was challenging corporations. Government has \u201cbecome less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was,\u201d he told The New York Times last year. \u201cAnd so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe notion that big business might shape government policy is nothing new, of course. Lobbyists have been working to sway lawmakers for decades, and the corporate world was an influential force in the tax overhaul passed last year.\n\nYet for the most part, these efforts were narrowly aligned with a company\u2019s self-interest, usually in the form of lowering taxes and loosening regulations. And rarely have business leaders tried to assume operational control of a government function, let alone something as complex and unwieldy as health care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent years, however, more chief executives have begun speaking out on issues that at first glance have little to do with the bottom line, including immigration policy, climate change and gay rights.\n\nCorporate leaders have banded together to protest laws targeting transgender and gay rights in Indiana, North Carolina and Texas.

General Motors and Pepsi pulled out of South Africa during the apartheid era. Apple, Disney and Xerox were early in extending health care benefits to gay and lesbian couples.\n\nSimilar efforts by chief executives today recall \u201can earlier era of corporate statesmanship,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a fellow at New America, a research and policy institute. \u201cA lot of these business leaders viewed a business as having a somewhat broader public mission.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow, he said, thanks to \u201cthe rise, over the last 15 years, of the importance of social responsibly and social mission, there is a broad movement in business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven Amazon\u2019s much-publicized efforts to select a city for a second headquarters could, in a roundabout way, influence local policymakers. Given that the company is unlikely to set up shop in a state with socially conservative laws that might alienate some employees, \u201cAmazon could have an effect not just on prices but on what legislators pass,\u201d Mr. Chatterji said.\n\nOther examples of ambitious efforts by top executives to tackle social problems aren\u2019t hard to find. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, made an ill-fated attempt to reform the public schools of Newark, N.J. Elon Musk has audacious plans to build a futuristic high-speed transportation network connecting cities in the Northeast. And billionaires across the political spectrum \u2014 from Tom Steyer on the left to the Koch brothers on the right \u2014 are spending heavily to sway public policy to their liking.\n\nThe wealthiest corporate titans are also using their philanthropy to shape public policy, in the United States and beyond.

(While Art.com offers a selection of exclusive prints through licensing deals and partnerships, many of its posters and fine art gicl\u00e9es are reprints.)\n\nHOW IT WORKS If you\u2019re looking for something unique, Saatchi Art has more than 500,000 original paintings, drawings, sculptures and photographs from thousands of emerging artists around the world. You can sort by medium, size and price, or browse curated selections like \u201cartists of the week\u201d or \u201cnew abstract expressionist paintings.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTapping on an artist\u2019s name brings up more works by that person. Filtering by price ($100 to $500) and size (large) produced a wide selection, from limited-edition prints like a poster of Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d by Robotic Ewe, recreated using the film script ($210), to acrylic paintings like \u201cAmazonia,\u201d a bright abstract by Rashna Hackett, inspired by rain forest parrots ($490).\n\nTapping \u201cview in a room\u201d displays the art on your wall and allows you to save a photo on your phone. But judging size is a bit tricky, as users must estimate their distance from the wall. When I tried to view \u201cWoods II by Dimitar Hinkov\u201d on my wall, the app pulled up the $500 painting, showing its dimensions (20 inches long by 28 inches high) with the directions \u201cplease stand 5.1 feet from wall.\u201d The company plans to introduce an update in coming weeks that eliminates this step by automatically sizing the artwork to scale.\n\nUnlike Art.com\u2019s app, this one has no self-serve feature for viewing your art in frames. But if you have a budget of $1,000 or more, Saatchi Art will connect you with a curator who will put together a selection of art for you to peruse based on your space and style, and work closely with you to produce a mock-up of what that art would look like in your living space.\n\nBEST FOR Beginning and longtime collectors alike with budgets starting at $150, as well as those interested in emerging artists.\n\nPhoto\n\nHOW IT WORKS If you want to see what your own photos would look like hanging on your wall, PictureThat AR allows you to pull from your phone\u2019s camera roll by tapping a circular icon at the bottom of the screen.

Tapping on your superimposed image pulls up its dimensions along with the option to buy a digital print ranging from $36 for a 4-by-6-inch photo to $84 for a 24-by-36-inch one.\n\nThe app also allows you to save an image to your camera roll from any website to view on your wall later by using the Action button (that little square icon with the upward-pointing arrow) on your iPhone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

During a trial run in my light-deprived apartment, my attempts to virtually hang photos elicited the following response: \u201cNot enough surface detail. Try moving camera or find better lighting.\u201d Though I was able to view the photos on my wall, the images occasionally drifted off the screen. Michael Yagudaev, the chief executive of Nano 3 Labs, a mobile and web development company in Vancouver, British Columbia, which developed the app, acknowledged the issue and said he expects the app to improve as the technology evolves.\n\nBecause this app allows you to upload any image from your camera roll onto your wall, it helped with a longstanding issue of my own that the others did not address: All the framed posters and rice-paper prints I bought on vacation in Vietnam years ago that are now stashed at the back of my closet. By taking photos of them, I was able to virtually hang them on the wall to see where I might eventually put them.\n\nBEST FOR Getting an idea of how those skiing shots from your Tahoe vacation would look on your wall or as a way to view art from websites without a 3-D option.\n\nThis home renovation and design site was the flurry of home furnishing sites that began leveraging Apple\u2019s new augmented reality development platform last year to let you try out furniture at home virtually. Earlier this month it added a new feature that extends those capabilities to wall d\u00e9cor, including ready-to-hang paintings, photographs, fine art prints, clocks, mirrors and wall-mounted lighting.\n\nHOW IT WORKS After you have selected a piece of art, tapping the \u201cView in My Room 3D\u201d button opens up the camera view on your iPhone or iPad. To virtually hang the art on the wall, you scan the floor and place the phone flat against the wall.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nThe annual California Democratic Convention is typically filled with passion and drama, though its influence is debatable. Attendees tend to be activists who don\u2019t necessarily represent a cross-section of Democrats or the state.\n\nKeeping that in mind, here are a few of our takeaways from this weekend\u2019s session in San Diego.\n\n1) Senator Dianne Feinstein is not a particularly popular figure in this crowd; she is viewed as too moderate and Old Guard. No one expected her to get the 60 percent of delegate votes needed to capture the state party endorsement.\n\nThat said, her showing \u2014 37 percent \u2014 was something of a shock and reminder of structural weaknesses in her candidacy at a time when the party is moving left and wants change. Her opponent, Kevin de Le\u00f3n, the Senate Democratic leader, got 54 percent. Still, Ms. Feinstein\u2019s lead in statewide polls, financial advantage and her good will with party leaders suggests she shouldn\u2019t be sounding alarm bells. Yet.\n\n2) John Chiang, the state treasurer running for governor, invoked in his speech high-profile affairs that involved two of his main opponents, Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor, and Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles. Their well-documented episodes may seem a bit tame compared with many of the recent #MeToo stories, but Mr. Chiang made clear he thought this could undermine their effectiveness in dealing with the issue.", "title": "California Today: 4 Takeaways From the State\u2019s Democratic Convention", "authors": []}

The Times interviewed Mr. Johns for the Arts & Leisure section last Sunday. And we talked this week to Joanne Heyler, the Broad\u2019s founding director, who co-curated the exhibition, which runs through May 13. This email interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: How did the Johns exhibit end up at the Broad?\n\nJoanne Heyler: \u201cJasper Johns: Something Resembling Truth\u201d is the result of four years\u2019 worth of curatorial and institutional collaboration between the Broad and the Royal Academy of the Arts in London. Edith Devaney, a curator at the Royal Academy, and I had a meeting four years ago as part of her earliest explorations about a Johns show. She inquired whether Eli and Edye Broad and the Broad Art Foundation would lend artworks from our very deep Johns holdings for such a show in L.A. We felt a responsibility, as the only L.A. museum with a deep collecting relationship to the artist, to hold this show here.\n\nQ: How is this show organized?\n\nJH: This exhibition is thematic rather than chronological, which with an artist like Johns \u2014 who returns many times, over decades, to motifs and ideas \u2014 is a very rewarding way to understand the work. Eight thematic sections give you a foothold in Johns\u2019 ruminations, through his work, on the nature of perception, on literary figures, memory, mortality and more.\n\nQ: Could you point out a few of your pieces people should be sure to see? (I know, it\u2019s like asking to choose a favorite child, but indulge us.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJH: \u201cPainting Bitten by a Man\u201d (1961) is one of the smaller works in the show, yet one of the most significant. It has a deep wax surface, painted grey, except for a tooth-marked impression in the center from being repeatedly bitten by the artist. It is raw, and complicates Johns\u2019 aloof or iconic image. Another quiet yet iconic work is \u201cPainted Bronze\u201d (1960).

It piled up in drifts around the weathered sides of four skeletal barns hung with blood red Sterling Ruby mop heads and papered with spectral black and white Warhol reproductions. It was crushed under the shoes of guests, so little motes of popcorn dust blew through the air. They landed on the coats and skirts and hair of Michael B.

They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it. Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 people this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices \u2014 in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman \u2014 are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting. \u2026 At other high schools across the country, students rallied in solidarity with Stoneman Douglas High and staged walkouts to protest what they called Washington\u2019s inaction in protecting students and teachers. A gun control advocacy group, Moms Demand Action, said it had been so overwhelmed with requests from students that it was setting up a parallel, student focused advocacy group. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s too early to talk about it,\u201d Mr. Kasky said. \u201cIf you ask me, it\u2019s way too late.\u201d His argument reflects the words of other students who want action: The issue is not an abstraction to them.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "But nepotism isn\u2019t the most important source of unjustified inequality. Those who already have the advantage of better educations, better connections and better financial resources often parlay these advantages into securing more valuable opportunities and more remunerative careers. Internships are one device for doing this. They\u2019re often unpaid or low-paid, so that only those with substantial family resources can afford to do them. And access to them is often by way of connections. So, internships require both social capital and financial capital. (Charles Murray has famously pronounced them \u201caffirmative action for the advantaged.\u201d) Given all this, you might think that internships should be given to applicants with the best qualifications, but these qualifications are easier for the rich and well connected to acquire, which is why such people often have more cultural capital, too.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a real problem here. The question is what your role should be in finding a solution. If the system is as you describe it, you\u2019re unlikely to get this internship unless you agree to the pulling of the paternal strings. Should you forswear a system you rightly think unfair at the cost of not getting an internship? There are at least two worries about that.\n\nOne is that it won\u2019t make any difference. Nobody will notice that one application came without a thumb on the scale. A second is that the policy of depriving yourself of opportunities in an unfair system makes it likelier that the opportunities will be distributed among people who don\u2019t even have the virtue of being aware of the problem. Generally speaking, social problems of this sort aren\u2019t best solved by heroic individual sacrifice. They\u2019re solved by bringing attention to the issues \u2014 as you just have \u2014 and joining others in campaigning for change. I prefer your other option: Take the internship, work hard and well, get a job and rise to the level where you can reform the company\u2019s hiring practices.

But also, in this time of increased racial sensitivity, I feared the added arrogance of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d had I chosen to intervene. I am a white, white-haired 75-year-old woman (though still healthy and strong); the couple were most likely in their early 20s and \u201cof color.\u201d There were many ethnicities and colors in that car, all avoiding eye contact, and at least one other woman, herself \u201cof color,\u201d aware of this situation (she was the person who changed her seat to avoid the couple).\n\nMy appraisal: He was high and violent, and she was being abused in public in front of my eyes and those of everyone else in the car. What should I have done? Name Withheld\n\nOne issue your letter raises is what philosophers sometimes call \u201cgroup agency.\u201d No individual in the car, let alone you, the white-haired septuagenarian, was obliged to confront a violent, possibly high young man; but you can still have the thought, surveying your fellow passengers, that \u201cwe\u201d should have done something.\n\nMight there have been an effective way to mobilize the disapproval of others in the subway car and perhaps trigger a sense of collective responsibility? The psychology of intervention in cases like these is quite complex, and many studies have been done on so-called bystander apathy. Generally, when people are in a crowd, they don\u2019t intervene when they see someone misbehaving. Part of the explanation is no doubt the reasonable thought that you have no special responsibility here. It\u2019s also true that people are less inclined to intervene when, as here, the victim is perceived to be in a relationship with the perpetrator. People feel it\u2019s not their business. And because the perpetrator here may have been high and seemed violent, there would indeed have been risks in intervening.\n\nStill, interventions in these circumstances might contribute to reducing spousal abuse, especially if we could establish a norm that people don\u2019t allow this to happen in public places like the subway. To get one concern out of the way: I don\u2019t think the fact that you were white and he wasn\u2019t changes much. No \u201cwhite privilege\u201d was implicated in your desire to help this young woman of color. If you said something to him and he reacted violently, he might have used the word \u201cwhite\u201d in cursing you; but had he actually attacked you, the odds that someone would have defended you would, I suspect, have reflected your gender and age, not your race.\n\nWhat were your options? You could have tried addressing the woman and asking her whether she would like help. If the man were to turn on you at that point, someone would probably have come to your aid; it\u2019s hard to rationalize doing nothing when a morally justified stranger is being menaced. But you might have worried that if she said \u201cyes,\u201d he would have taken it out on her later.\n\nAnother tack would have been to address the most vigorous-looking people in the carriage, saying something like, \u201cCome on, we can\u2019t let him do that to her.\u201d Again, though, this is likely to have been helpful only if she had been going to get away from him as a result. Your account suggests that she wasn\u2019t fleeing him: Remaining in the same car, she was perhaps trying to create temporary distance from him, until he cooled down. In that case, they\u2019ll be seeing more of each other, and he could well have exacted a penalty from her if he felt publicly humiliated.\n\nAssuming your appraisal was widely shared, then, I can see why so many of you might have felt powerless. So, let\u2019s return to your instinct to call for law enforcement. It\u2019s worth remembering that there\u2019s a conductor (as well as an operator) on every M.T.A. subway train; you could have stepped out of the car and walked up the platform waving to catch his or her attention and then communicated what you saw.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "Some removal technologies are more fanciful than others, but as for which are most viable, it could be argued that none are, at least not yet. In a report last month, the European Academies Science Advisory Council offered a pessimistic outlook for carbon removal, saying that it offered only \u201climited realistic potential\u201d to have a climate impact. The authors argued that the world should not count on removal technologies to make up for a failure to sharply reduce or eliminate emissions in the first place.\n\nThere are five major approaches to carbon dioxide removal:\n\nPlant more forests. Trees remove carbon dioxide naturally, incorporating it into their tissues as they grow. Worldwide, forests store about one billion to two billion tons of carbon annually, offsetting a chunk of the roughly 10 billion tons emitted by human activity. Reforestation and afforestation, properly managed, could remove a lot more and keep it out of the atmosphere. But planting forests is slow work \u2014 as Icelanders know well \u2014 and requires a lot of land. The world is currently much better at cutting down forests than planting new ones.\n\nCrush a lot of rock. This technique is called enhanced weathering, and is based on the fact that some types of rock weather by naturally combining with carbon dioxide in the air or water. One suggested approach would use the mineral olivine, which is plentiful, crushing it into fine sand and spreading it on land, perhaps along coastlines. But mining, crushing and transporting the billions of tons needed would be expensive and energy intensive. And the carbon removal would still be exceedingly slow.\n\nBurn plants for energy and capture the carbon dioxide. In this high-tech approach, called bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, vegetation would be used to naturally remove carbon dioxide. The vegetation would then be burned in a power plant and the carbon dioxide in the exhaust gases would be captured and stored. So far there are only a handful of working BECCS projects; others have been canceled. Among the many questions about the technology is whether emissions are really negative if the carbon cost of growing and harvesting the vegetation is taken into account.\n\nSprinkle iron in the ocean. Like enhanced weathering, fertilizing the ocean by putting iron particles or other nutrients in the water is among the more far-fetched approaches. The idea is that the nutrients would stimulate the growth of tiny marine plants called phytoplankton, which would incorporate carbon dioxide as they grew and then sink to the bottom of the ocean when they died, taking the carbon with them. Generally, however, putting large amounts of metal or chemicals into seawater is considered ocean dumping. There have been only a few tests of the idea, one of which was conducted without scientific oversight off Western Canada in 2012 under the pretense of helping a native Canadian community improve its salmon catch.", "title": "Can We Really Scrub Carbon Dioxide From the Atmosphere?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Income tax rates were slashed on conventional corporations (so-called C corporations), but the great majority of corporations, especially smaller ones, are in another category. They are pass-through entities, meaning their tax liability is borne by the owners on their personal tax returns. Rates were cut for pass-throughs, too, but not nearly as much, and provisions in the law, passed in late December, limit tax breaks for pass-through vehicles of certain types and sizes.\n\nThe discrepancy in headline tax rates has persuaded some owners of pass-through entities \u2014 which include partnerships, Subchapter S corporations and limited-liability companies \u2014 to consider converting to C corporations (often called C corps). In certain cases that may be the right move, tax advisers say. They encourage owners to calculate their tax liability under different structures to assess which would work best.\n\nStill, when all tax consequences are factored in, they expect most people to be better off keeping what they\u2019ve got.\n\n\u201cPeople will have to decide, \u2018Should I operate as a pass-through or as a C corp?\u2019\u201d said James Markham, a tax specialist at Ernst & Young who focuses on issues that entrepreneurs face. To determine the better way to go, \u201cyou have to run the numbers.\u201d\n\nThe basic arithmetic gives the edge to C corps, for which the top tax rate has been cut to 21 percent from 35 percent. The top rate for individuals has been cut to 37 percent from 39.6 percent, and most qualified business income \u2014 essentially net profits \u2014 for pass-through entities gets a 20 percent deduction. That brings the top rate from 39.6 percent to 29.6 percent (a 20 percent deduction applied to the new 37 percent rate), well above the top C corp rate.\n\nBut we\u2019re talking about the tax code: It\u2019s not that simple.\n\nAdvisers point out that C corp income paid out as dividends is taxable to the recipients, usually at 20 percent, from profits that have been taxed already. That double taxation more than nullifies the advantage of the lower income tax rate.\n\nSay a company earns $100 and pays $21 in tax; if it pays the remaining $79 out as a dividend, the recipient is likely to end up with an additional 20 percent tax bill, leaving a net payment of only $63.20.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn most cases, the double taxation for C corps versus single for flow-throughs makes a lot of difference,\u201d said Ian Shane, a partner at the law firm Michelman & Robinson. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put money into a corporation and keep it there and reinvest from it, you\u2019re probably better off in a C corp, but very few people are going to do that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChuck Hansen, founder and chief executive of Electro Scan, a Sacramento, Calif., company that uses high tech methods to seek out flaws in sewage systems, may be one of those people. Mr. Hansen is contemplating converting Electro Scan into a C corp from an S corporation.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m accumulating cash and won\u2019t have to pull it out, and I can make investments on the company platform, why not?\u201d he said. While a lot of details remain to be ponder concerning the tax law and its effect on Electro Scan and his other business interests, he said, \u201cI\u2019m already leaning toward that.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAnother reason to convert to a C corp is that the deduction for pass-throughs is limited if the income is earned providing services that depend on the owners\u2019 reputation and skill. In that case, it can be applied only to qualified business income of $315,000 for married owners and half that for single owners, with a portion of the deduction available on the next $100,000 (for married owners) or $50,000 (for single owners) of income. Electro Scan provides \u201ctechnology as a service,\u201d Mr. Hansen said, so it may run afoul of that provision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coin flip on whether I\u2019m happy or mad about this thing,\u201d Mr. Hansen said of the law.\n\nThe treatment of service businesses under the new law is still unclear. For example, the deduction limit on services applies explicitly to activities like health, law, accounting, insurance, performing arts, consulting, athletics and financial services. While architecture and engineering should be eligible for the full deduction, professionals may still \u201cget caught by the \u2018reputation or skill\u2019 provision,\u201d Mr. Shane said. \u201cFollow the logic here? No, neither do I.\u201d\n\nOther provisions of the tax bill in general are clear enough but still hard to factor into tax planning. Making the most of a new rule on writing off depreciable property, for instance, might require an ability to travel back in time.\n\nAndrew Oswalt, an analyst at TaxAct, a provider of tax filing software, noted that businesses can immediately write off the full value of equipment placed in service beginning Sept. 27, nearly three months before the bill was enacted.\n\nIf you\u2019re unlucky enough to have put a big piece of machinery into service on Sept. 26, it would feel unfair, he said. \u201cIt hurts a bit.\u201d In that case, the previous regulations hold: You are entitled to write off only 50 percent of the value.\n\nAnother aspect of the law could inflict pain: the rules regarding how much pass-through owners decide to pay themselves. They are required to take a salary that reasonably reflects the work they do as employees but usually will take as little as possible so they can minimize payroll taxes. That incentive grows under the new law because salary does not receive the 20 percent qualified income deduction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo try to curb that tendency, Mr. Oswalt said, the rules generally require that the deduction be capped at 50 percent of a firm\u2019s W-2 wages; very small salaries will result in smaller deductions. But this provision applies only to businesses with income above the $315,000/$157,500 threshold, he said.\n\nWhile the new law adds some complications, Mr. Markham at Ernst & Young said it makes life simpler for some not-very-small businesses. Ones with gross receipts below $25 million can use the simpler cash method of accounting rather than the accrual method; the previous ceiling was $5 million.\n\nProvisions such as this and the ability to write off equipment expenses fully are \u201chuge in terms of complexity for small businesses,\u201d Mr. Markham said.\n\nThe law gives business owners a lot to ponder, but Mr. Oswalt encourages them not to get carried away.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t overthink it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a ton of things that need to be done.\u201d If you run a pass-through entity, he said, \u201cjust educate yourself and think about how it\u2019s going to affect your 1040.\u201d", "title": "Can You Get Rich From the New Tax Law by Becoming a Company?", "authors": ["Conrad De Aenlle"]}

The invitation was later withdrawn but not before it spurred anger.\n\nWhatever the reaction to his apparel choices, they were no doubt a conscious decision for Mr. Trudeau, whose eye-catching sock selection has become global news, and who has shown an acute adeptness for stage-managing his image. In recent years, he has been photographed shirtless in a selfie with a family hiking in Quebec and posed in a wet-suit during a beach wedding in British Columbia.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister remains a beloved character abroad, feted by social democrats in Europe and beyond as a liberal counterpoint to President Donald J. Trump on everything from immigration to female reproductive rights. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Mr. Trudeau is a social media darling as adept at posing with panda bears as he is at parsing quantum computing.\n\nBut lately he has been buffeted by a series of missteps.

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "The other two parties of the left, the Greens and the Left Party, appear equally devoid of optimism and direction. At the beginning of the year, Sahra Wagenknecht, the parliamentary leader of the Left, called for a \u201cleft movement\u201d in which her own party, the Social Democrats and the Greens came together. This sounds like a good idea, a way to unify Germany\u2019s fragmented progressives into a strong collective. Unfortunately, Ms. Wagenknecht is one of the impediments.\n\nIn recent years, she has made remarks on immigration (\u201cNot all the impoverished and poor of the world can come to us\u201d) and on feminism (\u201cI get hit on, too, but I\u2019m able to set boundaries and don\u2019t have to weep on Twitter\u201d) that have alienated potential allies on the left. And a divisive leader is not the party\u2019s only problem. The Left Party has historic links to the East German regime, which continues to scare off voters. Some members of the Parliament, like Diether Dehm, are reported to have ties to anti-Semitic groups. The party\u2019s soft line on Russia has also drawn censure. The result is that the party is \u2014 despite its promising left-wing program \u2014 \u201cunw\u00e4hlbar\u201d (unelectable) for many leftists.\n\nThe Greens, for their part, hardly present a better option. Last month, the party elected new leaders, choosing for the first time since its founding in the 1980s \u201crealos\u201d \u2014 a nickname for centrist \u201crealistic\u201d politicians. Meanwhile, the left-wing core of the Greens, known as \u201cfundis\u201d for their commitment to the party\u2019s fundamentals, continues to lose power. In the months after the election, the Greens entered into coalition talks with Ms. Merkel\u2019s party and the radically free-market Free Democratic Party. Those talks foundered, but that the Greens even contemplated the idea was seen as the end of an era. And this centrist drift hasn\u2019t even led to electoral success; in September\u2019s election, the party came in sixth place.\n\nAs Germany\u2019s left-wing parties fail in one way or another, a soaring number of young people are unhappy with politics. According to a recent survey, about 86 percent of Germans under 30 years do not feel represented in the current political system.\n\nThe main task for the German parliamentary left now will be to offer an alternative for both disaffected young urbanites and the alienated working class. The Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens all have politicians in their ranks who stand for progressive change. But these figures can come into power only with increased pressure from the base.\n\nThere is no need \u2014 or reasonable prospect \u2014 of a merging of these three parties. And yet they would be well advised to agree on three points: opposition to nationalism, to further deregulation of the economy and to the gutting of social services.

It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.\n\nThe Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.\n\nBut at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.\n\nDoes it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.\n\nBecause Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.)

(Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.\n\nThe guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.\n\nNo matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.", "title": "Opinion | Can the United States Search Data Overseas?", "authors": []}

Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, said that based on the overall results of the study, the government should reassess and strengthen the limits it imposes on how much and what types of radiation cellphones can emit.\n\nScientists do not know why only male rats develop the heart tumors, but Dr. Bucher said one possibility is simply that the males are bigger and absorb more of the radiation.\n\nThe studies also found some DNA damage in the exposed animals, a bit of a surprise because scientists had believed that radio-frequency radiation \u2014 unlike the ionizing radiation in X-rays \u2014 could not harm DNA.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel like we understand enough about the results to be able to place a huge degree of confidence in the findings,\u201d Dr. Bucher said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA seemingly paradoxical finding that has also puzzled the researchers is that the rats exposed to the cellphone radiation actually lived longer than the controls. One possible explanation, Dr. Bucher said, is that the radiation may ease inflammation, and lessen the severity of a chronic kidney disorder that is common in aging rats and can kill them.\n\nAsked if there was any chance that cellphone use could help people live longer, Dr. Bucher said: \u201cThe extrapolation to humans requires a number of steps that go beyond the realm of what we\u2019re studying here.

(Ms. Devlin and Ms. Turner, the director, are frequent, and invaluable, collaborators.)\n\nVisual contrast is missing from this landscape. Something else is missing, as well, though to elaborate would result in an unforgivable spoiler. What can be said is that the Ms. Mulligan we see at the close of the uninterrupted 90 minutes has an altogether different aspect from the freewheeling raconteur seen at the start. Rather like the American playwright Neil LaBute, who has traversed comparable terrain in such plays as \u201cBash: Latter-Day Plays,\u201d Mr. Kelly addresses humankind\u2019s capacity for violence at every turn. Not even the children are exempt.\n\nSo far so good, if so depressing, though hardly more so than the world at large. But not content to leave well enough alone, Mr. Kelly dresses up his narrative in ways that detract from its power, like some overzealous puppeteer. More than once, there is the sort of rhetorical question \u2014 \u201cDoes that make sense?\u201d \u2014 that in the theater tends to make me queasy, lest an overeager audience member reply.

Polished discretion has always been part of her signature.\n\nNo matter what you call it, the transition is another generational change for New York fashion.\n\nAnd to Mrs. Herrera\u2019s loyal band of customers, such as Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who wore Herrera to the Oscars in 2004, 2008 and 2013, and Caroline Kennedy, who wore it to her wedding, that can be an unsettling thing.

Some have ignored it (see: Azzedine Ala\u00efa, who died unexpectedly last November without a succession plan for his business), while others in Mrs. Herrera\u2019s peer group have tried to solve it, with varying degrees of success.\n\nBefore he died, Oscar de la Renta appointed a successor, Peter Copping, who was supposed to work by his side and learn his ways, but Mr. de la Renta passed away before that could happen and Mr. Copping clashed with the remaining family and left after a year. Diane von Furstenberg has named numerous design heirs, planning to concentrate on her work as a women\u2019s advocate, but thus far all have lasted two years or less. (Jonathan Saunders, her most recent chief creative officer, left in December, and she named Nathan Jenden chief design officer in January.)\n\nMrs. Herrera had an uncomfortable moment in the spotlight in late 2016 \u2014 a rare display of dirty laundry from a house known for always appearing perfectly pressed \u2014 when she got embroiled in a court case with the Oscar de la Renta company and it was revealed that her former chief executive, Fran\u00e7ois Kress, had plotted to have her replaced by the designer Laura Kim. Who, in an only-in-fashion twist, had reportedly come to work for Herrera on the promise of ascension after leaving de la Renta when Mr. Copping was hired, but who then left Herrera to return to de la Renta when she discovered that Mrs. Herrera had not been consulted on the plan and was none too pleased with it. (In the end the case was settled, and Mr. Kress left.)\n\nWhether it was that experience that set Mrs. Herrera thinking about the future she won\u2019t say \u2014 when asked, she made a moue of distaste and talked about the importance of not looking back \u2014 but it has been on her mind for about two years.

The American chain, which started in Tampa, Fla., in 1988, did not have any locations in Australia until 2001. The outback theme was entirely manufactured by a group of American businessmen, who purposely eschewed travel to this country in order to avoid the creep of authentic influence.\n\nAlthough steakhouses had been popular in Australia in the 1960s, they mostly died out when nouvelle cuisine hit in the \u201970s. There wasn\u2019t much of a steakhouse scene at all until Australian restaurateurs began imitating the American chain steakhouse boom of the \u201980s and \u201990s, which, curiously, was spurred in part by the success of Outback.\n\nIf the founders of Outback had wanted to find a particularly Australian take on the genre, one with the populist appeal required for a successful chain restaurant, they might have done well to visit Cav\u2019s Steakhouse on the Gold Coast.

Well, giddy yup. \u201cMounts with a little white on top?\u201d should be topographical, if not for that question mark. The mount in question is equine; one of the fun variations on a horse\u2019s coat color is ROAN, which usually means one color evenly speckled or dusted with white.\n\n12D: I questioned this entry, MIMED for \u201cCopied,\u201d but it\u2019s correct in two ways; even in the classical, Marcel Marceau sense, the silent representation of something is often in satirical mimicry, something I\u2019ve forgotten since a mime has been boiled down, in my mind, to just someone mutely trying to get out of a nonexistent box. In computers, MIME also refers to the technology that helps you send out files, photos, videos and other things via email, which when you think about it, is all about copying, as your recipient gets a duplicate version of what you create. It still stopped me for a minute.\n\n21D: Font trivia alert! Bauhaus was a pre-World War II movement in Germany that reacted to America and England\u2019s pragmatic but artisanal Arts and Crafts and turned everything into sharp angles and slabs. FUTURA was all of that, swapping serifs for the pointiest of pointy corners and ends. In the department of what goes around comes around (my favorite department, don\u2019t you know), the Nazis disliked Futura for eliminating their Fraktur-style heavy ornamentation \u2014 until they took Futura as their own, with no explanation.\n\n44D: One of those clues that I was referring to, unusual references to common entries, I don\u2019t know a bit about any of the soldiers in King David\u2019s army (Hi, fellow heathens!). This guy, it turns out, was also Bathsheba\u2019s husband, which is a slightly commoner clue for him. He also inspired an unctuous Dickens character, URIAH Heep, who inspired the name of a big classic rock band \u2014 these are the references I recognize. But gleaning new knowledge from the clues as well as the entries doubles the fun, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nGo big or go home, right? For my first published triple-stack, I added an extra column to accommodate my longtime idol (and Twitter follower!) at 29-Across. I think he\u2019s worth it. Lin, I think your way with words would translate well to puzzle construction \u2014 let me know if you\u2019re interested! I\u2019m a bit sad to see the neutered clues on ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, originally [Literary trope that\u2019s getting revived?]; and MLB DRAFT [Occasion to cover one\u2019s bases, familiarly?]. I write a lot of themelesses for fun, but often leave them sitting in my drafts folder without cluing them, so I guess I\u2019m still getting used to Will\u2019s style on late-week puzzles. I avoid partial phrases in my puzzles unless there\u2019s really no other option, so I was disappointed that 11-Across\u2019s clue change caused it to be reparsed from the Latin AMO to the two-word A MO. Other than these quibbles, I\u2019m quite pleased with the final version of this puzzle, which underwent several drafts over the last few years. Redoing themelesses until you finally get that golden fill is such a satisfying exercise, so I\u2019m glad I persisted on this one. Lastly, I\u2019m over the moon that this puzzle is coincidentally being published the same day as the Boston launch event for \u201cDown and Across,\u201d the debut novel of one of my best friends, Arvin Ahmadi. Arvin began writing the book when we were college roommates, and I\u2019m honored to have served as a bit of a puzzle consultant on it (and reader of several drafts).

He told Mr. Sisi the United States stood \u201cshoulder to shoulder with you and Egypt in fighting against terrorism,\u201d but he avoided giving even lip service to the need to ensure free and fair elections.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson is to visit Egypt and other countries in the region, beginning this week.

But in this paper, researchers examined how women changed their work in response to having children, and how that affected their lifelong pay. Mothers were paid less partly because they worked fewer hours, took longer breaks from employment and were more likely to move into lower-paying, family-friendly jobs, the paper found. Their probability of becoming a manager also declined.\n\n\u201cEqual work is in practice not an option for most women, because they have to take care of the children and therefore have different kinds of jobs and different kinds of hours,\u201d said Henrik Kleven, an economist at Princeton, who wrote the paper with Jakob Egholt Sogaard, an economist at the University of Copenhagen, and Camille Landais, an economist at the London School of Economics.\n\nAs in the United States, the pay gap in Denmark has shrunk over time as women have become better educated than men and more likely to be professionals or managers. Children, which accounted for 40 percent of the pay gap in 1980, now account for 80 percent of it. Discrimination and other factors play a role in the remaining gap, researchers say.\n\nThe same pattern is true elsewhere.

Most of the difference was explained by women who were working shorter hours and taking time off work in the five years after their first child was born.\n\nAs any parent knows, children come with a host of time-consuming responsibilities.

Wallace and Collier celebrate both Barnes\u2019s success on the gridiron and his subsequent reinvention as an artist. As in \u201cThe United States v. Jackie Robinson,\u201d athleticism is a secondary concern; early on, we see the young Barnes in a museum, wondering where the black painters are, and the story ends with contemporary young museumgoers being shown Barnes\u2019s art.

The candy-colored pages and straightforward stories are hard to resist, and will doubtless forever shape the way many readers think about Wangari Maathai and Langston Hughes.\n\nHarrison\u2019s book focuses on great black women, and it\u2019s lovely to see Lorna Simpson and Gwen Ifill ascend to the ranks of Marian Anderson and Bessie Coleman.

It\u2019s a work of verse, with some prose end matter to help elucidate the poems, and it will reward a reader sophisticated enough to grapple with language and metaphor. Andrea Davis Pinkney frames her poem cycle about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s last months with the figure of Henny Penny, the bird who either worried or prophesied, and she makes King\u2019s death feel as significant as the falling of the sky above.

It\u2019s a bit like sneaking kale into brownies: Swanson offers plenty of context on King\u2019s activism and his turbulent times, but frames the book as a manhunt for James Earl Ray.

His brilliant adaptations of \u201cPinocchio\u201d (2008) and \u201cCinderella\u201d (2011) also tour regularly.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t modify my stage language at all,\u201d he said of his approach to the productions for young audiences. \u201cI worked with the same elements, the same vocabulary I use in my shows for adults. I had the same desire to accomplish something spectacular, despite the economy of means.\u201d It never occurred to Mr. Pommerat and regular collaborators like Eric Soyer, the set and lighting designer, and Gr\u00e9goire and Fran\u00e7ois Leymarie, the sound designers, to cut corners because the theatergoers\u2019 ages would be in the single digits. \u201cWe wanted to be just as demanding for kids as for adults,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the content, Mr. Pommerat figured that there was a reason that all these stories have endured for centuries.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201c\u2018Little Red Riding Hood\u2019 and \u2018Cinderella\u2019 used to be the equivalent of films or theater,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople gathered to tell stories, so they were meant for everybody, not just children. That\u2019s why these stories appeal to adults today \u2014 they were meant for them. What happened, I think, is that they have been adapted for children. Walt Disney totally went in that direction, with all that implies in terms of simplification and sweetening. So we\u2019ve come to think of those stories as too simple, lacking in powerful, authentic emotions.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Pommerat made \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d accessible, so the younger set could follow it, he did not try to prettify the picture. \u201cThere are scary bits,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to traumatize kids, of course, but I also didn\u2019t want to water down the emotions. I wanted to take the situations at face value: the encounter with animal ferocity, with danger, with fear, with monstrous things \u2014 two people get eaten after all, that\u2019s quite violent! But that violence is symbolic. That\u2019s the virtue of art, of theater: You can experience particular emotions while being protected by the fiction of performance. You come to the theater to see something that\u2019s simultaneously fake and a description of reality.\u201d\n\nChallenging notions of what constitutes children\u2019s fare is key to Tilt, which runs through March 18. The multidisciplinary slate also includes a special matinee of \u201cGala,\u201d a new show by the renowned choreographer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel at the N.Y.U.

Paper, $15.99.\n\nJuli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez\u2019s debut novel, \u201cA Beautiful Young Woman\u201d (translated from the Spanish by Samuel Rutter), begins as a rapturous portrait of a young woman in 1970s Argentina as seen through the eyes of her son, remembering back to when he was 7. His evocation of her is poetic, but ringed by menace: A military dictatorship rules the country, the school day is disrupted by bomb threats, and the mysterious phone calls she keeps taking in a neighbor\u2019s apartment suggest her involvement in a resistance movement. Given the violent ends met by so many who opposed the junta, the sense of dread surrounding mother and son grows with each chapter.\n\nL\u00f3pez\u2019s book can be seen as a kind of counterpart to Patricio Pron\u2019s 2011 novel, \u201cMy Fathers\u2019 Ghost Is Climbing in the Rain,\u201d in which a son uncovers his father\u2019s role in a leftist group during the same dark period in Argentina\u2019s history. But where Pron is forensic in his approach, L\u00f3pez is sensual. The narrator\u2019s descriptions of his mother are longing, even erotic at times, and the most moving passages describe his small, often futile attempts at intimacy, like taking a breath after she walks by \u201cas a way of embracing her.\u201d\n\nWhile L\u00f3pez\u2019s narrator is effusive about his mother (the phrase \u201cmy mother was a beautiful young woman\u201d recurs as a songlike refrain), the book leaves much unanswered. The political situation is only obliquely described, and we never discover precisely what role this young woman was performing, or what happened to her. If this is frustrating, then it is appropriately so: a fitting enactment of the ghostly silence into which so many of the desaparecidos \u2014 the disappeared \u2014 fell. As readers we must share the mysteries that still haunt the narrator, a disillusioned adult, in the book\u2019s final pages. More problematically, his fascination with his mother is not always conveyed with the urgency presumably intended: This is a short book, but it could be shorter still.\n\nIt is difficult to judge the book\u2019s quality, however, when there are such significant problems with its translation. In many cases the Spanish has been translated literally, without any restructuring, which leads to awkward phrasings like \u201che moved forward in complete slowness\u201d rather than (say) \u201che crept toward me.\u201d Elsewhere the meaning is more seriously compromised, and sometimes lost entirely. For example, a boy\u2019s face becomes \u201cmore and more concentrated,\u201d when the intention seems to be that his concentration becomes more pronounced. Similarly, L\u00f3pez nicely evokes the narrator staring at his sleeping mother\u2019s face, drawing so close that her features distort \u2014 and disturb him \u2014 like a Picasso portrait; the translation, which renders this as \u201cshe was so close that she was as unsettling as a Picasso,\u201d loses much of its impact. At one point temeroso is confused with temeridad, so we read \u201cbrazen uncertainty\u201d when L\u00f3pez probably intends \u201cfearful uncertainty\u201d; at another the adjective acerado (\u201csteely\u201d) is mistaken for encerado (\u201cwaxed\u201d), leaving us puzzling at the waxy smells of airports; and so on.\n\nThe closing section of the book describes the narrator\u2019s adult life with three women he loves in different ways, each of them an inadequate surrogate for the one he loves most of all, \u201ca beautiful young woman lost forever in horror.\u201d There are some memorable scenes, in particular two lovers sharing a last, silent breakfast as dawn breaks, and the surreal image of a concrete staircase ending in a cliff\u2019s edge: an arresting visual metaphor for the lives cut short by the Dirty War. But doubts about the translation continue to distract, as does uncertainty about how much better a writer L\u00f3pez might be than the one presented here.", "title": "Child\u2019s Eye View of the Dirty War", "authors": ["Chris Power", "Juli\u00e1n L\u00f3pez"]}

But the government was only embarking on another grand experiment in population engineering: This time it was urging women \u2014 though only the right sort \u2014 to reproduce for China.\n\nThe authorities in Beijing seemed terrified that plummeting birthrates, an aging population and a shrinking labor force might undermine the results of years of double-digit growth rates, and threaten the political legitimacy of the ruling Chinese Communist Party (C.C.P.). So they began allowing most married couples to have two children. They hoped that the new policy would bring three million additional births a year through 2020 and add more than 30 million workers to the labor force by 2050.\n\nBut there has been no baby boom.

{"date": "2018-02-25 00:00:00", "text": "The Constitution now limits Mr. Xi, who became president in 2013, to two terms in that office, amounting to 10 years. But the party leadership has proposed removing the line that says the president and vice president \u201cshall serve no more than two consecutive terms,\u201d Xinhua, the official news agency, reported on Sunday.\n\nBy moving so early in his tenure, Mr. Xi, 64, is in effect proclaiming that he intends to stay in office well past 2023, overturning rules of succession in Chinese politics that evolved as the party sought stability following the power struggles to replace first Mao, and then Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping will certainly continue,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a retired historian at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cIn China, he can do what he wants to do, and this is just sending a clearer signal of that.\u201d\n\nMr. Xi already serves as the party\u2019s general secretary and the military chief, positions with no term limits.\n\n\u201cThis is the next step in the continuing breakdown of political norms that had held sway in China\u2019s reform era,\u201d said Carl Minzner, a professor of law at Fordham University in New York and author of a new book on Mr. Xi\u2019s increasing authoritarianism.\n\n\u201cWhat are the risks of these shifts?\u201d Professor Minzner said. \u201cIn the short term, all the traditional dangers that arise from the excessive centralization of power in the hands of one person. But in the long term, the real question is how far the breakdown in political norms could go.\u201d\n\nJiang Zemin, the leader who succeeded Deng, was installed during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and served two terms as president from 1993 to 2003. But he lingered in power until 2004 by retaining control of the committee that runs China\u2019s military.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis successor, Hu Jintao, stepped down from all his positions after his two terms \u2014 an example that some experts had expected Mr. Xi to follow.\n\nBut as Mr. Xi\u2019s first term comes to an end, few in China see much likelihood of his power being subdued anytime soon by rivals in the leadership elite.\n\n\u201cXi is now unfettered. He owns the entire policy process,\u201d Susan Shirk, the head of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego, wrote in a forthcoming paper about politics under Mr. Xi. \u201cAnd Chinese domestic and foreign policy is only as restrained or aggressive as he wants it to be. The risk of policy misjudgments is greater than it has been under any other leader since Mao died.\u201d\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Xi pressed an aggressive campaign against corruption and dissent, a crackdown that has silenced potential rivals in the leadership. At the same time, many party elders, who once held intimidating influence, have died or are too old for political intrigue. Mr. Jiang is 91, and Mr. Hu, 75, has shown no appetite for taking on Mr. Xi.\n\nOn the Chinese internet, some people eluded the party\u2019s censors and mocked Mr. Xi\u2019s ambitions by sharing images like that of Winnie the Pooh \u2014 portly like Mr. Xi, and used by critics to represent him \u2014 hugging a huge jar of honey.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And harsh security measures make mass protests against a central leader nearly impossible. So any major public backlash against Mr. Xi\u2019s move appears unlikely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any reasonable challenges for him,\u201d Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing who formerly taught at Tsinghua University, said of Mr. Xi. \u201cHe has removed any potential political competitors. So far, there is no organized political competition for him.\u201d\n\nThe proposed constitutional changes were released in the name of the Central Committee, a council of hundreds of senior party officials, who will meet starting on Monday for three days.\n\nMr. Xi had already built expectations that he would stay in office past two terms, and some analysts said he must have decided to move while at peak political strength. Usually, authority begins to ebb from Chinese leaders as retirement nears.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI can see where his thinking is that he\u2019s riding high, he\u2019s got the momentum, and took the initiative to ram this through,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics in Beijing who works for the Conference Board, which provides research for companies. \u201cWhy risk diminished power three years from now if the economy tanks or there\u2019s a conflagration with North Korea, and not have the ability to do it?\u201d\n\nIn another victory for Mr. Xi, the draft amendments to the Constitution would add his trademark expression for his main ideas \u2014 \u201cXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\u201d \u2014 into the preamble of the Constitution, as well as adding a nod to the ideological contributions of his predecessor, Mr. Hu.\n\nThe proposed amendments would also authorize a new anticorruption commission that Mr. Xi has pushed. The commission would expand the reach of corruption investigations, which up to now have mostly been conducted by a Communist Party agency acting largely beyond the law.\n\nThe amendments are almost certain to be passed into law by the party-controlled legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, which holds its annual full session starting on March 5. The congress has never voted down a proposal from party leaders.\n\nIn what would be another break with tradition, Wang Qishan, a close ally of Mr. Xi in his campaign against corruption and disloyalty in the party, appears set to return to power as vice president. Mr. Wang, 69, stepped down from a party position last year because of his age.\n\nThe abolition of the term limit may also explain another recent move by Mr. Xi to send one of his closest advisers, Liu He, to Washington on Tuesday. While that trip had initially looked like an attempt to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s tougher rhetoric on trade, it now seems likely to also be a mission to explain Mr. Xi\u2019s plans to American leaders.\n\nAt the Communist Party national congress in October, Mr. Xi conspicuously broke with precedent by choosing not to name a pair of much younger officials to the Politburo\u2019s ruling inner circle, the seven-member standing committee, to serve as his potential heirs. Instead, Mr. Xi chose men \u2014 no women \u2014 who were closer to his own age or older.\n\nMr. Xi\u2019s strongman style has been compared to that of the Russian president. But even Mr. Putin did not try to erase his country\u2019s constitutional limit on serving more than two consecutive terms as president when he approached that limit in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, he arranged for a close adviser, Dmitri A. Medvedev, to serve as president for a single term while Mr. Putin held the post of prime minister. Mr. Putin then returned to the presidency in 2012, and is running this year for re-election.\n\nWith Mr. Xi\u2019s hold on power now seems unquestioned for the foreseeable future, the biggest question will be how he chooses to wield it.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping is susceptible to making big mistakes because there are now almost no checks or balances,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who is the author of a 2015 biography of Mr. Xi. \u201cEssentially, he has become emperor for life.\u201d", "title": "China Moves to Let Xi Stay in Power by Abolishing Term Limit", "authors": ["Chris Buckley", "Keith Bradsher"]}

A United States business lobby group warned last week that Chinese officials had threatened to retaliate against American companies if the Trump administration imposed tariffs, saying that agricultural and aircraft imports may be the most at risk.\n\nMr. Bown said that some farmers would suffer but that the broader United States economy would not be substantially harmed if tariffs were to be imposed only on the sorghum industry. The worry is that, as trade frictions escalate, tariffs could spread to more economically important sectors, such as soybeans, he said.\n\nSoybean exporters are a powerful political constituency for Mr. Trump. China imported $14 billion worth of soybeans from the United States in 2016, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture.\n\nChina, which in recent years has been increasingly assertive about protecting its economic interests, has not been afraid to use tariffs as a tool against the United States.

He still believes in a universal cash-transfer policy, it seems, but no longer has the courage of his convictions: \u201cWhat went wrong at The New Republic,\u201d he says, is \u201cthe driving reason why I favor a more modest guaranteed income\u201d instead. But he never convincingly explains why his failure at the magazine plays such an outsize role in his worldview, especially compared with his successes at Facebook and in Obama\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nHughes\u2019s proposal \u2014 which he himself describes as a \u201cprosaic and incremental\u201d expansion of the earned-income tax credit \u2014 is emphatically not a universal basic income. For one thing, it targets only the bottom 35 percent or so of earners in the country. Worse, it doesn\u2019t even reach all of them. The Hughes plan is restricted to working Americans: people who made more than $6,000 last year, who are looking after dependents under the age of 6 or over the age of 70, or who are enrolled in an accredited college. If you earned less than $6,000, you\u2019ll receive only your previous year\u2019s earnings \u2014 and if those earnings were zero, you\u2019ll receive zero. Those who live at the very bottom of the income spectrum would have to continue to rely on America\u2019s overstretched social safety net, which, in all too many cases, pays them little or nothing.\n\nBy creating a hard ceiling at $50,000 a year, Hughes also creates a nasty marriage penalty: He\u2019s effectively telling couples where each partner earns less than $50,000 that they shouldn\u2019t get married and form a household. That\u2019s because, if they do so, thereby bringing their joint earnings above $50,000, they\u2019ll lose a combined $12,000 a year in guaranteed income.\n\nHughes quotes Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the architect of a previous attempt at a national guaranteed income, as saying that it failed because it was \u201cboth too much and too little; too radical, too reactionary; too comprehensive, not comprehensive enough.\u201d Yet his plan seems to make exactly the same mistake. Opponents of no-strings cash handouts will not be particularly mollified by the fact that this plan targets merely 42 million households rather than all 120 million households in the country. Proponents of a universal basic income, meanwhile, especially those who see it as insurance for a time when robots drive us all out of work, will be exasperated at the way the plan explicitly excludes the jobless and the neediest.\n\nHughes is attracted to boldness, and played an important part in the achievements of both Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama. But ultimately he\u2019s a better follower than a leader. Fired up by his new cause, he could have published a rallying cry, an inspirational manifesto. Instead, he has delivered a book with more footnotes than passion \u2014 and, for the very poorest, a proposal that seems deeply unfair.", "title": "Chris Hughes Made Millions at Facebook.

It\u2019s just a stain, but you see the color, and it looks so natural. I usually wear this when I\u2019m flying because I don\u2019t want to wear makeup.\n\nAnd because I travel so much, I\u2019m all about little compacts. Anything that has a highlighter and blush in one is a savior. I\u2019ve been using one by Bobbi Brown.\n\nFragrance\n\nI\u2019m wearing the Anine Bing fragrance Savage Rose in a roll-on.

It\u2019s heavy, but it\u2019s great for me because I have the heaviest hair ever. I also use the shampoo from the Oribe Gold Lust line.\n\nMy hair color is by my friend Justin Anderson.

My hair is coarse, but it\u2019s also kind of flat, so I can\u2019t use oils that weigh it down. I love this new one called Playa Ritual. It\u2019s really light. Or, if I want more of a wavy look, I use Ouai Wave spray.\n\nOther Services\n\nI get really tense shoulders, so I try to get a massage once a week. I go to this hole-in-the-wall down the street from my house. It\u2019s not luxurious. The lady steps on my back. I also love going to the Sweat House. I do it whenever I need a detox.\n\nDiet and Fitness\n\nI\u2019m very conscious about what I eat during the week. My husband is a foodie, and we let loose on the weekends. I don\u2019t really believe in diets because they\u2019re too constraining. I do ask myself how something will make me feel afterward. And I do start my morning with a green powder drink by Hum; it gives me energy. Then I have a kombucha. I\u2019ll also have an avocado toast or oatmeal. I go heavy in the morning. Throughout the day, I don\u2019t have that much time to eat.\n\nI\u2019m really into H.I.I.T. workouts. I don\u2019t get to work out every single day, so when I do, I want it to be high intensity. I\u2019ve also been doing Orangetheory for about a year, and I\u2019m getting good results. It makes me get my cardio in, which I don\u2019t love. On weekends, I don\u2019t have help, so I have my daughter with me. I carry her up a huge hill by my house or pull her up in a stroller.

{"date": "2018-02-17 00:00:00", "text": "Certainly, the final years of Mr. Bailey\u2019s tenure at the top were tumultuous, casting a shadow over a long and starry ascent that had begun when the affable Yorkshireman, son of a carpenter and a window-dresser for the British department store Marks & Spencer, graduated from the Royal College of Art in 1994. After a stint in New York working for Donna Karan, he moved to Milan to work for Tom Ford at Gucci, the job he had when, in 2001, he met Rose Marie Bravo, then the American chief executive of Burberry.\n\nMs. Bravo was tasked with rebooting the company after decades of poorly conceived licensing deals diluted both the creative and commercial powers of the brand founded in 1856 and best known for supplying trench coats to British army officers during World War I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe moment I met Christopher, I knew he was the right person for Burberry \u2014 it almost felt like a divine intervention,\u201d Ms. Bravo said of Mr. Bailey, then a relative unknown.\n\nWithin weeks of that initial meeting, she hired him to replace the designer Roberto Menichetti as Burberry\u2019s creative director.\n\n\u201cBurberry had a very strong history and Christopher was so passionate about it, and that of Britain too. So I said to him: \u2018How far can you push the boundaries of what Burberry stands for? What does this brand have the power to be and say about British fashion?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bravo said.\n\nMr. Bailey\u2019s answer was threefold.\n\nFirst, he imbued every collection with references and nostalgic flourishes drawn from British culture, class, experience and weather: the signature Burberry trench reinvented in every conceivable cut and color, in prints and lace and velvet; Wellington boots and Fair Isle knits; Bloomsbury-style floral prints and \u201960s-style leather with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll flair.\n\nThen he enlisted a constellation of British stars for his ad campaigns and front rows: among them Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Cara Delevingne and Sienna Miller and up-and-coming male singers like James Bay and Tom Odell.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd finally, he fully embraced technology long before most rivals did to reach new luxury audiences, becoming the first British brand to live-stream and live-tweet its shows, create YouTube video ads, and even create a Burberry channel on Apple Music featuring only British musical talent, which he did in 2015.\n\nAs Burberry\u2019s creative chief, working first alongside its chief executive officers Ms. Bravo and then Angela Ahrendts, Mr. Bailey came to enjoy a run as the golden boy of British fashion.\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade there was a common phrase in the industry: \u2018doing a Burberry,\u2019\u201d said Alexandra Shulman, the former editor of British Vogue. \u201cThe idea of taking a languishing and not especially desirable brand, then turning it into a global success, became the ultimate 21st-century fashion fairy tale. Much of that was down to Christopher.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough Mr. Bailey initially moved the Burberry shows to Milan to demonstrate to the fashion world that it could \u2014 and should \u2014 compete with such global names as Gucci and Versace, in 2009 he brought them home. That was the same year the brand\u2019s many offices were consolidated into a single London headquarters, Horseferry House, the better to convey a made-in-Britain message. (The building, a glossy minimalist temple kept immaculately tidy by its staff, was designed down to the last detail by Mr. Bailey himself \u2014 including the mineral-water bottles he created for the staff cafeteria.)\n\n\u201cChristopher gave an unquantifiable boost to the identity of British fashion, making London Fashion Week a must-stop for buyers and press after years of being overlooked,\u201d said Anna Wintour, editor in chief of American Vogue. \u201cHis genius was also in creating a world around Burberry where you could be any age or stage and still want a piece of it.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Ms. Ahrendts took a job at Apple as head of retail, and less than a year later Mr. Bailey \u2014 already in charge of an enormous portfolio that ranged from overseeing 50 collections per year to store design and marketing \u2014 was given his greatest challenge to date: becoming her replacement, and the new chief executive.\n\nSome said later that Mr. Bailey was privately reluctant to take the leap, only to be vigorously encouraged by the Burberry chairman, Sir John Peace, fearful that his star designer might be getting restless. Others have suggested that as a figure whose down-to-earth modesty and witty intellect could occasionally unfurl to reveal the hallmarks of a control freak, the prospect of becoming the first designer from a major public brand to ever adopt a dual role \u2014 with such power \u2014 had proved irresistible to Mr. Bailey.", "title": "Christopher Bailey Takes a Final Walk Down the Burberry Runway", "authors": ["Elizabeth Paton"]}

In response, the Honduran Congress passed a budget decree that froze all investigations into the money for those social projects, and a judge threw out the case against the lawmakers.\n\nFurious, Mr. Jim\u00e9nez said then that the investigation had spread to about 60 current and former lawmakers, including the powerful president of the Congress, Mauricio Oliva Herrera, a close ally of the president.\n\nThe investigation also appeared to be widening beyond Congress.

Boyce, said of the phone numbers, which are fed into a growing database of \u201cthousands of numbers\u201d that turned up at overdose scenes in 2,260 overdose investigations last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe father of a 41-year-old Queens man who struggled with heroin addiction and died at his parents\u2019 home this month, said the officers who responded were respectful. \u201cThe police are trying to find out what\u2019s going on in the neighborhood,\u201d said the father, who asked not to be named.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to slow down this crisis,\u201d Chief Boyce said.

One was found in his mother\u2019s house; another came first thing after sunrise. Four were saved by emergency medical workers or police officers who administered naloxone. Three died. Each resulted in a new case.\n\nYet in public materials, City Hall has seemed to de-emphasize the role of the police: The mayor\u2019s 36-page, full-color pamphlet announcing the plan offered a 12-point strategy; its new teams of detectives were listed as Strategy 11.\n\n\u201cThe stuff that they\u2019re putting out there, it\u2019s not anything bad, but it\u2019s incomplete,\u201d said Julia DeWalt, director of community engagement at Boom!Health, a harm reduction nonprofit in the Bronx. \u201cWhy are we continuing to put most of the money to law enforcement?\u201d\n\nShe added that a Health Department report on so-called supervised injection facilities, funded by the City Council over a year ago, had yet to be released. No such facilities, where heroin users can inject themselves under supervision to prevent overdoses, exist in the United States, though Philadelphia and other cities have moved to open them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After the second time, the man accepted his help, which includes a \u201ccare bag\u201d with a round-trip MetroCard and information about fentanyl, a potent opioid blamed for the recent surge in overdoses.\n\nOverall, since May, about 155 people accepted counseling from peers like Mr. Fagan. A smaller number accepted referrals for treatment or other services.\n\n\u201cI say I have lived experience with using drugs,\u201d Mr. Fagan said, explaining how he introduces himself to skeptical patients, who are often in the throes of a withdrawal in the emergency room. \u201cOnce you say that, a lot of barriers come down.\u201d", "title": "City Officials See Progress in Effort to Curb Opioid Deaths", "authors": ["J.

Prof. Cohen-Sinclair said that designers accentuate the midrange sound frequency, which translates best to earbuds and small speakers, and to which humans are most sensitive. Because mobile games often compete with external noise, they also contain louder sounds that often carry beyond the player\u2019s earbuds.\n\nConstant earbud and headphone use and high-decibel public venues have led to hearing loss (the World Health Organization estimates that over one billion teenagers and young adults are at risk), forcing listeners to crank up the volume even more. And, of course, there is the occasional altruist who eschews earbuds altogether and generously allows others to share in the melodious sounds of his game, music or video.\n\nWe tend to think of visual stimuli as the dominant forces of distraction in modern culture, but sounds too make bids on our attention in the raucous marketplace of noise. Moreover, we have been conditioned physiologically to respond to these auditory cues with dopamine spikes, especially when the alert is for the reward-based feedback of social media validation.

Television and film networks and production companies have always had audio signatures so long as there have been so-called talkies; think of the fanfare accompanying the iconic 20th Century Fox logo, the growling lion of MGM, the three-tone chime of NBC.\n\nContrast those with the popular networks of the cable and streaming age. HBO has long begun its shows with a television zapping onto a static field that resolves into an ethereal hum. Netflix has a four-second double timpani strike followed by a wash of strings. Amazon Originals offerings start with a whooshing, revolving sound and conclude with a series of vibrant chimes. The new 21st Century Fox logo forgoes the orchestral arrangement and ends in a series of R2D2-like bleeps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhereas the old guard privileged pleasing musicality or organic sounds and tried to create distinctive signatures that somehow represented their brand, the new wave seems primarily concerned with securing the viewer\u2019s attention immediately, at a minimum of time, through jarring, synthesized noises that are ultimately interchangeable with those of other companies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ruthlessly corporate way of trying to coerce the attention of the viewer,\u201d said Paul Grimstad, a writer and composer in New York who has scored a number of films. \u201cThe scale of attention asked of the viewer for a Netflix episode is comparably smaller than the grand cinematic experience the 20th Century Fox orchestral fanfare sets you up for.\u201d\n\nMany digital sound effects, such as the camera shutter, can be classified as \u201cskeuomorphs,\u201d or imitation objects that unnecessarily use ornamental design features of the originals (such as fake stitching on pleather seats). Their ubiquity suggests a postmodern aural backdrop in which the artificial is increasingly replacing the real. For people who grew up hearing only the real sounds, the new distinctions are likely clearer.\n\n\u201cSomeone who\u2019s 80 and someone who\u2019s 12 are going to have different responses to a sound,\u201d said Will Mason, a visiting professor of music theory at Oberlin. But the 12-year-old isn\u2019t necessarily at a disadvantage, he said: \u201cWe want to privilege the real sounds over the synthesized ones, and we want to think a shift to a landscape characterized by these \u2018artificial sounds\u2019 is a dystopian element. But I wonder why it is that we want to call it dystopian. There seems to be some knee-jerk, intuitive way in which that\u2019s the default stance and in which the real is preferable.\u201d\n\nOne reason, aside from our longstanding skepticism over synthetic imitations, may be the preponderance of malevolent or duplicitous artificial intelligence voices in science fiction, from HAL 9000 in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d to Samantha in the 2013 film \u201cHer.\u201d Most of us now have our own HALs and Samanthas in the form of Siri and other virtual phone assistants, which, though rudimentary at this point, should eventually approach the fluency of their fictional forebears. Their speech-simulation abilities, along with their mobility, are helping acculturate us to a future in which public spaces are flooded with digitized and recorded voices on top of all the dings and chimes to which we have grown accustomed.\n\nFor years the only automated announcement familiar to New York City subway riders was \u201cStand clear of the closing doors, please,\u201d but now there is a suite of them to replace previously garbled live messages. The new ones include the well-known imperative urging passengers to be on the lookout for packages left on the train \u2014 a common-sense post-9/11 safety announcement, to be sure, but also one that suggests our growing comfort with a surveillance state in which people regard one another with suspicion yet tolerate unseen but heard government and corporate oversight.\n\nAs we blithely send our personal data to companies on a whoosh and a bleep, we think less and less about hearing so many other disembodied and artificial noises in the background.

The facts of the case are bad enough, but they also underscore another outrage: Vaguely written statutes in many states, including New York, permit police officers to escape sexual assault charges by claiming that the victims consented to the act.\n\nThe New York State Assembly last week passed legislation to close that odious loophole \u2014 and the State Senate, which is considering the same bill, needs to swiftly follow suit. States across the country that may be letting police officers get away with rape need to revisit their statutes as well.\n\nThe New York City case was particularly disturbing.

But that is not what many West Virginians choose to hear.\n\n\u201cWhat hurt coal was the Obama administration and nothing else,\u201d said Denny Harton, a retired business owner who introduced Mr. Blankenship recently at one of his rallies.\n\nPhoto\n\nDianne Dewey White, chairwoman of the Republican Party of Logan County, said thousands of miners who once looked to Mr. Blankenship for work are likely to support him now. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what good parties they had, and what times they had,\u201d she said. \u201cThey spent a lot of good years with him.

The Battle of Blair Mountain happened here in 1921, when miners seeking to unionize clashed with a private army fielded by mine owners, and more than 50 people died.\n\nBut as West Virginia has become a deep-red state, the sympathies of many mine families have shifted from unions to mine operators, who are portrayed as job creators.\n\n\u201cI have heard people say, \u2018When Don was in charge, we always worked,\u2019\u201d said R. Booth Goodwin II, who prosecuted Mr. Blankenship as a United States attorney and then ran for governor unsuccessfully in 2016. \u201cThe coal industry is still perpetuating a lie that coal mining is coming back, and it\u2019s going to be just like it was before, when all objective evidence is to the contrary,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Blankenship, 67, is up against two more conventional candidates \u2014 Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Representative Evan Jenkins \u2014 in the Republican primary in May. He said he is prepared to spend whatever it takes on the race, and his pockets are deep: In his last years at Massey Energy, he was reportedly paid $38.2 million. Opponents who once dismissed his candidacy now see him as a credible threat in the Trump era, positioned to appeal to many West Virginians\u2019 resentment of elites of any kind.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a pride in the state, deep inside, that comes from people dumping on it so long,\u201d said an aide to Senator Joe Manchin III, the Democratic incumbent who will face the winner of the Republican primary in November.\n\nMr. Manchin once said that Mr. Blankenship \u201chas blood on his hands\u201d because of Upper Big Branch, the worst mining disaster in the United States in 40 years. Some West Virginians speculate that Mr. Blankenship is running to pursue a vendetta against Mr. Manchin, who was governor at the time the mine exploded. Although Mr. Manchin is the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, he is still expected to face a tough re-election race in the state, where Donald J.

The car that brought him to a recent appearance in Parkersburg, W.Va., was a luxury BMW sedan with Tennessee plates.\n\nTo many relatives of the miners who were killed, his re-emergence in coal country is a source of bitter pain.\n\nGary and Patty Quarles, who are raising a grandson after their son, Gary Wayne Quarles, was killed at Upper Big Branch, described their anguish at watching Mr. Blankenship\u2019s TV ads, titled \u201cFor the Sake of Coal Miners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting here in our living room with our grandson, and there he sets up on TV \u2014 that\u2019s sickening,\u201d said Mr. Quarles, who also worked in Massey Energy coal mines. \u201cDon can say what he wants to about safety and doing all this and that for miners \u2014 there was no safety in Massey coal.

That was Manfred\u2019s first year as commissioner, when he made pace-of-play a priority. But the players quickly learned that the league and the umpires were not really forcing them to stay in the box or deliver pitches at a brisker pace. The pace reverted to a crawl.\n\nThe biggest factor, though, is that players are increasingly incentivized to take more time. In the age of analytics, teams cultivate power hitters and power pitchers, and the amateur ranks churn out plenty every year. Strikeouts and homers reached record highs last season, and walks are rising again, too. That means more pitches, which means more relievers, which means more time.\n\nThe 2017 season included 1,196 more home runs, 1,756 more walks and 2,658 more strikeouts than the 2015 season. The number of pitches per nine-inning game rose from 283 to 292 in the same period.

It was a different game in many ways. Kaat was among his generation\u2019s best pitchers but averaged only 4.9 strikeouts per nine innings for his career. Last year, only one pitcher who made at least 25 starts, Andrew Cashner, averaged fewer. (Naturally, Cashner is an unsigned free agent.)\n\nBetween 1973 and 1980, Kaat started 11 nine-inning games that took no more than 1 hour 40 minutes.

It was the longest civil conflict in the region.\n\nYet after little more than a year, much of the agreement stands paralyzed. The new courts have not begun work, coca production is still soaring and many rural towns do not have a single police officer. The National Liberation Army, a rebel group that did not sign the deal, has stepped up attacks. Public resentment simmers, with some people saying that the FARC rebels got off too easy.\n\nAnd on Friday, the FARC said it would stop campaigning for the presidency in May and 74 congressional seats to be elected in March.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to suspend our campaign activities until we have sufficient guarantees\u201d of safety, the group said in a statement.

The former guerrilla fighters now find themselves fearing the voters they are meant to court.\n\nThe killing of FARC members also is a reminder of the past: In the 1980s, thousands of members were slaughtered by paramilitary groups when they last attempted to come out of the shadows, forming a party known as the Patriotic Union. That memory, many say, is behind the caution in the current election.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Colombia\u2019s interior minister, Guillermo Rivera, said that the FARC\u2019s decision was not what the government had wanted to see.\n\nWhile Mr. Rivera said that former fighters had been killed in recent months, he noted that no candidate had died and that in some cases the FARC had declined protection.\n\n\u201cWe will keep offering the guarantees so they can safely continue campaigning,\u201d Mr. Rivera said.\n\nYet while few wished to see violence in the election, sympathy for the former rebels was hard to find among commentators in Colombia on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe FARC suffered from a guerrilla\u2019s vanity, which consisted of thinking that upon abandoning arms, signing the peace deal and becoming civilians that Colombians were going to cheer, applaud and unconditionally support them,\u201d said Jairo Libreros, a political scientist and columnist in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe United Nations mission responsible for monitoring the peace process reported last month that 36 FARC members had been killed since the war ended in 2016.

And Disney\u2019s desire to buy Fox\u2019s current stake in Sky suggests it likes the asset, wants more of it and would want to prevent Comcast owning it.\u201d In fact, Robert Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has called Sky the crown jewel of his company\u2019s purchase of Fox assets.\n\nReaction\n\n\u2022 Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James: \u201cThe potential for Fox to return and make a competing bid remains high, in our view, as our European investment team believes Sky is the best-in-class European leader in Pay-TV.\u201d\n\nA brief explanation of British takeover rules.\n\nWhen is an offer an offer can be a fine point under Britain\u2019s complicated takeover rules.\n\nOn Tuesday, Comcast announced a \u201cpossible all-cash offer\u201d to acquire Sky, the British satellite broadcaster, for about $31 billion .\n\nSky and 21st Century Fox, which has been trying to acquire the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own for more than year, both responded that \u201cno firm offer\u201d had been made.\n\nThat may seem like an odd distinction when Comcast, the owner of NBCUniversal, announced publicly how much it is willing to pay for an asset to kick off negotiations.\n\nBut, that comes down to Britain\u2019s extensive takeover code, which spans more than 400 pages, and can often trip up American companies not used to operating under those rules.\n\nThe public disclosure of merger talks is triggered under the code when a number of factors occur, such as rumors in the market that a deal is in the works or \u201cuntoward movement\u201d in a takeover target\u2019s stock price.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaking a public announcement then starts a countdown clock for a potential acquirer to announce a formal offer under the rules, known as a so-called firm intention to make an offer.\n\nThe rules are intended to make sure all shareholders are treated fairly and have access to the same information about a deal and to establish an orderly framework for takeovers.\n\n- Chad Bray\n\nPhoto\n\nComcast takes on Rupert Murdoch\n\nWe\u2019d waited to see if Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., would challenge Walt Disney for control of 21st Century Fox. Instead, he plans to disrupt Mr. Murdoch\u2019s bid for full control of Sky, the British satellite broadcaster.\n\nWhat Comcast is offering: \u00a312.50, or about $17.50, a share for all of Sky\n\nWhat Fox is offering: \u00a310.75 a share for the 61 percent of Sky that it doesn\u2019t own\n\nBehind the maneuvers\n\nComcast had worked on its own offer for Fox, with the chance to expand internationally through Sky being a big reason for bidding. But the Murdochs and their advisers believed that it would be difficult for Comcast to win U.S. regulatory approval.\n\nHowever, Fox\u2019s bid for Sky has been held up by questions by British regulators about whether Mr. Murdoch was fit and proper to control a major broadcaster in the U.K. That presented Comcast\u2019s opportunity.\n\nWhat Mr. Roberts said in Comcast\u2019s regulatory statement: \u201cWe already have a strong presence in London, and Comcast intends to use Sky as a platform for our growth in Europe.\u201d\n\nWhom to thank for the Comcast bid\n\nCritics\u2019 corner\n\n\u2022 Paul Richards of the media research firm Numis told the FT that Comcast\u2019s bid is a \u201cvery strong competitive offer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Alex DeGroote at Cenkos Securities told Bloomberg, \u201cThe market was anticipating another approach and will be pleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction\n\nComcast investors don\u2019t seem pleasantly surprised.

Powell, the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, we may see if he has mastered the art of stern but subtle disapproval.\n\nCongress has recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases that could stimulate the economy at a time when the Fed may want to tamp things down a bit.\n\nA tug of war could end up occurring between elected politicians wanting a boom to continue and a central bank that is concerned about government deficits and inflation. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Powell or any other Fed official would want to get drawn into a direct, public fight with members of Congress or the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\nSo, how might Mr. Powell express concern about loose government fiscal policies? He can talk about Congress\u2019s stimulus as just one of many factors that can have an impact on the Fed\u2019s mission of creating the economic conditions for maximum employment and stable prices. In other words, he could depersonalize any tensions, and imply that concern about spending and deficits is just the Fed doing its job. And in his prepared testimony for the hearing, Mr. Powell noted the stimulus from fiscal policy.\n\n\u201cIn gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the F.O.M.C. will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing P.C.E. price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis. While many factors shape the economic outlook, some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds: In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.\u201d\n\n(F.O.M.C. is the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets monetary policy, while P.C.E. price inflation is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of prices, derived from a survey of personal consumption expenditures conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.)\n\nUpdate from the hearing\n\nIn this testimony before the House committee on Tuesday, Mr. Powell took some questions about the recent loosening of fiscal policy, and how the Fed might respond.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe followed the careful path outlined above. On the one hand, he noted that government finances can have an impact on economic conditions, saying: \u201cFiscal policy changes can have an effect.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe really need to get on a sustainable fiscal path, and the time for doing that is now.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Powell said the Fed did not want to directly interfere in government spending decisions. \u201cWe don\u2019t do fiscal policy at the Fed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nAmazon is buying doorbell maker Ring.\n\nThat\u2019s according to GeekWire and confirmed by CNBC.\n\nThe details\n\n\u2022 \u201cRing has raised $209 million so far and was last valued at $760 million, according to Pitchbook.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Amazon\u2019s Alexa Fund, which invests in startups that make Alexa compatible devices, was an investor.\n\n\u2022 Amazon plans to have Ring operate as a separate business, much as Zappos and Twitch do.\n\nPhoto\n\nTake another executive\u2019s name off the 2020 list.\n\nHoward Schultz, the founder and executive chairman of Starbox, said during an interview with Fox Business that he is not running for president.

British regulators have expressed repeated concerns about giving Rupert Murdoch and his family more control over the country\u2019s media, stretching the approval process out over more than a year and forcing 21st Century Fox to offer more concessions.\n\nComcast has said that buying Sky would help it expand in Europe, where the broadcaster has 23 million customers and owns rights to show the English Premier League and other professional soccer leagues. Disney, too, has been keen on expanding internationally, with the British company serving as an important part of its $52 billion plan to buy a significant portion of 21st Century Fox.\n\nWhoever prevails, it will shake up Disney\u2019s plans. Either 21st Century Fox will have to pay more for Sky, or Disney will lose a valuable international property to Comcast.", "title": "Comcast Seeks Control of Broadcaster Sky, Countering Murdoch and Disney", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nComcast boss Brian Roberts is driving a wedge between Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox. The United States cable company\u2019s 22 billion pound ($31 billion) offer for Sky, the British pay-television group, leaves Rupert Murdoch, Fox\u2019s chairman, with two unappealing options: enter a bidding war for Sky, or rethink his deal to sell Fox\u2019s entertainment assets to Disney.\n\nSky\u2019s investors owe a big thank you to a store employee near the group\u2019s London head office. Mr. Roberts\u2019 interest in the broadcaster firmed up after an hourlong demonstration of its flagship Sky Q TV product during a trip at the end of last year. Comcast is offering \u00a312.50 a share in cash for Sky, comfortably beating Fox\u2019s bid of \u00a310.75 per share for the 61 percent of the company it does not own.\n\nComcast\u2019s slim operations in Britain mean the bid should raise few competition concerns. 21 Century Fox, by contrast, has been told by regulators that its bid risked giving the Murdoch clan too much influence over Britain\u2019s news agenda. It\u2019s now waiting for the publication of a final report that will detail regulators\u2019 recommended remedies, such as a separate editorial board for Sky News. Media Secretary Matt Hancock will have the final say in the summer.\n\nComcast reckons its expertise funneling television shows, sports and movies directly to homes makes it a better owner for Sky. How the $183 billion group\u2019s own shareholders will benefit is unclear: Comcast\u2019s offer contains lots of detail about supporting creative industries and young people in Britain, but little about financial returns. That may be because Mr. Roberts\u2019s real objective is to upset a $52 billion all-stock tie-up that Disney and Fox announced in December. Comcast still covets Fox\u2019s assets, Reuters reported earlier this month. Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, has described Sky as Fox\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel.\u201d\n\nComcast\u2019s offer will go ahead if just over 50 percent of Sky shareholders accept it. That means Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake will not be enough to block the deal. Mr. Murdoch, therefore, has two options: revise the terms of the Disney sale to exclude Sky, or enter into a bidding war with Mr. Roberts. Sky shares jumped by a fifth on Tuesday morning and now trade almost 7 percent above Comcast\u2019s bid.

The cable firm is considering whether to try to thwart the Mouse House\u2019s $52.4 billion purchase of parts of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s empire. The story has many moving parts, and the Walt Disney Company may yet have to raise its game.\n\nComcast, led by Brian Roberts, initially bid around $60 billion when Mr. Murdoch first indicated that he was willing to part with cable networks like National Geographic and FX, movie studios, and Fox\u2019s businesses outside the United States. Disney clinched the deal in December with an all-stock offer that was about 15 percent less than what Comcast had put on the table.\n\nRegulatory concerns might have been a reason for Fox to take the lower offer. A tie-up with Comcast would look a lot like AT&T\u2019s $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, which the Department of Justice sued to block. That said, watchdogs may yet take a dim view of Disney\u2019s plans too. Folding in Fox\u2019s film assets would reduce six large movie-studio players to five. And it\u2019s unclear how regulators will handle Disney\u2019s purchase of Fox\u2019s stake in their jointly owned video-streaming service, Hulu. Comcast, a third partner in Hulu, had to cede influence in the venture for seven years to be able to buy NBCUniversal.\n\nAntitrust concerns may, in any case, be a fig leaf. Fox\u2019s fate depends on what best suits the Murdoch family, which controls 21st Century Fox with nearly 40 percent of the voting shares. It has more chance of making its influence felt at an enlarged Disney than at Comcast, where a dual share structure firmly entrenches the Roberts family. Disney is also considering whether Mr. Murdoch\u2019s son James will have a role in the company.\n\nIf AT&T wins its case, Comcast has every reason to try its own offer again. If AT&T doesn\u2019t, Comcast might go for Fox\u2019s international assets like its European pay-TV operator, Sky. As for Disney, it might want to think about how much more firepower it has at its disposal, in case the Fox bid saga moves into a tense second season.", "title": "Comcast\u2019s Interest in Fox May Force Disney to Raise Its Offer", "authors": ["Jennifer Saba"]}

The Fed quickly slashed interest rates to zero. Months later it started buying billions of dollars\u2019 worth of bonds from financial institutions to lower long-term interest rates and encourage borrowing.\n\nThe Obama administration hurried to cobble together an economic stimulus package of more than $1 trillion to get money to families that needed it most. It expanded the eligibility for unemployment insurance to its longest duration ever, 99 weeks. It raised the earned-income tax credit for low-wage workers. It more than doubled the budget for food stamps \u2014 the poor\u2019s last line of defense.\n\nThe economy failed to snap back as the administration hoped. Unemployment remained at 9 percent or more for over two years.

And there is a knowing wink here. But the more you watch, the more his set comes across as a genuine labor of love, comedy he hopes everyone likes, even though it really just caters to a small segment. And what\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nDrummers laugh, too, and material about them isn\u2019t exactly everywhere. You won\u2019t find any other stand-up special with imitations of Keith Moon, Meg White and Larry Mullen Jr.; or one that pokes fun at the lighting in instructional videos for drummers. And for those who don\u2019t know anything about this world, there is fun to be had observing this clubby atmosphere from the outside.\n\nMr. Armisen has long been a bridge between the comedy and music worlds, after his 11 years on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d with a job as the bandleader on \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers.\u201d On \u201cPortlandia,\u201d he has done sketches filled with musicians like one this year about a reunion of aging punk rockers, which starred Henry Rollins, Krist Novoselic (formerly of Nirvana) and the Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty.

His setups are repetitive, his transitions awkward and some of the jokes aren\u2019t fully formed. A bit about how he doesn\u2019t like blues isn\u2019t much more than that. \u201cAren\u2019t crazy people crazy?\u201d is a line that should be cut.\n\nBut someone with such diverse talents would be wasted toiling away at a comedy club. Mr. Armisen\u2019s jokes are at their best when they bleed into sketches, when they lean on characters rather than punch lines in his own voice. In one premise, he says that doo-wop was once considered as edgy and angry as heavy metal. Then he puts on some doo-wop music and imagines what a kid from the 1950s getting his mind blown would look like. His performance is all flailing limbs and coiled attitude, evoking a whole type in a few brief flourishes.\n\nIt\u2019s something Mr. Armisen specializes in \u2014 look at his brief appearance as Michael Wolff, the author of \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d on a recent episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The skit captures his devil-may-carelessness in a flip of the hand.\n\nPart of what makes him gifted at these caricatures is his perceptive ear for the eccentric ways people talk, pointing out oddball pieces of rhetoric and habits of speech. He also displays a gift for accents. At one point, he puts up a video of a map of America and goes state by state, demonstrating the accent of every major city in the country. It\u2019s a marvel, and not entirely off point, since local differences are the kind of thing bands on tour know.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like a joke so much as a feat, and yet he\u2019s summing up entire regions with a slight change in intonation or affect. This is fairly subtle work, the kind that also reminds you that we\u2019re living in a big, complex country where even people in neighboring states talk differently.\n\nThere\u2019s something wonderful about the idea of trying to speak to everyone. But in our divided, siloed culture, who really believes that\u2019s possible? Just as politicians play to their base, comedians now find their specific audiences, and because of social media and podcasts, they can communicate with them more directly than ever.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe future of comedy is not in the size of your crowd, but in the depth of its passion.

Yet \u201cshe was somewhat under the Met\u2019s radar,\u201d Peter Gelb, the company\u2019s general manager, said in an interview.\n\nThen came the director Patrice Ch\u00e9reau\u2019s searing \u201cElektra\u201d at the Aix Festival in France in 2013, with Ms. Herlitzius at its center, persuasively both wounded and wounding.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the greatest performances I\u2019d heard in my life,\u201d Mr. Gelb said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you dream about in terms of a tour de force of acting and singing. She was both terrifying and totally sympathetic.\u201d\n\nThe production was scheduled to come to the Met a few years later, but with Nina Stemme in the title role rather than Ms. Herlitzius. Other singers, better known to New York audiences, have been cast here as Br\u00fcnnhilde, another Herlitzius trademark, which she will sing in June at San Francisco Opera. The Met doesn\u2019t do nearly as much Wagner and Strauss as German houses, so there are far fewer Isoldes and Ortruds to go around.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo, Mr. Gelb said, \u201cI put her into the first thing we could think of\u201d: \u201cParsifal.\u201d He added that Ms. Herlitzius will return to the company as the Nurse in a planned revival of Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Frau ohne Schatten\u201d in the 2020-21 season.\n\nHer goal, she said, is to draw the audience \u201cinto the scenery and onto the stage, to focus their energy and attention.\u201d That is Ms. Antonacci\u2019s gift, too \u2014 a presence that holds your eyes and ears, whether the mood is rage or quiet calm. Lincoln Center has hosted her a couple of times in recent years, but the recitals next week are being presented by New York City Opera. (She has had discussions with that company about staged productions, she said over coffee at her hotel, but there are no definitive plans, yet.)\n\nMs. Antonacci has never been content to do what\u2019s expected of singers. A smattering of \u201cCarmen\u201d and Cassandre in \u201cLes Troyens\u201d have been among her few forays into the standard repertory, and her plans these days are dominated by delicious rarities like Hindemith\u2019s \u201cSancta Susanna,\u201d Britten\u2019s \u201cGloriana\u201d and Charpentier\u2019s \u201cM\u00e9d\u00e9e.\u201d\n\nPreparing for \u201cGloriana\u201d was one of her aims in the program she will be performing at Zankel Hall with her longtime collaborator, the pianist Donald Sulzen, so she chose Britten\u2019s cycle \u201cOn This Island.\u201d She has made a calling card of Poulenc\u2019s \u201cLa Voix Humaine,\u201d including in New York, and next week adds his \u201cLe Travail du Peintre\u201d and \u201cLa Dame de Monte-Carlo.\u201d And she has long admired the elegant music of Boulanger, better known as one of the 20th century\u2019s great piano and composition teachers.\n\nWe are, in a way, lucky to still have Ms. Antonacci.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Goode said that he had initially been resistant to the idea of working from film sources because of a \u201ccultural misunderstanding\u201d of the roles of theater and film. \u201cWe think either film is like theater with better special effects, or that theater is made by people who can\u2019t afford a film yet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you are setting yourself up for a disappointment one way or another because you can\u2019t re-enact what an audience loves about a film.\u201d\n\nHe added that he was also often skeptical of the motivations for choosing well-known films as sources for the stage. \u201cIt can be a way of hooking an audience who are already familiar with the material, and that can feel like convenience food; too much of the lifting is pre-done.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut \u201cJubilee\u201d \u2014 a dystopian fantasy in which Queen Elizabeth I is transported into a future where nihilist girl-gangs roam a decaying London \u2014 is hardly convenience food.\n\nMr. Goode said he had long been using \u201cJubilee\u201d as \u201can example of what film can show us about theater spaces,\u201d and began to think about transforming it into a stage work as the movie\u2019s 40th anniversary approached. \u201cThere is a literacy to our interactions with film and the screen today, and I think it has made theater artists more able to think critically around how film communicates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really different grammar to the novel.\u201d\n\nIn an interview in London, before the premiere of \u201cNetwork\u201d in November, Mr. van Hove said, \u201cI used to be a real film freak when I was young.\u201d And, he added, film scripts often dealt with themes he couldn\u2019t find in theater texts: \u201cVisconti\u2019s \u2018Rocco and his Brothers,\u2019 which I did a few years ago, is a fabulous script about immigration and integration. And I have never found a text as extreme on the subject of death as Bergman\u2019s \u2018Cries and Whispers.\u2019\u201d\n\nAsked why he thought film was such a popular theatrical source now, Mr. van Hove said that theater \u201cis very good at having an open mind.\u201d And perhaps, he added, his example has inspired others to follow suit. \u201cPeople are always predicting the death of theater,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think it will be one of the most important art forms of this century if it keeps its identity as a live event. You can watch a movie at home now on a screen almost as big as in a cinema, so why leave your home? But live theater, with the engagement between audience and performers, is a different thing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nChristiane Jatahy, the Brazilian director whose \u201cRules of the Game\u201d offers an update of the storied Renoir film, said in a telephone interview she thought that for the generation now in its 40s and 50s, cinema was a repository of memory and images. \u201cThe difference with books is that when you use this material, it\u2019s not only about the story, but the images the audience have from the film,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe this challenge provokes ideas about creation, and this is interesting for directors.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Jatahy added that she thought it was important to make cinema itself part of the dramaturgy of her play. \u201cNot just to create images or set, but how to build the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the play, Robert, a protagonist in the film, is totally addicted to cameras and films his guests. So he is Renoir in a way.\u201d\n\nOur familiarity with images, the ubiquity of binge-watching, the daily bombardment of clips on social media; all of this perhaps feeds into a hunger for the human-scale thrills of theatrical magic. (Opera too is currently in love with the movies; a spate of new pieces \u2014 Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s \u201cExterminating Angel,\u201d Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cBreaking the Waves\u201d and Nico Muhly\u2019s \u201cMarnie\u201d among them \u2014 show a similar interest in cinematic source material.)\n\n\u201cWhen we watch film, we know everything can be C.G.I.-ed,\u201d said Mr. Beresford, whose adaptation of \u201cFanny and Alexander\u201d is being directed by Max Webster. \u201cIn theater, when you make people fly or disappear, there is a genuine marveling.\u201d\n\nMr. Beresford said he believed that the adaptations of film for the stage reflected the current confidence of the art form. \u201cSome people will tell you that it\u2019s a symptom of an impoverished, commercially driven theater, but I think theater has realized it can be a medium for big spectacle,\u201d he said, pointing to the work of Robert Lepage, Robert Wilson and Matthew Bourne. \u201cThe idea of theater cannibalizing film materials and the language of film is the sign of a confidence, I think.

One wall section is based on Hans Memling\u2019s painting \u201cAllegory of Chastity\u201d (circa 1475), in which a woman with arms folded politely seems bound at the waist by a mountain that also looks like her skirt.

Once dry, the material is peeled off and reinforced to make the free-standing walls.\n\n\u201cIf you look back at old masters, you can extract a lot about the role of women, either encased in a giant pile of fabric or lounging horizontally \u2014 dead or fainting or sleeping,\u201d said Ms. Al-Hadid.

After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, both the California\u2019s state pension fund and the California teachers pension fund divested their stakes in gun manufacturers.\n\nAnd after a gunman used an accessory called a bump stock in a mass shooting in Las Vegas last October, two retailers, Walmart and the outdoors store Cabela\u2019s, removed the products from their websites.\n\nBut in the days since the Florida school shooting, the push for boycotts and meaningful change has mobilized faster than with previous mass shootings. Professor Schweitzer noted that reflected the fact that the survivors are teenagers who are well versed in the usage and power of social media.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Twitter, the hashtag #stopNRAmazon was a rallying cry aimed at pressuring Amazon to stop streaming content from NRATV, the gun group\u2019s online video channel. The effort quickly drew support from Hollywood as actors like Alyssa Milano, Denis O\u2019Hare, Evan Handler and Misha Collins posted on social media in support of the campaign; several noted that Amazon prohibits the sale of firearms on its e-commerce site.\n\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeading retailers including Cabela\u2019s, Walmart and Bass Pro Shops also came under renewed boycott calls on Twitter for selling guns or sponsoring N.R.A. events.

In less than 24 hours, at least eight companies that had offered N.R.A. members discounts or special deals announced plans to separate or end affiliations with the organization, including Hertz, Enterprise and Avis Budget; SimpliSafe, which gave N.R.A. members two months of free home security monitoring; and North American and Allied Van Lines.\n\n\u201cNorth American and Allied Van Lines no longer have an affiliate relationship with the N.R.A. effective immediately,\u2019\u2019 the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have asked them to remove our listing from their benefits site.\u201d\n\nEven companies that do not have ties to the N.R.A. nevertheless rushed to distance themselves from the group. Wyndham Hotels said in a statement that it ended its relationship with the trade group in late 2017. Best Western Hotels & Resorts tweeted to dozens of customers that it \u201cdoes not have an affiliation with and is not a corporate partner\u201d of the N.R.A.\n\nEarlier this week, lists of companies that were part of the N.R.A. membership program began circulating over Facebook and Twitter. A Change.org petition asked 25 companies, including North American Van Lines and the hearing aid company Starkey Hearing Technologies, to break their connection with the N.R.A. The petition had more than 1,100 signatures by midday Friday.\n\nWith lists of companies circulating widely, Facebook users swarmed the profiles of Avis, MetLife and others, announcing their plans to end their patronage and switch to competitors.\n\nRob Bradford, a designer who travels frequently, said Friday morning he would take the $600 he spends each year renting vehicles from Avis to competing rental companies if Avis did not disavow the N.R.A.\n\n\u201cI know that boycotts work, especially in the age of social media,\u201d he said. \u201cI will go out of my way to avoid businesses associated with that group even if that means spending more money.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Avis Budget Group, which owns the car rental companies Avis and Budget, said it had decided to end its discount partnership with the N.R.A., effective on March 26, according to a representative.\n\nLate Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, which calls itself the largest privately owned bank holding company in the country, said that it would not renew its contract with the trade group to issue an N.R.A.-branded credit card.\n\nThe card had been advertised as \u201cthe official credit card of the N.R.A.,\u201d and cardholders were offered a $40 credit with their first purchase.\n\nBut the move drew strong, even extreme, reaction on the bank\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cYou are doing the right thing by dropping the NRA,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cThey are a hate group with blood on their hands.

But some are surprised by how tiny the villages are, and how quiet their streets. They see a handful of restaurants in Irvington or Dobbs Ferry, spy a few mom-and-pop shops and wonder aloud if the place is too simple for their urbane tastes. \u201cThey\u2019ll look at us and say, \u2018This is it?\u2019\u201d Ms. Bernstein said.\n\nThat isn\u2019t a problem in Montclair, where there are big-name retailers like Anthropologie, Lululemon, the Gap and Whole Foods. There is also an indie movie theater, as well as numerous coffeehouses and more than one well-stocked independent bookstore. And makeup guru and local resident Bobbi Brown is opening a 32-room boutique hotel, The George Inn, there this month.\n\nLeslie Kunkin, an agent with West of Hudson Realty Group in upper Montclair who has lived in the area since 2000, said that clients choosing between the Rivertowns and Montclair tend to go with Montclair if they are not ready to let go of a city lifestyle. \u201cWherever you are in Montclair, there are always people walking,\u201d Ms. Kunkin said.\n\nPhoto\n\nPaul Molakides, who opened Boro6, a wine bar and restaurant in Hastings-in-Hudson, a year ago, admits that small-town life isn\u2019t for everyone, but he hardly misses having a retail chain store nearby. Mr. Molakides, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Danny Meyer who trained at Eleven Madison Park, said he can\u2019t go to the grocery store without bumping into a patron, a neighbor or a friend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for Mr. Molakides and his wife, Jennifer, there is no better place \u2014 for them, their two children or their restaurant. From the large picture windows across from the village\u2019s hardware store, he can wave to friends strolling by on Warburton Avenue. \u201cWe all came up here with the same mentality: You can take us out of the city, but you can\u2019t take the city out of us,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is these new residents \u2014 with their vision and fresh energy, say local residents \u2014 that is beginning to change the look and feel of the Rivertowns. Dobbs Ferry is getting its first lifestyle boutique, At Land, where kombucha will be on tap alongside $300 wool sweaters. And while there is no movie theater in any of the villages, a new development in Dobbs Ferry along the Saw Mill Parkway, called Rivertowns Square, is catering to an upscale clientele with an iPic cinema, where \u201cfarm to glass\u201d cocktails are served, and an 18,000-square-foot Brooklyn Market that is set to open this year.\n\nSmall-town life has its perks, residents say. Sonya Terjanian, an advertising copywriter and novelist who is working to designate a historic district in Dobbs Ferry, and her husband, Pierre, a curator of arms and armor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said they will often get a text from another parent saying their sixth grader is headed to the diner or to a friend\u2019s house. Here, parents can give their children more freedom to roam because someone always has an eye on them. \u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Ms. Terjanian said.\n\nBut for buyers looking for something between small-town life and a large urban-suburban township like Montclair, there is a happy medium: SOMA, an area named for Maplewood and neighboring South Orange, which suffers only in that it is perhaps a bit too charming. The thriving row of local businesses along Maplewood Avenue includes a well-stocked bookstore, Words, a well-curated home store, Perch Home, and a movie theater where the name over the marquee \u2014 Maplewood \u2014 is spelled out in art deco letters. The biggest controversy: allowing a Starbucks in town.\n\nJen Simon, 40, a freelance writer, said she and her husband, Matthew Trokenheim, a 45-year-old lawyer, ruled out the Rivertowns quickly when they were living in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. \u201cThey were expensive and felt too much like New England,\u201d she said, adding that they settled on South Orange because \u201cit was just so homey.\u201d They loved Montclair, too, but they were scared off by the size and by the prospect of entering the township\u2019s school lottery system for their two boys, who are now 8 and 5.\n\nMs. Simon and her husband bought a renovated house in 2014 across from the elementary school, where she has met many other liberal-minded mothers; groups of them boarded buses to attend the Women\u2019s March last year. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique about living here,\u201d she said, \u201cis that everyone really wants to be here. They\u2019re excited by social justice, and the people are just cool.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nResidents say that living in Maplewood inspires a commitment to building community \u2014 in the hippest of ways, of course. Locals formed the Maplewood Artist Collective to unite artists and organize events, and two mothers started Maplewood Mercantile, a 2,500-square-foot space offering a selection of vintage home goods, children\u2019s items and jewelry. And many people come together every summer for Maplewoodstock, a two-day outdoor music festival, while others mark their calendars for Rent Party, a live-music series that raises money to fight hunger.\n\nDavid Leibowitz, who moved to Maplewood seven years ago, recently started a Meetup group to find other local parents who \u201cstill go to rock shows.\u201d Within a day, there were 150 responses. Now he and a few previously unacquainted neighbors are forming a band.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Leibowitz, 46,who grew up on the Upper East Side, and his wife, Emily, 43, fell for the antique homes in Maplewood, but living there also made him appreciate that \u201cit\u2019s not a place where everyone is driving a BMW.\u201d\n\nStill, he is baffled that Maplewood has remained more affordable than parts of Westchester, including the Rivertowns. Mr. Leibowitz, who founded PicketFencer, a website that offers profiles of more than 600 suburbs within commuting distance of Manhattan, joked that it is the \u201cJersey stigma discount.\u201d (According to his website, the average home value in Maplewood is $538,000, while in Hastings-on-Hudson it is $725,400.)\n\nFor some people leaving Manhattan, he said, moving to a New York suburb is easier to digest than trading their city identity for a Jersey one: \u201cAs amazing as it is here, some people just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nMary Kate Burke, 41, who moved to a Tudor in Maplewood with her 15-month-old daughter, Maya, and her husband, Shardul Kothari, 46, six months ago, said she worked through her stereotypes of Jersey quickly. \u201cWe found this progressive little pocket where it was diverse and family-oriented,\u201d she said.\n\nThey had been living in Washington Heights, and while the Rivertowns were only a few stops north, they seemed too posh for her family\u2019s tastes. Plus, her husband was working in Hoboken. \u201cThat commute just didn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said.\n\nShe appreciates the diversity of her new hometown, where it is common to spot rainbow flags hanging from residents\u2019 front porches or to see two fathers pushing a stroller to town. \u201cNothing about Maplewood,\u201d she said, \u201cis cookie cutter.\u201d", "title": "Comparing Suburbs: Montclair in New Jersey vs. Dobbs Ferry in New York", "authors": ["Brooke Lea Foster"]}

Women are demanding full freedom, the 28-year-old woman said, adding that the report showed that many people agreed with that view.\n\nThis past week, dozens of women made the same symbolic gesture and shared their actions on social media: taking off their head scarves in public and waving them on a stick. They were emulating a young woman who had climbed onto a utility box on Dec. 27, removed her scarf and was subsequently arrested. Activists say she has since been released, but she still has not resurfaced in public.\n\nThe protests, while small in number, are nevertheless significant as a rare public sign that dissatisfaction with certain Islamic laws governing personal conduct may have reached a tipping point in Iran.\n\nThe first protest in December took place on a Wednesday and seemed connected to the White Wednesday campaign, an initiative by Masih Alinejad, an exiled Iranian journalist and activist living in the United States. Ms. Alinejad has reached out to Iranian women on Persian-language satellite television, through social media and through a website she runs called My Stealthy Freedom. On the website, women post images of themselves without head scarves, demanding an end to the compulsory head scarf law.\n\nThe Islamic head scarf, or hijab, is seen by Iranian ideologues as a pillar of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The law regarding the scarf has been enforced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and a head scarf is obligatory for every woman in the country, even tourists and visiting foreign dignitaries.\n\nAlthough women are subject to broader laws on matters like divorce and inheritance, the hijab is a highly public symbol of the rules imposed by Iran\u2019s clerical leaders. Rules are also imposed on men, who are not allowed to wear shorts in public.\n\nMany Iranians now resent such restrictions as the country has grown more secular, and are increasingly flouting them.", "title": "Compulsory Veils?

More than one million boys play football in high school, about the same as those who play baseball and basketball combined.

A player who suffers a concussion is susceptible to second-impact syndrome, which occurs when the brain swells after a second concussion, but before the first concussion has been diagnosed.\n\nThe F.D.A. approved the test for use in adults, but Henry Nordhoff, chief executive of Banyan Biomarkers, based in San Diego, the company that makes the device, said he thought it might also appeal to physicians evaluating children for concussions.

Suddenly the quarterback Blake Bortles, who was having the game of his career in the first half, was transformed back to in the so-so game manager he has always been. And then Brady began to methodically rip the bad guys to shreds.\n\nThe other reason I have so fully embraced the Patriots is their dominance.

But the fund has seen its resources dwindle since 1997, when the state lowered its gasoline tax, cutting total revenue by $4 billion, according to the office of Governor Dannel P. Malloy. An increase in vehicle gas mileage and a growing market for electric cars has also led to a drop in gas tax revenue.\n\nIn 2016, a state panel recommended increasing the gas tax to 39 cents a gallon from 25 cents over a seven-year period, raising fees charged by the Department of Motor Vehicles and reintroducing highway tolls, which Connecticut removed in the 1980s. The report has not led to those changes yet. Mr. Malloy proposed several measures this week to raise money, including a return of tolls and a 7-cent-a-gallon increase in the gas tax.\n\nMr. Redeker called the tolls a longer-term solution that would take at least four years to put in place and would not alter the July 1 changes to train schedules.\n\nMr. Malloy\u2019s office recently froze hundreds of transportation-related capital projects that total $4.3 billion and vary in scope, from the replacement of salt shed roofs to the widening of Interstate 95 between Bridgeport and Stamford.

The drill at most of these places is the same: Order at the counter and hand your receipt to a server or, in this case, the guy making the dumplings. Grab your food, an available seat and enjoy.\n\nOther quality dumpling houses abound, and special mention should go to Ling Long Fang for its casual, appealingly dingy atmosphere and excellent xiao long bao (16 yuan a dozen) \u2014 which you can see being made while you wait. The real M.V.P. of Shanghai dumplings, though, is the sheng jian bao. At the intersection of steamed bun, fried pot sticker and soup dumpling, you\u2019ll find the sheng jian bao (not to be confused with the regular jian bao mentioned above).

{"date": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cTeens today get much more information about sexually transmitted diseases in school health ed classes than they do about pregnancy prevention,\u201d according to Dr. Philippa Gordon, a pediatrician in Brooklyn, N.Y., who treats many adolescent girls and boys. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize how very easy it is for a teenager to become pregnant. Just five to eight acts of unprotected sex would result in pregnancy. A girl can get pregnant even without having intercourse. Our biology is set up to foster it.\u201d\n\nTalking with adults about sex is often embarrassing for teenagers and challenging for their parents, who may leave it up to teachers and doctors to provide the necessary details. Indeed, some may be getting their information surreptitiously from watching pornography. Although schools may recognize the importance of preventing teenage pregnancy, they are often hampered by the mistaken belief that informing youngsters about contraception can encourage them to become sexually active.\n\nHowever, Dr. David L. Hill tells parents, \u201cTalking to kids about sex and even giving them condoms does not make them have sex any sooner. It does, however, lower the chances you\u2019ll become a grandfather before you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, with or without sex ed, about half of high school seniors have already become sexually active and need accurate, up-to-date information and access to effective contraception. Furthermore, teenagers who are not adequately informed about pregnancy prevention, or are told only about abstinence, are more likely to become pregnant than those told about birth control options, including emergency contraception, and how to get them. Cost may be a factor.\n\nMany adolescents planning on abstinence do not remain abstinent. As Dr. Hill wrote on the website healthychildren.org, \u201cThe best studies of adolescents who take a \u2018virginity pledge\u2019 suggest that these kids have sex just as early as those who don\u2019t pledge, but that they are less likely to use birth control when they do have sex.\u201d\n\nRecognizing this, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) have urged their members to have \u201ccomprehensive\u201d conversations with adolescent patients about their reproductive health and their contraceptive needs, knowledge and concerns.\n\nDr. Karen Gerancher, author of a recent ACOG opinion article on counseling adolescents about contraception, said, \u201cWhen we\u2019re able to reach patients before they become sexually active, or early in their sexually active life, we empower them to take control of their reproductive health, and prevent sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies that could permanently impact the future they\u2019ve envisioned for themselves.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Here\u2019s what teens should know about contraceptive options, in order of effectiveness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe implant. This long-acting reversible contraceptive is a matchstick-size flexible plastic rod that a doctor inserts under the skin, usually in the upper arm, where it can prevent pregnancy for at least three years, at which time it should be replaced. It contains a progestin hormone that blocks the release of an egg from the ovary. It is the most effective means of birth control, with a one-year failure rate significantly less than one in 100 (0.05 percent). Fertility typically returns quickly once the implant is removed.\n\nAn IUD. This other long-acting reversible contraceptive has a slightly higher failure rate of 0.2 to 0.8 percent. A doctor inserts the small T-shaped device into the uterus, where it prevents sperm from fertilizing an egg. There are two types: the Copper T IUD that has no hormone and needs to be replaced only once in 10 years, and a progestin-containing IUD that is replaced every three to five years.\n\nProgestin injection. This shot of a progestin prevents the release of an egg from the ovaries for three months. Its failure rate is six in 100 within the first year.\n\nVaginal ring. This hormone-containing ring is placed once a month by the user into her vagina, where it prevents release of an egg for three weeks. It is then removed for one week to permit menstruation. During one year of use, about nine women in 100 will get pregnant with this method.\n\nThe patch. The patch contains a hormone that is absorbed through the skin to block release of an egg. It is replaced weekly for three weeks, followed by a week off to allow for menstruation. Like the ring, it has a 9 percent failure rate.\n\nThe pill. This too has a 9 percent failure rate within the first year of use. The pill must be taken daily, and inconsistent use is the usual reason it fails. There are two types, but only the one containing two hormones, an estrogen and a progestin, is usually prescribed for teens.\n\nCondom. This is the only method that can prevent sexually transmitted infections and should always be used with any of the other methods. The male condom, a thin sheath that slips over the penis, has a pregnancy rate of 18 percent. The female condom, or vaginal pouch, has a failure rate of 21 percent, comparable to that of withdrawal, which has a 22 percent failure rate.\n\nEmergency contraception. These progestin-containing pills, to be taken within five days (the sooner the better) when contraception is not used or a condom breaks, are available over-the-counter, even for teens.\n\nACOG recommends that teens keep emergency contraception on hand \u201cjust in case\u201d to maximize its effectiveness.", "title": "Contraception for Teenagers", "authors": ["Jane E.

A quarter of all workers are covered by a noncompete agreement with their current employer or a past one.\n\nJust as astounding, over half of major franchises forbid their franchisees from competing for one another\u2019s workers, up from 36 percent in 1996. Businesses have also discovered that they can push down labor costs by outsourcing work. Because outsourcing companies may have greater labor market power than the original firms, they can reduce workers\u2019 wages.\n\nFor a long time, economists believed that labor-market monopsony rarely existed, at least outside old-fashioned company towns where a single factory employs most of the residents. But in recent decades, several compelling studies have revealed that monopsony is omnipresent. Professionals like doctors and nurses, workers in factories and meat processing plants, and sandwich makers and other low-skill workers earn far less \u2014 thousands of dollars less \u2014 than they would if employers did not dominate labor markets.\n\nThe studies show that common features of the labor market give enormous bargaining advantages to employers. Because most people sink roots in their communities, they are reluctant to quit their job and move to a job that is far away. Because workplaces differ in terms of their location and conditions, people have trouble comparing them, which means that one cannot easily \u201ccomparison shop\u201d for jobs. And thanks to a wave of consolidation, industries are increasingly dominated by a small number of huge companies, which means that workers have fewer choices among employers in their area.\n\nWhen employers exercise monopsonistic power, wages are suppressed, jobs are left unfilled, and economic growth suffers. Unions used to offset employer monopsony power, but unions now represent only 7 percent of private sector workers, down from a peak of 35 percent in the 1950s.

It spoke to another vacuum \u2014 a moral one \u2014 being filled by companies, many of which are more high-minded, forward-thinking and solutions-oriented than the federal government on immigration, L.G.B.T. rights, climate change and more.\n\nLehane noted that democratic governments are designed to proceed with caution, but the pace of change in a digital world of automation and, now, artificial intelligence is brisker than ever. The nimbleness of corporations gives them an edge over hoary, complacent institutions, including those in higher education.

Spellings was education secretary under President George W. Bush.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos, has mulled the same possibility. Speaking to the U.S. Conference of Mayors last month, she recalled a conversation with the Israeli ambassador: \u201cHe was baffled as to why America\u2019s businesses haven\u2019t simply stepped in to create their own education programs to equip individuals with the necessary skills, instead of relying on others to get it right for them.\u201d Some businesses have done precisely that, though DeVos was obviously wondering whether that effort was enough. She said that there were six million job openings in America and suggested that schools weren\u2019t graduating students with the know-how to fill them.\n\nCorporations have long been engines of innovation, sources of philanthropy and even laboratories for social policy.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "ART AND FASHION have always been competitive siblings, bound by a shared DNA. Their kinship betrays natural similarities, a kind of simpatico for which we can forgive their inevitable entanglements: Both are process driven, both aesthetically minded. Both extol an insider\u2019s world, and both, increasingly, are impressed with celebrity and the commercial power that buttresses their existence. Still, fashion is inescapably made for the consumer, whereas art is a form of expression. The two realms have always been associated with each other \u2014 Coco Chanel designed the costumes for the Ballets Russes in 1924 because she was enamored of Diaghilev\u2019s circle and desired a closer association with Picasso, who was a frequent collaborator \u2014 and, depending on your perspective, have a relationship that is either inspiring or exploitative. Designers elevate themselves with art. Museums and institutions can boost attendance if they offer fashion. (125,000 visitors attended the O\u2019Keeffe show.) On occasion, this relationship is charming, even sublime, as with the 1965 color-blocked dress Yves Saint Laurent designed, inspired by Piet Mondrian\u2019s great Modernist paintings. There can exist, too, a chemistry that is unavoidable, as with the mixed-media artist Vanessa Beecroft, who, as her stature rose in the late \u201990s, began to use both professional models and designer clothes in her works. (Her 2002 installation of a nude women army in thigh-high Helmut Lang stiletto boots is an unforgettable image.) Sometimes, though, the relationship is overtly commercial, as with Maria Grazia Chiuri\u2019s recent appropriation of the writings of art historian Linda Nochlin at Dior, in which she presented models in T-shirts emblazoned with the title of Nochlin\u2019s landmark 1971 essay about gender inequality, \u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\u201d (The answer was not offered on the runway.)\n\nBy focusing on what remains from an artist\u2019s life \u2014 her dresses, her earrings, an envelope scrawled with her handwriting \u2014 museums suggest that style is an essential part of her practice. This isn\u2019t exactly wrong. Consider the grim-faced conceptual artist Yayoi Kusama, who wears bright red wigs and muumuus in prints that match her obsessive dot paintings. In 1968, she launched a fashion label, Kusama Fashion Company Ltd., sold at Kusama Corner in Bloomingdales, which was as much a conceptual lampooning of fashion as it was an earnest attempt at commercialism. Her dresses were wildly, hilariously inappropriate, with cutouts where breasts or a bottom would appear. They challenged the sartorial conventions expected of women to be beautiful, sexualized beings. Or consider what the master of color, Sonia Delaunay, once said: \u201cI always changed everything around me \u2026 I made my first white walls so our paintings would look better. I designed my furniture; I have done everything. I have lived my art.\u201d For women artists of an earlier generation, the world was not built to allow them to make art easily, if at all. And on an elemental level, these outfits suggest that creativity is labor. Before Lucien Freud began painting, he would tear a square from a white sheet, tucking it into his waistband like an apron. At the end of the day, he would discard it as a rag. The muumuus, the smocks, the striped shirts \u2014 all are uniforms that express both the artist\u2019s individuality as well as the tedious, cog-like process of producing art every day. But does this interpretation threaten to overshadow the work? There exist philosophies (the Romantics, the Aesthetics) that embrace art as life, and life as art. But when we allow art the privilege of speaking for itself, of being measured on its own terms, are we really only allowing it when it\u2019s made by men?\n\nNot always \u2014 especially as male artists have found a way into the domestic space. Donald Judd\u2019s New York home on Spring Street in Lower Manhattan is now a museum and odd public monument to the artist, seemingly preserved exactly as he left it upon his death in 1994, down to the flatware on the open kitchen shelves. Books that Judd read still line the library, pottery bowls he collected from Southern Italy are displayed around the house, even his fur coat hangs in one of the upstairs closets. He has a spectacular Dan Flavin sculpture that lights up the bedroom, and the most beautiful Frank Stella painting (\u201cGur II,\u201d 1967) that looks as if it were made exactly to Judd\u2019s specifications. These objects hint at his life, his friends. But like his sculptures \u2014 colossal geometric shapes without any sign of the human touch \u2014 the SoHo residence is surprisingly detached from the personal. As with Philip Johnson\u2019s Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., the Judd home is an homage to Minimalism (a term he rejected) and to the kind of art that Judd championed: industrialized, empty, colorful.

On the spring runway, Tod\u2019s showed cowhide prints, clay-colored clothing and white leather moccasin booties. At Versace, regional elements were gilded with Euro glamour: gold belt buckles, gold-trimmed leather and a black Western-style pantsuit edged in gold filigree. The overall vibe was cowgirl meets Aspen divorc\u00e9e. In the design world, too, Southwestern accents, which were everywhere after the 1986 publication of \u201cSanta Fe Style\u201d \u2014 the best-selling Rizzoli coffee table design book \u2014 are once again ubiquitous\n\nSo why now? For one, bright tiles, fringe and Pendleton blankets are well suited to the Instagram era. It may also be that in a time of techno-overload and environmental uncertainty, designers are drawn to the earthy and elemental. And, of course, Europe has long been fascinated with the mythology of the American West (see classic mid-\u201960s Spaghetti Westerns). Finally, if there is a look that evokes an idealized American past, while also nodding to our original resistors and outsiders, it\u2019s this.

Today\u2019s puzzle by Peter Wentz feels as if he cleaned out the bank.\n\nYou may or may not know about xwordinfo.com, an exhaustive resource for puzzle analysis (and vital reference for this column, natch). There is something called the \u201cFreshness Factor\u201d there, and it\u2019s wonderful; it\u2019s an attempt to quantify the uniqueness of the entries of a particular grid, on an algorithmic scale, I know, I know, but bear with me. Everything gets boiled down to a letter grade.\n\nIf you\u2019ve rappelled through the grid today, or come here in search of belaying assistance, I just want you to know that it\u2019s an A, and almost an A+, in terms of \u201cfreshness,\u201d which is in the 94th percentile. In this case, 39 of the puzzle\u2019s 68 words are either debuts, or unusual enough to be against the law in Scrabble (again, I know, but these are the rules). This is a full grade, 10 points, fresher than a normal Saturday.\n\nThis is all really just to say that there\u2019s some wild stuff in this grid.

The app came out and I gradually adopted its use for the rest of the week, but Sundays felt unwieldy, and I kept my paper habit. This year I\u2019ve resolved to do the streak \u2014 really do it, every day in 2018, no flaking \u2014 so I\u2019m working these on the phone from now on.\n\nThis is really just to say that I\u2019m an old hand at this game, but I frankly find it uplifting that on most Sundays, today included, I get the charge of discovering another clever verbal gymnastics routine that I never would have thought of myself. Today David Levinson Wilk has crafted a puzzle with a tightly defined theme, and a subtle secondary trick that requires one to recognize a homonym in the title and also do some letter deconstruction in the grid to completely get it.\n\nToday\u2019s Themes\n\nWe have a double whammy today, and the puzzle\u2019s title, \u201cCracking Wise,\u201d quite brilliantly alludes to both. For starters, you probably deduced the appearance of a humorous element, which is always nice, in my opinion \u2014 even when the jokes are corny, are any of us doing the puzzle in search of tragic material? So it\u2019s no surprise that seven across clues, at 23, 31, 50, 67, 86, 100 and 115, all have to do with the art of comedy, the knocking of the funny bone, the ol\u2019 ha ha ha, the wisecrack.\n\nIf you\u2019re so brilliant that you race through this puzzle using only the across entries, and fill in every theme answer without needing a single clue from the vertical crosses, then that\u2019s it for your theme, you poor brainiac (I am seriously doubting there being many of you in this boat). It turns out that there\u2019s a bonus trick in the title and the downs, one that you probably didn\u2019t see until you encountered one of the latter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s take 23A, \u201cStop! You\u2019re killing me!\u201d, which was the first theme answer I figured out, although it wasn\u2019t before I\u2019d passed through the whole grid, popping entries in here and there. I needed several crosses to get to the answer \u2014 THATS HYSTERICAL \u2014 and got a bit stymied by 24D, \u201cPoison ivy, e.g.,\u201d when I\u2019d narrowed it down to the nonsensical \u201cyne.\u201d This is the time when that title\u2019s double meaning made itself apparent. We aren\u2019t just wisecracking, here, we\u2019re \u201ccracking wise\u201d \u2014 or cracking Ys. For what is a Y, really, except a letter I with a V on its head?

Liberals look at the country\u2019s high incarceration rate and see the tragedy of racial animus; many on the right look at it and see the spreadsheet \u2014 another example of wasteful and ineffective government spending. Here there can exist a convergence of goals.\n\nAdvocacy around criminal justice reform in recent years has been increasingly fierce and successful. According to the latest government data, in 2016, the number of prisoners in state and federal correctional facilities fell for the third consecutive year. A movement to end or drastically curtail cash bail, and thus reduce the number of people held in pretrial detention for their inability to pay it, has swept across the country. New Jersey has nearly eliminated it altogether; in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has proposed getting rid of cash bail for people facing misdemeanor and nonviolent felony charges. Even Alaska, which has voted for a Republican in the last eight presidential elections, has reformed bail.\n\nBut the fate of prisoners when they return home remains a confounding problem, apart from the obvious difficulties of getting work. This is largely because of a parole system that replicates and often magnifies the anxieties of poverty, which in many instances served as the catalyst for an engagement with crime in the first place. Too often, former prisoners find themselves incarcerated a second or third time, not because they have done anything particularly wrong or pose a threat to their communities, but because they are found to have violated stringent rules that have little to do with maintaining public well-being. Famously last year the rapper Meek Mill was given a two- to four-year prison sentence for violating his parole, for breaches including popping a wheelie on his motorcycle in a music video.\n\nJust this week a report from Columbia University\u2019s Justice Lab examined the way the issue has played out in New York City. For the four years ending on Jan. 1, the city\u2019s jail population declined by 21 percent, the result of decreases in the number of people held at Rikers Island, for the most part, before their trials begin. During the same period, though, one subgroup of the city\u2019s jail population grew: the number of people held on technical parole violations. That figure increased by 15 percent. Between 2016 and 2017, the average daily population of those in jail for such infractions climbed to 20 percent. As Vincent Schiraldi, co-director of the Justice Lab and a former probation commissioner put it, these are people who most of the time \u201chaven\u2019t even jaywalked or jumped a turnstile.\u201d", "title": "Criminal Justice Reform Empties Cells, Parole Fills Them Up Again", "authors": []}

Ms. Hwangbo, the hockey player, defected to South Korea through China with her family in 1997.\n\nThe athletes are carefully screened before being allowed to participate in international events. Even if they wanted to defect, they will be closely watched by North Korean minders. In Pyeongchang, South Korean security forces will also be watching, as neither side will want the publicity of a defection undercutting the message of unity between the two Koreas.

Those stolen credentials allowed attackers to spread their malware throughout the computer networks that support the Winter Games on Friday, just as the opening ceremony was timed to begin.\n\nSecurity companies would not say definitively who was behind the attack, but some digital crumbs led to a familiar culprit: Fancy Bear, the Russian hacking group with ties to Russian intelligence services. Fancy Bear was determined to be the more brazen of the two Russian hacking groups behind an attack on the Democratic National Committee ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBeginning in November, CrowdStrike\u2019s intelligence team witnessed Fancy Bear attacks that stole credentials from an international sports organization, Mr. Meyers said. He declined to identify the victim but suggested that the credential thefts were similar to the ones that hackers would have needed before their opening ceremony attack.\n\nOn Wednesday, two days before the ceremony, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs made an apparent attempt to pre-empt any accusations of Russian cyberattacks on the Games. In a statement, released in English, German and Russian, the agency accused Western governments, press and information security companies of waging an \u201cinformation war\u201d accusing Russia of \u201calleged cyber interference\u201d and \u201cplanning to attack the ideals of the Olympic movement.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first Olympic opening ceremony that was a target for hackers.

On Wednesday morning, YouTube\u2019s No. 1 trending video was a clip that seemed to push a conspiracy theory that some survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting who have called for stricter gun control are actually paid actors. The video, of a TV news broadcast that included Parkland student David Hogg, carried the description: \u201cDAVID HOGG THE ACTOR\u2026.\u201d\n\nDai: It\u2019s repugnant that anyone would keep pushing these conspiracy theories about kids who have already suffered so much, but this video was a little tricky. It was a video of a legitimate news story involving the student. It wasn\u2019t a false or doctored video, and the content itself didn\u2019t push a conspiracy. However, the title on the video framed this otherwise innocuous video as evidence of a broader conspiracy. Even the description isn\u2019t obviously inflammatory unless you understand the context of why this student is being called an actor. Man, YouTube can\u2019t bring on those 10,000 human checkers fast enough.\n\nYouTube took down the video before I had my morning coffee in California, but only after it attracted more than 200,000 views.

YouTube\u2019s video-recommendation engine is engineered to keep you on the site. It\u2019s pretty darn good at it.

After federal prosecutors last week indicted 13 Russians and three companies for spreading misinformation online in an attempt to subvert the 2016 election, Facebook\u2019s vice president for advertising, Rob Goldman, posted a series of tweets that downplayed their impact.\n\nDai: Of course, he walked it back after President Trump amplified the comments to his followers, saying this was evidence that there was no collusion between his campaign and the Russians.

They\u2019re sold at fashionable department stores and boutiques, starting at about $20, which is considerably more expensive than a bottle of Selsun Blue.

It\u2019s a creamy cleanser composed of, among other ingredients, eucalyptus and tea tree oil along with pyrithione zinc.

My wife and I have navigated this really well. She\u2019s interesting and she loves me and she cherishes our relationship but she doesn\u2019t need me. She is self-actualized. She\u2019s a strong enough woman to handle the rigors of distance. If anything it was a difficult thing to navigate coming off the road.\n\nI feel like on this album I heard the word \u201cwe\u201d more than on previous records.\n\nI did, too, and I didn\u2019t know it until the record was done.\n\nMaybe this is a na\u00efve or oversimplified way of talking about Dashboard records, but I experience them as \u201cI,\u201d not \u201cwe\u201d records.\n\nWell, I was navigating the world by myself at that moment when I was writing most of the Dashboard songs. I\u2019m now not only navigating the world with my wife, but I\u2019m looking back, I\u2019m holding on fiercely to what I realize is so rare with this really strong circle of friends that I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have. Previously, I was at a point where I thought I was going through things alone. Now I\u2019ve just been in a place where I\u2019m no more certain about anything that life\u2019s handed me and the reasons for it, but I\u2019ve never been less alone.\n\nPhoto\n\nHave you come across any of the feminist reassessments of emo \u2014 stories about how women were marginalized in the scene as participants and also how the music often reduced them to objects?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI would say that I was never really that satisfied with the limited amount of women that were in the scene. Two of my favorite bands, Jejune and Rainer Maria, had women coleads. And I had women singing on all my records. But I\u2019m not deaf. A lot of the bands that followed our era, they were like degraded copies every six months, where I and everybody thought it was almost like hair metal or something like that, costumes some of them put on. And the stories and the feelings beneath them were incidental. I didn\u2019t relate to that. I think at that point it got pretty much, like, by the numbers and it was like, \u201cO.K., you pick on a girl.\u201d\n\nDid you reject it in the moment?\n\nYeah. I felt like it was gross. I thought it was opportunistic. I thought it was degrading.\n\nWere there bands you wouldn\u2019t tour with?\n\nYes. And it bummed me out and it broke my heart a little. And in that time, beforehand but especially once I started to notice it, I made a rule of trying as often as possible to have a female-led band or a band with a woman in the band on tour with us.\n\nYou toured with Brand New. What was your reaction to the allegations against Jesse Lacey? [In November, the singer was accused of sexual improprieties by a woman who said he solicited nude pictures from her when she was a minor. He released a statement apologizing for his behavior without directly addressing the allegation. No charges have been filed.]\n\nI think it is abhorrent, shocking.\n\nWere you surprised by it?\n\nI was surprised by it, because in this case, I never saw anything that would indicate that. I haven\u2019t spoken to Jesse about it, as we haven\u2019t really spoken that much in years. As part of the scene \u2014 I don\u2019t mean outside of it being a band they looked up to, I mean being one of the kids in it \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to not be offended by it. First, I was a fan in that scene, then I was somebody that people were fans of. I remained a fan in that scene too. We had a trust.\n\nThere was a morality to it.\n\nI felt that\u2019s what made us different than other scenes. We were the answer to the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll clich\u00e9, I thought.\n\nHave these topics been an active subject of conversation between you and your peers?\n\nWell, between me and my friends.\n\nWhat about people who are in the scene in some form or another?\n\nNo, it seems uncomfortable when I\u2019ve tried to talk to some of them about this. They seem as concerned, but I think that nobody knows how to come to grips with the idea that our scene was a place that something like this could happen. It\u2019s shameful. I don\u2019t want to believe that my part of the circle of fans were treated that way or felt that way at shows. I feel like we\u2019re there to take care of each other.\n\nThat\u2019s what the ethics of a scene really should be.\n\nLike if I see a fight break out, I\u2019ll stop the show and say, \u201cStop the fight. Is everyone O.K.?\u201d It\u2019s our responsibility \u2014 not just the bands, anybody that\u2019s proactive in the scene \u2014 it\u2019s our collective responsibility to say, in all situations, \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d I just didn\u2019t know I had to say it about this stuff.

The B.B.C. has details of the meal that was served at the meeting, held at the official country retreat of Prime Minister Theresa May: A cream of sweetcorn soup with a ham hock croquette, a Guinness short rib of Dexter beef with onions and parsnip mash, and a lemon tart with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries.\n\nThe menu is a reminder of how often food is used to help understand Brexit.\n\nCherries: The British government\u2019s position seems to be that it wants to abide by some European Union rules that would be advantageous for trade, while discarding others. In the Brexit debate, Britain\u2019s attempts to pick and choose is commonly described as cherry-picking, and top officials of the European Union have said they won\u2019t let Britain take this approach. And for Britain to ask for three baskets of cherries is likely just too much for the European Union to stomach.\n\nWhy?\n\nCake: The rationale for not letting Britain take an \u00e0 la carte approach is that it allows the country to have its cake and eat it. Underpinning the European Union is the belief that the benefits of being more closely integrated are often obtained through compromises that all member countries must make. And to supporters of the bloc, Britain\u2019s desire to opt in for some things and not others corrodes that community spirit.\n\nThe cake and cherries rhetoric thrown around in the Brexit debate suggest there is little middle ground between the European Union and Britain. But an alternative way to view the tensions is that so much trade goes on between Britain and the bloc, and others ties are so deep, that both sides will ultimately strike a new relationship that retains much of the existing one. As analysts at Nomura wrote earlier this week:\n\nIn terms of the bespoke deal issue, we think it is not credible to say the U.K. can only take an off-the-shelf Norway / Switzerland / Turkey / Ukraine / Canada / Mexico deal. They were all bespoke deals when they were made. The idea that the world\u2019s seventh largest economy, an ex-member and a country that will still have strong institutional, economic and geographic ties to the E.U. should not get a bespoke deal is not reasonable, in our view.\n\nAnd the Sun newspaper is reporting that some in European Union may actually want to throw Britain a few cherries. The Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge, who often has fresh insights from Brussels, has details of a paper drafted by the Belgian government:\n\nThe paper, produced by the Belgian government for a meeting of diplomats last week, will prove a huge boost to British negotiators and gives new insight into E.U. thinking.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nOne reason the Treasury balked on Dodd Frank\u2019s bank resolution regime.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda seems to have met its match in the obscure world of international financial regulation.\n\nOn Thursday, we wrote about the Treasury Department\u2019s decision to retain the process for winding down a failing bank that was introduced under the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA big reason the Treasury held back: The concerns of foreign regulators.\n\nAs the Treasury\u2019s proposal stated, an alternative to the Obama-era wind-down is a new form of bankruptcy for large financial firms, called Chapter 14. The Treasury favors using Chapter 14 where possible, but it opted to keep the current resolution mechanism. This disappointed Republicans who want Chapter 14 to replace the the current process. But foreign regulators pushed back against a bankruptcy-or-nothing approach. Specifically, the Treasury noted, foreign regulators have expressed doubts about whether they could coordinate effectively with a United States bankruptcy judge when winding down a big American bank that has large amounts of business overseas.\n\nOn that point, the Treasury could have pushed back. It could have told foreign governments that Chapter 14 judges would, in fact, be up to the task of handling international cases. Indeed, the Treasury in its paper said it expected the judges to have such competency:\n\nFurther, these judges, once designated, could engage in planning and coordination exercises, including cross-border efforts (e.g., the crisis management groups discussed above).\n\nInstead, fearing higher costs for United States banks, the Treasury apparently gave the concerns of foreign regulators considerable weight and took an internationalist approach.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nGeely has become Daimler\u2019s biggest stakeholder.\n\nThe Chinese manufacturer has built up a $9 billion stake, or just under 10 percent, in the German automaker and parent of Mercedes-Benz.\n\nFrom Bloomberg:\n\nThe investment in the parent of Mercedes-Benz furthers Hangzhou-based Geely\u2019s foray into the European premium automotive market and ends months of speculation.

{"date": "2018-02-05 00:00:00", "text": "But Monday\u2019s plunge was far less impressive on a percentage basis. The Dow\u2019s fall ranked as its 100th biggest, while the S. & P. 500\u2019s slide was the 127th biggest in the index\u2019s history, according to S & P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nHere is how Monday\u2019s sell-off stacks up against two other major tumbles.\n\nSept. 29, 2008\n\n\u2022 Dow: Down 777.78 points, or 6.98 percent\n\n\u2022 S. & P. 500: Down 106 points, or 8.81 percent\n\nJust weeks after Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, lawmakers in the House defied President George W. Bush and rejected a $700 billion economic rescue plan. The vote sent markets tumbling to what was the biggest point loss in either index\u2019s history.\n\nBut points are not the best way to compare the magnitude of a stock index\u2019s declines across eras. As the stock market has risen, big point moves have translated into increasingly smaller percentage changes. The Dow and the S. & P. 500 have more than doubled from their closes on Sept. 29, 2008.\n\nOct. 19, 1987\n\n\u2022 Dow: Down 507.99, or 22.61 percent\n\n\u2022 S. & P. 500: Down 57.86, or 20.47 percent\n\n\u201cBlack Monday\u201d was a petrifying moment \u2014 an even bigger decline in both points and percentage than the stock market crash of 1929. But unlike the 1929 crash, the slide in 1987 did not contribute to a wider economic slump. The stock market recovered its losses by early 1989.\n\nBut the plunge did prompt regulators to introduce special brakes that kick in when the market falls too far, too fast. Stock markets, though, remain vulnerable to the sort of confusion and fear that one prominent economist said last year was a potent force in 1987.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer and Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nKenneth C. Griffin sees warning signs for stocks.\n\nAs the U.S. stock markets look wobbly for the first time in nearly two years, at least one major investor is sounding a bearish tone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a Jan. 31 letter to investors, Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Chicago hedge-fund firm Citadel, wrote that even though the broader economic backdrop continues to be positive, he sees several warning signs that could turn stock prices downward.\n\nThe end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to stimulate the U.S. economy is one factor, Mr. Griffin wrote, that could pressure stocks. But the prospect of inflation, or a rapid rise in the prices of goods and services, is making him especially nervous.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the nascent signs\u201d of rising inflation in a variety of countries, he wrote. As a result, he added, money managers at Citadel, which runs a variety of hedge funds, are \u201ccarefully positioning\u201d for a surprise, sharp upturn in inflation.\n\nMr. Griffin added that he is also concerned about geopolitical risks, writing that his money managers need to be able to handle negative events if they do occur, \u201cincluding a trade policy misstep or a military conflict.\u201d He did not elaborate.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC in November, Mr. Griffin said the stock market was in the \u201cseventh inning\u201d of a rally. He said through a spokesman on Monday that he still thinks there are several innings to go before a downturn begins and that he is more bearish on bond prices than stocks at the moment.\n\n\u2014 Kate Kelly\n\nHere\u2019s a reason to be positive on stocks: Corporate America is reporting strong earnings.\n\nWith 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.\n\nThe numbers\n\n\u202275 percent of companies are reporting earnings above estimates, above the five-year average.\n\n\u2022 Companies that are beating estimates are doing so by a 4 percent margin, below the five year average.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u202280 percent of companies have reported revenue above estimates, a record high.\n\n\u2022 All 11 sectors are reporting earnings growth.\n\nPhoto\n\nWill Wells Fargo miss out on the banking party?\n\nA Federal Reserve regulatory action, announced Friday evening, placed a cap on the amount of assets (loans and securities) that Wells Fargo can hold. The Fed took this action in response to misconduct at the bank that involved deceiving its customers. The cap will be in place until the Fed is satisfied that the bank has made sufficient improvements in its operations and corporate governance.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s stock is down more than 7 percent Monday, suggesting that investors believe the growth cap will have some bite. With the economy strengthening and interest rates rising, banks can expect to earn higher profits as they make more loans and suffer fewer losses from defaults. Indeed, this optimistic scenario has helped send bank stocks on a tear in recent months. Now, the question is to what degree Wells Fargo will have to sit out the good times.\n\nWells Fargo executives on Friday suggested that the cap would have limited financial impact, saying it would reduce this year\u2019s net profits by $300 million to $400 million, which works out at less than 2 percent of 2017\u2019s earnings. One reason the earnings hit might be small is that the bank can stay within the cap by selling short-term, lower-risk investments that don\u2019t earn much. Another way the bank intends to limit the negative impact is by reducing the amount of deposits on which the bank pays out a relatively high interest rate.\n\nCrucially, Wells Fargo said that it hopes to increase the size of its loan book. The hope is that, by shedding the low-risk investments, the bank will create the room to make more mortgages, credit card loans and loans to businesses, while staying within the limit.\n\nBut it may not turn out to be as straightforward as that.\n\nThe growth cap comes after a lackluster year for Wells, which reduced its loans 1 percent last year, compared with an increase of 3.5 percent at Bank of America. Investors waiting for catch-up growth at Wells may have to wait still longer. Also, much depends on whether Wells Fargo can now satisfy the Fed\u2019s concerns. Any indication that the bank is struggling to comply with the regulator\u2019s demands could set off more turmoil at the bank. There is also a possibility that the tactic of shedding of low-risk investments while making more loans could increase the overall risk of Wells Fargo\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nBrian Kleinhanzl, a banks analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote on Sunday that the Fed\u2019s action will \u201cmean Wells will have a harder time maintaining market share and will have to compete more on price or credit terms versus peers,\u201d adding, \u201cWells will also have to maintain the balance sheet while other banks are growing, and we view this as defensive versus peers.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom puts more pressure on Qualcomm\n\nIn raising its takeover bid to about $121 billion just now, Broadcom is hoping to allay concerns about its takeover bid and its quest to create a behemoth in computer chips.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Broadcom is offering:\n\n\u2022 A takeover price of $82 a share, up from its original offer of $70\n\n\u2022 A \u201csignificant\u201d breakup fee if a deal were to be halted for antitrust reasons\n\n\u2022 A \u201cticking fee\u201d that Broadcom would pay in cash if a deal took more than a year to close\n\nIt said the new \u201cbest and final\u201d offer would be withdrawn if Qualcomm either pushed its annual shareholder meeting back from March 6 (when Broadcom hopes to unseat the entire board) or if it paid more than $110 a share for NXP Semiconductor.\n\nThe context: Qualcomm recently reported a 96 percent drop in operating income amid a royalty dispute with Apple. That has given Broadcom some pause, but not enough to make it walk away.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: This offer isn\u2019t likely to tempt Qualcomm. It has a better chance of tempting investors, who might then press the chip maker into negotiations.\n\nStocks aren\u2019t the only asset selling off recently.\n\nBitcoin is down 14 percent Monday to $7,360.

The goal: to send a message.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore from Emily Flitter, Binyamin Appelbaum and David Enrich:\n\nThe settlement is an attempt by the Fed to impress upon banks that their boards of directors should be vigorous, independent watchdogs \u2014 and if they fail, there will be consequences. That reflects a shift from regulators\u2019 historically hands-off approach to corporate boards, and the boards\u2019 role is likely to grow in importance as regulators appointed by President Trump and Republicans in Congress generally loosen the reins on big banks.\n\nBehind the scenes: Wells Fargo executives were irate that the Fed\u2019s announcement trumpeted the replacement of the banks\u2019 directors, and that it implied the boardroom changes came at the Fed\u2019s instruction.\n\nThe big question: Will Wells Fargo have to do more than it just agreed?

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "The culprit? The Model 3, Tesla\u2019s first mass-market car. Many of the costs associated with the Model 3 are being booked in the income statement but difficulties in producing the car mean sales are low. As a result, the gross margin on the Model 3 was negative and is expected to remain so in the first quarter of 2018, Tesla said. The company did not specify how negative the gross margin on the Model 3 was.\n\nTesla tried to be reassuring. The company said it was on track to produce 5,000 Model 3s by the middle of 2018. The company had pushed back when it would hit this 5,000 vehicle target last month. But Tesla did not sound overly confident about achieving its Model 3 milestones. The company said:\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that while these are the levels we are focused on hitting and we have plans in place to achieve them, our prior experience on the Model 3 ramp has demonstrated the difficulty of accurately forecasting specific production rates at specific points in time.\u201d\n\nCash flow may not be as impressive as it looked. In the fourth quarter, Tesla brought in $510 million of operating cash flow, a big turnaround from an outflow of $301 million in the prior three months. How did Tesla pull this off? The company said the increase was achieved in part by doing a better job collecting the money it is owed and by reducing its inventory of finished vehicles. But the company\u2019s balance sheet showed a nearly $500 million increase in short-term liabilities in the fourth quarter. In other words, the amounts Tesla owes its customers and suppliers went up. It may be tough to keep generating cash flow in this fashion.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a Tesla call without something for the bulls: Elon Musk said on the call that \u201c2018 is likely to be a very big year for Tesla\u201d and that he is optimistic Tesla will be GAAP profitable. \u201cIt\u2019s not certain, but I\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Mr. Musk said.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nAthenahealth names Jeff Immelt as chairman.\n\nSince stepping down from General Electric last year, Jeff Immelt has certainly been keeping busy. He interviewed for the Uber C.E.O. position and joined the venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates as a partner.\n\nNow he is adding \u201cchairman of a fast-growing health company\u201d to his titles.\n\nAthenahealth, a provider of electronic medical records software, announced Wednesday that it has hired Mr. Immelt as its chairman, capping a monthslong search for the position.\n\nThe context\n\nThe move adds a veteran corporate chieftain to oversee the fast-growing company, particularly as it seeks to prove that it\u2019s capable of maturing.\n\nAthenahealth had been under pressure last year from Elliott Management, which disclosed a 9.2 percent stake in the company last spring and pressed for operational changes. Jonathan Bush, the company\u2019s founder and C.E.O. (and a cousin of George W. Bush) credited the activist investor with helping him realize that a shake-up was necessary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe company beat earnings and revenue estimates in its fourth quarter.\n\nFor Mr. Immelt, joining Athenahealth is in keeping with his interest in the health care business, a focus of his at G.E.\n\nWhat the principals say about the appointment\n\n\u2022 \u201cI literally feel like I just scored a decade\u2019s worth of guitar lessons from Elvis,\u201d Mr. Bush said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m convinced that this platform at Athenahealth can be one of the transformational platforms for health care,\u201d Mr. Immelt said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m a junkie for the industry.\u201d\n\nThe big question\n\nCan a founder who has run the company since its beginning take direction from an outsider? Mr. Bush said that with Mr. Immelt, the answer is yes.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing less marriage counseling with 12 adults,\u201d Mr. Bush said of his board, adding that Mr. Immelt would be a partner to take advice from (and occasionally whine to).\n\nAn outside perspective\n\n\u201cWhat Jeff brings is an understanding of scale on a couple of dimensions, not only in terms of people and processes but also how you think about scaling with your partners.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Henry Ellenbogen of T. Rowe Price, one of Athenahealth\u2019s biggest shareholders, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nSenate leaders reach a deal to raise spending.\n\nThomas Kaplan of the NYT reports that Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, his Democratic counterpart, have struck a far-reaching agreement that would add hundreds of billions of dollars to military and domestic programs over the next two years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe deal would:\n\n\u2022 raise the spending caps by about $300 billion over two years, according to a congressional aide.\n\n\u2022 increase the limit on military spending by $80 billion in the current fiscal year and $85 billion in the next year, which begins Oct. 1, the aide said.\n\n\u2022 increase the limit on nondefense spending by $63 billion this year and $68 billion next year.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\n\u201cThe deal will cause federal budget deficits to grow even larger, on top of the effects of the sweeping tax overhaul that lawmakers approved in December. But because the agreement gives both parties what they wanted most, the deficit impact appears to be of little concern. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Speaker Paul D. Ryan all quickly embraced it.\u201d\n\nCritics corner\n\n\u2022 Hard-line conservatives were unsparing in their assessment of the deal.\n\n\u2022 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the leader of House Democrats, said she could not agree to any budget deal that was not accompanied by a debate over legislation to protect the fate of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\n\nPhoto\n\nHas Snap finally snapped its losing streak?\n\nShares of the messaging and media company surged nearly 40 percent to $19.49 in recent trading. That\u2019s their highest level since June and well above its initial public offering price of $17 a share.\n\nThe jump comes after the company reported results after the close on Tuesday. David Streitfeld of the NYT writes:\n\n\u201cRevenue was $286 million, up 72 percent from a year earlier and about $30 million more than analysts had expected. Daily users rose nine million to 187 million, the best growth in over a year. The retention rate of new Android users, a special focus for Snap, jumped nearly 20 percent over the previous year.\u201d \u201cThe company lost $350 million in the quarter, or 13 cents a share, which was narrower than the loss of 16 cents that was expected by analysts. And it also contrasted with the carnage of the prior quarter, when Snap recorded a net loss that was twice the forecast.\u201d\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe results have helped quell some of the concerns about the company\u2019s slowing revenue and user growth in the face of increased competition from the likes of Facebook.\n\nCritics corner\n\nRoss Sandler of Barclays: \u201cWe think shares could continue to grind higher as the narrative changes from 2017\u2019s \u2018FB is going to crush SNAP\u2019 to 2018\u2019s \u201cusers and revenue accelerate and the platform is under-monetized\u201d. Shares are expensive (8.3x our FY19 revenue estimate), but everything is accelerating, and as we\u2019ve seen repeatedly in consumer internet, these inflection points are not likely one-quarter events.\u201d\n\nDaniel Ives of GBH Insights: \u201cThis eye popping top-line beat was a \u2018shocker\u2019 and was a stark contrast to the overwhelming bear sentiment heading into the 4Q print and speaks to a company with strong growth prospects, albeit clear business challenges ahead to iron out in 2018. After much pain that investors have endured since SNAP went public, this quarter was finally a breath of fresh air that gives new life to the SNAP turnaround story in 2018.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTrump: Investors are making a mistake.\n\nPresident Trump, who has taken credit for a rising stock market as a measure of his own success, complained on Twitter Wednesday that \u201cgood (great) news\u201d in the economy led to an abrupt decline in stock prices, his first comments about the stock market since its sharp drop earlier this week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the early-morning tweet, Mr. Trump lamented that in the \u201cold days,\u201d stocks would rise on good economic news, saying \u201cToday, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down. Big mistake.\u201d The tweet did not elaborate on what he meant by the \u201cold days\u201d or explain further his analysis of why stocks plummeted on Friday and Monday.\n\nUntil Wednesday\u2019s tweet, the president had been unusually silent about the stock market, which has been rocked by volatility, including a decline in the Dow Jones industrial average of almost 7 percent over two days. At one point on Monday, the Dow was down almost 1,600 points, or about 6 percent of its total value, the markets plunging at the same moment as Mr. Trump was giving a speech in Blue Ash, Ohio. It closed that day down 1,175 points.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the fall was pegged to good economic news stems from Friday\u2019s job report, which showed wages beginning to rise as the economy nears full employment.\n\n\u2014 Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport\n\nThe bigger picture\n\n\n\nWelcome to the end of easy money, as strengthening economies lead to higher wages and tighter unemployment \u2014 and potentially to central bankers raising interest rates.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s tax cut was meant to supercharge growth in an economy already doing fine. (Though Eduardo Porter notes that productivity is low and new business formation has slowed.) Economists and analysts are increasingly worried that the tax overhaul will do the opposite of what it was intended to.\n\nPhoto\n\nWe still have questions about Wynn Resorts\u2019 board\n\nSteve Wynn resigned yesterday as the C.E.O. of Wynn Resorts after allegations of sexual misconduct. Those accusations have created an important test for corporate America.\n\nIn recent months, many powerful men have had to step down from senior positions as they have faced accusations of sexual harassment, but none were the head of a public company like Mr. Wynn. How would the board, shareholders, regulators, customers and unions react?\n\nWe now know something about the shareholder perspective: Shares in Wynn Resorts were up 7 percent in early-morning trading today. Regulators in Nevada, Massachusetts and Macau are still conducting their own investigations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the biggest unresolved question remains the board and its conduct.\n\nThe board set up a committee of independent directors to carry out an investigation after the WSJ article, but it was not clear how rigorous it would be. The board did not have a track record for holding Mr. Wynn accountable.\n\nIn an email exchange with me, Lucian Bebchuk, a Harvard law professor and an expert in corporate governance, asked why the board did not suspend Mr. Wynn from his position pending the investigation, or demand that he not interact with Wynn Resorts employees, a step that would have limited his ability to influence the board investigation.\n\nIn fact, the board, in its statement, sounded somewhat saddened by Mr. Wynn\u2019s departure, saying it had \u201creluctantly\u201d accepted his resignation.\n\nOne remaining way to assess the board\u2019s resolve will be Mr. Wynn\u2019s separation agreement, which is not yet finalized.\n\nWhen the WSJ article was published, Mr. Wynn denied the accusations of sexual misconduct, calling them \u201cpreposterous.\u201d On Tuesday he said, \u201cI have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear why Mr. Wynn decided to step down. It may have been pressure from gaming regulators. Customers might have been pulling back.\n\nMr. Wynn may have wanted to preserve the value of his own stake in Wynn Resorts. But as it stands, it does not look like the board was a strong force.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nMisconduct claims take down an S. & P. 500 C.E.O.\n\nSteve Wynn has stepped down from his $17 billion casino empire, a little over a week after allegations of forced sex and other sexual misconduct claims emerged in a WSJ investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere had been little sense at Wynn Resorts over the last week that the man who made modern Las Vegas was on his way out:\n\nTop executives spent hours with Mr. Wynn going over plans for a new casino he would like to build in Las Vegas, according to a person familiar with the matter, while the company\u2019s general counsel hopped on a call with other executives to discuss the Vegas Strong Fund, a nonprofit formed in the aftermath of last year\u2019s mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip, according to a person familiar with the call.\n\nHe also attended the company\u2019s 1,500-guest Super Bowl party on Sunday, the WSJ says.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Wynn blamed his exit on \u201ca rush to judgment\u201d that took \u201cprecedence over everything, including the facts.\u201d\n\nThe intrigue: The company\u2019s news release reads almost like a corporate eulogy, calling Mr. Wynn a \u201cbeloved leader and visionary.\u201d So why the sudden exit?

In December, they asked Michael Grimes, the head of global technology investment banking at Morgan Stanley, to present options for going public, said people close to the bank.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Tosi \u2014 who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with Mr. Chesky on other issues and generally did not fit in at Airbnb \u2014 resigned.\n\nAn Airbnb spokesman denied there was ever any intent to pursue an I.P.O. this year.\n\nBonus trivia: Mr. Tosi set up a hedge fund of sorts at Airbnb, which was responsible for 30 percent of Airbnb\u2019s cash flow last year and made about $60 million.\n\nThe tech flyaround\n\n\u2022 Goldman Sachs\u2019s retail arm is in talks to offer financing for Apple customers, unnamed sources say.

The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent.\n\nThe consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs.\n\nInvestors appeared to reassess whether the previous day\u2019s violent decline\u2014the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011\u2014reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters.\n\nFor months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility\u2014the ups and downs of stock prices\u2014hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data\u2014such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday\u2014showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years.\n\n\u2014 Matt Phillips\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nDisney easily exceeds Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy.\n\nDisney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter.\n\nDisney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period\u2019s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers\u2019 willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nSnap jumps 20 percent after earnings.\n\nThe company reported earnings after the close that easily beat analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe Numbers\n\n\u2022 Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts.\n\n\u2022 The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share.\n\n\u2022 Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated.\n\nThe Context\n\nSnap\u2019s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap\u2019s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReasons not to worry about the recent sell-off.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe stock market\u2019s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety.\n\nStocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history.\n\nBut there are reasons investors shouldn\u2019t get too concerned.\n\n1) Heading into the final hour of trading, the markets have rebounded strongly. The Dow has jumped 2 percent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent. That suggests that worst of the sell-off may be passed.\n\n2) The outlook for economic growth is strong in the United States. The American economy grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow tracker forecasts a 4 percent rise in the first quarter.\n\n3) Corporate America\u2019s bottom line is growing. With 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase.\n\n4) The sell-off comes after a big run-up in stocks. Until Monday, the Dow and the S.&P. 500 hadn\u2019t endured a pullback of 5 percent in more than 400 sessions. Since 1929, a 5 percent decline happens every 92 days on average, according to Goldman Sachs. So stocks were arguably due for a selloff. But it should be noted that after Monday\u2019s declines the Dow was at levels last seen in, well, mid-December and was up more than 30 percent since the 2016 election.\n\nStrategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote:\n\n\u201cThe stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.\u201d\n\nSpaceX successfully launches its Heavy Falcon rocket.\n\nThe company, founded by Elon Musk, achieved a new milestone with a successful test launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, the most powerful rocket in operation in the world today.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of the launch:\n\nWill the Mouse help keep the bear at bay?\n\nWhen stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified.\n\nThat is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America .\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company\u2019s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday.\n\nThough Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors..\n\nThe numbers to watch: Analysts expect Disney to earn $1.61 per share, and take in $15.44 billion in revenue in the quarter, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nOf course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nClayton: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me.\u201d\n\nAt a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil.\n\n\u201cIs this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?\u201d Mr. Shelby asked.\n\nJay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading.\n\n\u201cAs I sit here today, there\u2019s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,\u201d Mr. Clayton said.\n\nChristopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe system worked as it was designed to do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Nathaniel Popper\n\nIs algorithmic trading to blame for Monday\u2019s plunge?\n\nFollowing a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market.\n\n\u201cI have heard from others that it has played a role, as there\u2019s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it\u2019s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier with companies\u2019 response with more and more investments in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\n\n\nSteven Mnuchin isn\u2019t concerned about the stock market turbulence\n\nAsked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nHe said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were \u201cno systemic issues\u201d that were reported to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to report I got the green lights,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nThe Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll still claim credit for the fact that it\u2019s up over 30 percent since the election,\u201d he said of the stock market.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday\u2019s plunge: short volatility.\n\nInvestors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market\u2019s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows.\n\nThat quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product \u2014 VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN \u2014 endured heavy selling.\n\nThe selling led Credit Suisse to say it is going to buy back XIV and after the bank has done that it will no longer exist. Nomura also said its Next Notes \u201cwould be redeemed at a steep discount to their closing price on Monday in Asia, crystallizing large losses for investors,\u201d the WSJ reported.\n\nFrom Barclays:\n\n\u201cIn our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.\u201d\n\nFrom Morgan Stanley:\n\n\u201cThe near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.\u201d\n\nFrom Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research:\n\n\u201c Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nPhoto\n\nThe big questions about another market drop\n\nStock markets around the world appear headed down for a third straight trading day, after yesterday\u2019s 4 percent drop in the S.&P. 500. Here are the latest numbers:\n\n\u2022 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng fell 5 percent.\n\n\u2022 Japan\u2019s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent.\n\n\u2022 The U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent.\n\n\u2022 Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge,\u201d the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd here\u2019s some more context from our colleague Peter Eavis.\n\nThe technical question: Has computer-driven unwinding of \u201cGoldilocks\u201d trades tied to peaceful market rises played a role here?\n\nThe economic question: Economies are growing around the world, which is likely to mean rising wages and then, perhaps, inflation. So will central bankers have to raise rates more than previously expected?\n\nThe political question: What does this mean for President Trump, who has touted stock market gains as a measure of his success?\n\nMore from Ben White of Politico:\n\n\u201cThis is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,\u201d said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. \u201cUntil now, Trump\u2019s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she\u2019s out the door and volatility is back.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another way of thinking about Mr. Trump\u2019s role, Andrew writes in his latest column:\n\nInvestors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect action from the newly sworn-in Fed chairman, Jay Powell \u2014 at least, not yet.\n\nA bit of humor, courtesy of our colleague Binyamin Appelbaum:\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nVirtual currency prices are falling, too\n\nWhere Bitcoin was this morning: $6,628, down almost 16 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum\u2019s Ether and Ripple\u2019s XRP fell by double digits, too.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening: Regulators are clamping down on digital money, and scams and hacks are eroding trust in it.\n\nMore from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT:\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,\u201d said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThe combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.\u201d\n\nNext: The heads of the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are to talk Bitcoin with the Senate Banking Committee today.\n\nPhoto\n\nWill we avoid another government shutdown?\n\nThe House appears ready to vote on a stopgap bill; funding would otherwise expire at 12:01 a.m. on Friday.\n\nWhat it does: Pairs short-term funding for the government with long-term funding for the military.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do: Include the increase in domestic spending demanded by Democrats, particularly Senate Democrats. Nor does it address immigration, which caused last month\u2019s shutdown (though Senators John McCain and Chris Coons have a bipartisan proposal on that).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExpect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress:\n\n\u201cI think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we\u2019ll see where the ball lands,\u201d said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.\n\nElsewhere in policy\n\n\u2022 Most of President Trump\u2019s legal team wants to avoid letting Robert Mueller question him.

(NYT)\n\nWill Comcast try to top Disney\u2019s bid for Fox?\n\nIt depends whether AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner goes through. Comcast dropped out of the running for Fox once it became clear that Rupert Murdoch would prefer a tie-up with Disney, but it is studying whether to rejoin the fray, CNBC reported.\n\nMore from Alex Sherman of CNBC:\n\nAn unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney\u2019s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox\u2019s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox\u2019s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.\n\nElsewhere in the deal world\n\n\u2022 Archer-Daniels Midland is in advanced talks to buy Bunge, unnamed sources say.

In \u201cThe Invisible Ladder,\u201d Liz Rosenberg\u2019s thoughtfully edited anthology of contemporary American poetry for children, she makes sweetly explicit the profound connection between grown writers and young readers. At the start of each section, then-and-now snapshots of each writer featured \u2014 from Robert Creeley and Cornelius Eady to Rita Dove and Li-Young Lee \u2014 reveal the poet as both child and adult.

In this picture book, vividly illustrated by Ekua Holmes, the authors Kwame Alexander, Chris Colderley and Marjory Wentworth craft poems in the styles of 20 poets from around the world \u2014 Robert Frost, Terrance Hayes, Rumi and Maya Angelou among them.

Some of the poet\u2019s darting, playful, exuberant lines can be found in four seasonal sections, which include some of her most beloved poems (like \u201cThere\u2019s a certain slant of light\u201d and \u201cThere is no frigate like a book\u201d) as well as less familiar ones on several of her favorite subjects: botany, faith and language. Italicized notes at the bottoms of the pages define unfamiliar vocabulary, and a section at the back titled \u201cWhat Emily Was Thinking\u201d provides enlightening context. (Both explanatory features appear in the series\u2019s other books, on Carl Sandburg and Walt Whitman.)\n\nLiterary Samplers\n\nCarefully curated anthologies, each with a narrow focus, would make fine resources for your project. In \u201cBeastly Verse,\u201d JooHee Yoon\u2019s riotous illustrations make even old favorites about animals (both real and imagined) new. The wildest of the bunch, including \u201cThe Tiger,\u201d by William Blake, \u201cEletelephony,\u201d by Laura E. Richards, and \u201cHumming-bird,\u201d by D. H. Lawrence, can\u2019t be tamed by a single spread; page flaps open to allow animals to prowl, make mischief and fly.\n\nFor times when your notebook isn\u2019t close at hand, you\u2019ll want to introduce your granddaughter to the singular delights of memorization. \u201cForget-Me-Nots,\u201d a sizable treasury selected by Mary Ann Hoberman and joyfully illustrated by Michael Emberley, starts short. Even the longest poem on the first spread after the introduction \u2014 \u201cPrimer Lesson\u201d by Carl Sandburg \u2014 could be learned in an afternoon. The challenge to commit verse to memory grows in later sections, though rhyming and silliness give the longer poems a mnemonic boost.\n\nStretch the Rules\n\nOnce you\u2019ve played with some words you\u2019ll want to master some forms. \u201cSeeing Into Tomorrow,\u201d a collection of 12 delicate, late-in-life nature haiku by Richard Wright, is exquisitely illustrated in a photo collage by Nina Crews. The structure of Marilyn Singer\u2019s reverso poems is less easily repeated. Her dramatic and satisfying \u201cEcho Echo,\u201d inspired by Greek myths and illustrated by Jos\u00e9e Masse, gives different perspectives in adjacent, top-to-bottom mirror poems. And, for a more immediate though no less complex wordplay, turn to Paul Fleischman\u2019s exquisite book of read-aloud verse, \u201cJoyful Noise.\u201d The insect-themed compositions unfold in rich counterpoint meant for two readers.

He\u2019s dying. An examination in September by a doctor from the Columbia University Medical Center found that Hamm had no usable veins and that \u201cthe state is not equipped to achieve venous access in Mr. Hamm\u2019s case.\u201d\n\nSo began a macabre dance characterized by an unseemly determination to execute Hamm. The Alabama Supreme Court set an execution date late last year. U.S. Chief District Judge Karon Bowdre of the Northern District of Alabama granted a stay on Jan. 31. After an emergency appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, that stay was vacated on Feb. 13 and a medical examination ordered.\n\nThe examination found that Hamm\u2019s arms and hands were unusable but his legs and feet, or \u201clower extremities,\u201d were workable. On Feb. 20, Bowdre ordered that the execution could proceed on Feb. 22. Then the 11th Circuit required that a doctor be present with ultrasound equipment. A final appeal to the Supreme Court was denied last Thursday evening, setting in motion the ghoulish proceedings.\n\nTo state the obvious, this is obscene.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "I did ask some with expertise, just to be sure. Charlie Camosy, a theologian at Fordham University who writes about ethics and animals, read the paper and supplementary material from Dr. Larson\u2019s article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution. \u201cNothing about this is familiar to me,\u201d he emailed back. He did say that misconceptions about religious ideas on animals were common.\n\nBut Dr. Larson and others took the story for granted, and the debunking started out as something else entirely. Dr. Larson researches the origins of domestic animals like dogs and pigs. He asked a graduate student in his Oxford University laboratory, Evan K. Irving-Pease, to use the well-accepted date of rabbit domestication, 600, as a basis for checking the accuracy of a tool that helps researchers use modern DNA to look back in time and estimate when different species diverged.\n\nMr. Irving-Pease first did a bit of historical housekeeping and searched for the papal edict. \u201cHe comes back,\u201d Dr. Larson said, \u201cand says, \u2018Small problem. It doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThat was only the beginning. With a tug on that one thread, the whole story unraveled.\n\nMr. Irving-Pease went on to document a kind of historical telephone game, with an initial error embellished and extended by one writer after another.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe problem began, he said, in 1936 when a German geneticist, Hans Nachtsheim, writing about domestication, said that Saint Gregory of Tours (not Pope Gregory, a different person altogether) had written that fetal rabbits were popular during Lent.\n\nActually, Saint Gregory merely described one person consuming fetal rabbits during Lent, and that person was sick, died shortly thereafter, and may not even have been a Christian.\n\nNonetheless, in 1963, another writer, Frederick E. Zeuner, in another book on domestication, added to the mistake and said the fetal rabbits were not considered meat.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on,\u201d Mr. Irving-Pease said in an email, \u201cthe story takes on a life of its own, as further small details get embellished in each retelling.\u201d In the end, he wrote, the \u201cwatery\u201d environment of the womb made the fetal rabbits fish, \u201cSt. Gregory becomes Pope Gregory and, finally, his manuscript becomes a papal edict.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith that story debunked, Dr. Larson says, the whole business of rabbit domestication is unclear. It is known that domestic rabbits descended from the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, which originated in France and Spain.\n\nAnd, they were kept by humans in penned warrens and fattened for slaughter in hutches at least since the first century B.C. That is not, however, the same as controlling their breeding, which is usually considered a mark of domestication.\n\nDr. Larson and colleagues write that the earliest evidence of skeletal changes that mark a difference between domestic and wild rabbits occurs in the 18th century, around the time people began keeping rabbits as pets. At such recent times, DNA evidence is not very useful.\n\nDr. Larson suggests that the reason for the acceptance of the fetal-rabbit story is that even scientists fall victim to the appeal of a good narrative. And he said, it indicates an underlying, and mistaken view of domestication as an event, not a process. The domestication of rabbits, he believes, involves a long interaction with humans. They were hunted for thousands of years in Southwest France and the Iberian Peninsula; consumed as fetuses; kept by Romans and during Medieval times in warrens and hutches; and most recently bred as pets. All of this is the story of their domestication.\n\nThat is where Leif Andersson, of Uppsala University in Sweden, disagrees. Dr. Andersson, who was a senior author of a 2014 paper on the rabbit genome, found the debunking of the myth persuasive, but he noted in an email that he and his co-authors did not cite the story in their genome paper.\n\nBut, he said, he did not agree that all instances of domestication have been continuous processes over a long period. For rabbits in particular, he said, that conclusion was \u201cmisleading.\u201d He said there is a consensus that it happened in modern times and that his paper showed that domestic rabbits are more closely related to wild rabbits from southern France than to those from the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nRabbits may have been domesticated around 600, he wrote, saying that he found nothing in Dr. Larson\u2019s paper to exclude the possibility that, papal edicts aside, \u201cFrench monks or farmers in Southern France, because they loved rabbit meat, made a specific effort during a period of 50-100 years to establish tame rabbits that became the founding population for the domestic rabbit.\u201d", "title": "Debunked: The Strange Tale of Pope Gregory and the Rabbits", "authors": ["James Gorman"]}
{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nOften when a few people reveal a secret, others feel free to share their stories, too. This was the case last week, after The New York Times Magazine published an excerpt from my book, \u201cRise and Kill First,\u201d about the secret history of Israel\u2019s targeted assassination program. The excerpt focused on Israel\u2019s numerous attempts to kill the P.L.O. leader Yasir Arafat, many of which were thwarted by Israeli officers worried that the sometimes spectacular schemes, which involved dropping bombs on crowded neighborhoods or shooting down civilian aircraft, threatened too much collateral damage and would amount to war crimes.\n\nImmediately after the story ran, the Israel news media erupted in controversy. Some commenters were disturbed by the existence of the program; others were upset that it did not go far enough. The arguments were familiar. What was more interesting, though, was the reaction from people who were present at the incidents I described and at others like them.\n\nOne of the episodes in the Times excerpt involves the story of Uri Avnery, a dovish Israeli journalist who, during the 1982 Israeli siege of Beirut, crossed the lines from an Israeli-held sector into the P.L.O.-controlled western neighborhoods with a photographer and a young reporter to meet Arafat. This was a controversial move. Israelis perceived Arafat to be their greatest enemy. His code name was \u201cthe Fish\u2019s Head,\u201d after the old saying that a fish rots from the head down. An Israeli special-ops task force that was set up to locate Arafat, code-named Salt Fish, knew about Avnery\u2019s plan and decided to track his party until it reached the meeting place and then strike. An argument broke out among the military men and intelligence operatives involved as to whether they should endanger the lives of the three Israelis. On this occasion, in the heat of the battle and perhaps because some of the officers held the left-wing Avnery in contempt, it was decided not to let his party\u2019s presence foil the plans to dispose of Arafat. Ultimately, however, Arafat\u2019s security team was able to shake the operatives who were trailing him, and the decision remained a theoretical one.\n\nIn the wake of the Times article, Avnery wrote about the episode from his own perspective, for Ha\u2019aretz. A German journalist, he said, had suggested that he interview Arafat and gave him his office telephone number. \u201cI hurried to my hotel room and dialed the number,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn Arabic-accented voice answered. I said that I was Uri Avnery from Tel Aviv and I would like to meet with the Ra\u2019is\u201d \u2014 the president in Arabic. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ll call you in the evening,\u2019 the man answered. I was certain nothing would come of it.\u201d Salt Fish, monitoring many of Arafat\u2019s phone calls, learned of the plan. Late that night, the phone rang in Avnery\u2019s hotel room and he was told, \u201cBe at the museum checkpoint at exactly 10:00 tomorrow. A man named Ahmed will be waiting for you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe route to the meeting place was a bit odd,\u201d Avnery recalled in Ha\u2019aretz, \u201cwe drove in crazy zigzags, back and forth, right and left.

Williams Jr., a lawyer for Mr. Gerardi, said allowing questioning on that topic would get into a \u201cwhole mini-trial\u201d that would unfairly prejudice the jury.\n\nProsecutors said defense lawyers had opened the door to that line of inquiry by arguing that Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi had been innocent victims of, rather than active collaborators with, Mr. Howe, when they allegedly bribed Mr. Percoco.

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s former top aides, the defense quickly rested on Monday, setting the stage for closing arguments that will begin on Tuesday.\n\nStanding in front of Judge Valerie E. Caproni in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the chief defendant, Joseph Percoco, said he would not testify in his own defense.

Mr. Scott\u2019s proposed rule, which Senator Marco Rubio also supports, would make 21 the minimum age across the board for all gun purchases.\n\nPresident Trump and the N.R.A. have endorsed putting more armed educators in schools, but Mr. Scott and state Republican legislators did not follow their lead.\n\nInstead, Mr. Scott\u2019s plan, which has largely been endorsed by Florida House and Senate leaders, would mandate at least one armed police officer for every 1,000 students at public schools.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI disagree with arming teachers,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cMy focus is on bringing in law enforcement.

The proposal would allow voting by mail, as 30 other states already do \u2014 including virtually the entire western United States.

The expansion of voting rights is one of the great stories of American progress over the last century. But the United States still has lower voter turnout than almost every other wealthy country, partly because of how inconvenient voting often is.

Mr. Reid\u2019s strategy was embraced by his successor, Catherine Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina elected to the Senate.\n\nIn the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, there has been a renewed focus on the so-called white working-class vote, a demographic segment that has been getting smaller each year and has been trending away from Democrats for a long time. While it is true that compared with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton lost ground with that segment of the electorate, the clues to a new Democratic majority may be found in the coalition that elected Mr. Northam governor of Virginia, or perhaps more accurately, voted against Mr. Gillespie and his immigrant bashing.\n\nIn Virginia, polling data has made it clear that Mr. Gillespie\u2019s MS-13 rhetoric backfired among minority voters as well as, crucially, among many whites. Mr. Northam won a majority of white college-educated voters, who made up a larger share of the electorate in 2017 than they did in 2016. Mr. Gillespie matched Mr. Trump with noncollege whites, but their turnout was down.

But in the end, election results and polling data in Virginia proved all that thinking was wrong.

Nathaniel Persily, the Stanford professor who helped draw the map, has been barred by the court from discussing it.\n\nA series of pro-Democratic choices would be necessary to create statewide partisan balance, since lopsided winning margins in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh put Democrats at a considerable disadvantage in translating their votes to seats statewide. In fact, the new map still slightly advantages the Republicans with respect to the statewide popular vote.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the court strove for partisan symmetry in the context of a partisan gerrymandering case. But the court order did not say that the maps should strive for partisan balance, and it seems that\u2019s the reason Democrats did not strive for it, either.\n\nMichael McDonald, an associate professor at the University of Florida, suggests Democrats held back from greater ambition in part because they were protecting incumbents. But there was only one plausibly vulnerable Democratic incumbent to protect, Matt Cartwright, and there is little reason to believe the effort to protect him weakened the Democratic proposals.\n\nMr. Cartwright\u2019s new district voted for President Trump by 10 points; in the Democratic proposals, the district voted for Mr. Trump by an average of nine points. Just as important, even a concerted effort to protect him would have little effect on the overall statewide map. It would be enough to flip the old 15th District from Mr. Trump to Hillary Clinton (going by 2016 results) but no more. And it wouldn\u2019t flip the 15th District in the other contests where Democrats generally fared better, like the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe map comes close to maximizing the number of Democratic opportunities while complying with the court\u2019s order to minimize county, municipality or precinct splits except to make sure each district has about the same number of people. Perhaps the only plausible way to substantially improve Democratic chances from here would be to split the city of Pittsburgh, an unlikely choice given the requirement to avoid unnecessarily splitting municipalities.\n\nOver all, it\u2019s a huge lift to Democrats\u2019 chances. In this political environment, they\u2019d probably be favored to gain around four seats in the state, up from the two they were favored to carry before. They are overwhelming favorites to win the new versions of the old Seventh and modest favorites to win the old Sixth and 15th, with very good additional opportunities in the old Eighth and 12th, and two long-shot options in the old Third and Fourth.", "title": "Democrats Didn\u2019t Even Dream of This Pennsylvania Map.

He said the Trumps and the Chawlas had agreed that any rebate \u2014 which Mississippi offers in an effort to draw tourists \u2014 would not figure into fees paid to the Trumps.\n\nStill, if the state approves the tax rebate for the Chawlas, it could indirectly, but personally, benefit the president, who owns the family business through a trust, an arrangement that raises some constitutional concerns, critics and legal experts say.\n\nIn lawsuits filed last year, a number of lawmakers, academics and state attorneys general contended that Mr. Trump was violating the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, which essentially prohibit the president from accepting certain gifts from foreign or domestic governments. A federal judge in New York dismissed one case, while a federal judge in Maryland signaled recently that he might allow another to proceed.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s founders included the emoluments clauses as a big bright-line rule,\u201d said Jed Shugerman, a professor at the Fordham University School of Law who helped write a legal brief in support of the plaintiffs in the emoluments litigation. Assessing the Chawlas\u2019 application, he argued that while some state incentives are allowable, \u201cMississippi has discretion to give the tax rebate, and if they do award it to this hotel, then they are likely giving Trump an emolument.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for the same brief, John Mikhail at Georgetown University Law Center studied 40 dictionaries from the founding era and concluded that the term \u201cemolument\u201d was almost always defined more broadly than the Trump administration has interpreted it. Still, some legal experts argue that domestic emoluments are allowable so long as Mr. Trump does not earn them from his service as president.", "title": "Developers Seek $6 Million Tax Break for Trump-Managed Hotel", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "Let\u2019s review. Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman until August 2016, is credibly alleged to have received $12.7 million in \u201cundisclosed cash payments\u201d from then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian stooge. Had Manafort not been exposed, he might have gone on to occupy a position of trust in the Trump administration, much as Reagan campaign manager Bill Casey wound up running the C.I.A. He would then have been easy prey to Russian blackmail.\n\nGeorge Papadopoulos, the young adviser who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the F.B.I., spent his time on the campaign trying to make overtures to Russia. In May 2016 he blabbed to an Australian diplomat that Moscow had political dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2014 information that proved true and was passed on to U.S. intelligence. This was the genesis of an F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation, as the Nunes memo itself admits.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Carter Page, the man at the center of the Nunes memo. By turns stupid (his Ph.D. thesis was twice rejected), self-important (he has compared himself to Martin Luther King Jr.), and money-hungry (a suspected Russian agent who tried to recruit him in 2013 was recorded saying he \u201cgot hooked on Gazprom\u201d), Page happens also to be highly sympathetic to the Putin regime. The Russian phrase for such characters is polezni durak \u2014 useful idiot. No wonder he was invited to give a commencement speech at a Russian university in the summer of 2016. That\u2019s how assets are cultivated in the world of intelligence.\n\nGiven the profile and his relative proximity to team Trump, it would have been professionally negligent of the F.B.I. not to keep tabs on him. Yet the bureau only obtained a surveillance warrant after Page had left the campaign and shortly before the election, and it insisted throughout the campaign that Trump was not a target of investigation. How that represents an affront to American democracy is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nThe memo does seem to have uncovered conflicts of interest at the Justice Department, most seriously by then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, whose wife was working for Fusion GPS (and thus, by extension, the Clinton campaign) on opposition research on Trump. The memo also claims this relationship was not disclosed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when the Justice Department applied for a surveillance warrant on Page.", "title": "Opinion | Devin Nunes\u2019s Nothingburger", "authors": []}

His message is worth remembering in our current political moment.\n\nIn elaborate and thoughtful prose, Washington raised red flags about disunity, false patriotism, special interests, extreme partisanship, fake news, the national debt, foreign alliances and foreign hatreds. With uncanny foresight, he warned that the most serious threat to our democracy might come from disunity within the country rather than interference from outside. And he foresaw the possibility of foreign influence over our political system and the rise of a president whose ego and avarice would transcend the national interest, raising the threat of despotism.\n\nWashington certainly had great confidence, but in his address he didn\u2019t brag about his accomplishments. On the contrary, he beseeched the Almighty to soften the impact of his errors and expressed hopes that the country would forgive them. He established a standard for presidential self-deprecation out of the fear that a president of grossly inflated ego could become a threat to democracy.\n\nHe cautioned against both overly friendly alliances (lest another country\u2019s interests and wars become our own) and excessive hatreds (lest we provoke unnecessary conflict and war with others). Forbearance in the use of power was another of his major themes. \u201cA free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another,\u201d he declared. Such encroachment, he said, would lead to the consolidation of power and create \u201ca real despotism.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Did George Washington Predict Donald Trump?", "authors": []}

Will it become, as some on social media have suggested, the black \u201cStar Wars,\u201d with spinoff movies and TV shows that further explore the movie\u2019s mythology and cast of characters?\n\n[ Wondering what\u2019s new to stream on Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime this month? Let us help you find the best movies and TV shows. ]\n\nThe #BlackExcellence of it all\n\nPhoto\n\nLet\u2019s state the obvious: This movie is very black, possessing a broad-spectrum, Pan-African blackness. There are many small moments that spoke directly to the African-American audience (did your theater erupt when Shuri re-enacted the \u201cWhat are those?!\u201d meme? Or when she and T\u2019Challa shared that secret handshake?) and still others, like T\u2019Challa\u2019s sandals and the dancing at Warrior Falls, that felt recognizably African. But perhaps the bigger achievement of the movie is just how natural this all felt. It\u2019s an argument for the difference a black director and crew can make on a blockbuster. What small moments or cultural references stood out to you?\n\nEverybody loves Shuri\n\nPhoto\n\nT\u2019Challa\u2019s little sister Shuri \u2014 an irreverent tech prodigy who\u2019s part Q from the James Bond movies and part Penny from \u201cInspector Gadget\u201d \u2014 arguably steals the movie. It should be a star-making performance for Letitia Wright (she previously appeared in the most recent season of \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d in the episode \u201cBlack Museum\u201d). In the comics, Shuri eventually succeeds T\u2019Challa as Black Panther. Might she get her own spinoff movie? Or a teen-oriented cartoon show? At the very least, expect her to play a prominent role in the inevitable sequel.\n\nThe Dora Milaje and Wakanda\u2019s women\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s not just the portrayal of the African diaspora in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d that pushes boundaries, it\u2019s that of the women. This is the rare superhero movie that doesn\u2019t treat the female characters like ornaments or seasoning and even passes the Bechdel test.\n\nWhat did you make of Okoye (Danai Gurira of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d) and her all-female fighting squad? Okoye\u2019s wig-throwing and car-surfing-in-a-red-dress scenes in South Korea were among the film\u2019s most indelible. But was her romance with W\u2019Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) believable? Was it necessary?\n\nHello Winston Duke!\n\nPhoto\n\nM\u2019Baku, the chief of the renegade mountain tribe, starts out as a third-tier villain in the movie but ends up being unexpectedly heroic and pivotal to the plot.

If there\u2019s any justice in the world, he\u2019ll be starring in a rom-com next year.\n\nKillmonger\u2019s motivation\n\nPhoto\n\nA character that several critics have called the most compelling Marvel villain to date, Erik Killmonger is a unique and thoroughly American revolutionary. His bloodthirsty vision (of sweet revenge for centuries of oppression visited upon African-descended peoples around the world) is provocative because, viewed from the right angle, it offers a convincing approximation of justice.\n\nWas his primary critique of Wakanda \u2014 that it has selfishly shirked its responsibilities to other African nations and the diaspora \u2014 ultimately correct? Or was T\u2019Challa right that isolation to the point of invisibility was the only way to ensure that Wakanda never met the fate of its subjugated sister nations? Killmonger\u2019s final line \u2014 \u201cBury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, because they knew death was better than bondage\u201d \u2014 is among the film\u2019s most trenchant, and one of the hardest to believe actually exists in a Marvel movie.\n\nThe white characters\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a film almost entirely populated by black faces, the two main white characters \u2014 one a marauding thief (Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue), the other an intermittently useful ally (Martin Freeman as CIA agent Everett Ross) \u2014 are a study in contrasts. Ross, the butt of several jokes in the movie (Shuri taunts him as a \u201ccolonizer\u201d), exists as a kind of corrective to the \u201cwhite savior\u201d characters that are standard in earlier Western films about Africans. What did you think of the character and how did your theater react to the jokes at his expense?\n\nPost-credit politics\n\nPhoto\n\nTo the politically minded, the Wakanda of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d offers an almost too perfect rebuttal to President Trump\u2019s comments in January in which he referred to African nations with a disparaging expletive. (Of course, the film was completed well before those comments were made.)\n\nIn the first of two post-credit sequences, T\u2019Challa addresses the United Nations with a speech that includes this line: \u201cThe wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.\u201d Is that a pointed reference to the proposed border wall? Or just an apropos aphorism for Wakanda\u2019s climactic embrace of internationalist foreign policy?\n\nLet us hear your Wakandan war cries about all the things we called out above (and anything we did not) in the comments section.", "title": "Did You Watch \u2018Black Panther\u2019?

It\u2019s not very complicated, either.\n\nStudy after study \u2014 as well as common sense \u2014 suggests that most people should eat a varied diet, heavy on vegetables, fruits, whole grains and proteins. They should minimize the amount of processed food and added sugars. Most Americans would benefit by cutting back on sugars and junk food.\n\nIf you follow this advice, you don\u2019t need to worry so much about the amount you eat, because it\u2019s difficult to overeat most natural foods. When you\u2019re eating, say, a salad, fish, whole-grain garlic bread and an apple, you\u2019ll tend to stop eating when you\u2019ve consumed a healthy number of calories. You will be full. When you\u2019re eating, say, fried chicken and ice cream, you won\u2019t naturally stop (unless you have a lot more self-control than I do).\n\nThere is no need to follow every twist and turn in food research, as if the expert consensus were frequently changing.

The French service, a historical example of excellence, has made significant progress in addressing the lack of diversity in its ranks, but a majority of its most senior diplomats remain white men.\n\nThe United States Foreign Service is under assault by the Trump administration, which is driving out dozens of its members and seeking to cut about a third of its budget, resulting in the lowest morale in recent history. The British Foreign Office neglected formal training for its diplomats for decades; it finally established a dedicated center in 2015, but it hasn\u2019t instituted mandatory professional development.\n\nWith all the history and professionalism of Western European diplomatic services, why were those countries so shocked by and unprepared for the influx of refugees in 2015? Being intimately familiar with conditions, events and trends in foreign countries is an essential part of a diplomat\u2019s job. Most refugees came from conflict zones. Good diplomats should have anticipated those developments and prepared policy analyses and recommendations for their leaders back home.\n\nAnd why has it been so difficult for the West to exert meaningful influence with Turkey, a NATO member, to prevent what Western officials view as destabilizing actions, such as its current attack on Syrian Kurds? There are certainly many reasons, but insufficient diplomatic skill and creativity are part of the problem.\n\nChronic underfunding is also crippling the diplomatic services of rising powers, including those of India and Brazil, which are grossly overextended. India, for example, is struggling to run more than 160 missions with 600 diplomats.\n\nEven China has failed to make a sufficient investment in diplomacy, choosing instead to focus almost exclusively on its military, whose budget is almost 20 times bigger than what it spends on foreign affairs. Not surprisingly, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has much less clout in policymaking than its counterparts in other countries.\n\nBut most countries do not have proper professional diplomatic services, particularly in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, and even in some parts of Europe and Asia. True, they do have civil servants in their ministries of foreign affairs, some of whom are sent to work in embassies and consulates from time to time. Many of these officials have degrees in international affairs or a related field, and that\u2019s enough for many governments to assume that they can excel in diplomacy.\n\nSome countries offer only initial training to new recruits, and it tends to focus on area studies, such as the politics and economics of geographic regions, as well as foreign languages. Others put a big emphasis on humanities courses, forgetting that the ability to converse at cocktail parties is not as important today as it was in previous decades \u2014 and that there are plenty of other places to get that knowledge.", "title": "Opinion | Diplomats Are Made, Not Born", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThese days, plant-based beauty products are de rigueur Stateside. But the roots of many natural skin care solutions can be traced to Europe, where alternative medicine practitioners have been bottling botanical tinctures and homeopathic remedies for centuries. Take, for example, Rudolf Steiner \u2014 the Austrian scientist and philosopher launched his Weleda skin care range in the 1920s using flowers, herbs and other extracts cultivated on biodynamic farms. Or the Vienna-born chemist Rudolf Hauschka, who took inspiration from the rhythms of nature when co-creating his Dr. Hauschka line of essential-oil-spiked elixirs in 1967 \u2014 long before self-care Sundays were a thing.\n\nNow, a new guard of European scientists and skin experts is combining an old-world respect for nature with the latest advancements in chemistry to perfect the skin. Newly arriving in the U.S. this month: The Cream and The Cream Rich ($265 each) from Augustinus Bader, a German university professor who has spent the last three decades working as a specialist in the field of regenerative medicine. In 2007, Bader developed a breakthrough hydrogel that eliminates the need for skin grafts in some burn patients (just one of the 200-plus patents he holds). Tapping into similar self-healing technology, his creams contain a complex of amino acids, vitamins and compounds that mimic those naturally found in the skin and help minimize everything from fine lines to redness to dark spots. \u201cIt takes skin care to the next level; it\u2019s about achieving skin health through physiologic and innate ways,\u201d Bader says. The collection is also boosted with evening primrose, avocado and argan oils \u2014 and it gives back. Part of the proceeds from the range will fund the Augustinus Bader Foundation, which provides free hydrogel treatments to clinics that treat burn victims.\n\nGerman orthopedic surgeon Barbara Sturm, M.D., meanwhile, spent the early years of her medical training on the slopes, analyzing how professional skiers recover from injury and trauma. She discovered that quelling inflammation is the key to physical longevity, a theory that applies to the entire body \u2014 especially the skin. Inspired by this finding, she opened her first aesthetic clinic in D\u00fcsseldorf in 2004. Among her more experimental offerings is MC1, a bespoke anti-aging cream infused with patients\u2019 own plasma (and for this, there is a lengthy waitlist). Next came a ready-made range of cleansers, creams and masks that aim to enhance youthfulness via fresh doses of purslane. The plant, says Dr. Sturm, has \u201cpotent anti-inflammatory, wound-healing and nutritive properties,\u201d and also \u201cextends cell life.\u201d It\u2019s pumped into all of her products, along with lab-derived actives like the hydrating long- and short-chain hyaluronic acids in her popular plumping serum Ampoules ($215), and the nontoxic UV filters in her Sun Drops ($145, currently sold out until spring). Her newest innovation: Anti-Pollution Drops, made with \u201can interesting new compound produced by marine microbes,\u201d Dr. Sturm says. \u201cIt\u2019s able to directly combat the effects of environmental pollution on the skin surface.\u201d\n\nOther complexion concerns \u2014 from stubborn acne to dullness \u2014 require looking beneath the surface, says Nigma Talib, a London-based naturopathic doctor. After suffering from eczema and digestive issues as a child, Dr. Talib eventually tried botanical supplements to balance her system rather than steroid creams and antacids. \u201cIn three to six months, I was 100 percent better,\u201d she says. \u201cI decided this was the type of doctor I wanted to be \u2014 one that looks at the root cause of illness.\u201d Now, she\u2019s leveraging her 18 years of experience to create holistic products that improve skin from the inside out: her Healthy Flora ($65) supplement contains probiotics and grapeseed oil to fight oxidative damage while her Hydrating and Plumping Serum No. 1 ($205) uses plant stem cells and light-water technology. \u201cMost creams and serums are mainly made up of water,\u201d Dr. Talib explains. \u201cBut we remove the heavy isotopes from the water molecule.\u201d It\u2019s a process that allows the ingredients to deeply penetrate the skin for more effective results, she says.\n\nFor most Europeans, the goal of skincare is natural-looking results, says Munich-based dermatologist Timm Golueke, M.D., who created his Royal Fern line to nurture skin by noninvasive means. Its star ingredient \u2014 Scottish fern \u2014 might be able to protect cellular DNA from the harmful effects of UV exposure, a detail Dr. Golueke uncovered in his reading of medical literature. He adds other botanicals to his products \u2014 including wild rose blossoms and sea buckthorn \u2014 to form an encapsulated complex that promises to deliver hydration, fight hyperpigmentation and soften fine lines gradually over time. In a nod to German efficiency, all of the formulas are multitasking: the Phytoactive Anti-Aging Serum ($295) and Phytoactive Anti-Aging Cream ($250), for example, are designed to firm, brighten and nourish. Such no-fuss solutions mesh well with the broader European perspective on aging, which hasn\u2019t changed much over time.

For someone with light skin in a temperate climate at midday, \u201c10 minutes a day of exposure to 10 percent of your body\u2019s surface area, such as your arms and face, will give you what you need,\u201d said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, director of the Bone Metabolism Lab at the USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University. Closer to the Equator, even less time is required.\n\nThat\u2019s a rough estimate, though, and many factors can interfere with vitamin D synthesis. People with darker skin need two to three times the sun exposure to make the same amount of vitamin D, and synthesis also declines with age, Dr. Dawson-Hughes said. Environmental factors like clouds, ozone and air pollution can likewise decrease vitamin D production, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile a little sun exposure can be good for vitamin D status, too much can increase the risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Jean Y. Tang, associate professor of dermatology at Stanford University. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it in a very safe way, where you get enough sun to make the vitamin D, but not so much sun that you cause erythema, or redness, and a sunburn,\u201d she said.", "title": "Do I Get Enough Vitamin D in the Winter?", "authors": ["Alice Callahan", "Ask Well"]}

It won\u2019t. Face-lifts simply don\u2019t do that. You may see your mother in the mirror, but you\u2019re gazing at your own face. This is how you look at 50. Like many women, you don\u2019t like what you see not because there\u2019s anything wrong with your appearance, but because we live in a culture that holds a relentlessly narrow view of female beauty while placing the utmost importance on it. Though I don\u2019t judge people who opt to surgically alter their faces for the reason you cite, I can\u2019t deny that I find it pretty sad. It\u2019s a decision born of shame and self-loathing, and it\u2019s one that could only be made in a culture that degrades women. What if, instead of changing the face the world sees, you change the way you see your face in the world? What if, instead of risking your life (and you would be risking that) to look 10 years younger, you risked standing strong against the sexism and ageism 50-year-old women endure because they are female and 50?\n\nSA: I agree with Cheryl that cosmetic surgery has a certain air of Dorian Grayish sorrow about it. But I\u2019m not sure that \u201cstanding strong against sexism and ageism\u201d alone will address what you feel when you look in the mirror, Mini Mom. Your struggle also resides in standing strong against your mother, and the looming shadow of her cruel behavior. It\u2019s worth noting that her verbal abuse toward you is almost certainly displaced self-loathing. Don\u2019t fall into the same trap. Your job is to figure out how to love and accept yourself. That, I suspect, is what will make you feel truly distinct from your mother.\n\nCS: On the contrary, I think standing strong against sexism and ageism is the only thing that will eventually allow you to feel O.K. in your skin, Mini Mom. A face-lift is a temporary fix for something you\u2019ll have for the rest of your life: an aging face. Having surgery will allow you to feel better about your appearance only until you age more and feel miserable about how you look again. Changing your perspective about what your \u201ccute self\u201d looks like is a mental shift that will be with you forever. You\u2019ve already done important work of this nature when you learned how to give your abusive mother less access to you \u2014 and therefore less power over you. I\u2019m suggesting you do the same with our society\u2019s beauty standards.\n\nSA: Cosmetically speaking, there are less radical ways of altering your appearance so you don\u2019t look \u201cjust like\u201d your mom (i.e. hairstyle, makeup, clothing). But ultimately, the goal should be to accept that, however you look, you are distinct from your mother. As much as I applaud Cheryl\u2019s firmer stance here, I tend to see the line between cosmetic measures that trigger personal empowerment, and those that arise from cultural judgment, as subjective and awfully blurry. Some women feel better about themselves if they wear makeup, or lose weight, or shave their legs \u2014 even though they do those things, at least partly, in response to an internalized (patriarchal) set of ideas about what makes women desirable. Rather than judging what they want to do, I\u2019m more interested in why.\n\nCS: I\u2019m 49. I know your struggle, Mini Mom, because it\u2019s also mine. I\u2019m entirely aware that it\u2019s a lot harder to alter your mind than it is to alter your face, and unlike surgery, it\u2019s not something that will happen in a day. But with intention and effort, coming to accept \u2014 and even love \u2014 your body is possible. A face-lift won\u2019t obliterate the fears you have about your beauty as you age, but seeing beauty in a new way will. The best way out of a hole isn\u2019t to dig deeper.

He treated me as an honored guest and brought me to the village where he grew up. I thought of him almost as a brother.

In 2002, the political scientists Robert S. Erikson, Michael B. Mackuen and James A. Stimson found that more than half of the variance in a president\u2019s approval ratings could be explained by either the performance of the national economy or by big events like international crises, assassination attempts and scandals \u2014 factors over which a president may not exert much influence at all. Jimmy Carter gained 20 points when Iranian student demonstrators occupied the United States Embassy in Tehran. Ronald Reagan picked up seven after being shot.\n\nNone of this has dissuaded presidents from trying to influence their own approval ratings. Reagan was the first to bring a public-opinion expert, Richard Wirthlin, onto the White House team. Wirthlin\u2019s firm went on to test public opinion for George H.W. Bush in the lead-up to the Persian Gulf war; Dick Cheney, at the time Bush\u2019s defense secretary, would later grumble in his memoirs that Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \u201cseemed more comfortable talking about poll numbers than he was recommending military options.\u201d As the war approached its conclusion, crowds of supporters were ushered onto the White House lawn with signs trumpeting Bush\u2019s approval rating: \u201cWE \u2665 GEORGE \u2014 91%.\u201d\n\nThe war crystallized fears of what the political scientists Paul Brace and Barbara Hinckley described, in the 1992 book \u201cFollow the Leader,\u201d as \u201ca public-relations presidency: a pattern of action in the White House that gives high priority to public support.\u201d (The idea had enough popular credence in the 1990s to serve as the premise for the 1997 film \u201cWag the Dog,\u201d in which an administration fakes an entire war to rally the masses.) There was, Brace and Hinckley warned, a tension between a genuinely successful presidency and a momentarily popular one \u2014 \u201can uneasy balance at best between being liked and being president.\u201d\n\nTrump might seem like the logical conclusion of the public-relations presidency, but he complicates the idea at least as much as he confirms it. For someone who cares so singularly about approval, he almost never pursues it in any rational fashion; he routinely does the opposite of what a majority of the electorate claims to want, from leaving the Affordable Care Act alone to logging out of his Twitter account. And Trump\u2019s low approval numbers, which could easily have been a death sentence for another president\u2019s agenda, have not much impeded his legislative progress. Taking stock of this, a recent Politico headline asked, \u201cHas Trump made approval polls meaningless?\u201d\n\nA more plausible explanation is that the diminished meaning of political approval is what made Trump. Partisanship has always factored heavily into presidential approval, but in recent decades it has come to eclipse all other variables in Gallup\u2019s data. The last president to hold more than 40 percent approval from opposition-party voters in the early days of his presidency was George H.W. Bush. In his first three months in office, Trump received the lowest-ever approval rating among opposition-party voters (9 percent) and the third-highest-ever among his own partisans (87 percent). In a Huffington Post poll in April, 40 percent of respondents \u2014 63 percent of those who disapproved of Trump and 24 percent of those who approved of him \u2014 said there was almost nothing Trump could do to change their minds about him.\n\nThis question becomes less and less hypothetical every time Trump barrels through another taboo that previously bound the modern American presidency: firing an F.B.I. director who was investigating him, hesitating to censure white supremacists, casually accusing his critics of treason. Trump sees an approval rating maddeningly stuck around 40 percent, while most of the country \u2014 57 percent of it, if you credit Gallup \u2014 wonders: Really, still 40 percent?

His Treasury Department in December released a one-page analysis that made outlandish economic assumptions to justify giant tax cuts for corporations and wealthy families. Republican lawmakers in Congress went even further, attacking the Congressional Budget Office and Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on Taxation, both nonpartisan, because those analysts had the temerity to warn that the tax law would add to the federal deficit.\n\nMr. Trump wants everyone to know that his election delivered a booster shot to the economy and stocks. \u201cThe reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,\u201d he told reporters in November.

The tax law and a push by the Trump administration to increase military spending will reduce federal revenue and force the Treasury to borrow more money when the economy is close to full employment.

This is the 164th most popular song among men who are now 38 years old. But it is not in the top 300 for the cohort born 10 years earlier or 10 years later. Note that the men who most like \u201cCreep\u201d now were roughly 14 when the song came out in 1993. In fact, this is a consistent pattern. I did a similar analysis with every song that topped the Billboard charts from 1960 to 2000. In particular, I measured how old their biggest fans today were when these songs first came out. It turns out that the \u201cCreep\u201d situation is pretty much universal. Songs that came out decades earlier are now, on average, most popular among men who were 14 when they were first released. The most important period for men in forming their adult tastes were the ages 13 to 16. What about women? On average, their favorite songs came out when they were 13. The most important period for women were the ages 11 to 14. Granted, some results of my research are not surprising. One of the facts I discovered is that Coolio\u2019s \u201cGangsta\u2019s Paradise\u201d is extremely unpopular among women in their 70s. Thank you, Big Data, for uncovering that nugget of wisdom!

Yet he speaks about his game very confidently, saying things like, \u201cFor me, the golf swing is clearing the hips, getting them out of the way.\u201d I played golf in college and hip clearance never once came up. It\u2019s kind of like if Tom Brady said he throws the football well because he flicks his wrist right at the end.\n\nThe most confusing aspect of President Trump as golfer is that golf is the ultimate test of integrity and humility. There are no referees, so it\u2019s on you to count your own strokes. Golfers develop a very strict honor code and a moral obligation to themselves and their playing partners to be 100 percent honest.

It plans to accomplish this, in large part, by giving low-income families boxes of pasta, cereal and other nonperishable foods, rather than giving them the full amount of their benefit on electronic cards, as the SNAP program works today. Those cards can be used at about 260,000 retail stores and farmers\u2019 markets nationwide to buy a wide range of fresh and packaged food, allowing recipients to shop with their families\u2019 preferences and dietary needs in mind.\n\nThe administration argues that its proposal, which also would make it harder for adults living without children or other dependents to benefit from the program if they aren\u2019t employed, is \u201cdesigned to improve nutrition and target benefits to those who need them, while ensuring careful stewardship of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. Trump and his aides actually cared about improving nutrition and the lives of low-income Americans, they would be trying to put more money into SNAP, not less. The program has done a heroic job of reducing poverty and improving the lives of millions of people. Studies have found that the program\u2019s beneficiaries are less likely to report not having enough to eat.

The list is short and uninspiring. In October, Mr. Trump declared the epidemic of opioid abuse a national emergency, which could be a good step toward addressing it \u2014 but he\u2019s since done almost nothing to combat a crisis that killed more than 64,000 Americans in 2016.\n\nIn his State of the Union address last month, Mr. Trump promised to \u201cembark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.\u201d It\u2019s great if he really means that, but it\u2019s hard to square his assurance with his own attorney general\u2019s opposition to a bill that includes recidivism-reduction programs intended to achieve precisely this goal.\n\nPerhaps the most insidious part of the Trump administration\u2019s approach to criminal justice lies in its efforts to link crime to its broader crackdown on immigration. In a speech last month, Mr. Sessions said undocumented immigrants are far more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, a claim he found in a paper by John Lott, the disreputable economist best known for misusing statistics to suit his own ideological ends. In this case, it appears Mr. Lott misread his own data, which came from Arizona and in fact showed the opposite of what he claimed: Undocumented immigrants commit fewer crimes than citizens, as the vast majority of research on the topic has found.\n\nBut no matter; Mr. Trump and Mr. Sessions don\u2019t need facts to run their anti-immigrant agenda, which has already resulted in more than double the number of arrests of immigrants with no criminal convictions as in 2016, as the Brennan Center report noted. Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order cutting off federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials. A federal judge blocked the order in November for violating the Constitution.\n\nThe rhetoric from the White House and the Justice Department has emboldened some state and local officials to talk tougher, even if just as ignorantly, about crime. The good news is that it\u2019s not working as well anymore. In Virginia\u2019s race for governor last fall, the Republican candidate, Ed Gillespie, attacked his opponent, Ralph Northam, with ads blaming him for violence by the MS-13 gang.\n\nIt was a despicable stunt, its fearmongering recalling the racist but effective Willie Horton ad that George H. W. Bush ran on in his successful 1988 presidential campaign. Thankfully, Virginia\u2019s voters overwhelmingly rejected Mr. Gillespie, another sign that criminal justice reform is an issue with strong support across the political spectrum. In the era of Donald Trump, candidates of both parties should be proud to run as reformers \u2014 but particularly Democrats, who can cast the issue not only as a central component of a broader progressive agenda, but as yet another example of just how out of touch with the country Mr. Trump and his administration are.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump and the Undoing of Justice Reform", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "The proposal would raise military spending by 14.1 percent while cutting funding for the State Department \u2014 the agency that has a mandate to resolve problems without going to war \u2014 by 26.9 percent. It would cut the Department of Health and Human Services by 20.3 percent and the Department of Education by 10.5 percent. It calls for (yet again) the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and proposes cutting food stamps by $213 billion, or around 30 percent, over 10 years. Medicare and Medicaid, which benefit one-third of Americans, are targeted for cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nIf Congress adopted Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal, millions of people would stand to lose health insurance, subsidized food, low-cost housing and other benefits. The result would be to greatly increase poverty and hunger in America.\n\nThis is surely not what most of Mr. Trump\u2019s working-class supporters imagined during the primary and general election campaigns. In May 2015, Candidate Trump tweeted, \u201cI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid.\u201d And in an April 2016 ad that ran in Pennsylvania he promised to \u201csave Social Security and Medicare without cuts.\u201d\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Another of Mr. Trump\u2019s promises was to build the \u201cgleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways all across our land,\u201d a promise that he referred to as recently as his State of the Union address in January. Yet his budget recommends slashing funding for Amtrak and grant programs that help local and state governments pay for highway and transit projects. Over all, the administration wants to reduce the Department of Transportation\u2019s budget by nearly a fifth. The budget would also effectively cut the Highway Trust Fund by $122 billion over a decade.\n\nNo doubt Mr. Trump will claim he is still serious about infrastructure by pointing to a separate infrastructure proposal he announced on Monday. In that document, the administration says it will bolster investment by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. But the math simply doesn\u2019t add up. The White House suggests that the federal government would put up only $200 billion, which would be enough to get state and local governments and the private sector to supply the rest of the money. But where would most cities and states find those funds? Already strapped, many will struggle to raise new tax revenue, because the Republican tax law limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. The private sector might be interested, but only in projects like toll roads that produce a steady and rich source of income.\n\nIt will be tempting for some to dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s budget as a marketing stunt by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who was earlier a Tea Party zealot in Congress. After all, Congress last week passed, and Mr. Trump signed, a two-year bipartisan budget that authorizes a significant increase in domestic, as well as military, spending.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump\u2019s Nasty Budget", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "Now the final decision on whether to block the memo from becoming public lies with the White House. The F.B.I., which has reviewed it, issued a rare public warning against its release, citing \u201cgrave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\u201d Nevertheless, reports on Thursday indicated that Trump had decided to allow the memo\u2019s disclosure.\n\nAll this drama might make you think that the memo\u2019s claims are scandalous. But part of what\u2019s so weird and disorientating about this whole episode is that, in a normal political environment, no Republican would want to draw attention to the F.B.I.\u2019s reasons for surveilling Page. As The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, Page has been on the radar of counterintelligence agents since at least 2013. A 2015 criminal complaint against two suspected Russian spies, Victor Podobnyy and Igor Sporyshev, cited an intercepted conversation about their efforts to recruit a man \u201cworking as a consultant in New York City.\u201d Page has acknowledged that he was the man they were referring to, and admitted to passing documents to the Russians.\n\nAccording to CNN, Page was the subject of a secret intelligence surveillance warrant in 2014, well before the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Despite this, Trump identified Page as one of his key foreign policy advisers in March 2016. Later that year, the F.B.I. received a new secret warrant to monitor Page\u2019s communications after he traveled to Russia, where he met with multiple Russian government officials.\n\nThanks to reporting on the memo, we know that Rosenstein, a Trump appointee, saw fit to apply for this warrant\u2019s renewal. This suggests that one of the most senior figures in Trump\u2019s own Justice Department thought it was credible that Trump had someone on his campaign who had been compromised by Russia. Only in a crazy alternate universe does that exculpate the president.\n\nUnless, that is, you believe that it is illegitimate for intelligence agencies to be watching Trump associates. And to believe that, you have to start with the premise that Trump is innocent and the agencies are corrupt. The controversy around the Nunes memo works to insinuate these assumptions into the public debate. It may also give Trump the very thinnest of pretexts to fire Rosenstein, which would be a first step toward attempting to shut down the Russia investigation.\n\nIf and when it\u2019s released, the Nunes memo will probably only vindicate Trump among people who already share right-wing assumptions. But it will put the F.B.I. in a difficult position, since to defend itself against accusations that it relied solely on Steele\u2019s findings to get a warrant on Page, it would have to release additional classified evidence. (CBS News reported on Thursday that, if the memo is released, the F.B.I. is prepared to issue a rebuttal.)\n\nTo some commentators, it is ironic that liberals are now defending the F.B.I., long a left-wing b\u00eate noire. But liberals recognized the dangers of the campaign to broadly discredit the mainstream media even though they had their own passionate criticisms of it. The right\u2019s war on the F.B.I. is a sign of how far some are willing to go to subvert any checks on Trump\u2019s power to create his own reality.\n\n\u201cI think the most disappointing realization for me of the past year was not how bad of a president Trump turned out to be \u2014 that was foreseeable \u2014 but how unwilling members of Congress would be to stand up and defend our system of government,\u201d Schiff told me. The most dangerous thing about the release of the Nunes memo is not the memo itself, but Republicans\u2019 shamelessness in using national security processes to deceive the people they\u2019re supposed to serve.", "title": "Opinion | Don\u2019t Believe the Liberal F.B.I.", "authors": []}

The police recommend that he be charged on multiple counts of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Fresh charges may yet be brought in additional investigations. A former top aide to Netanyahu agreed this week to serve as a witness against him. Press reports suggest a man clinging to power.\n\nDon\u2019t be so sure. If an election were held tomorrow, Bibi \u2014 as Netanyahu is universally known in Israel \u2014 and his Likud party would likely win, according to recent polls. Roughly half of Israelis think the prime minister should quit, but that\u2019s down from 60 percent in December. Netanyahu has no intention of resigning, even if the attorney general chooses to indict him. The Likud rank-and-file remain loyal to their leader. His coalition partners may detest him, but for now they see greater political advantage in a wounded prime minister than in a fresh one.\n\nBesides, Bibi has been, for Israelis, a pretty good prime minister. Some indicators:\n\nEconomy: Since Netanyahu returned to power in 2009, the economy has grown by nearly 30 percent in constant dollars \u2014 nearly twice the growth rate of Germany or the United States. Some 3.6 million tourists visited Israel in 2017, a record for the Jewish state. On Monday, Israel announced a $15 billion dollar deal to export natural gas to Egypt from its huge offshore fields.\n\nDiplomacy: Netanyahu\u2019s personal ties to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are exceptionally close, as they are with Japan\u2019s Shinzo Abe. Israel\u2019s relations with African countries and the Arab world are the best they\u2019ve been in decades; reaction in Riyadh and Cairo to the Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem amounted to a shrug.

We stopped leading the effort to combat climate change. We stopped leading on trade and commerce, and raised questions about our continued commitment to multilateral organizations and military alliances. We stopped leading on human rights and the rule of law. If we fail to continue funding the International Space Station, America will sacrifice its rank as the global leader in space exploration and commercial space innovation.\n\nNASA programs have benefited the people of our planet since the founding of the agency in 1958.

Much more than any other country, in fact. Funding scientific research is one of the most productive ways to put taxpayers\u2019 dollars to work. It not only creates jobs but also creates industries that otherwise would never exist. It\u2019s easy to see how a dollar spent on our space program is returned to the taxpayer many times over.\n\nBudgeting is about making tough choices, but to abandon one of our most successful and innovative endeavors \u2014 one in which we are the global leader \u2014 just as it is clearly transitioning to a hub of commercial activity would be extremely shortsighted.\n\nOther countries will undoubtedly fill the void left by American withdrawal \u2014 most notably China and Russia, countries we consider significant rivals. Not only would they reap the economic and political benefits of leading in space but they also could change the direction of the world\u2019s collective space endeavors in a way inimical to American interests and values.\n\nIf we want our nation to continue leading in space, fully funding NASA\u2019s existing programs is absolutely essential. And if we want to some day send astronauts back to the moon or to Mars, we need to fund those efforts as well.

Varietal is not a noun, it is an adjective. One may properly refer to a \u201cvarietal wine,\u201d like a cabernet sauvignon or a chardonnay, in which the wine is made with a dominant grape variety.\n\nThis distinction pertains directly to our most recent topic, California grenache, in which we had one varietal wine, made entirely out of grenache, and two blends, in which grenache was one of several varieties in the wine.\n\nHere at Wine School, we try not to be sticklers, but we do feel compelled to be accurate, if not exact. This is difficult when considering the leeway that California offers in its labeling rules, which require that a varietal wine contain at least 75 percent of that particular grape. In other words, a wine can still bear the varietal label \u201cgrenache\u201d even if other grapes account for 25 percent. But if the blend includes less than 75 percent of grenache, it cannot be called by the name of the grape.\n\nBefore 1978, when that rule was enacted, a California wine could be called grenache or pinot noir if it contained just 50 percent of that grape.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "Congress is now considering long-overdue legislation that authorizes faster access to internationally stored electronic data needed to prosecute serious crime and disrupt terrorist plots in the United States, Britain and elsewhere. The legislation, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, would preserve law and order, advance the United States\u2019 leadership in cybersecurity, ease restrictions on American businesses and enhance privacy standards globally. This is a priority for both of our governments.\n\n\n\nAmerican efforts to investigate crime and terrorism are increasingly impeded by a lack of access to data stored outside the country, even when it is held by companies subject to United States jurisdiction. Britain and other allied foreign governments face similar problems. All too often, officials in one country investigating a serious crime with victims in that very same country cannot get data they need simply because it is on a server halfway across the world. The internet is moving fast, and our legal constructs are not keeping up. This leaves tech companies in the difficult position of having to withhold information that could protect public safety.\n\nTo make matters worse, a case at the United States Supreme Court could leave our governments and others with no effective way to obtain vital evidence of serious crimes. Oral arguments are scheduled for Feb. 27 in that case, which asks whether Microsoft may comply with a United States warrant to disclose information related to an American crime stored on a cloud server in Ireland. Microsoft argues that it cannot.\n\nFortunately, there is a legislative solution to this problem that advances a model that empowers law enforcement. The Republican senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Chris Coons of Delaware, and members of the House have proposed legislation that would clarify the legal authority of the United States to obtain data stored in another country, and would authorize special agreements to resolve potential conflicts of law.

If they offered mortgages with interest rates that did not change but had to pay different interest rates over time to depositors, there could be a money-losing mismatch. Better, then, to sell mortgages to investors who actually wanted to collect checks based on a fixed rate of interest over a long period of time. Plus, the lender could take the money from the sale and originate more mortgages.\n\nThose investors, as the eventual owners of the loan, turn out to have a lot of power here, even if you never interact with them as a borrower. And they care a lot about which company is servicing the mortgages they own \u2014 so much so that they may pay more or less for a basket of mortgage loans depending on whether a particular servicer is collecting the payments each month.\n\nGiven that, they are not so keen on people like me showing up and demanding permission to shop for a different servicer, which is why the Wells Fargo phone representative I spoke to this week told me that I was out of luck. Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, confirmed this. He also told me that the bank had in fact never sold my loan. Even so, in the world of mortgages there is no practical way for ownership (or simply servicing rights) to be sold or transferred on a one-off basis.\n\nBut just because we can\u2019t do it to them doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t do it to us. Servicers get tired of baskets of loans all the time for any number of reasons. At that point, they sell off the rights to collect payments. So it\u2019s entirely possible that the servicer on my mortgage will indeed change. I just won\u2019t get to have any say in it.\n\nCould the industry give borrowers more power? Sure, but experts contend that we wouldn\u2019t actually like it if they did. \u201cThe standardization of all of this is what allows rates to be low,\u201d said Sam Mischner, chief sales officer and head of mortgage for the online mortgage site LendingTree. \u201cThe more complexity you put into the system, the more the cost gets passed on.\u201d\n\nSo how much more would it cost to let people like me take a walk? Because servicers make money collecting mortgage payments, they\u2019d want something in exchange for losing the business \u2014 or merely for the possibility that it might happen frequently. Bob Walters, president and chief operating officer of Quicken Loans, estimated that mortgage rates might be as much as a quarter of a percentage point higher as a result.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt which point he tried to sell me a mortgage, since that\u2019s his job. Indeed, the easiest way out of my relationship with Wells Fargo is through refinancing. But the best deal Mr. Walters\u2019s salesman could offer was a loan that cost $300 per month more (albeit while ending in 20 years instead of our current 23-year countdown) and required $6,200 in closing costs.\n\nThis was not good news, since I had already promised my wife that we would not make a change unless it cost us nothing. (Even given that theoretical possibility, she had reservations. \u201cThis is the definition of a lovable quality of yours that also makes me crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s your desire to enlist in projects that we do not have time and bandwidth for, however noble, and your willingness to inflict pain on ourselves in order to inflict pain on some corporation that doesn\u2019t care.\u201d)\n\nYou, however, may fare better on refinance pricing depending on your current mortgage loan. If so, keep in mind that whoever originates your next mortgage could turn back around and sell the servicing rights, which means that even if you shed Wells Fargo in a refinance, it could end up back in your life each month once more. \u201cYou can talk to the lender and get a sense of whether they intend to retain the servicing,\u201d said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. \u201cThey will tell you that.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s Mr. Goyda, in an honorable gesture, offered to warn me away (if I did refinance) from lenders who might sell off the loan in a way that would cause me to end up with Wells again as my servicer. He also pointed to its website for examples of the bank\u2019s efforts to earn back trust. (As I\u2019ve written in the past, I\u2019d settle for Wells Fargo offering world-beating rates, rewards, products and services to prove that it is serious about winning over customers.)\n\nAt any rate, the numbers don\u2019t add up for my household, so we will stick with Wells Fargo for now. It isn\u2019t worth $6,200 and a hike in monthly payments to prove a point, even if we would pay off the loan three years early. And while I believe that consumer lock-in like this does help keep mortgage rates down, there ought to be some kind of morals clause in the loan contract. So if your servicer, say, fakes more than one million account openings, you can force it to pay closing costs on a refinance with a different company. I\u2019d love to send Wells Fargo a $6,200 bill from a competitor.\n\nIt was Wells that inspired my pique, but it is not alone in the frustrating way it holds on to customers. When students borrow money from the federal government, they generally get whomever they get on the servicing front. Your employer picks your 401(k) or 403(b) administrator, and you may get stuck with high fees and lousy investment choices. And let\u2019s not forget about Equifax and the other credit bureaus. Nobody asked to have personal data collected and exposed, let alone for the hassles that resulted from the big breach in that industry.\n\nBut this is just how things are, right? You can cut the cable cord with ease and choose mobile phone plans that don\u2019t lock you in for long, if at all. But when it comes to six-figure matters like your retirement and your home loan, making an escape will be costly at best and potentially impossible.", "title": "Don\u2019t Like Your Mortgage Servicer?

All five of this season\u2019s starters, including Allen, are projected as first-round picks, which would match Kentucky\u2019s record from 2010. The other four are freshmen.\n\nKrzyzewski\u2019s new way of doing business has also given rise to a new archetype: the Duke Senior \u2014 a kind of story Duke tells itself in order to keep being Duke. Allen is the unlikeliest and most intriguing Duke Senior so far.\n\nRecruiting one-and-done talents has a clear upside \u2014 it gets you the best players \u2014 and in 2015 it produced Krzyzewski\u2019s fifth national title. The downside is teams that take awhile to jell (sometimes longer than the season lasts) and, in the meantime, are susceptible to being exposed by lesser squads like the sub.-500 St. John\u2019s team that stunned the Blue Devils on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMaturity of the game, not just individually but collectively, is something we have to teach in a condensed period of time,\u201d Krzyzewski said.\n\nThe one-and-done model can also cause malaise among fans. Throughout college basketball, traditionalists complain about the increased prevalence of underclassmen, who not only betray their inexperience but rarely have time to forge a connection between fan and team. \u201cYou used to get the chance to know them,\u201d goes the common refrain. \u201cNow I don\u2019t even know half their names.\u201d\n\nDuke fans feel this grievance viscerally because Krzyzewski avoided recruiting one-and-dones longer than some other top coaches, and now does it better than any other.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of watching it,\u201d the longtime Washington Post sports columnist (and Duke graduate) John Feinstein tweeted after Saturday\u2019s game, referring to \u201cone-and-dones who pretty much only care about their draft position.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis development has not stopped Duke fans from being Duke fans.\n\n\u201cAny fan base, and it doesn\u2019t matter which, they\u2019ll rationalize whatever they\u2019re doing,\u201d said the ESPN analyst Jay Bilas, a former Krzyzewski player and assistant coach.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He may not be the team\u2019s best player \u2014 or even the third best \u2014 but his experience and wisdom, the argument goes, lend a necessary, if intangible, patina to the apprentices surrounding him.\n\nBefore the 2015 title run, Krzyzewski said \u201cour most valuable guy\u201d was the senior Quinn Cook, even though by objective measurements that honor belonged to one of the three freshmen who were selected in the first round of the N.B.A. draft that summer.\n\nLast season, as Duke won the Atlantic Coast Conference title primarily through the genius of the sophomore Luke Kennard (now of the Detroit Pistons) and the freshman Jayson Tatum (the Boston Celtics\u2019 likely rookie of the year), the Duke Seniors were Amile Jefferson and Matt Jones.\n\n\u201cHe does valuable things for us, or else we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here right now,\u201d Krzyzewski said of Jones, Duke\u2019s sixth-leading scorer, adding, \u201cThere are valuable things that only people who want to look deeper into it see.\u201d\n\nThis year, the Duke Senior is Allen. What is surprising is the plethora of roles he has already played.\n\nAs a freshman, he was the Blue Devils\u2019 inspirational story, a bench-warmer who came alive in the national title game to jump-start a come-from-behind victory. The next season, he was the budding star, the team\u2019s leading scorer. Next, he was the enfant terrible, suspended and stripped of his captaincy for maturity issues that included a predilection for kicking opponents.\n\nFor non-Duke fans he also filled another, time-tested role: the (white) Duke villain.\n\nThis season, Allen has been statistically peripheral. Duke\u2019s explosive offense revolves around three freshmen: Marvin Bagley III, who averages more than 21 points and 11 rebounds a game; Duval, the point guard; and Gary Trent Jr., the team\u2019s best shooter. (Duke\u2019s defense? The less said about that the better.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut by several accounts, Allen is genuinely his team\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cG is usually the one who gets us together, tells us what we need to do,\u201d Duval said. \u201cHe\u2019s been through it. This is his fourth year. He\u2019s been doing it for three years. He\u2019s seen it all, he knows the situations we\u2019re in, how we need to be.\u201d\n\nAllen has accepted this role. He said on Saturday that he saw his job as to \u201ckeep us together as a team, talk to all the guys, make sure we\u2019re all on the same page \u2014 the same page as Coach.\u201d\n\nAs for Krzyzewski, his frustration with his team\u2019s youth was explicit after the St. John\u2019s defeat. \u201cWe\u2019re really young,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung is more susceptible to inconsistency.\u201d\n\nBut those who wish Krzyzewski would stop recruiting one-and-dones \u2014 or believe he is sick of it \u2014 might want to take a look at next year\u2019s class. After Zion Williamson\u2019s commitment last month, Duke will have the top three players in the class of 2019.

But from a geological standpoint, all three occurred in the same general area \u2014 a so-called subduction zone, where one piece of the earth\u2019s crust, in this case the Cocos Plate, is slowly sliding under another, the North American.\n\nLike other subduction zones around the Pacific and elsewhere, this region is the source of many earthquakes, some of them very strong and destructive. The movement of the two plates relative to each other is very slow \u2014 about two to three inches a year \u2014 but it causes stresses to build, either at the boundary between the two plates or, as was the case with the September quakes, within one of them. At some point the stresses become too much and the rock formations slip, releasing energy as an earthquake.\n\nShortly after Friday\u2019s quake, the United States Geological Survey released a brief initial analysis, saying that it occurred \u201con or near\u201d the boundary between the two plates, and about 55 miles north of the Middle America Trench, where the Cocos begins its slide beneath the North America plate.\n\nIn addition to local destruction, strong Mexican earthquakes often cause damage in Mexico City \u2014 even if, as in this case, the capital is miles away. Mexico City was built on an ancient lake bed, and the sediments of sand and clay amplify the seismic waves as they arrive from the epicenter.\n\nDepending on the amount of energy released, the depth of the epicenter and its distance from Mexico City, the seismic waves from a quake can affect some buildings in the capital more than others. In the Sept. 19 quake, mostly shorter buildings were knocked down.

Going to sleep within two hours of eating dinner and snacking after dinner were also associated with obesity, but skipping breakfast was not.\n\nThe study, in BMJ Open, found an association, not a causal relationship.

Cramer \u2014 a producer of television shows including \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cThe Love Boat\u201d \u2014 asked the artist Ellsworth Kelly to design a free-standing structure on his vineyard near Santa Barbara, Calif. Cramer was a loyal collector of the artist, and wanted Kelly to make an original, large-scale artwork for his property. Kelly, who died in December 2015 at the age of 92 and whose career was defined by stripping painting and sculpture down to their elemental components of form and color, made designs for what appears from the outside to be a simple double-barrel-vaulted building, alluding to Romanesque and Cistercian religious architecture and resembling an igloo made of stucco. Inside, the artist had planned for a number of revelations. Colored-glass windows \u2014 arranged as a grid over the entrance, as a ring of tumbling squares on one side of the building, and a sunburst on the other \u2014 would bend the light in different ways. On the walls was Kelly\u2019s take on the stations of the cross \u2014 14 marble panels, variations on stark black-and-white abstractions. In the rear of this single-room structure, where one would expect to find the crucifix in a Christian church, would be one of Kelly\u2019s totem sculptures \u2014 a thin column standing over the interior like a sentinel. The project eventually fell through; Kelly kept two models of the structure in his studio, though he never really believed the chapel would be built.\n\nBut in an unlikely end to this story, the artist\u2019s building has now been constructed on the grounds of the Blanton Museum of Art, on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, almost exactly as he had envisioned it 30 years ago. Kelly planned the piece, \u201cAustin,\u201d which is 2,715 square feet with a 26-foot ceiling, in the final three years of his life with the help of Simone Jamille Wicha, the Blanton\u2019s director. (She was made aware of the project by Mickey and Jeanne Klein, who are collectors of Kelly\u2019s, alumni of the University of Texas and members of the museum\u2019s board.) Wicha helped raise the $23 million necessary for construction and the endowment, and sent renderings and sample materials \u2014 for everything from the glass panes to the granite floor to the limestone used for the building\u2019s exterior (changed from the original plan\u2019s stucco to better withstand the Texas climate) \u2014 to Kelly\u2019s home in upstate New York, where he approved every aesthetic decision. Construction began two months before his death.\n\n\u201cAustin,\u201d which opens to the public this month, is very much the culmination of Kelly\u2019s oeuvre, not just a summation of his work\u2019s themes but his masterpiece, the grandest exploration of pure color and form in a seven-decade career spent testing the boundaries of both. It is also the kind of ambitious fantasy that artists rarely get to execute, in the same category as Christo and Jean-Claude\u2019s 20-year attempt to suspend six miles of fabric panels over the Arkansas River (a project he abandoned last year) or Michael Heizer\u2019s colossal \u201cCity,\u201d a mile-and-a-half-long sculpture in the Nevada desert that the artist has been building since 1972 and which the public has never seen and perhaps never will. There are precedents for \u201cAustin\u201d \u2014 for instance, Donald Judd\u2019s sprawling Chinati Foundation complex, which he worked on from 1979 until his death in 1994 to showcase his large-scale artworks and those of his contemporaries in the desert of Marfa, Tex.; Barnett Newman\u2019s 14-part abstract painting cycle from 1958 to 1966 interpreting the stations of the cross; the Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence on the French Riviera, completed in 1951, which was designed by Henri Matisse and displays his work; and Le Corbusier\u2019s 1954 Notre-Dame du Haut, a Roman Catholic chapel in eastern France. But it\u2019s possible that no contemporary artwork of this scale by a major artist has matched its creator\u2019s initial ambitions so perfectly as Kelly\u2019s \u201cAustin.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nWHEN I VISITED Texas at the end of November to see the work, I was cautioned by various people that \u201cAustin\u201d is not, in any official sense, a chapel. The artist in fact turned down an offer to construct the work at a Catholic university because they asked that the building be consecrated, according to Kelly\u2019s partner of 32 years, Jack Shear, who described Kelly as \u201ca nonbeliever\u201d and \u201ca transcendental anarchist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s gonna be called a chapel whether anyone likes it or not,\u201d Shear told me. But, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s a chapel really dedicated to creativity. That\u2019s how I see it: It\u2019s a secular chapel.\u201d He compared this to the Rothko Chapel, the most inevitable analogue, a brick octagonal structure principally designed by the architect Philip Johnson, which features 14 moody, dark paintings by Rothko, who killed himself a year before the chapel opened in Houston, Tex.

In the early 19th century, the area was called Hall\u2019s Corners after a wealthy resident who bought the tavern. Elmsford adopted its current name around 1870, in recognition of a large elm tree that stood near a ford across the river, used as a landmark by George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\n\nOld-timers enunciate both syllables: Elms-ford. \u201cYou can tell who has grown up here,\u201d said Marilyn Catucci, a 74-year resident, \u201cby how they pronounce the name.\u201d", "title": "Elmsford, N.Y.: A Quiet Village Surrounded by Highways and Commerce", "authors": ["Susan Hodara", "Living In"]}

There are reasons to be skeptical that the companies will be able to make a big dent in their workers\u2019 health spending. But if the companies succeed, they will be harnessing the advantages and opportunities of a much maligned part of American health care.\n\nCompanies started offering health coverage broadly during World War II, when the government imposed wage controls. And the system was cemented when the Internal Revenue Service decided that health insurance was not subject to income taxes, making it a particularly valuable way for employers to improve compensation for their workers.\n\nCritics point to numerous problems with the system: It relies on company leaders to pick health insurance for all workers, even though C-suite executives might have preferences different from their lower-wage employees. It diminishes incentives to reduce costs, by insulating workers from the full price of their benefits. It discourages changes that could displease even a small number of workers, creating incentives to minimize disruption. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason for the employer to be doing this,\u201d said Fiona Scott Morton, a health economist at the Yale School of Management.\n\nBut the employer system also has points in its favor. For one, proponents note employers have multiple incentives to get health insurance right. They want their workers to be happy with their full slate of compensation \u2014 an employer that offered deceptive plans, for instance, might not hold onto good employees for long.

One such debate: Is it more important to sweep faster, with a higher stroke rate, or harder, with greater force applied to the ice? And what about body positioning? Do sweepers generate more power by holding the broom upright or at an angle?\n\nThese were the types of questions eating at Will Hamilton.\n\nHamilton was coaching a junior women\u2019s team six years ago and wanted to help his sweepers improve their technique. But he knew there was no clear way to assess how well they were actually doing. It was all guesswork.\n\nHamilton dreamed of producing data that could be used to solve some of those age-old curling debates. So he zeroed in on Flemming and Fowler, two friends with engineering degrees. Hamilton knew they liked to build stuff for fun. At the time, they were trying to invent a climate-controlled, water-cooled suit jacket.\n\nWhen Hamilton met with Flemming over beers one night, he pitched a new project: Was there a way to take a pedometer (to measure stroke rate) and a miniature bathroom scale (to measure force) and fuse them to a curling broom?\n\n\u201cSo Andrew looks at me like I\u2019m an idiot and says, \u2018No, you\u2019d use, like, four sensors and an accelerometer,\u2019 \u201d Hamilton recalled. \u201cBut I could tell that he thought it was interesting.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFlemming and Fowler were coming to realize that their climate-controlled suit jacket was not about to set the world on fire.

Hamilton took one for a spin down the ice, and the data was instantaneous \u2014 line graphs along with a slew of numbers that showed his force in pounds and his stroke rate in hertz. Hamilton also pointed to a figure that he described as his \u201csweeping performance index,\u201d or S.P.I., a metric that combines power and speed in one easy-to-digest figure.\n\nPatrick Janssen, a world-class curler from Canada, has consistently registered an S.P.I. in the 2,800 range. Fowler provided context.\n\n\u201cAs a Thursday night club curler, I\u2019d be happy to get 2,000,\u201d he said.\n\nThe numbers by themselves might not mean much, Flemming said, but subtle changes in technique can lead to big differences in the quality of each stroke. And now curlers have that information at their disposal. They can experiment to see which stroke works best for them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sometimes tough to convince an athlete that what they\u2019re doing is maybe not the best, because they feel like they\u2019re working really, really hard,\u201d Flemming said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s probably true that they\u2019re working really, really hard. But they might also be wasting a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nThe first SmartBroom was used by Canada before the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. But at the request of Curling Canada, the country\u2019s national curling federation, Hamilton and his partners agreed not to sell SmartBrooms to other consumers until after the Olympics. Fowler called it a \u201cpolite agreement\u201d rooted in relationships with Curling Canada officials.\n\nIn Sochi, the Canadian men and women swept gold.\n\nAhead of the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the gospel of the SmartBroom spread across the globe, and many of the teams competing in South Korea this month are acolytes.\n\nMatt Hamilton, the American curler, said he discovered that he was able to generate greater force by holding the broom more upright. Kennedy, the Canadian curler, said he learned that pressure was more important than stroke rate. So now he sacrifices speed for the sake of power.\n\n\u201cFor years,\u201d he said, \u201cwe thought it was the other way around.\u201d\n\nCurlers have also used the SmartBroom to assess their physical conditioning.

In Ohio, that will mean pursuing not only the governorship but also the offices of state auditor and secretary of state, both of which play a role in shaping legislative maps. In Wisconsin and Florida, Mr. Holder\u2019s group will help Democrats compete for the governorship and the State Senate majority.\n\nIn North Carolina, where there is a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, but Republicans have control of the legislature by vast margins, the redistricting committee hopes to shave seats off the current Republican supermajorities.\n\nMr. Holder said he would campaign aggressively himself in some of these races, beginning with an election for the Wisconsin Supreme Court this spring. Both he and Mr. Obama will focus heavily on mobilizing African-American voters, Mr. Holder said.\n\nThe strategy has the potential to inject a new volume of money, on the Democratic side, into typically low-profile elections.

Democrats have already sued to throw out congressional maps in several states and the United States Supreme Court is expected to consider a number of cases this year involving gerrymandered maps.\n\nRepublican leaders have long described control of the redistricting process as one of the party\u2019s prized assets. Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the party\u2019s campaign chairman in the House, said in an interview with Politico that \u201cthe congressional lines\u201d were one of the Republicans\u2019 great advantages in 2018.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

A model for Democratic efforts, several strategists said, might come from Pennsylvania, where an all-Republican government implemented an elaborately gerrymandered map after the 2010 elections. Democrats later captured the governorship and the State Supreme Court, which recently voided the existing district lines and forced an icy standoff between Republican legislative leaders and Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, over the creation of a new map.\n\nMr. Wolf said in an interview on Monday that he was optimistic Republican leaders would ultimately agree to redraw a \u201cfair map\u201d with his input.

Back then, there was kind of a lull with athletes and activists. People weren\u2019t speaking out as much. But then you\u2019ve seen a resurgence as of late.

What was the dynamic with your teammates like? Did you ever receive any pushback?\n\nI tell people all the time: If they would\u2019ve heard the conversations that we had in the locker room, they would\u2019ve been surprised. We had so many political conversations around a current event and everybody had opinions. From around the N.B.A., I would get nods of support. I\u2019d be playing against a certain player and they\u2019d be on the free throw line. They\u2019d tell me, \u201cHey, I read what you said at that rally. That\u2019s good stuff!\u201d Some media people didn\u2019t like it. It depended on what side of the fence they were on with whatever I was saying. I never got any pushback from management or coaches.\n\nYou write about an interesting conversation you had with the sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson comparing activism of athletes from decades ago to now. He suggests that athletes in the past engaged in \u201csocial protest,\u201d while today the top athletes are more likely to engage in \u201csocial charity.\u201d Do you agree?\n\nWe were going back and forth and came to some common ground. This is the thing. Everybody back in the 1960s was not Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell. There\u2019s sometimes been a romanticizing.\n\nThere\u2019s always a risk when you do speak out. It might be a different type of risk. Back in the sixties, there was a threat to your life on a whole different level. People love Muhammad Ali now. But back then? When he said he wasn\u2019t going to go in the Army? He was hated. People think that Colin Kaepernick is hated right now. They can just imagine it times one hundred with Ali.\n\nDo you feel, given the platform, that there is an obligation for athletes to be politically active?\n\nI don\u2019t feel that anybody should be forced to do something that they don\u2019t want to do. I think it\u2019s kind of unfair to tell somebody to take on a fight that isn\u2019t their fight or they\u2019re not passionate about it.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "THE JUNIPER TREE\n\nBy Barbara Comyns\n\n177 pp. New York Review Books. Paper, $14.95.\n\n\u201cI have few happy memories of my mother,\u201d the narrator tells us early on in \u201cThe Juniper Tree,\u201d this reimagining of a famously savage Grimm fairy tale. \u201cNot that she hurt me physically, the hurt was mental.\u201d As Barbara Comyns\u2019s novel unfolds, the hurt that mothers inflict and the hurt that mothers suffer keep piercing through the ordinary fabric of daily life, and some of the wounds (though not all of them) are mental.\n\nComyns, a British writer who died in 1992, was no self-declared feminist, yet she takes up here the voice of one of the most wicked stepmothers in the fairy tale canon, and not only understands her, but makes her the sympathetic heart of the story. This is not easy. Just listen to the closing song of the Grimms\u2019 version, which became Comyns\u2019s epigraph: \u201cMy mother she killed me,/My father he ate me,/My sister, little Marlinchen,/Gathered together my bones,/Tied them in a silken handkerchief,/Laid them beneath the juniper tree,/Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird I am.\u201d Comyns\u2019s hapless heroine\u2019s vicissitudes follow the original story closely as she updates and rationalizes the extreme, weird sequence of murder and revenge.\n\nThe original \u201cJuniper Tree\u201d first appeared in 1812, in the first edition of \u201cChildren\u2019s and Household Tales.\u201d Unlike many stories the Brothers Grimm collected from oral sources, this one was written and sent to them by the German Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge, who specialized in capturing the wild energy of children\u2019s imaginations. He conjured dreamlike, metaphysical fairy realms, as well as portrayed real-life subjects as radiant beings. With \u201cThe Juniper Tree,\u201d he passed on a literary masterpiece of gory fantasy, level and cool and laconic, structured with musical repetition and told with a masterly deadpan command of the horrible.\n\nComyns steps with intense identification into the persona of a woman who, in the Grimms\u2019 telling, decapitates her stepson by dropping the lid of a trunk on his head in a moment of rage and then cooks him in a stew. In Comyns\u2019s version, she is called, with a touch of ominousness, Bella Winters. Her face is badly scarred on the left side, after a car accident \u2014 with Comyns\u2019s perfectly pitched insight into male monstrosity, she recounts how Bella\u2019s lover Stephen, who was at the wheel, blamed her, though she was fast asleep at the time, for distracting him. Soon after this, Bella has a baby. When she first sees the little girl, she thinks there must have been a mistake, since she barely remembers the black lover in a crimson velvet jacket whom she slept with one night after a party when she was on the rebound from Stephen. But she soon grows to love her biracial daughter, gives her the nickname Tommy, and they eke out their survival in a dreary bed-sit infested with cockroaches, heated only by puny gas fires that require feeding with coins, of which Bella never has enough. She is helped by \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d like the \u201cgirl from the Canaries\u201d who \u201cunbuttoned her blouse and gave me one of the steaks that were plastered there. \u2026 They were always offering to babysit, only I had nowhere to go while they sat.\u201d", "title": "Evil Stepmother, Reimagined", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Like \u201cWaterbearer,\u201d many other works of Simpson\u2019s from that period \u2014 including \u201cTwenty Questions (A Sampler)\u201d (1986), \u201cFive Day Forecast\u201d (1988) and \u201c7 Mouths\u201d (1993) \u2014 are both figurative and fragmentary. Evenly lit, crisply photographed, they look like pictures from an illustrated medical dictionary, indexical images of heads, torsos and mouths that are detached from context. Even in a work like \u201cFigure\u201d (1991), the figure in question, sheathed in a black dress and set in the black infinity of no particular place, feels like a fragment, as though she had been extracted from a group photo or a furnished room. The texts accompanying her, eight engraved plastic plaques, read like excerpts from a language primer: \u201cfigured the worst,\u201d \u201che was disfigured,\u201d \u201cfigured there would be no reaction\u201d and so on. Here, not only has the story been winnowed down; it is in fact completely gone. There\u2019s no story. We are left with only the tensions of concrete poetry.\n\nSometime in the mid-1990s, Simpson began to detect clich\u00e9d responses to her work. At the same time, her own thinking was evolving. What does an image of a black woman mean? A commentary on race? An assertion about gender? Simpson branched out from figure-based images and began to experiment more with varied subject matter \u2014 landscapes and inanimate objects like wigs \u2014 and also with unusual quasi-sculptural material like felt and standing screens. A series of monumental multisectional images, several of them landscapes, collectively titled \u201cPublic Sex\u201d (1995-1998) and featuring no figures at all, addressed the provocative title only obliquely. These pictures, made over many years, contain what the scholar and curator Okwui Enwezor calls \u201cthe rumor of the body.\u201d Mysteries of a jagged and deadpan sort, they would go on to influence the noirish tone of Simpson\u2019s later film work.\n\nPhoto\n\nSimpson began to set ever more intricate conceptual layers between her initial inspiration for a work and the finished product. The idea for \u201c9 Props\u201d (1995) began during a residency at the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington. With the aid of artisans at the school, she fabricated a series of dark vessels modeled on vases and other objects used in the portrait work of the pioneering Harlem photographer James Van Der Zee. But these vessels were not the final work. She shipped them back to New York and then photographed them against a plain background. And that still was not the work. Further intervention followed: She turned those photographic images into nine lithographs, which she printed on felt. Finally, she wrote captions below each lithographed vessel, describing the context in which it originally appeared. One of them, for instance, reads:\n\nDinner Party with boxer Harry Wills, 1926 James VanDerZee Harry Wills a k a \u201cThe Black Panther,\u201d boxer, businessman- sits with seven other men and women, mostly women with champagne glasses raised as a woman on his left makes a toast in his honor. There are three bottles of champagne, a crystal decanter, a bottle of port, an arrangement of flowers and fruit, and before each guest an untouched china place setting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom multiple directions, the work gestures at what cannot be seen: the original placement of the vessels that inspired Simpson\u2019s own, the people in the photographs by James Van Der Zee, the social life of Harlem evoked by his photographs and the complexity of manners and class implied by them. All that vanished world of culture and experience is reduced to an elegant grid, as simple as an antiquarian\u2019s catalog, a thought picture that demands calm engagement and imaginative intervention on the viewer\u2019s part. Without being representational, it is about race; but race is not off in some category by itself, hemmed in only by questions of skin color, separate from life.\n\n\u201cRepresent!\u201d in the black American sense means standing up for your people, expressing solidarity and letting a shared ethos underwrite your presence and work. It is an exhortation, a greeting and a farewell. The word also has more conventional associations. In the visual arts, it is contrasted with the abstract or the symbolic. To represent, in this more common sense, is to make work that visually corresponds to realities out there in the world: to illustrate uncomplicatedly. This second sense of \u201crepresent\u201d is enjoying a vogue in the art world. Realism is back. This is welcome: after so long an absence of black figures and black faces in art museums, they are now being seen more frequently. Many artists, black and otherwise, are depicting the black body. It is necessary and often successful. Just as often, it fails when it is little more than a clumsy shorthand for socially concerned art, unobjectionable and unimpressive.\n\nA strong appeal of Simpson\u2019s work is that she has always embraced the inherent complexity of blackness, her own blackness as well as the blackness that runs ineluctably through American history. She does not reject representational depictions, but neither does she feel the need to confine herself only to \u201crace\u201d work. When an artist uses a black model, she is presenting a human question by foregrounding a human presence. Is a white man a person while a black woman is and can only be a gendered and racialized subject? As the scholar Kellie Jones has pointed out, nonwhite bodies are often thought of as \u201cnot neutral enough for the dispassionate formulas thought to constitute conceptual practice.\u201d If a black woman\u2019s race and gender are the only things apparent to certain viewers, Simpson seems to say, the ethical responsibility to escape those shackles is the viewer\u2019s.\n\nFreedom is Lorna Simpson\u2019s starting point and her permanent theme. A humane current animates all of her work, a current that neither sidesteps nor confines itself to race. Her work is simultaneously about the \u201cneutral\u201d space of ideas and the particularized experience of the body. \u201cMontage\u201d is photographic and painterly, a riff on a pair of found photographs, sequenced to look like a giant strip of film. It deals with dreams and nightmares, ambiguities and vulnerabilities. At its heart is what Simpson calls \u201cthe push and pull of photography\u201d: the stuttering potential inherent in mechanical reproduction and the imperfect registrations that mirror subconscious life. It is a rapid response to the current political climate, situating a crucial part of it in the most intimate space of all, where the hectoring \u201cthey\u201d is temporarily held at bay in favor of the puzzled \u201cI.\u201d In your own sleeping bed, images persist and words are hard to come by. It is the art we need now: rich, allusive, tongue-tied and unanswerable.", "title": "Evoking What Can\u2019t Be Seen", "authors": ["Teju Cole", "On Photography"]}
{"date": "2018-02-04 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Howe\u2019s testimony has been eagerly anticipated ever since federal prosecutors announced in 2016 that he had pleaded guilty and was cooperating with authorities in an investigation of Joseph Percoco, a former senior aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and one of his closest friends. (Mr. Cuomo has not been accused of any wrongdoing.)\n\nThe government has charged that Mr. Percoco, one of four men on trial, accepted more than $300,000 in bribes from Mr. Howe\u2019s clients in return for taking official actions on their behalf.\n\nMr. Howe, who had lobbied in Albany and Washington, has longstanding ties to the Cuomo family. He worked in the administration of former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the current governor\u2019s father, and he also worked under Andrew Cuomo when he served as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton.\n\nDefense lawyers\u2019 attacks on Mr. Howe in Mr. Percoco\u2019s trial began early and relentlessly, as they warned the jury that Mr. Howe could not be believed \u2014 a common defense tactic to try to weaken the credibility of a key witness.\n\nA prosecutor, Robert L. Boone, clearly expecting the attacks, told the jury \u2014 even before the defense did \u2014 that Mr. Howe was a criminal who had pleaded guilty to eight felonies, many of which related to him telling lies.\n\n\u201cHe has lied to his employer, he has lied to the I.R.S. and he\u2019s even lied to the defendants. He will tell you all about it,\u201d Mr. Boone said in his opening statement, adding that Mr. Howe had cooperated and was testifying \u201cin hopes of getting a lower sentence.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Boone signaled that the government would offer other, supportive evidence for Mr. Howe\u2019s testimony.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe charges to which Mr. Howe pleaded guilty include extortion, wire fraud and conspiracies to commit honest services fraud and bribery. Six of the counts carry maximum prison sentences of 20 years each, but if Mr. Howe completes his cooperation successfully, prosecutors say they will write to the judge and seek leniency on his behalf.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Mr. Howe lies on the witness stand, the government could rip up his deal, and he could face years in prison \u2014 a possibility that Mr. Howe\u2019s lawyer, Richard J.

Rechnitz in building their case against Norman Seabrook, the powerful former chief of New York City\u2019s correction officers union.\n\nMr. Rechnitz, a wealthy real estate scion who had agreed to cooperate with the government after pleading guilty to fraud conspiracy, spent days on the witness stand, describing for the jury how he had facilitated bribes between Mr. Seabrook and a hedge fund financier.\n\nBut defense lawyers excoriated Mr. Rechnitz in terms virtually identical to those that Mr. Percoco\u2019s lawyers have hurled at Mr. Howe. They called him a felon, a con man and a pathological liar.\n\nThose disparagements, coupled with Mr. Rechnitz\u2019s smug and combative demeanor on the witness stand, may have weighed upon at least some members of the jury, which ultimately could not reach a verdict. After the mistrial was declared, one juror told reporters he had found Mr. Rechnitz to be a \u201cstraight-up liar.\u201d (The government has said it would retry Mr. Seabrook.)\n\nAll the anticipation that has preceded Mr. Howe\u2019s testimony \u2014 just the mention of his name last week seemed to make some courtroom spectators sit up straighter \u2014 has almost overshadowed the men actually on trial.\n\nMr. Morvillo, Mr. Howe\u2019s lawyer, suggested as much in a recent letter to the judge, in which he referred to the defense\u2019s attacks on Mr. Howe during opening statements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThose openings offered false narratives based on \u2018alternative facts,\u2019\u201d Mr. Morvillo wrote, \u201cand have tried to turn this into a trial of Mr. Howe.\u201d", "title": "Ex-Albany Insider Is Expected to Tell All, if He Can Be Believed", "authors": ["Benjamin Weiser", "Vivian Wang"]}

Kevin DeGood, the director of infrastructure policy at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank, said that since the plan requires states to fund the vast majority of new projects with their own money to qualify for federal funds, \u201cthere\u2019s a real strong case to be made that many states won\u2019t bother.\u201d\n\nThe administration disagrees and says that the $200 billion in federal spending, combined with quicker permitting that allow projects to get started fast, will incentivize a wave of projects. Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of transportation, said this month that a goal of the administration\u2019s plan is \u201cto use federal dollars as seed money to encourage infrastructure investment by the states, localities and the private sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all want better infrastructure,\u201d she said at a White House news briefing.\n\n\u201cBut unfortunately, there\u2019s just not enough money in the world to pay for all the infrastructure, which is why\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s plan also puts an emphasis on the private sector, Ms. Chao said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They have warned that the reliance on private spending could lead to high user fees, such as tolls, on new projects.\n\nOn Friday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said that \u201cIf we ever needed proof that Trump\u2019s infrastructure plan is made out of thin air and would create Trump tolls, Trump tolls and more Trump tolls across the country, this independent study is it.\u201d\n\nThe administration has consistently been more optimistic than outside analysts in forecasting the economic effects of his proposals. The Council of Economic Advisers projected this week that the $1.5 trillion tax cuts Mr. Trump signed into law last year would boost the economy by 2 percent to 4 percent, a much higher rate of growth than independent analyses have found. Top administration officials said this fall that faster growth from Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies, including the infrastructure plan and tax cuts, would generate enough additional tax revenue to more than offset any increase to the federal budget deficit from the tax cuts.\n\nThe Penn Wharton Budget Model, in contrast, forecast in December that the tax cuts would increase the size of the economy by 0.6 to 1.1 percent over a decade, and add as much as an additional $2.2 trillion to the national debt in that time. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the economic scorekeeper of Congress, predicted that the cuts would increase the size of the economy by 0.7 percent and add more than $1 trillion to the debt.", "title": "Experts Doubt Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan Will Boost Economy", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley"]}

That acid, produced when certain bacteria metabolize alcohol, is what broadly defines vinegar and its flavor \u2014 the sharpness on your tongue, the prickling in your nostrils.\n\nBut vinegar enthusiasts, including a growing group of chefs and home cooks across the country, have a far more nuanced understanding. And what Mr. Lee makes is only distantly related to the harsh, distilled vinegars used for household tasks, or diluted for basic brines.\n\nThe word comes from the French vin aigre, or sour wine, but great vinegars can be made from the slow, controlled fermentations of many different fruits, vegetables, grains and syrups. They can be cloudy or clear, mouth-puckering or sweet, fruity or gamy, with endless variations.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cA great vinegar has all the characteristics of the initial product \u2014 that\u2019s the most important thing,\u201d said Harry Rosenblum, the author of the 2017 book \u201cVinegar Revival\u201d and a founder of the Brooklyn Kitchen, a cooking school with two locations in New York.\n\nMr. Rosenblum sees the uptick of interest in quality vinegar as a part of the home-brewing and fermentation movements \u2014 an ingredient with history, and roots all over the world, that also welcomes creativity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaking your own vinegar isn\u2019t foolproof, but part of its appeal is that it requires little in the way of an initial investment, and few tools. (Though serious vinegar-makers may rely on pH meters and other gadgets, a wide-mouthed jar and a piece of cheesecloth are all you really need to get started.)\n\nVinegar, the result of acetic fermentation, simply requires oxygen, bacteria and alcohol. You can start the process with ready-made alcohol \u2014 a bottle of wine, sake or cider \u2014 or create your own alcohol by fermenting fresh peaches or coconut water. From there, the microbes get to work, turning the alcohol into vinegar.\n\nMr. Lee has a space-saving method at his restaurant. He seals fruit with sugar and water in clear plastic bags and stacks these on sheet pans in the walk-in refrigerator. As the fruit rots, the bags puff. But before they burst open, Mr. Lee transfers the contents to finish fermenting in small two- to three-quart jars.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe often draws out the process over several months, until the bacteria start to metabolize the acetic acid itself. Now, the vinegar changes, taking on new layers of flavor. Its sharp edges soften. As it ages, it becomes increasingly mellow.\n\n\u201cFor me, good vinegar is something that\u2019s alive,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIt has a good shot of umami; it makes your mouth water.\u201d\n\nIn her Dallas apartment, the chef Misti Norris ferments a jumble of vinegars in glass containers and covered oak barrels, in a dark, temperature-controlled nook equipped with a dehumidifier that keeps the vinegars around 65 degrees. Some will mature for a few months, others a year.\n\n\u201cI like to work on things that take a long time,\u201d said Ms. Norris, who runs the pop-up restaurant Petra and the Beast.\n\nWhen she began making vinegar a few years ago, she was giving bottles away to friends in the restaurant business, but as the taste and demand for great vinegar have increased, so has Ms. Norris\u2019s production. She plans to sell her vinegars later this year, including some made from local mustang grapes, passion fruit, peony flowers and figs, as well as collaborations with local brewers, made from sour beers and fruit-infused saisons.\n\nPhoto\n\nJori Jayne Emde, who runs Lady Jayne\u2019s Alchemy in Chatham, N.Y., lets her vinegars ferment slowly, over many months, in an open-air barn. Come winter, she steps away, letting the steel containers freeze where they stand. When the weather warms, she says, the vinegars thaw out and pick up where they left off.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Emde owns Fish & Game with her husband, the chef Zak Pelaccio, and was drawn to vinegar-making in part as a way to avoid food waste. \u201cAll the things that might get put in the trash or composted, I mix with wine and ferment,\u201d she said, \u201cI call it whole utilization.\u201d\n\nShe collects food scraps and leftover wine dregs, transforming the miscellany into an array of vinegars, from carrot and tomato to sour cherry and brown bread. The kitchen at Fish & Game uses these bottles, and never fresh citrus, to tinker with the acidity in their dishes, seasoning it on snails roasted with absinthe and garlicky herb butter, or using it to dress winter greens.\n\nMs. Emde works with six-gallon steel drums full of pith, seeds, stems, tops, peels and cores fermenting in a base of wine. She lets the vinegars sour naturally, without a starter, and develop acetic acid over time. But since her production is outdoors, she occasionally takes the spent yeast from previous batches and splashes it around the barn. She says it ensures that the microbes she values, the ones she wants in the vinegars, are thriving nearby.\n\nMany vinegar-makers will speed up the process slightly with a mother \u2014 a jellylike disk of acetobacteria and cellulose that may form naturally on the top of a vinegar as it ferments, or can be bought online.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his book \u201cOn Food and Cooking,\u201d the science writer Harold McGee calls vinegar \u201calcohol\u2019s fate,\u201d neatly summing up both its process and history, which goes back as far as the making of wine, beer and mead.\n\nThe earliest vinegars were likely produced in the Middle East, somewhere along the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. Before refrigeration, there was simply no way to put the brakes on the fermentation process: Ripe fruit produced alcohol, then charged ahead in warm climates, turning to vinegar.\n\nMichael Harlan Turkell, a writer and photographer who makes honey vinegars in his Brooklyn backyard, traveled the world researching the ingredient for his 2017 cookbook, \u201cAcid Trip.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cVinegar probably wasn\u2019t a culinary ingredient until around 1500 B.C.,\u201d he said. Around that time, it was used not only as a preservative but also as a flavoring agent, poured over noodles in China, and forming the base of dipping sauces.\n\nOnce vinegar made the leap, it persisted. Like alcohol, vinegar was refined all over the world in different ways, shaping cuisines as both a preservative and a flavoring. Where nipa palms and coconuts grew, vinegar could be made from sap and water. Where rice and sugar cane grew, it could be made from sake and juice.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Paris, Mr. Turkell met the French chef Bertrand Auboyneau, who used a generous amount of rich, tannic red wine vinegar to brighten oeufs en meurette, the bistro dish of poached eggs in a red-wine sauce. And at a cooking school in Tokyo, the Japanese instructor Naoyuki Yanagihara taught him to make sumiso, the yolk-rich sauce seasoned with rice vinegar and white miso.\n\nMs. Norris, the Dallas chef, emulsifies her vinegar made from foraged Texan grapes into melted butter and uses it like a sauce to dress pasta. The more rounded, fruity vinegars end up in her desserts, like a mustang grape and white chocolate tart, made with sunflower and passion fruit seeds.\n\n\u201cI think that balance of salt, acid and fat is what makes people want to eat,\u201d Ms. Norris said. \u201cVinegars can add such subtle nuances, and so much character.\u201d\n\nMashama Bailey, the chef and owner of the Grey, in Savannah, Ga., compared her use of sherry vinegar and white balsamic to a little squeeze of lemon, brightening everything up just before it\u2019s served. The better the vinegar, she said, the fewer other ingredients, and less cooking the dish needs to shine.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a really beautiful aged balsamic, you drizzle a little on a piece of cheese,\u201d said Ms. Bailey, \u201cand it becomes the star.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen vinegar makers get talking, they sound a little like wine lovers. They refer to the expression of the fruit, the structure of the flavors, the complexity of aromas in the nose.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going from rotten fruit to this beautiful, flavorful, elegant acidic thing that you can drink,\u201d Mr. Lee said. After a decade of making vinegar from scratch, he added, the process remains somewhat mysterious to him. \u201cThings are so scientific, and so standardized in the kitchen. We\u2019ve figured it all out. But not vinegar!\u201d\n\nAbout 20 percent of the time, the vinegar doesn\u2019t work out, he said. A spore mold finds its way into the jar, ruining the entire batch. Or the liquid becomes too rich in ammonia or somewhat rancid-tasting, or everything turns the bad kind of moldy.\n\nHis cooks find vinegar\u2019s lack of certainty irritating, but for Mr. Lee, it only underscores his affection.\n\n\u201cEvery time I make a vinegar and it works out, it\u2019s like a minor miracle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m over the moon.\u201d\n\nRecipes: Poached Eggs in Red Wine (Oeufs en Meurette) | Homemade Red Wine Vinegar\n\nMaking (Bad) Vinegar at Home: A Critic\u2019s Confession, by Eric Asimov\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

On the street with the beige garage conversion, Mr. Almeida could point to a clue on nearly every property. Peeking over a fence, he spied another garage with a satellite dish mounted outside. One home had an R.V. that looked to be permanently stationed in a large carport. Across the street, a home zoned for just one unit had a second address posted outside. The home next door had two satellite dishes on the chimney and a third on the garage.\n\nThis spring, volunteers will use a texting app the city tested in December to identify these a nd similar units. The city will then flag them on the Census Bureau\u2019s master address list for San Jose. Mr. Almeida vows that the city department in charge of building code enforcement will never see these address notes, and the Census Bureau requires confidentiality from the local officials who do access them. A nonprofit founded by the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, Cities of Service, is hoping to spread the tool to other cities that will be receiving their address databases from the census in the coming weeks.\n\nIn New York City, half a dozen workers in the planning department have been similarly canvasing neighborhoods for the last 15 months.

Meyer spends years suffering from food poisoning.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI studied in the eastern city of Nanjing the year before Meyer arrived in China and later covered the country as a reporter. His descriptions of the 1990s and early 2000s awakened my memories: the ambitious men with their pagers clipped to pleather belts; the young women click-clacking in heels and half-rolled pantyhose; the endless questions about life in America, especially how much everything cost. (Meyer\u2019s recollections also echo those of \u201cRiver Town,\u201d the 2001 memoir by his fellow Peace Corps volunteer Peter Hessler, who now writes for The New Yorker.)\n\nLike Guo, Meyer ends up in Beijing, where he teaches at an international school, writes freelance stories and courts a feisty woman from Manchuria who will become his wife. His Beijing is a city so dedicated to self-improvement that it reflects little on what is lost on the way. \u201cMaybe,\u201d Meyer writes, \u201cBeijing kept tearing itself down to bury its unexamined past.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But his memoir, like Guo\u2019s, also captures a China where the syncopation of pile drivers only adds to the drumbeat of national optimism.\n\nI lived in Beijing back then. As in China as a whole, the sense of possibility in the capital was intoxicating, even if the ghosts of students massacred near Tiananmen Square lingered. Guo documents performance art in which exhibitionists eat human placentas to critique China\u2019s one-child policy. The police descend on grungy artist colonies but self-expression flourishes.\n\nToday\u2019s Beijing is sanitized and modernized. Bentleys and Serrano ham are on sale. But the city is no longer a playground for struggling artists or idealistic intellectuals. Late last year, entire warrens inhabited by migrants were razed. And under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, the Chinese dissident movement has been starved of oxygen. So many of my friends and acquaintances \u2014 lawyers, writers, activists and artists who dared to articulate a different dream for China \u2014 have either left the country or are in jail.\n\nGuo exited early when she won a scholarship in 2002 to study film in London. She is now a British citizen and has written novels in English, like \u201cA Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers.\u201d In 2013, Granta named her one of the best young British novelists. When her memoir veers to exile in Europe, its emotional punch is weaker, just as Meyer\u2019s story lags when he strays from Sichuan, Beijing and Manchuria. While he criticizes foreign correspondents for their facile coverage of China, his dispatches from Tibet and Xinjiang, vast lands on the edge of the Chinese Empire, also rely on quick anecdotes to fill out a larger truth.\n\nStill, Meyer is an amiable narrator, and he introduces the reader to some of China\u2019s greatest paradoxes, notably a pride in history that coexists with a compulsion to destroy the past. Guo uses her book to explore another contradiction: the role of women in a society where Chairman Mao deemed that women should hold up half the sky even as he kept a stable of concubines for his pleasure. Born long before the Communist revolution, Guo\u2019s grandmother was a child bride considered so insignificant that she lacked a name. The Communist census-takers who came to her remote fishing village were appalled by this relic of a feudal past, with her bound feet and bent body.\n\nBy contrast, Guo\u2019s mother starred in revolutionary operas after her factory shift was over. Yet Chinese women are still owned and exploited. While confiding to dorm mates at the Beijing Film Academy, Guo realizes the pervasiveness of the sexual abuse she suffered as a teenager. Her best friend throws herself out of a window because of a man. Being a mistress is now a career choice for young women in China.\n\nBoth Meyer and Guo begin their memoirs with quotes from \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d a classic 16th-century Chinese fable starring a Buddhist monk and a magical monkey.

But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.\n\nResearchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement \u2014 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases.\n\nFacial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.\n\n\u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.\n\nUntil now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination.

The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.\n\nThe African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.\n\nThen, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.\n\nMs. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies.

Many Americans \u2014 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 talk about support for \u201cuniversal health care,\u201d but that term usually refers to universal health insurance coverage, and there are competing visions of how to achieve that goal.\n\nPublic support for a single-payer system \u2014 one in which the government pays medical bills \u2014 has been growing, and politicians on the left like Bernie Sanders have urged America to \u201cjoin every industrialized country and guarantee health care to all Americans as a right.\u201d (The United States does have a single-payer system, Medicare, for Americans over 65.)

Many alarming statistics have been produced since the election about how many times \u201cfake news\u201d was shared on Facebook or how many times Russian bots retweeted content on Twitter. These statistics obscure the fact that the content being shared may not reach many Americans (most people are not on Twitter and consume relatively little political news) or even many humans (many bot followers may themselves be bots).\n\nWhether the people being exposed are persuadable. Dubious political content online is disproportionately likely to reach heavy news consumers who already have strong opinions. For instance, a study I conducted with Andrew Guess of Princeton and Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter in Britain showed that exposure to fake news websites before the 2016 election was heavily concentrated among the 10 percent of Americans with the most conservative information diets \u2014 not exactly swing voters.\n\nThe proportion of news people saw that is bogus. The total number of shares or likes that fake news and bots attract can sound enormous until you consider how much information circulates online. Twitter, for instance, reported that Russian bots tweeted 2.1 million times before the election \u2014 certainly a worrisome number. But these represented only 1 percent of all election-related tweets and 0.5 percent of views of election-related tweets.\n\nSimilarly, my study with Mr. Guess and Mr. Reifler found that the mean number of articles on fake news websites visited by Trump supporters was 13.1, but only 40 percent of his supporters visited such websites, and they represented only about 6 percent of the pages they visited on sites focusing on news topics.", "title": "Fake News and Bots May Be Worrisome, but Their Political Power Is Overblown", "authors": []}

His musical tastes alone are a dead giveaway: Before going to prison, King loved classic jazz masters like Fats Waller and Louis Armstrong, but now that he\u2019s out, his tastes run to the tormented sounds of Thelonious Monk (\u201cthe madman in the corner pounding out the truth between the fabrications of rhythm and blues\u201d). King gets his mojo back by taking the death-row case of a black militant journalist who calls himself A Free Man and by wading into a politically acute case of police corruption including a drugs-and-prostitution ring run out of a church.\n\nAs usual with this singular author, the plot is way over the top; but the vibrant characters and pulsating dialogue are primo Mosley. This time out, the come-hither voice from the dark side belongs to Melquarth Frost, a seductive sociopath who consistently beats King at chess. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, aren\u2019t you, Mel?\u201d King puts it to him. \u201cYeah. I guess I am,\u201d Frost admits. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna be. It\u2019s not like I can get to it, you know what I mean? I love life. \u2026 It\u2019s just \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGreat stuff.\n\n\u2666\n\n\u201cWhat if I told you I covered up a murder?\u201d THE UNFORGOTTEN (Gallery, $25.99), a first novel by the British journalist Laura Powell, turns on that loaded question. This mournful tale is primarily set in 1956 in a Cornish fishing village plagued by both a serial murderer and a baying pack of reporters lured down from London by the smell of blood. John Gallagher, the only gentleman in this fraternity of uncouth louts, is immediately drawn to Betty Broadbent, the bright 15-year-old daughter of the woman who manages the hotel where the journalists are camped out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe whole village is soon howling for the hide of Nigel Forbes, the local butcher, but Betty knows the real identity of the so-called Cornish Cleaver. It will take 50 years for the truth to come out, and Powell leaves us agonizing over the terrible choices open to a young woman like Betty, living in a village like St. Steele and seeing no way out.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-18 00:00:00", "text": "Canada uses a complex formula to select members of its team, but if a skater is among the top 16 in the world, finishes in the top three at the national championships, and has skated a time that is faster than the Olympic cutoff standard, qualification for the Olympics is automatic.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Russia ban figured to rule out two Russian skaters ranked ahead of Dutton, who was ranked 18th when the I.O.C. announced the ban. That put him in the top 16, he thought. Also, Dutton had finished second in the 500 meters at the Canadian nationals. His best time in the 500 meters didn\u2019t meet the qualifying standard, but that number was determined in part by the times of those two Russian skaters who appeared likely to be barred. Eliminate them, and he met the standard.\n\nHowever, the I.O.C. took more than a month to decide the exact criteria for barring the Russians. The I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, has said the time was necessary to provide the Russians with due process and figure out a complicated procedure for approval.\n\nWith time short to select its Olympic team, Speed Skating Canada decided to pick the three Canadians ranked ahead of Dutton, even though Dutton had skated to second place in the trials and would have made the top 16 if the Russians didn\u2019t figure in calculations.\n\nDutton took the speedskating selectors to court. The matter was referred to arbitration. That created uncertainty and tension within the team as Dutton\u2019s potential inclusion would have imperiled the participation of another athlete, Laurent Dubreuil.\n\nDavid Bennett, an arbiter with the Sport Dispute Resolution Center of Canada, ruled that Canada\u2019s Olympic selection panel should reconsider its decision because Dutton \u201cwould meet the criteria if the ineligible Russian athletes were not included.\u201d\n\nBennett asked the panel to consider the results of the two most detailed investigations into the Russian affair: A 2016 report by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that first laid out the scale of the cheating scheme, and a similar study on behalf of the I.O.C. by Samuel Schmid, a former president of Switzerland, that confirmed many of those findings late last year. Bennett also argued that the two Russians placed above Dutton, Pavel Kulizhnikov and Artyom Kuznetsov, would most likely be ruled ineligible from the Games when the I.O.C. issued its decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, when the selection panel met to review its decision on Jan. 23, the I.O.C. had not publicly disclosed how it would determine which Russian athletes would be picked. Several barred athletes, including Kuznetsov, were appealing to the international Court of Arbitration for Sport. According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, this lack of clarity played a role in the panel\u2019s decision to stick with its original selections and not assume the Russian skaters would be eliminated, which they eventually were.\n\nSelectors \u201ccould not determine that Russian athletes should be removed from the determination of the Qualifying Standard,\u201d said one of the documents. The selectors also felt Russian athletes should receive the same \u201cdue process, natural justice and procedural fairness\u201d as Dutton while their appeals had yet to be ruled on.\n\nSusan Auch, Speed Skating Canada\u2019s interim chief executive, is adamant that the selection body made the right decision, saying that Dutton was simply a victim of fierce competition. She conceded, however, that the delay in dealing with Russia created a \u201cmurky situation\u201d for all sports governing bodies.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a decision with the information we had at the moment,\u201d she said.\n\nDutton described the six-hour arbitration hearing as worse than anything he\u2019d experienced in nearly 10 years of speedskating. \u201cI think my heartbeat went to 190,\u201d he said. \u201cFour years of training come down to that.\u201d\n\nThe irony of a Canadian being ensnared by the Russian scandal isn\u2019t lost on Dutton. The process that led to Russia\u2019s ouster is inextricably linked to Canada.\n\nMcLaren\u2019s investigation exposed the scale of the scheme, and since then, some of the biggest voices demanding tough action against Russia have come from Canada. Richard W. Pound, a Canadian who once led the World Anti-Doping Agency and is the I.O.C.\u2019s longest-serving member, has urged the organization to take the hardest of lines against Russia.\n\nThe former Canadian cross-country skier Beckie Scott, the leader of the agency\u2019s athlete committee, has also been a prominent voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a Canadian-led fight, really,\u201d Dutton said.\n\nPound said that Dutton should be at the Games and not sitting more than 5,000 miles away from his teammates.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

The uncertainty around his fate has strained Dutton\u2019s relations with his former teammate Dubreuil, who will line up for the 500-meter race at the Gangneung Oval on Monday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on very good terms with almost all of my teammates, except one person, who is an affected party,\u201d he said. \u201cSpeed Skating Canada ended up putting us in that position by not excluding times of Russian cheaters.\u201d\n\nAuch said she had sympathy for Dutton, though she insisted that the team in Pyeongchang was the strongest, explaining that Dubreuil had won a gold medal at a world championship meet earlier this year. Dutton beat Dubreuil to second place at the Canadian nationals.\n\n\u201cIf we could have taken four, we would have,\u201d Auch said.\n\nRussia has the third-largest presence at the Olympics after the I.O.C. ruled that nearly 170 athletes could participate under the banner \u201cOlympic Athletes From Russia.\u201d\n\nDutton and others are frustrated that several sports governing bodies, including those for speedskating, luge and ice hockey, have yet to discipline tainted Russian athletes, meaning they can continue participating in events outside of the Olympics.\n\n\u201cWhy are these people who are banned from the Olympics still competing against us?\u201d he asked. \"We are competing with them in World Cups, and they are banned from the Olympics.\u201d", "title": "Far From the Games, a Canadian Skater Says Russia Cost Him a Spot", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"]}

{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "Dr. Chambers said the researchers were in the process of analyzing the mothers\u2019 answers to questions to see if they can identify relationships between the timing and amount of drinking during pregnancy and the type and severity of children\u2019s impairment.\n\nIt has been unclear how common these disorders are because the facial features are subtle, and some effects, like problems paying attention or recognizing the consequences of behavior, can apply to other diagnoses. Also, the degree and area of a child\u2019s brain damage appears to vary depending on when and how much during pregnancy the mother drank, as well as genetics, so symptoms can vary, too.\n\nThen there is the stigma that often makes mothers reluctant to acknowledge alcohol consumption.\n\n\u201cWhen you identify a kid with FASD, you\u2019ve just identified a mom who drank during pregnancy and harmed her child,\u201d said Susan Astley, director of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Diagnostic and Prevention Network at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study.\n\nWhile Dr. Astley, a longtime expert in the field, said she admired the researchers\u2019 hard work, she said the reliability of the study\u2019s numbers was hampered by several factors. For example, only 60 percent of eligible families in the schools allowed their children to be evaluated and more than a third of those children\u2019s mothers declined to answer questions about drinking during pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIf we could generate accurate estimates of FASD, we\u2019d all benefit,\u201d Dr. Astley said. \u201cBut the major limitations in the study design render the results, for the most part, uninterpretable.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the study, which was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, acknowledged the study\u2019s limitations and tried to partly compensate by providing a conservative estimate (of 1.1 percent to 5 percent) that is likely low and another estimate (of 3.1 percent to 9.9 percent) that is likely high. Dr. Chambers also said the results might not generalize across the country because although the four communities were diverse, they did not include a large, high-poverty urban area or certain rural or indigenous communities that struggle with high rates of alcoholism.\n\nThe locations, which are not named in the publication, include small-to-midsize cities in the Midwest and Rocky Mountains, a Southeast county and a Pacific Coast city the authors identified in interviews as San Diego. Participating first graders were given neurodevelopmental evaluations and most also had their facial features evaluated by dysmorphologists. About 62 percent of the first graders\u2019 mothers were interviewed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

All but two of them had not been previously diagnosed, although the authors said many parents had been aware their children had learning and behavioral difficulties.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the hidden problem,\u201d said Dr. Howard Taras, a study author and professor at the University of California, San Diego, who is the physician for the San Diego Unified School District, which participated in the study. \u201cIf not in one classroom, certainly in another, there\u2019s going to be one or two kids with these problems, but they\u2019re not identified as such.\u201d\n\nIdentifying children with alcohol-related impairments can help teachers and psychologists work with them more effectively, experts said.\n\nEven if educational approaches might resemble those for other special needs children, the diagnosis tells teachers behavior problems are \u201cnot because this child is disobedient, it\u2019s because of some neurological disorder,\u201d said Dr. Svetlana Popova, a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health\u2019s Institute for Mental Health Policy Research in Toronto, who was a co-author of an editorial about the new study.\n\nDr. Astley said a diagnosis might inform medical treatment, as well, because some medications, like Ritalin, might work for inherited attention deficit disorder, but not attention deficit symptoms caused by alcohol.\n\nRecently health authorities in the United States have sharpened warnings about alcohol in pregnancy. A 2015 American Academy of Pediatrics report said \u201cno amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe\u201d during any trimester. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noting that half of American pregnancies are unplanned, recommended that sexually active women who are not using birth control \u201cnot drink alcohol at all.\u201d\n\nTo the astonishment of people working with alcohol-damaged children, the C.D.C. report unleashed a swirl of pushback from those who considered the advice insulting, shaming or over-the-top.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous, I went to a wine tasting and my kid came out fine,\u2019\u201d Dr. Taras said. \u201cBut the C.D.C. is saying, \u2018We don\u2019t know. Maybe you just won the lottery.\u2019\u201d\n\nExperts say there is evidence that more drinking causes more damage, but much remains to be learned, and in some women even a small amount of alcohol can seriously affect a baby, Dr. Astley said. She added, \u201cThere\u2019s probably no two women on the planet who drank the same amount on the same day of pregnancy. And alcohol doesn\u2019t impact every fetus in the same way.\u201d\n\nDr. Popova said she hoped the new study would make people pay attention.\n\n\u201cAlcohol can damage every system of the body,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to scream about this problem to the world.\u201d", "title": "Far More U.S. Children Than Previously Thought May Have Fetal Alcohol Disorders", "authors": ["Pam Belluck"]}

Where the company\u2019s reputation once seemed headed toward something like Walmart\u2019s \u2014 that is, widely seen as a kind of monster spawn of American capitalism \u2014 now Amazon is fast becoming something else in the public eye: The fix-anything, can-do business hero who rolls up his sleeves to take on America\u2019s biggest challenges.\n\nIn that vein: Tune in for Bezos\u2019s star turn in Amazon\u2019s Super Bowl commercial on Sunday.\n\nFacebook usage falls.

Now Facebook is turning a new leaf, according to Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn an earnings report on Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief repeated what he has been saying for several months now: Facebook is going to address its effects on society by encouraging people to use Facebook less often.\n\nAnd guess what?

Investors didn\u2019t know what to make of the news; Facebook\u2019s stock fell in the aftermath of its report. But by Thursday, shares were back up, suggesting Facebook\u2019s argument to investors had stuck.\n\nZuck argues that if people spend less time on the site but feel like the time they do spend there is more valuable, Facebook\u2019s advertising business will prosper too. So far that is bearing out \u2014 Facebook\u2019s bottom line is still increasing at a double-digit rate.\n\nBut I\u2019m fascinated by what happens next.

This seems weird because Google is the internet\u2019s largest advertising company. So how does an advertising company design ad-blocking software? Very, very carefully, it turns out, in a process rife with conflicts.\n\nGoogle argues that over all, the internet ad business has been great for the economy and society, but that a few bad apples are ruining it all. Google, then, wants to \u201cmaintain a balance,\u201d because \u201cif left unchecked, disruptive ads have the potential to derail the entire system,\u201d the company said in a blog post this week. (In a recent column, I took a different view, arguing that the digital ad business is at the root of most of the internet\u2019s problems.)\n\nSo Google\u2019s new ad blocker is designed to block some ads, not all of them. The software will eliminate a dozen types of ads that the company deems intrusive or disruptive. But most ads, including most from Google, would skate through just fine.\n\nBut how does Google decide which ads are too disruptive? The company says it relied on input from an ad-industry group, the Coalition for Better Ads. But as the The Wall Street Journal reported, the group\u2019s membership and its research were heavily influenced by Google. This has led to recriminations in the industry, with rivals charging that Google is using the veil of self-regulation to diminish its competitors.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting fight, but it may also be an irrelevant one. What\u2019s unclear is whether Google\u2019s limited ad blocker will stem the rising popularity of more restrictive ad blockers.

The passenger train, heading south, was diverted onto a rail siding where, while apparently traveling below the speed limit, it crashed into a CSX train that had been loaded with automobiles.\n\nBut with the specific sequence of events and cause of the crash unlikely to be settled for many months, the episode, which injured at least 116 people and allowed thousands of gallons of fuel to spill, posed a new challenge for an already beleaguered Amtrak.\n\nBy one crucial metric, Amtrak is stronger than ever: In its most recent fiscal year, it posted a record-high ridership of about 31.7 million passenger trips. Yet a series of fatal accidents in recent months have triggered a test of confidence in the rail service.\n\n\u201cAmtrak has put a question in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said James E. Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash in South Carolina.\n\nOn Wednesday, a train carrying Republican members of Congress to a retreat in West Virginia hit a garbage truck in rural Virginia, killing a passenger in the truck. And in December, a passenger train on a newly opened Amtrak route jumped the tracks on an overpass near Seattle, slamming rail cars into a busy highway, killing at least three people and injuring about 100 others.\n\nFederal Railroad Administration statistics have shown that in recent years the agency has had an average of about two derailments a month, accounting for about one-quarter of the accidents it reports.\n\nDerailments rarely cause more than minor injuries, but the aftermath was tragically different on Sunday not far from Columbia, the state capital.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said the engine of the Amtrak train, which had been carrying eight crew members and 139 passengers on its route from New York to Miami, was \u201cbarely recognizable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing to see \u2014 to understand the force that this involved,\u201d Mr. McMaster said.\n\nThe Lexington County coroner, Margaret Fisher, identified the dead as Amtrak employees: the train\u2019s 54-year-old engineer, Michael Kempf, of Savannah, Ga., and a conductor, Michael Cella, 36, of Orange Park, Fla. Both men were in the first car of the train.\n\n\u201cWe should have had a lot more casualties, but we didn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nDozens of passengers were taken to a nearby middle school, where the American Red Cross set up a temporary shelter and passengers tried to make sense of what had happened aboard Train 91 at about 2:35 a.m. on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt just started shaking, you could actually feel the cars hitting the back of our train,\u201d said Samuel Rodriguez, an unemployed metalworker from Brownsville, Brooklyn, who had been sitting beside his mother as they traveled to Florida. \u201cSmoke. Screaming. I went to pick up one kid, checked my mother out to see if she was all right: \u2018Ma, you all right? Don\u2019t move.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Rodriguez continued: \u201cThat\u2019s when I went between aisles, and I saw a kid bleeding all over, his skull was showing, and his mother was in shock. So I run to the back, try to get to the bathroom. Bathroom\u2019s tore up, toilet bowl\u2019s out, everything\u2019s a disaster, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m still walking.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said his mother suffered a fractured nose and injured her leg in the crash, and was released from Lexington Medical Center in Columbia.\n\nOfficials said that about 115 other Amtrak passengers had been transferred to local hospitals. The CSX train did not have any passengers on board, Mr. McMaster said.\n\nIn a post on Twitter, President Trump expressed his condolences to victims of the crash and thanked emergency workers. Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican who represents this area, visited the Red Cross shelter and said he remained confident in Amtrak. But days after being aboard the train that derailed in Virginia, Mr. Wilson suggested that his experience on Sunday of seeing first responders and shaken passengers had been deeply unusual.", "title": "Fatal Amtrak Crash in South Carolina Is New Challenge for Rail Service", "authors": []}

He declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nBut in Mexico, the action carries tremendous political weight. The very step of defending himself against possible arrest would have been unthinkable for a man of his stature even a few years ago, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe investigation breaks the notion of the untouchable figure,\u201d said Vidal Romero, a political-science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. \u201cFigures like Beltrones being investigated \u2014 although the common belief is that it will be very difficult for him to actually go down \u2014 is a sign of a change that we are experiencing as a nation.\u201d\n\nDriving the case is the governor of Chihuahua, Javier Corral, a member of a rival party who has made it his mission to unearth the staggering corruption under his predecessor, a former stalwart in Mr. Beltrones\u2019s party.\n\nFew figures around the country have been willing to challenge the governing party as directly as Mr. Corral has. And in Mexico, where corruption investigations are often quashed or thwarted before they begin, his gambit has exposed notable weaknesses in the Mexican political system, rattling it at the highest levels.\n\n\u201cCorruption has made the establishment so fragile that one person can shake it,\u201d said Juan Pardinas, the general director of the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, an anticorruption group. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet if this person will win. The fight is still going, and the system is going to use all of its resources to stop it.\u201d\n\nThe case began in 2016, ahead of elections for state governors across Mexico. As president of the governing party, known as the P.R.I., Mr. Beltrones was in charge of its campaigns, an uphill battle given Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s low approval ratings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to former officials, politicians and analysts, using public resources for unauthorized political purposes is not a new phenomenon in Mexican politics. But 2016 was an especially challenging year for the P.R.I., given its low popularity.\n\nThe plan \u2014 according to court documents, bank records and a review of public contracts \u2014 was simple.\n\nThe federal government sent money to states controlled by P.R.I. governors under the premise of legitimate budgetary needs, according to testimony from cooperating witnesses and interviews with individuals familiar with how the arrangement worked.\n\nThat money was then sent to phony companies, which were supposed to fulfill state contracts for services like education. But ultimately, the money was funneled to campaigns, according to testimony from cooperating witnesses.\n\nIn Chihuahua, the amount totaled about $14 million, according to the government contracts and bank records reviewed by The Times. But individuals aware of the effort claim it went beyond a single state and were exerted nationwide.\n\nWhile the total amount funneled to other states is unclear, The Times found contracts and bank records that show millions of dollars went to some of the same phony companies, or companies connected to them, in the states of Sonora, Durango and Colima.\n\nBut for all the coordination, the P.R.I. campaigns may have been undone by the very corruption that was supposed to give them a boost.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn private conversations since the election, some officials have grumbled that, despite their best efforts, the money didn\u2019t always make it to the campaigns, according to two individuals with knowledge of the arrangement who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid incriminating themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlong the way, various intermediaries siphoned off portions of it, leaving the intended beneficiaries with less than promised, they said. The governing party, which had hoped to rise to victory on the back of corruption was instead undone by the corruption within its own ranks, they said.\n\nOne of the former deputies of the governing party, Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez, is accused of taking part of this, according to records presented by prosecutors in Chihuahua. Of the millions of dollars sent to Chihuahua for electoral purposes, Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez directed some $230,000 to a company he owned, the records show.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The P.R.I. lost elections in 7 states, including some where they had held power for more than 70 years, and Mr. Beltrones was forced to step down as party president. Then came the investigations under the new governor, Mr. Corral, whose efforts have put the entire party on alert.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Mr. Beltrones has been against the ropes. In various phases of his career, he has faced political exile, only to reinvent himself and work his way back into the halls of power.\n\nIn 1997, when he was the governor of the state of Sonora, Mr. Beltrones was accused by some American officials of having links to drug traffickers. The claims were serious enough that the American ambassador at the time considered revoking his Mr. Beltrones\u2019s visa to the United States.\n\nMost people thought Mr. Beltrones was done after that. He left his governorship and did not have another major political position for years. But by 2003, he was back, having found his way into the center of the action as a crucial intermediary between the P.R.I. and the administration of Vicente Fox, the first non-P.R.I. president in 70 years.\n\nA new era for Mr. Beltrones followed. He became known as a politician capable of maintaining power even when his party was in the opposition, able to broker deals with his rivals and retain his own influence, lawmakers recall.\n\nAs other politicians of his generation fell by the wayside, Mr. Beltrones evolved. Through charm, guile and a shrewd ability to read the winds of change, he galvanized his reputation as Mexico\u2019s timeless politician, the ultimate power broker even when his party was out of power.\n\nPerhaps his most powerful moment came when he allied himself with another former president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n of the rival National Action Party, whose election was so contested that one opposition party blocked his entry into Congress to keep him from being sworn in as president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Beltrones, according to some versions of the story, helped sneak Mr. Calderon into Congress using a back door. And then Mr. Beltrones helped ensure that his fellow party members from the P.R.I. were in attendance to achieve a quorum and allow Mr. Calder\u00f3n to be sworn in.\n\nSome Mexican lawmakers described Mr. Beltrones\u2019s role during Mr. Calderon\u2019s tenure as something of a prime minister. As the head of the opposition, Mr. Beltrones had tremendous power over the president\u2019s agenda, able to marshal his party members to approve or reject it.\n\nSupporters and critics alike say that Mr. Beltrones\u2019s reputation during this era as a politician willing to work with his rival has helped him remain in power.\n\n\u201cManlio has achieved longevity, which is rare in politics,\u201d said Eduardo Olmos, a former federal representative for the P.R.I. and an ally of Mr. Beltrones. \u201cHe has been coherent with his beliefs and actions \u2014 reliability, making deals, and effective dialogue with people who not only think differently than him but lead different political parties.\u201d\n\nMr. Beltrones has managed to garner respect from tough critics as well. Javier Garza, a former editor of the newspaper El Siglo de Torre\u00f3n, recalled an interview he had with Mr. Beltrones several years ago. The men talked for two hours, bouncing from tax reform to energy reform to education.\n\nMr. Garza said he was skeptical, leery of the politician\u2019s history. But as the meeting wore on, his reputation as corrupt dinosaur \u2014 a term sometimes used for veteran politicians here \u2014 gave way to surprise.\n\n\u201cWhen he left, I was like, \u2018Wow, I agree with this guy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Garza said. \u201cI mean, his tail hasn\u2019t even made its way out of the building yet, but he\u2019s convinced me.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Beltrones was named an official coordinator for the P.R.I. presidential candidate, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, who has been suffering heavily in the polls and has struggled to excite voters. Mr. Beltrones will take over coordination in several states \u2014 including Chihuahua, where the suspect financial dealings are under scrutiny.\n\nIt\u2019s a metric of how important Mr. Beltrones is to the party \u2014 and how much Mr. Meade needs a boost from the elder heavyweights of the P.R.I. \u2014 that he has been selected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe P.R.I. and Meade see him as essential to having any chance at election success,\u201d said Duncan Wood, the director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Mexico Institute.", "title": "Fearing Corruption Inquiry, Former Mexico Party Chief Moves to Block Arrest", "authors": ["Azam Ahmed"]}
{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "The scary take on higher yields: To some, the bond market is a particularly prescient predictor of economic trends. So is it picking up on an inflationary surge that the Federal Reserve likely will take too long to recognize? If there\u2019s a scenario guaranteed to scare investors, it\u2019s one in which the Fed, caught out by inflation, has to frantically jack up interest rates.\n\nBut the overheating fears may be overdone. The January inflation report was hardly conclusive. Mr. Feroli of JPMorgan, waving away sulfurous fumes for a second, said that the January increase \u201cprobably overstates the underlying trend.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the index overshot expectations because two items \u2014 clothing and medical services \u2014 had very strong increases, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics. Clothing was due for a big rebound because it seemed to lag a lot in recent months, Pantheon asserted. As for medical services, the jump there came from hospital costs, which Pantheon described as \u201cvery erratic.\u201d\n\nThe economy may not be as strong as it looks. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that the prevailing view on Wall Street was that the economy was stuck with sluggish growth and perennially low inflation. And even though there are reasons to believe the United States economy is breaking out of that rut \u2013 big tax cuts and a revival of the global economy \u2013 it may not be as vibrant as it looks.\n\nThe analysts at Hoisington Investment Management have in recent years highlighted stubborn weaknesses in the United States economy, and the firm still sees significant problems. They note, for instance, that disposable personal incomes, adjusted for inflation, only rose by 1.9 percent last year, an increase that was supported by borrowing. And consumers\u2019 lack of spending power may explain the weak retail sales that came out on Wednesday.\n\nBond yields may not rise much from here. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen in anticipation of an economic surge, only to fall again. That pattern may reoccur. Steven Major, global head of fixed-income research at HSBC, expects the yield on the 10-year Treasury to be at 2.3 percent by the end of the year, well below this week\u2019s level. He notes that, over the past decade, actual inflation has been significantly lower than the level implied by the price of the 10-year Treasury note and other Treasury securities. \u201cMy point is that higher inflation is already in the price,\u201d Mr. Major said in an email.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s 13F day.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission requires investment managers with more than $100 million in assets to file an update of their holdings within 45 days of the end of each quarter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWell, today is the 45th day, and here are some highlights from the holdings of some of the biggest hedge funds as of Dec. 31.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (via Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Sold nearly all of its IBM stake\n\n\u2022 Added more to its Apple holding\n\n\u2022 Made a new investment in Teva\n\nJana Partners (via Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Took new stakes in Comcast, Facebook and General Mortors\n\n\u2022 Exited Salesforce.com and Oracle\n\nThird Point (via Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Took new stakes in Netflix and Intercontinental Exchange\n\n\u2022 Exited its positions in Bank of America, T-Mobile US and Shire.\n\nAppaloosa Management (via Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Tripled its stake in Apple\n\n\u2022 Almost doubled its holding of Facebook\n\nElliott Management (via Bloomberg)\n\n\u2022 Pared its stake in Alcoa by almost two-thirds\n\nSoros Fund Management\n\n\u2022 Sold its stake in Alcoa\n\nPaulson & Co.\n\n\u2022 Maintained its stake in SPDR Gold Shares\n\nMoore Capital Management\n\n\u2022 Added to its Apple stake\n\nTiger Global Management\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Increased its Facebook stake\n\n\u2022 Lowered its stake in Netflix\n\nLone Pine Capital\n\n\u2022 Added to its Amazon wager.\n\n\u2022 Took a stake in Google-parent Alphabet\n\n\u2022 Reduced its Facebook stake\n\nCoatue Management\n\n\u2022 Reduce its stake in Apple and Facebook\n\nMaverick Capital\n\n\u2022 Lowered its stakes in Facebook and Alphabet\n\nPhoto\n\nGoldman adds a new co-head of global M.&A.\n\nThe investment bank named Dusty Philip as a co-head of its global mergers team.

Under the agreement, Fannie sends nearly all its profits to the government in the form of a dividend and operates with a limited capital buffer.\n\nAfter the quarter\u2019s planned infusion, Fannie will have sent $166.4 billion to the Treasury Department in total, compared with the $119.8 billion it has received from the government, according to the WSJ.\n\nPhoto\n\nExpect Wall Street to keep worrying about inflation.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index, a government yardstick of inflation, jumped 2.1 percent in January, from a year earlier. That is slightly above the 2 percent rate that Wall Street economists, surveyed by Bloomberg, forecast. The January rate is equal to December\u2019s increase of 2.1 percent.\n\nThe number didn\u2019t roil the markets, but they did move lower.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction to its prices, jumped to 2.87 percent after the inflation figure came out. Yields rise when prices fall.\n\nThe United States stocks market opened down with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index off 0.3 percent.\n\nInflation fears were perhaps the main cause of the recent plunge in the stock market. After an unexpectedly strong rise in wages, investors became concerned that costs of producing goods and services might be rising, which could in turn prompt the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than anticipated. Higher interest rates make stocks look like less attractive investments \u2013 and, in the longer run, they can slow down the economy and erode companies\u2019 earnings.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nWas the VIX fixed?\n\nFinra, Wall Street\u2019s self-regulatory agency, is looking into it. It\u2019s unclear whether this is a formal investigation, but the discovery of any misconduct would be a black eye for the CBOE, which runs the Volatility Index.\n\nOne theory is that someone could have swayed the VIX through bets on S. & P. 500 options.\n\nMore from Gunjan Banerji of the WSJ:\n\nLast week, the resurgence of market volatility triggered a spike in the VIX and the collapse of a widely traded E.T.P. that buys and sells VIX futures.

It was showered with awards and praise for appearing to perfect the art of \u201ccross selling,\u201d in which it found creative new ways to peddle financial products to its existing customers. The bank\u2019s savvy management of risk allowed it to avoid the worst of the financial crisis.\n\nWhile others retrenched, Wells Fargo substantially expanded, snapping up ailing North Carolina lender Wachovia, in late 2008. That acquisition was engineered in part by federal regulators, who viewed Wells as one of the country\u2019s strongest, best-run institutions.\n\nThat reputation has crumbled recently, though. Wells Fargo was found by regulators to have systematically created fake customer accounts and misled customers and government officials.\n\nIt is unclear what impact the Fed\u2019s penalties will have on Wells Fargo\u2019s future. The bank had nearly $2 trillion in assets at the end of 2017. Going forward, the Fed will not let Wells Fargo\u2019s average balance sheet expand beyond that size, according to a senior Fed official. Because large banks\u2019 assets tend to expand as the economy grows, the Fed believes that this limitation will be a significant constraint on the bank\u2019s ability to grow.\n\nOne of Wells Fargo\u2019s primary regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, slapped significant restrictions on the bank last year, when it gave it a failing score on a key community lending metric. The low grade meant that Wells Fargo would need to clear extra hurdles to open new branches or otherwise expand its retail banking business.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s board has already undergone a makeover in the wake of the scandal, although half of its current board \u2014 eight members \u2014 were there at the time the scandal erupted.

The filing seeks records of those transactions from Facebook, and it urges the company to assess whether Mr. Hun Sen and his allies have been violating the platform\u2019s terms of use.\n\nPhoto\n\nGenevieve Grdina, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment directly on the petition, but she said that anyone with a public Facebook page could purchase targeted ads to reach particular audiences, and that Facebook made every possible effort to identify and eliminate click farms and fake pages.\n\nMr. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 33 years, has overseen an extensive crackdown on dissent and opposition as national elections scheduled for July have approached. The country\u2019s main opposition party has been dissolved, its leaders \u2014 including Mr. Sam Rainsy, who lives abroad \u2014 have been driven into exile or jailed, and independent news media outlets have been shut down.\n\nMr. Hun Sen nearly lost Cambodia\u2019s last national elections, in 2013, to the party led by Mr. Sam Rainsy, which used Facebook to appeal to young people and to skirt government restrictions on his access to traditional media. The opposition recruited a team to report and broadcast news shows entirely on Facebook, and used young social media stars to encourage attendance at antigovernment protests. (The opposition and its supporters also used the site to spread false rumors, as well as racist claims about Vietnamese living in Cambodia.)\n\nMr. Hun Sen seemed to learn his lesson. The premier and his family assembled a team to disseminate pro-government propaganda and pour money into promoting their own pages on Facebook, which is one of the country\u2019s most popular sources of information. Government ministries, all of which are run by Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party, were ordered to form \u201cFacebook working groups,\u201d and officials were told to start their own personal pages to interact with the public.\n\nHowever his \u201clikes\u201d were generated, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page now has more of them than any other in Cambodia. On it, he intersperses policy dictates and slick propaganda videos with slices of everyday life: photographs of him in an undershirt on the beach, in bed with his wife, and hugging garment factory workers. In speeches posted to his page, he rails against his political opponents and threatens that war will ensue if he ever loses power, while also offering folksy musings and updates on his health.\n\nDuong Dara, who manages Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook presence, said Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition revealed a misunderstanding of the nature of advertising.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou can see many billboards on the street, and people are willing to pay for more advertising, and it brings more business,\u201d Mr. Duong Dara said. \u201cThis is normal and simple and everywhere.

In one of his many legal cases, he was convicted of defamation after complaining that the prime minister appeared to be purchasing Facebook \u201clikes\u201d from India and the Philippines.

One woman fled the country after being sought by the police for throwing a shoe at a sign advertising the Cambodian People\u2019s Party and uploading a video of the act to Facebook. On Thursday, Thailand sent her back to Cambodia, where she was taken into police custody.\n\nIn another case, a student was jailed for 18 months for calling for a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d on Facebook. No pro-government Facebook users have ever been prosecuted along similar lines.\n\nHuy Vannak, an under secretary of state at Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry who often speaks on behalf of the government on media-related matters, said on Thursday that Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition was \u201cstupid and funny.\u201d He said Facebook was a level playing field where both the government and the opposition were free to promote their pages and make appeals to voters.\n\n\u201cI just tell stupid Sam Rainsy that if he plays Facebook, he should know about this,\u201d Mr. Huy Vannak said. \u201cFacebook has room for everyone to pay and boost their Facebook \u2018likes.\u2019 This is reality.

Before his programs last week, the American Adam Rippon spent the last minute circling the ice as if he were a short-track skater.\n\n\u201cI like to do laps because I feel it sometimes may make the other skaters nervous that I finished early,\u201d Rippon said last month, \u201cand I always smile at all the judges when I go by.\u201d\n\nMa\u00e9-B\u00e9r\u00e9nice M\u00e9it\u00e9, who is competing in her second Olympics for France, said the warm-up settles her mind.\n\n\u201cIf you have some troubles, you\u2019re more aware of what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you are good, you just have to keep going and be the same in your program.\u201d\n\nSkating etiquette calls for big jumpers to be afforded more space. Everyone is supposed to negotiate traffic on the ice like cars merging onto the highway. But as anyone possessing a driver\u2019s license knows, there\u2019s often one aggressive driver who will veer into another\u2019s space rather than follow the zipper method for merging.\n\nNear collisions, accidental or not, do happen in warm-ups, which is perhaps to be expected whenever two or more competitors are skating backward. Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, who successfully defended his men\u2019s singles title last week, collided with Han Yan of China near center ice during warm-ups at the Cup of China several months after his 2014 Olympic victory. Both skaters completed their long programs, although Hanyu skated with his head bandaged and fell five times.\n\nMishaps of that magnitude occur more often at practice sessions, which are an elongated version of the warm-up. Rippon said that during a practice a few years ago, he accidentally head-butted a competitor, who had to withdraw from the competition with a concussion. And Sasha Cohen, the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, once required 21 stitches after her calf was sliced by the blade of a competitor who collided with her while landing a jump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt an event in the United States during in the lead-up to the 2002 Olympics, Cohen brushed Michelle Kwan in the warm-up. By the time she became an Olympic medalist four years later, Cohen was known as a buzz-by artist who did not respect her opponents\u2019 personal space. Cohen said she was aware of her reputation but added that she never took aim at anyone.\n\n\u201cYou only have six minutes and everyone is aggressive with their space in order to get in everything they need to in order to feel prepared,\u201d Cohen said in an email. \u201cThat can mean having to jump almost on top of someone to avoid having to circle and do it again.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This is all about me.\u201d\n\nScott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic men\u2019s singles champion and an NBC commentator, said he competed against a few skaters \u201cwho would try to intimidate you, accidentally get in your way, accidentally pull your focus.\u201d\n\nBut Hamilton said he was always too absorbed with \u201cgetting through my Rolodex of jumps,\u201d as he put it, to be bothered. \u201cI had a couple of competitors who would try to suck up all the air in the room, and it honestly didn\u2019t really work,\u201d he said.\n\nThe most overt show of gamesmanship that Hamilton said he ever experienced came after a warm-up. An opponent finished his program, and as he was leaving the ice, he looked over at Hamilton, who was skating next, and said, \u201cin a very cocky way, \u2018Well, now, you have to skate perfect,\u2019\u201d Hamilton recalled. \u201cAnd I just looked at him and said, \u2018No problem.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Figure Skating Warm-Ups Can Cement Confidence.

In summertime, farmers\u2019 market tables overflow with greens, and garden zucchinis swell to the size of small dogs in the all-night light. But now is the season of austerity and anticipation. Though each day brings a few more minutes of light, the root-cellar stock has dwindled down to last summer\u2019s dry-skinned beets, gnarled carrots and potatoes with eyes. All those blocks of frozen sockeye in the chest freezer don\u2019t have the same appeal that they did in November.\n\nThe grocery store isn\u2019t much relief. About 95 percent of all the food Alaskans eat comes from somewhere else, according to the Alaska Food Policy Council. The bulk of it travels by highway to Seattle, then floats roughly 1,600 miles north by sea, a trip that can take a week inside a dark container.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy the time they get here, tomatoes have become ghosts, their flesh pinkish and watery. Avocados are hard but rotten around the pit. Boxed, prewashed lettuces often arrive with an odor of decay. But fresh food is still expensive, and there isn\u2019t always enough \u2014 especially on Sunday afternoons, when whole swaths of the produce section are frequently bare.\n\nFruit and vegetables come to one of Alaska\u2019s largest grocers, Fred Meyer, in just two or three weekly shipments, said Steve Lacy, the food safety manager. The challenge of keeping food fresh and costs down, and dealing with unexpected delays caused by weather or shipping breakdowns forces grocers to troubleshoot constantly, he said.\n\nBetween shipments, stores can\u2019t always keep up with the demand. \u201cOut of stocks,\u201d the grocery business term for empty shelves, are a fact of life. The farther from Anchorage shoppers are, the more often they encounter them. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way around it,\u201d Mr. Lacy said.\n\nBut resourceful Alaskans find a way. Pineapples peek out of carry-on luggage. Meyer lemons arrive from relatives by FedEx. An Alaskan might forgo a latte to pay $5 for a single perfect Sumo mandarin orange, flown in by New Sagaya, the city\u2019s largest gourmet market.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeah Glasscock-Sanders, a recess attendant at a charter school in Wasilla, an Anchorage suburb, always plans her shopping in the early mornings to get the best selection. Even so, she sometimes can\u2019t find what she needs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cleaned out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere might be five bell peppers to choose from when I get there, and they would all be of a quality I wouldn\u2019t purchase.\u201d\n\nAll of this deprivation can lead to unusual relationships. Maybe there\u2019s a \u201cpeach guy\u201d you meet in a parking lot, and you trade $70 in cash for a case of what\u2019s in his trunk. Or, if you live way up north, you may plead on Facebook for someone, anyone, to tuck an avocado into a pocket when he gets on a bush plane to your village. And you may think about it for days until it arrives, as you watch Giada and the Barefoot Contessa on cable.\n\nAnd then, after you thank whoever brought you the avocado with some caribou meat from your freezer, you may cut it in half and share it with your best friend, keeping it a secret from the children.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was about three years ago when Kim Sun\u00e9e, a memoirist and cookbook author, entered into an inventory-related texting relationship with some supermarket produce workers. Soon she was bringing the green-aproned men a quiche or a pan of lemon-raspberry rolls with cream cheese frosting. Now a little buzz in her pocket tells her when the store has a clutch of fresh organic figs, or white asparagus or pea shoots or passion fruit.\n\n\u201cYou have to cultivate these relationships when you are living in a place like this,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Sun\u00e9e still spends good money on mail order (ask her about shipping pastrami-cured salmon and bagels) from the New York deli Russ & Daughters. Once, she carried a leg of prosciutto di Parma all the way from Italy.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve smuggled back some things,\u201d she said.\n\nMaya Wilson moved to Nikiski, south of Anchorage, from California in 2011 to help pastor a church. The grocery store was more than an hour away, and she started a blog, Alaska From Scratch, tapping into her feelings of isolation, and making recipes for things she craved but couldn\u2019t easily find, like pumpkin spice coffee creamer and pillowy Lofthouse sugar cookies.\n\nHer blog audience grew every day, and her Instagram feed now has more than 54,000 followers. \u201cThe Alaska From Scratch Cookbook\u201d (Rodale) is due out this week.\n\nPhoto\n\nIsolation stokes her imagination, she said; cravings motivate her. They make Alaska a perfect laboratory for writing recipes. No pine nuts? Use pistachios. No lemons? Try oranges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI cannot tell you how many times I envisioned a recipe and I went to the store and I couldn\u2019t find the ingredients,\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \u201cI was so spoiled in California. Alaska has made me such a much more self-sufficient human being.\u201d\n\nIt used to be worse. Maybe 50 years ago, most winter vegetables and fruit came frozen or in a can. Many Anchorage children first encountered cherries, for example, in canned fruit cocktail, waxy and pink.\n\nAllison Warden, an artist and rapper who lives in Anchorage, is Inupiaq, with roots in the far-north village of Kaktovik. She lives with her mother, and they share a freezer full of wild foods: caribou, walrus, seal, whitefish, duck, seal liver and whale, mostly supplied by family.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen money is tight in winter, Ms. Warden finds herself eating traditional proteins and rice, but her fantasies are full of tropical fruit. She still remembers eating her first mango, when she was 28, on a trip to New York.\n\n\u201cIt was the most amazing thing ever that I never thought I could ever taste,\u201d she said.\n\nKate Consenstein, who owns a communications business in Anchorage, believes in eating seasonally, but then something comes over her when she glimpses an exotic fruit among the waxy apples and leathery oranges in Safeway, like a four-leaf clover in the grass.\n\n\u201cWhen you live in Alaska and, like, a dragon fruit waves at you from a stack at the grocery store, I run at it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m moved by its gravitational pull. I want that sweet brightness. I want it in my mouth. Then I get to the register and it\u2019s 20 freaking dollars. And I am like, so be it.\u201d\n\nMr. Watt, the chef at Fire Island bakery, is originally from South Carolina. He decided years ago to lean into Alaska\u2019s extremes, rather than resist them. His approach to winter cooking is to embrace the austerity and master what\u2019s left in the root cellar and freezer.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou learn what potato to get in order to get that perfect crispy exterior and the buttery interior,\u201d he said. \u201cYou figure out that roasting a whole carrot until it turns black is delicious.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlaska summers, short and lush, are electric, the long days packed with activity. In winter, he said, you get to catch your breath and revel in the slowness. You study the incremental return of the light, enjoy anticipation, get drunk on spring when it comes. Once you understand how all that works, you can call yourself Alaskan.\n\n\u201cThis is your penance,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get through it. Then you\u2019re rewarded, slowly at first with a few radishes and maybe a little bit of greens, and later with, like, everything.

It was doled out as a form of political patronage and possessing a few strands became a status symbol.\n\nThe hair has been woven into rings and other jewelry, and Professor Beutler said it had even been part of dubious science experiments, including one, in 1849, in which the tensile strength of Washington\u2019s hair was studied against hair belonging to African-Americans and Native Americans.\n\nFor centuries now, hair that was believed to have come from Washington\u2019s scalp has been discovered in attics and amid family heirlooms. The New York Times reported in 1905 that Mrs. William McGarrett of Harrison, N.J., found strands of hair in a cedar box in her home, along with an affidavit declaring its authenticity and a note saying, \u201cThe God-like Washington, died 14th Dec., 1799.

Dennis, a Gullah chef from Charleston, was stunned to find the rice growing in a field in Trinidad, tended by a farmer descended from slaves who once lived in Georgia.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Dennis had heard about hill rice \u2014 also known as upland red bearded rice or Moruga Hill rice \u2014 through the culinary organization Slow Food USA and the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, the group that brought back Carolina Gold in the early 2000s. He\u2019d also heard stories about it from elderly cooks in his community. Like everyone else, he thought the hill rice of the African diaspora was lost forever.\n\nBut then, on a rainy morning in the Trinidad hills in December 2016, he walked past coconut trees and towering okra plants to the edge of a field with ripe stalks of rice, each grain covered in a reddish husk and sprouting spiky tufts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHere I am looking at this rice and I said: \u2018Wow. Wait a minute. This is that rice that\u2019s missing,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIt is hard to overstate how shocked the people who study rice were to learn that the long-lost American hill rice was alive and growing in the Caribbean. Horticulturists at the Smithsonian Institution want to grow it, rice geneticists at New York University are testing it and the United States Department of Agriculture is reviewing it. If all goes well, it may become a commercial crop in America, and a menu staple as diners develop a deeper appreciation for African-American food.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most historically significant African diaspora grain in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d said David S. Shields, a professor at the University of South Carolina and chairman of the Carolina Gold Rice Foundation, who works with Mr. Dennis on historical culinary projects and was with him that rainy day in Trinidad.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Dennis, 38, believes food is the living bearer of history. He has devoted himself to promoting the cooking of the Gullah-Geechee Nation, the descendants of West Africans who lived along the coast from North Carolina to North Florida. Their cooks created the peanut stews, okra-laced purloos and seafood that define Lowcountry cuisine.\n\n\u201cWhat I am doing is searching for my culture through food,\u201d he said.\n\nBut how did the rice travel to that field in Trinidad? Dr. Shields has a theory.\n\nIt begins during the War of 1812, when British soldiers promised land and freedom to a small group of West African slaves along the Eastern Seaboard if they would take up arms against their masters. They did, and each was given 16 acres of undeveloped land in southern Trinidad. They came to be called the Merikins, a Creole rendering of the word American.\n\nOne group was the Fourth British Marine Company, from the Georgia Sea Islands. The rice, which Dr. Shields believes can be traced to Jefferson\u2019s barrel of seed, was among the crops the group brought with them to Trinidad.\n\nThe missing piece of the puzzle would have not been found if it hadn\u2019t been for Trinidadian ethnobotanist Francis Morean, a man with Merikin roots who has recorded interviews with most of the 60 or so Merikins still growing hill rice on the island.\n\nFLorida 400 miles BAHAMAS Atlantic Ocean CUBA PUERTO RICO HAITI JAMAICA DOMINICAN REPUBLIC Caribbean Sea Area of detail VENEZUELA TOBAGO 20 miles TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO Caribbean Sea Port-of-Spain Atlantic Ocean TRINIDAD San Fernando Moruga\n\nMr. Morean had traveled to the American South in September 2015 as part of his exploration of African diaspora cooking. He had heard about Mr. Dennis, but wasn\u2019t able to find him. Then, a few months later, Mr. Dennis reached out to him on Facebook, and the two bonded over their interest in using agriculture to keep their shared heritage alive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, no one had made the connection between the rice in Trinidad and the rice that had been lost in the American South. Most students of Gullah-Geechee cuisine thought Carolina Gold was the only rice that enslaved Africans in the coastal South had cooked.\n\nMr. Morean organized a small rice symposium in Trinidad in the winter of 2016, and asked Dr. Shields to present a paper on the island\u2019s hill rice. Also on the guest list were Mr. Dennis and Queen Quet Marquetta L. Goodwine, the elected leader and official spokeswoman of the Gullah-Geechee Nation, who often employs Mr. Dennis to cook for official events.\n\nDr. Shields, who is part of a global effort to find new ways to grow rice on dry land, began his research, and realized that the Trinidad hill rice might be linked to the missing American rice, which in turn could be traced all the way back to the West African rice fields.\n\nOn that wet morning in Moruga, Trinidad, he had his answer.\n\n\u201cWhen I got out of the car and walked toward the field and saw the rice just about to be harvested, I knew it had to be the real thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like you see the story made flesh. You see something that has existed as really an abstract possibility suddenly become real.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nGlenn Roberts, the founder of Anson Mills, immediately jumped on board. There is no one as fanatic about Southern heirloom grains as Mr. Roberts, whose South Carolina company led the revival of Carolina Gold rice and several other Southern heirloom grains.\n\nMr. Roberts arranged to have about 80 pounds of the Trinidad rice shipped to the United States. A few pounds made its way to Edouardo Jordan, the Southern chef who opened the restaurant Junebaby in Seattle last year. Mr. Jordan cooked with it and loved it.\n\nThe rice performs differently in the kitchen than Carolina Gold, which works best in wet or creamy recipes like Hoppin\u2019 John or risotto. Hill rice is better dry, with an okra stew or a saut\u00e9 or chutney piled on top.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jordan is so enamored that he is trying to find farmers in the Northwest to grow it, once the seed is approved by the Agriculture Department.\n\n\u201cIf we can bring this back,\u201d he said, \u201cthe historical back story could deepen the development of African diaspora food in America and better tell the real story of Southern food.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt another rice symposium held by the Carolina Rice Foundation in April, Mr. Dennis prepared hill rice for everyone. He cooked it the way he had learned to during his time in Trinidad, simmering it in coconut water until the rice became starchy. Then he covered the rice with chutney made from grinding toasted benne seeds; an herb called shadow benne that is similar to cilantro; some bird\u2019s-eye peppers, and garlic with a little oil. It was delicious.\n\nLike many a detective story, this one has some loose ends.\n\nMichael Purugganan, a New York University biology professor, was at the Charleston event. He had been part of a team that in 2015 sequenced the genomes of Oryza glaberrima, the African crop now grown by descendants of escaped slaves in the South American country Suriname, and connected it to rice that grew in Ivory Coast.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Dr. Purugganan took the rice to his laboratory in Greenwich Village and sequenced its genes.\n\nIt turned out not to be indigenous African glaberrima, but more likely a Japonica rice that made its way from Southeast Asia to West Africa between the 16th and 18th centuries.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmy Lawton-Rauh, a Clemson University professor of genetics and biochemistry who is working on the genetics of hill rice, is using population genomics tools to test whether the hill rice has a more complex history. It could even be a hybrid, she said, and not necessarily linked to Jefferson\u2019s rice.\n\nSo much rice may have been passed around among slave families and descendants that there is no way to be certain where the seed originated, said Christopher Wilson, director of experience design at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt might be too much to just give credit to Jefferson,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cWe know about him because we have records. But people miss just how big rice was, and how much money was involved and how much history we have no written record of.\u201d\n\nStill, he is as excited as anyone about the hill rice. He has introduced Mr. Roberts to a horticulturist at the Smithsonian to grow and display some of the hill rice. Last summer, Mr. Wilson invited Mr. Roberts to discuss the rice alongside Michael Twitty, a culinary historian and the author of \u201dThe Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African American Culinary History in the Old South\u201d at a Smithsonian event.\n\nMr. Twitty, who first heard about the rice from Mr. Dennis, has embraced it.

They\u2019ve taken a skeptical and lively interest in the public pressures shaping our private bonds. In many cases, they puzzle over one question: Why is this institution, long regarded as desirable, even compulsory, falling out of favor around the world?\n\nInspired by a similar curiosity, two new books \u2014 \u201cLeftover in China\u201d and \u201cThe Heart Is a Shifting Sea\u201d \u2014 look to China and India, respectively, to assess how marriage withstands breakneck economic growth, social change and the increasing financial independence of women.

In 1949, 75 percent of Chinese women were illiterate. Today, China has one of the lowest rates of female illiteracy in the world \u2014 as well as the highest percentage of self-made female billionaires. She explains that the draconian one-child policy meant that families had to pour their resources into their only child, even if that child was a girl (and escaped sex-selective abortion, that is). Those daughters have grown into accomplished, tragically single women. They have so outpaced men professionally they can\u2019t find suitable partners.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIs that it? Or is it that their ambition itself has rendered them undesirable? Or that dating is such a novel concept in China that men and women don\u2019t know how to talk to each other? Lake entertains all these ideas in a confused fashion. What she doesn\u2019t do is give sufficient space to Chinese women to explain their decisions and desires themselves. When that happens, in a fleeting scene halfway through the book, a more intriguing picture emerges. The female founder of a dating website tells her: \u201cMost of these so-called leftover women have voluntarily chosen their lifestyle.\u201d Lake scarcely grapples with the implication of this statement \u2014 how could she?

Heather is happy to be Colin\u2019s oracle, his nemesis, his rival and his fiend \u2014 but definitely not his protector.\n\nWhen their father dies two days later, shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide, it is clear that even if Heather were really able to tell the future, such warnings were never meant to help anyone.

The project, from the Bluestone Organization and other developers, began demolitions in January, but only after lawsuits had delayed the project for years.\n\nSupporters of projects like Broad Street say they promise to add a jolt of youthful energy to a population that is aging. But critics say shoehorning hundreds of new residents into dense blocks will worsen congestion.\n\nSteering clear of any controversy, the association has stayed neutral. \u201cWe will see what happens,\u201d said Mr. Justino, 62, who works in the construction machinery business and has lived in Fleetwood since 1986, when he bought a stone-and-stucco house for $250,000.\n\nFor others, both sides have merits.

At the southern end is a hodgepodge of Arts and Crafts bungalows, Dutch colonial-style homes and midcentury Capes on small lots. Worn multifamily homes pack streets like North Fulton Avenue.\n\nWhat seems to be one of the biggest collections of co-ops outside New York City crams this area, too. The red-brick, U-shaped Westchester Gardens on Gramatan Avenue, set back from the sidewalk by lawns, is the oldest, from 1924; it went up soon after Fleetwood\u2019s passenger railroad stop was built.\n\nOther co-ops, with Tudor facades, are tucked here and there, like Grand Gardens, on West Grand Street, with apartments that offer archways, moldings and eat-in kitchens.\n\nNorth of the Cross County Parkway, which slashes through, there is a different feel. Single-family homes sit on larger lots, and some streets end in hushed cul-de-sacs. It can be tough to tell where Fleetwood ends and the village of Bronxville begins; there are few signs, and the rich housing stock seems nearly identical.\n\nNeighborhoods within neighborhoods include Pasadena Park, with postwar colonial-style homes and raised ranches, and Aubyn Manor, where you can find historic Tudors. But these place names live on mostly through brokers.\n\nPhoto\n\nBesides that Broad Street tower, planned complexes include a $48 million, five-building rental complex with 179 apartments on MacQuesten Parkway. The first building will open in spring 2019, said Sam Mermelstein, director of development for Enclave Equities, the developer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd this winter, Mount Vernon\u2019s zoning and planning boards approved a 44-unit complex for East Broad Street.\n\nIf the architecture is diverse, so is the populace. Non-Hispanic white people represent 38 percent; non-Hispanic black people, 39 percent; and Hispanic people, 18 percent, according to the Queens College sociology department.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\n\nOn Feb. 20, there were 67 houses, condos and co-ops listed for sale on Zillow. At the high end was a five-bedroom Georgian from 1932 at $1.29 million; the least expensive was a one-bedroom co-op at $125,000.\n\nPrices seem to have declined slightly in the past year. In December 2017, the median list price was $150,000, according to Zillow, but the median in December 2016 (the oldest month for which Zillow has data) was $162,000. The high point was in May 2017, when the median was $195,000, according to Zillow, which measures the median on a month-by-month basis.\n\nRenters account for 43 percent of all households, high by suburban standards. An upscale option is the Princeton, on North Terrace Avenue: Studios are about $1,450 a month, and one-bedrooms, $1,800. Less-expensive options include Colonial Village, a red-brick complex where a studio was listed on Zillow for $1,250.\n\nThe Vibe\n\nA park on Broad Street West with climbing equipment, benches and a gazebo doubles as a village green. Concerts, movie nights and a Halloween party, hosted by the neighborhood association, take place there. A half dozen blocks away is Hunt Woods, a park popular with dog walkers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

On state English exams last year, 32 percent of students met standards, versus 40 percent statewide, according to state figures; on state math exams, 26 percent met standards, versus 40 percent statewide.\n\nMount Vernon High School enrolls about 1,400 students and has a 66 percent graduation rate, state figures show, compared with an 80 percent graduation rate statewide. On SAT exams last year, students scored an average of 413 on the reading and writing section, and 399 on the math section; statewide averages were 528 and 523, respectively.\n\nThe Commute\n\nMetro-North\u2019s Harlem line serves Fleetwood. Eight trains depart for Grand Central between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., with the quickest, at 8:06 a.m., taking 28 minutes. Monthly fares are $239.\n\nA narrow staircase runs to the station from Locust Street, or commuters can park at the station for $150 a month. There is no wait list for permits.\n\nWestchester County\u2019s Bee Line bus system also has several routes. And highways are never far.\n\nThe History\n\nFrom 1904 to 1914, Bronxville\u2019s Siwanoy Golf Club occupied a 95-acre site in Fleetwood. The subsequent owner, a Manhattan banker named Jesse Winburn, sought to turn it into a golf course for men only. But in 1925, Westchester County took 34 acres, for $142,800, to create the road that became the Cross County Parkway, according to The New York Times.\n\nMr. Winburn thought women had killed his plans, or those \u201cwho didn\u2019t like the idea of not getting to play golf on a course they had used when it was occupied by Siwanoy,\u201d he told The Times. The remaining 61 acres were sold as building sites.

In upscale buildings that go all out to pamper residents, a feature that requires exertion might seem counterintuitive.

This was a multisystem failure.\u201d\n\nThe state agency investigated whether Mr. Cruz intended to harm himself in September 2016, when he made the alarming social media posts after an argument with his mother. Mr. Cruz, who had depression, was upset over a breakup with a girlfriend, his mother, Lynda Cruz, told investigators. The report does not say who called in the complaint, which was given \u201cimmediate\u201d priority.\n\nThe report shows that investigators closed the case about two months later. The agency determined that the \u201cfinal level of risk is low\u201d \u2014 an analysis that one of Mr. Cruz\u2019s counselors at his school felt was premature \u2014 because his mother was caring for him, he was enrolled in school and he was receiving counseling. By the time of the shooting, however, Mr. Cruz had lost at least two of those elements: His mother was dead, and he had left Stoneman Douglas High School. It is unclear if he was still seeing a counselor.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cruz, 19, showed up at Stoneman Douglas and unleashed more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle he purchased last February, five months after the state investigation closed. As of Saturday evening, two Broward hospitals were still treating four patients in fair condition, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman.\n\nThe office of Mr. Finkelstein, the public defender, suggested that it had offered prosecutors a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows he is guilty. What we are saying is, let\u2019s put him away for life,\u201d Mr. Finkelstein said. \u201cWe are not saying the death penalty is not justified; we are saying, let\u2019s not put this community through the trauma and pain of a trial knowing that, three years down the road, one juror could keep him from being put to death.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Florida, the death penalty requires a decision by a unanimous jury.\n\nMichael J. Satz, the state attorney, said prosecutors would announce their position on the death penalty \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis certainly is the type of case the death penalty was designed for,\u201d Mr. Satz said in a statement. \u201cThis was a highly calculated and premeditated murder of 17 people and the attempted murder of everyone in that school.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s school disciplinary records show he attended at least six schools, including Cross Creek School, a school for students with emotional problems; Dave Thomas Education Center, an alternative high school for at-risk youth; and an adult education center. He was first identified as developmentally delayed in 2002, when he was 4 years old.\n\nIn incidents that began in 2012, when Mr. Cruz was 13, he was disciplined for being disobedient and unruly. In 2013, the records suggest, he was counseled for making a false 911 call.\n\nHe was suspended several times in the 2016-17 school year, his last year at Stoneman Douglas, and was frequently reported for prolonged and unexplained absences. In September 2016, he was suspended for two days for fighting, only to return and get suspended again nine days after the fight, this time for hurling profane insults.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The investigation, first reported by The Sun-Sentinel of South Florida on Friday, was obtained by The Times on Saturday. The state agency had petitioned a court on Friday to make the confidential records public, but the court has yet to do so.\n\n\u201cMental health services and supports were in place when this investigation closed,\u201d Mike Carroll, the secretary of the Department of Children and Families, said in a statement. Mr. Cruz was investigated as an adult, and the investigation appeared aimed at determining whether he was being neglected.\n\nAgency investigators identified Mr. Cruz, who had turned 18 a few days earlier, as a \u201cvulnerable adult due to mental illness.\u201d In addition to depression, Mr. Cruz had autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, the report said. He was regularly taking medication for the A.D.H.D. It was unclear whether he was taking anything for the depression, according to the report.\n\nAfter the argument with his mother, an investigator visited the family\u2019s home in Parkland, which was clean, clutter-free and did not present any foul odors. The investigator did not see the cuts on Mr. Cruz\u2019s arms: He was wearing long sleeves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMr. Cruz stated that he plans to go out and buy a gun,\u201d the report states. \u201cIt is unknown what he is buying the gun for.\u201d\n\nHis mother denied that she and her son had argued. She told the investigator that Mr. Cruz did not have a gun, though he did have an air gun she would take away from him when he did not follow rules about shooting only at backyard targets.\n\nHis mother, who died in November, told investigators she attributed Mr. Cruz\u2019s behavior to \u201ca breakup with a girl.\u201d Ms. Cruz \u201cstated that she and the girl\u2019s mother told the kids they had to end the relationship because it was unhealthy for everyone,\u201d the report said. Neither the girl nor her mother are named in the report.\n\nA year before, it was discovered that Mr. Cruz had a Nazi symbol and a racial slur on his book bag. His mother said that when she confronted her son about it, Mr. Cruz purported to not know what the sign meant, and she said the family had never expressed negative sentiments toward people of other races. She made him clean it off his bag.\n\nThe report noted that a mental health center had been contacted in the past to detain Mr. Cruz under Florida\u2019s Baker Act, which allows the state to hospitalize people for several days if they are a threat to themselves or others. The center determined that he was not such a threat. Had Mr. Cruz been involuntarily committed, state law could have prohibited him from buying a firearm.\n\nThe mental health counselor, from Henderson Behavioral Health, had also visited Mr. Cruz at home and had him sign a safety contract.\n\nDespite the assessment, a school counselor remained concerned.\n\n\u201cShe said Henderson found him stable enough not to be hospitalized,\u201d the Department of Children and Families investigator wrote of the school counselor. \u201cShe stated that the concern she and the other staff had was to ensure that the assessment of Henderson was not premature.\u201d\n\nHenderson Behavioral Health would not comment on Saturday. Neither the mental health counselor nor the school counselor could be reached.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to the report, investigators also tried to speak to a school police officer, who declined to cooperate.\n\nThe Department of Children and Families would have had no way to know if Mr. Cruz\u2019s behavior became more erratic after losing his mother because the agency is not automatically notified of a caretaker\u2019s death, said George Sheldon, a former department secretary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to second-guess because we don\u2019t know everything that the department knew at the time, but clearly this young man was showing serious signs of a mental health disorder, something that does not pop up overnight,\u201d said Mr. Sheldon, who left the department in 2011 and now oversees a nonprofit foster-care agency in Miami. \u201cHe was troubled and about to explode.

They met with Representative Patricia H. Williams, a Democrat, and Senator Debbie Mayfield, a Republican. Ms. Mayfield said that changes were needed, perhaps including raising the minimum age to buy powerful weapons, but she rebuffed criticism from a student, Daniel Bishop, 16, that such a change would not actually prevent deaths.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop crazies,\u201d she told the group.\n\nAfterward, Amanda De La Cruz, 16, looked distraught. \u201cI want the ban on semiautomatic weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the crazies.\u201d\n\nThen they headed to the House floor, where the powerful speaker of the House, Richard Corcoran, a Republican, had agreed to take their questions.\n\nStanding at the front of the chamber, he promised to unveil what he said would be the most sweeping gun reform package in the nation\u2019s history by Thursday or Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen a 16-year-old student named Alondra Gittelson raised her hand.\n\n\u201cI just want to know why such a destructive gun is accessible to the public \u2014 why that gun, the AR-15, that did so much damage, how is an individual in society able to acquire such a gun?\u201d\n\nMr. Corcoran responded that he would not be in favor of banning weapons like the one used in the attack on the students.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think that if you look, it\u2019s widely used in multiple different hunting scenarios,\u201d he said. \u201cI know people who go out and they\u2019ll do boar hunts and they\u2019ll use them.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou can disagree, but what I tell my kids \u2014 and being in elected office, you have to be very, very, very careful how much authority and power you bring to government.

Their school was now a place filled with grief counselors, comfort dogs, and posters of sympathy and solidarity from high schools across the country.\n\nThe three-story freshman building, where most of the bloodshed occurred, remained fenced off and closed, and it will not reopen for classes.

But as they walked into the school, some said they were growing angrier over reports that have raised questions about the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office, including how its officers responded to the shooting and how earlier warnings about the suspected gunman were handled.\n\nSheriff Scott Israel defended his actions as \u201camazing leadership\u201d on Sunday during a tense interview broadcast on CNN. The sheriff, a Democrat who won re-election to the post easily in 2016, said he would not resign, despite growing criticism of his deputies\u2019 actions.\n\nThe speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and dozens of other Republican lawmakers on Sunday called on Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican, to use his authority to suspend the sheriff from office.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe governor\u2019s office announced that state officials would conduct an investigation of the law enforcement response to the shooting. Sheriff Israel\u2019s office said it welcomed the governor\u2019s move and would cooperate with the investigation.\n\nSheriff Israel said he should not be held responsible for the armed deputy assigned to the school, who failed to enter the building to confront the gunman while the massacre was in progress. That deputy has resigned, and the sheriff said he would investigate whether others arriving on the scene also held back.\n\n\u201cDeputies make mistakes,\u201d the sheriff said on the CNN program, \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cPolice officers make mistakes.

They spoke of feeling panicky and queasy, and of asking parents and older siblings to accompany them.\n\nTyjanai Thomas, 15, said that she had seen her freshman geography teacher gunned down, and that she was focusing on staying calm. On the sidewalk outside, she held tight to a pearl pendant that hung on a silver chain around her neck \u2014 a gift from her godmother, she said.

Last year, he opened a second branch in New Canaan. With rates of $10,500 to $17,500 a person a month that are not covered by insurance, these homes are not for people of modest means.\n\nThe house in New Canaan is 8,000 square feet and valued at more than $4.5 million. It is decorated like a home in a design magazine; the basement contains a golf simulator.\n\nBut Lighthouse homes are more than a comfortable living space; they provide support and accountability for residents who go to work during the day and come back at night. In addition to their counseling and treatment sessions, residents are required to use a Breathalyzer and attend a weekly house meeting.\n\nOther facilities are offering treatment programs aimed at executives.\n\nSilver Hill is starting an executive program in conjunction with the Yale School of Medicine next month.

Peters.\n\n144 pp. New Directions. $16.95.\n\nONE DAY WHEN I was about 14 or 15 and wandering the aisles of a bookstore in Southern California, my eyes were drawn to \u201cEndless Life,\u201d a collection of poems by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. I grew up in a conservative household in an even more conservative neighborhood, and I doubt I\u2019d had any exposure, up till that point, to Ferlinghetti and his transcontinental, transcendental comrades known as the Beats. All I knew, as I flipped through the book, was that the words were bouncing around the page:\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat is this? I thought. Why is this guy allowed to write that way? To a teenager with an inchoate interest in language, those leaping lines conveyed a swig of freedom:\n\nPhoto\n\nI had never bought a book of poetry before \u2014 at that age, doing so had never crossed my mind \u2014 but I bought \u201cEndless Life,\u201d kick-starting a habit of impulse purchasing that continues to this day. I spent time with it. Ferlinghetti\u2019s \u201cspontaneous\u201d transgressions of punctuation and spacing appealed to a kid who was warming up to the intoxicating provocations of punk rock, and I can\u2019t be alone in having had that response. Unscientific polling over the years has led me to believe that Ferlinghetti (like E. E. Cummings and Charles Bukowski) used to be something of a gateway poet for young people in America, and a residue of nostalgic fondness remains even for those readers who have moved on to ostensibly more sophisticated stuff. (If you\u2019re looking for a contemporary analogy, one can hope that thousands of Rupi Kaur fans will eventually find their way to, say, Louise Gl\u00fcck and Nikky Finney.) Whenever I\u2019m visiting San Francisco, I still make a pilgrimage to City Lights, the North Beach bookstore, founded by Ferlinghetti, that stands as a kind of Plymouth Rock for American poetry and progressive thought.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut how does Ferlinghetti\u2019s work hold up now? (Ferlinghetti himself has held up well. At press time, he is still alive and nearing his 99th birthday.) As a publisher, a patron of the arts and a free-speech pioneer, he has been rightly celebrated for decades; he played a crucial role in the defense of Allen Ginsberg\u2019s \u201cHowl,\u201d even winning an obscenity case for daring to publish that zeitgeist-capturing incantation.\n\nYeah, O.K. \u2014 but what about his writing? The release of \u201cFerlinghetti\u2019s Greatest Poems\u201d (I wish New Directions had gone ahead and called it \u201cFerlinghetti\u2019s Greatest Hits,\u201d like an album full of ear candy by Tom Petty or Elton John) gives us a chance to revisit that question. It\u2019s a complicated one. Do the quicksilver qualities that can make Ferlinghetti\u2019s poetry so captivating to an adolescent undermine our ability to take it seriously with the passing of years? In his more unfortunate moments, as in the poem called \u201cUnderwear,\u201d corny humor lands with a clank and you can\u2019t help wincing: \u201cUnderwear can really get you in a bind / Negroes often wear / white underwear / which may lead to trouble.\u201d\n\nIt seems self-evident that the passing of years has done \u201cUnderwear\u201d no favors. At the same time, it would be churlish to deny that Ferlinghetti has given the popular canon many indelible lines. For a while in the 1950s and 1960s, his voice stood out amid a mounting dissident chorus; in these days of hashtagged political resistance, it is not uncommon to come across portions of his stanzas reconstituted as memes on Instagram and Facebook:\n\nI am waiting for my case to come up\n\nand I am waiting\n\nfor a rebirth of wonder\n\nand I am waiting for someone\n\nto really discover America\n\nand wail\n\nBased on passages like that, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to put Ferlinghetti in the company of skilled songwriters. He knows how to craft a hook. His lines have an easy, welcoming flow. (In this book, the poems are arranged chronologically and fluidly, as if they were part of an \u201cAbbey Road\u201d-like symphonic collage or a Hollywood highlight reel.) He has a gift for helping you hear what needs to be said, free of impenetrable filters. He is allergic to willful obscurity and \u201cour little literary games,\u201d as he declared in one \u201cHowl\u201d-referencing populist manifesto that he titled, with characteristic directness, \u201cPopulist Manifesto No. 1\u201d:\n\nWe have seen the best minds of our\n\ngeneration\n\ndestroyed by boredom at poetry\n\nreadings.\n\nPoetry isn\u2019t a secret society,\n\nIt isn\u2019t a temple either.\n\nSecret words & chants won\u2019t do any\n\nlonger.\n\nReturning to Ferlinghetti is ultimately about returning to the romantic associations of the milieu that produced Ferlinghetti, so it makes sense that some of Ferlinghetti\u2019s most plangent stanzas are the ones in which he looks back at the heyday of the Beats, that \u201crebel band who / rose over the rooftops of / tenement boneyards / intent on making out / And made out of madness / a hundred years of beatitude.\u201d Maybe there\u2019s no way to dissociate Ferlinghetti\u2019s poetry from the nostalgic gauze of various North Beach beatnik tropes \u2014 proto-hipsters wearing berets and listening to bebop and smoking French cigarettes, etc. \u2014 but what remains intact in the poems (even as their creator approaches a century of living) is the fresh, youthful energy of that moment. The liberating pulse can still be pretty contagious. His high points are the poems that you wish you could listen to in a car, on a long coastal highway, with the windows rolled down \u2014 and you certainly can\u2019t say that about Robert Lowell.\n\nDoes the occasionally tossed-off imperfection of the poems give them a kind of time-capsuled charm? If you\u2019re willing as a reader to be forgiving, it can be a blast to go back to the way the words bounce. And Ferlinghetti himself can\u2019t resist the pull of the past. In \u201cPlan du Centre de Paris \u00e0 Vol d\u2019Oiseau,\u201d this is how he remembers it:", "title": "For Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nearly 100, the Beat Goes On", "authors": ["Jeff Gordinier", "Lawrence Ferlinghetti"]}

Music, when combined with exercise, has been shown to delay fatigue and increase endurance, an effect similar to a performance-enhancing drug, said Costas Karageorghis of Brunel University in London, who wrote the book \u201cApplying Music in Exercise and Sport.\u201d\n\nKarageorghis has conducted a number of studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram to study the effect of music on physical performance. He has found that music can stimulate brain waves associated with arousal and alertness, and can alter the synchronization of powerful brain pulses associated with muscular activity. Music seems to block the brain\u2019s natural signals when a body needs rest, which helps explain why some people can run or bike or ski faster and longer when listening to music.\n\n\u201cI can never reproduce in the laboratory what goes on in the hotbed of competition,\u201d said Karageorghis. \u201cBut it does give us some good clues as to what happens neurophysiologically in the brain, and the influence of music. Using music to relieve anxiety, to lift confidence, to create your own bubble where you block out the competition hullabaloo and media expectations that go with it \u2014 that all can be very useful.\u201d", "title": "For Snowboarders, the Music Matters as Much as the Gear", "authors": []}

As the bats come winging in or out, you catch them in nets spread across the cave mouth and transfer them to a cloth bag. Then, you wait.\n\nSometimes, says M. Lisandra Zepeda Mendoza, who works in bioinformatics and is an author of a recent paper drawing on this raw material, you don\u2019t get what you need. \u201cThey get shy,\u201d she says, and one has to let them go before they release a sample.\n\nLuckily, however, Dr. Mendoza\u2019s colleagues at the bat cave mouth were able to collect enough feces that she and other collaborators could sequence the DNA of the bacteria within it.

But mounting research indicates that most of the disadvantages of singles compared with the currently married are accounted for by distress among the previously married, especially those most recently divorced or widowed.\n\nThis suggests an intriguing possibility, says the Ohio State University sociologist Kristi Williams, editor of The Journal of Marriage and Family: Many of the problems experienced by divorced and widowed people may result not so much from the end of their marriage as from having relied too much on their spouse and thus failing to maintain social networks and the skills of self-reliance. In Professor Chopik\u2019s research, single older people with solid friendships, whether previously married or never married, were just as happy and healthy as married individuals.\n\nA new study by Daniel Carlson of the University of Utah and Ben Kail of Georgia State finds that the only segment of the population where never-married individuals consistently report worse psychological well-being than the married is among the poorest Americans. This is partly because at this income level, married couples actually maintain higher levels of social integration than their unmarried counterparts.\n\nBut as income rises, the advantages of married over never-married individuals evaporate and even reverse. While affluent never-married people continue to multiply their interactions with friends, neighbors and family, affluent married couples don\u2019t. This could well be why, at the highest income levels, married people are actually more likely to report depressive symptoms than their equally affluent never-married counterparts.\n\nMaintaining social networks and self-reliance after marriage does far more, however, than protect you against depression and ensure against the worst outcomes of divorce or widowhood. It can also enhance and even revitalize your marriage.\n\nMany marriage counselors focus narrowly on improving partners\u2019 couple skills without taking into account how the marital relationship is affected by interactions with other people. Yet a 2017 study found that when people socialize more frequently with good friends, they not only report fewer depressive symptoms themselves, but so do their partners.\n\nPeople feel better when their spouses have good friendships, over and above the effects of their own friendships. In another example of how friendships can benefit a marriage, happily married wives who experience conflicts in their marriage generally feel closer to their husbands when they can discuss and reframe the issues with a good friend.\n\nAs the U.C.L.A. social psychologist Benjamin Karney told me, \u201c\u2018You are my everything\u2019 is not the best recipe for a happy marriage.\u201d Research his team will present next month at the annual conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology found that having supportive friendships is associated with more satisfying marriages, even among couples already content with the support they get from each other. \u201cEven the happiest couples have something to gain by nurturing relationships with people outside their marriage,\u201d he said.", "title": "Opinion | For a Better Marriage, Act Like a Single Person", "authors": []}

In one study, we asked participants to imagine that they were the coach of an N.B.A. team that was down by 2 points in the final seconds. Just as N.B.A. teams did, our participants avoided the superior strategy, opting for the 2-point shot 81 percent of the time.\n\nWhy do people make this error? Part of the explanation lies in our tendency to treat problems in isolation rather than as part of a larger whole. Just as investors often mistakenly evaluate stocks individually rather than as part of a portfolio, coaches and fans often evaluate decisions in terms of their immediate impact and give less consideration to how those decisions fit in the larger context of the game.\n\nIn our laboratory study, we found that whether participants opted for the 2-point or 3-point shot was unrelated to their beliefs about how the team would perform in overtime. They made their decision by focusing almost entirely on the prospect of losing immediately, neglecting how the future was likely to play out.\n\nBut there is more to the story than myopia. People also seem to be unnecessarily wary of risks that they feel they are choosing to take (as opposed to risks they feel they are forced to take).\n\nIn a study that highlights this point, we asked football fans to imagine that a team had scored a touchdown in the final seconds of a game. Then we told half the fans that the team trailed by 1 point and the other half that the team trailed by 2 points. We then told all the fans that the team was going to attempt a 2-point conversion.\n\nThose who were told the team was down by 1 point (and thus had the viable option of kicking the extra point to force overtime) thought the 2-point conversion was more likely to fail than did those whose team had to attempt a 2-point conversion just to force a tie. That is, the same decision was thought to be riskier when it was seen as optional than when it was seen as unavoidable.\n\n\u201cLive to fight another day\u201d is often a good rule of thumb, but it is not always the best strategy to pursue.

Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini regarded them as the highest proof of guilt.\n\nI analyzed numerous legal cases and around 300 prison memoirs for a book about forced confessions. To obtain such \u201cconfessions,\u201d interrogators in Iran rely heavily on psychological and physical pressures. They \u2014 like fellow interrogators elsewhere \u2014 scrupulously avoid the word torture (\u201cshekanjeh\u201d in Persian). In fact, the Iranian Constitution explicitly outlaws shekanjeh. Instead, interrogators describe what they do as \u201cta\u2019zir\u201d (punishment). Innumerable prison memoirs detail this process. It can be described as Iran\u2019s version of \u201cenhanced interrogation.\u201d\n\nPrisoners are asked a question, and if their answer is unsatisfactory, they are sentenced to a specific number of lashings on the ground that they had lied. These whippings can continue until the desired answer is given \u2014 and committed to paper. According to a letter circulated by some 40 members of Parliament, hallucinatory drugs now supplement these traditional methods.\n\nIn the 1980s and the 1990s, detainees were routinely shown on television reading their confessions, but the broadcasts were mostly stopped after most Iranians concluded that they were staged. The confessions continue to be used in court, however.\n\nDetainees have a limited number of options in the face of interrogation. They can submit, even before the instruments of enhanced interrogation are displayed. They can undergo prolonged agony, which may lead to death, if inadvertently \u2014 interrogators want a confession, not a badly damaged corpse, which can cause political embarrassment. The detainees can accept a plea bargain and \u201cadmit\u201d to a lesser transgression in return for release or a lighter sentence.\n\nAfter the disputed presidential elections in 2009 in which the right-wing populist Mahmoud Ahmadinejad prevailed over reformist opponents, many \u2014 including visitors from abroad \u2014 gave \u201cexclusive\u201d interviews to the regime press confessing to sundry transgressions, especially helping foreign powers conspiring to bring about \u201cregime change.\u201d\n\nDetainees have also agreed to public confessions and tried to insert phrases that undermined the whole ritual. A prisoner \u2014 later executed \u2014 declared in 1983 that he had been recruited into the K.G.B., the Soviet intelligence agency upon his arrival in Russia in 1951.

Unlike other reality-contest shows, everyone on \u201cFace Off\u201d is nice to one another. They speak openly about how they did, in fact, come here to make friends, and they help one another in the work room and freely offer constructive feedback and emotional support.\n\nI\u2019ve recommended \u201cFace Off\u201d in this newsletter a lot, but that\u2019s only because I like it so much. Even if reality-contest shows are not typically your jam, this is much closer to the wholesomeness of \u201cThe Great British Baking Show\u201d than to the manufactured conflict of \u201cTop Model.\u201d\n\n0\n\nGive Me Makeovers\n\nFrom left, Karamo Brown, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Antoni Porowski and Bobby Berk in \u201cQueer Eye.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Queer Eye\u2019\n\nWhen to watch: Starting Wednesday, on\n\nStarting Wednesday, on Netflix Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Bravo classic \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d has been revived on Netflix, with a new \u201cfab five\u201d doling out makeovers; a new home base, in Atlanta; and a slightly altered name. Otherwise, the show is largely the same: A bumbling, sometimes shabby man is in need of a style reboot to address his perceived shortcomings in fashion, self-care, cooking, domesticity and culture. The experts descend, gently tease the dude, coax him through their rituals, have some kind of teary heart-to-heart about sources of shame or grief and then send their living project back to his life.\n\nNew \u201cQueer Eye\u201d is a funny, often moving makeover show. It is not, however, quite the justice vehicle it seems to believe it is. An episode that attempts to address police violence against black people is jarring and incongruous, and for all the ways that the show could conceivably celebrate outsiderness, the experts seem to have an extremely narrow vision for what is acceptable, attractive and expressive. (Not everyone wants to host parties! Let a hermit live! Sheesh.)

It\u2019s just a group of people who hang out and are goofballs. Courteney Cox stars as Jules, who\u2019s amicably divorced from Bobby (Brian Van Holt) and mom to a teenage son, Travis (Dan Byrd). Her best friends are the ditsy Laurie (Busy Philipps) and the more acerbic Ellie (Christa Miller), who is married to Andy (Ian Gomez). Grayson (Josh Hopkins) is Jules\u2019s neighbor and eventual love interest.\n\nThat\u2019s \u2026 sort of it. Early on, the show tried to feature more of Jules\u2019s dating life before admitting that it is its best self when spending downtime among its main characters. \u201cCougar Town\u201d toys with the silly rituals of friendships, the in-jokes and the dumb, invented games that embody social intimacy.

He\u2019s describing an evening meal at the sweetly sedate and horribly expensive Paris restaurant La Tour d\u2019Argent. In a book that skillfully combines culinary history with reports from some of the city\u2019s most tasteful arrondissements, he adopts the conceit of a historian\u2019s walking tour, conflating past with present in gorgeous style.\n\nStarting on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, Downie compares it to a ship anchored midstream in the Seine, \u201ca floating Holy of Holies in the flow of Paris history.\u201d Strolling on, telling tales of Charles V\u2019s knife-wielding master cook Guillaume Tirel (nicknamed \u201cTaillevent\u201d for the swiftness with which he could slice up a daily court feast of 300 chickens, 36 suckling kids, 300 pigeons, 36 gosling geese, 11 sheep and 3 sides each of beef, veal and pork), Downie arrives unbloodied at the feet of Marie de M\u00e9dicis. Describing this frail Italian princess, who ballooned into a gargantuan widow after the demise of Henri IV, Downie notes that Rubens captured her girth \u201con enough canvas to sail fleets of galleons.\u201d Was the subject of \u201cthese sumptuous smorgasbords of color\u201d not just a glutton, he wonders, but also \u201cthe prototypical narcissist\u201d?\n\nBloated royalty offers plenty of succulent targets for Downie\u2019s knifelike pen. Louis XVI, pausing on his abortive flight from Paris to devour a dish of pig\u2019s trotters in which \u201cthe bones burst like bonbons, flooding the mouth with warm, liquefied marrow,\u201d cooked his final goose when he demanded \u2014 and ravenously shredded \u2014 an entire roast chicken while facing his scornful accusers in court. Quoting Dumas, Downie tartly remarks that the king put his own twist on Descartes: \u201cI am so I eat.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Downie takes food a bit too seriously. Balzac is scolded for being \u201can ecstatic, compulsive gorger and borderline glutton\u201d who devoured \u201ccongealed cold cuts and other toxic snacks.\u201d Not so our dapper author, savoring a tasteful supper facing the colonnade of the Louvre at Le Fumoir: \u201cHow delicious my appealingly plated but very old-fashioned roast pork loin with mustard sauce \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne.

The results are beguiling. Who ever suspected that Proust\u2019s famous madeleine almost lost out to a plain slice of \u201cpain grill\u00e9\u201d? Or that Chez Voisin\u2019s 1870 siege menu of antelope, cat and rat also offered its famished clients the impeccable liquid refreshment of Chateau Mouton Rothschild and Chateau Palmer?\n\nSome of the best treats provided by Baxter\u2019s delightful book are his startling asides. Comparing Picasso\u2019s utter indifference to haute cuisine with Matisse\u2019s daintier palate, he embellishes a description of Matisse\u2019s penchant for brandade de morue with unexpected advice: that the repeated washing of the codfish was best achieved, some housewives found, by a day\u2019s soak in the cistern of a flush toilet. He also informs us that Alexis Soyer, the 19th-century father of modern celebrity cooking, couldn\u2019t tolerate clothing cut on straight lines. And that wasn\u2019t all: His visiting cards, cigar case and even the handle of his cane had \u201cslightly oblique inclinations.\u201d\n\nOne grumble: Why is it that such an insider\u2019s guide fails to point out the virtues of traveling outside the familiar tourist precincts? It\u2019s there that some of the tastiest and least expensive food in Paris is to be found, but perhaps a dedicated gourmand is reluctant to share with visitors what to Parisians is an open secret. Then again, it\u2019s also true, as Baxter briefly reminds us, that McDonald\u2019s has met with great success in France. The French gave America the Statue of Liberty.

Douglass is remembered as many things: a fugitive slave who gained his freedom, an abolitionist, an advocate for women\u2019s rights, a gifted writer and orator. But we should also remember him as someone whose insights about scientific theories of race are every bit as relevant in our era as they were when he wrote them.\n\nWhen Douglass rose to prominence, in the 1840s, he was living in a world just as excited and anxious about his era\u2019s new inventions, like the railroad and the telegraph, as we are about modern-day innovation. But he understood that the ends to which science could be used were forever bound up with the moral choices of its practitioners. \u201cScientific writers, not less than others, write to please, as well as to instruct,\u201d he wrote in 1854, \u201cand even unconsciously to themselves (sometimes) sacrifice what is true to what is popular.\u201d\n\nThat statement was part of a lecture in which he attacked one of the most prominent scientific fields of the antebellum era: ethnology, or what was sometimes called \u201cthe science of race.\u201d Though often dismissed today as pseudoscience, at the time Douglass was writing, it was considered legitimate. The most accomplished scientists engaged in it, and the public eagerly consumed it.\n\nEthnology was not embraced just by Southerners who supported slavery.

These truths could only have made their debut in the public square, and eventually gained broad acceptance, under the armed guard, so to speak, of the First Amendment.\n\nBut not just the First Amendment. In addition to a legal sanction, free speech has flourished in the United States because we have had a longstanding cultural bias in favor of the gadfly, the muckraker, the contrarian, the social nuisance. For over a century, editors and publishers and producers \u2014 at least the more enlightened ones \u2014 have gone out of their way to make allowances for opposing points of view.\n\nThey do so not because they have no strong convictions of their own, but rather out of a profound understanding that the astute presentation of divergent views makes us more thoughtful, not less; and that we cannot disagree intelligently unless we first understand profoundly. They do so because they believe that social progress depends on occasionally airing outrageous ideas that, on close reflection, aren\u2019t outrageous at all. They hold firm to the conviction that moving readers out of their political or moral comfort zones, even at the risk of causing upset, is good for mind and soul. Ultimately, they do so because we will not be able to preserve the culture and institutions of a liberal republic unless we are prepared to accept, as Judge Learned Hand put it in 1944, that the \u201cspirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right\u201d \u2014 and must therefore have the willingness to listen to the other side.\n\nThis was what Adolph Ochs knew in 1896, when he promised that under his stewardship The New York Times would \u201cinvite intelligent discussion from all shades of opinion.\u201d The Times, like other papers, may not have always lived up to that promise as well as it might have done.

I think they are right. The country needs at least one great news organization that understands that the truth is neither relative nor illusory nor a function of the prevailing structure of power \u2014 but also that the truth is many-sided; that none of us has a lock on it; and that we can best approach it through the patient accumulation of facts and a vigorous and fair contest of ideas.\n\nThat, at any rate, is what I think we are trying to do at The Times, and I can only hope that more people will see its virtue as time goes by.

But when they pressed together in head-to-toe camel spins \u2014 each holding onto the other\u2019s extended free leg and waist to the lyric \u201cPara-para-paradise\u201d \u2014 it gave me pause. I couldn\u2019t have skated to that with one of my brothers. (And I know that reading this, they are relieved.)\n\nMs. Virtue and Mr. Moir, this season\u2019s sentimental favorites \u2014 they won silver four years ago and reunited for what was likely their last stab at the gold \u2014 burn with a seething rapture that has become performative, distractingly so. I\u2019ll never tire of their skill \u2014 their consummate speed and control \u2014 but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d soundtrack, they ran my red light.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s true that skating isn\u2019t pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren\u2019t merely ice dancers: They dance on the ice, showing how it\u2019s capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it.\n\nIn ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade\u2019s deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps \u2014 it\u2019s worse when they\u2019re crammed into the second half in order to score more points \u2014 ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place.\n\nHow can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other.\n\nIn the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback \u2014 arguably the most beautiful spin in skating \u2014 attests.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate \u2014 as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about \u201cDances at a Gathering,\u201d his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. \u201cYou should never dance anything for the audience,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren\u2019t there. It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn figure skating, it\u2019s a radical idea. But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman \u2014 to spark her fire.\n\nBut the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis\u2019s extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring.\n\nAs soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond. In that moment, at once bracing and luminous, the Olympics turned from being a competition into a performance.

Ground was broken for a new terminal last summer, and in December the Port Authority approved $496 million for early-stage development. It\u2019s expected to ask for more funding as soon as next week, and the project is estimated to cost $2.3 billion. But even if all goes according to plan, the new terminal isn\u2019t expected to be fully operational until 2022.\n\nThe Port Authority has been mired in scandal since at least 2013, when the Fort Lee lane-closing scheme exposed political machinations by appointees of New Jersey\u2019s then-governor, Chris Christie. Rick Cotton, a veteran civil servant and infrastructure expert whom New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo named as the authority\u2019s executive director last year, has pledged reforms.\n\nPhoto\n\nNewark\u2019s Terminal B, which received a $350 million update in 2014, and Terminal C, which was built by United Airlines and is operated under a long-term lease by the company, are far better, though both attract plenty of complaints from travelers.\n\nA major issue for the New York area\u2019s airports is that the Port Authority is allowed to divert revenues collected from airline passengers to nonairport uses, like the PATH train and the new Oculus station at the World Trade Center, a project that went grossly over budget. Federal law bans such redirections elsewhere, but the Port Authority was one of several airport operators that were exempted.\n\n\u201cIf Newark airport kept all the money it generated from landing fees it could be a world-class airport,\u201d said Tom Wright, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent urban research group that focuses on infrastructure and public policy in the New York area. But doing so would starve other Port Authority needs, such as mass transit, he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nImproving Newark and the rest of America\u2019s airports needn\u2019t add to the federal deficit. Airports can fund capital improvements by levying fees on passengers and airlines. Airlines typically oppose that, and federal law currently caps such fees, known as passenger facility charges. Efforts to raise the cap, which hasn\u2019t been increased in 15 years, have gone nowhere in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense that the fees would be the same for Des Moines and Newark, given their vastly different mass transit needs,\u201d said Mr. Wright.\n\nAfter a 10-minute walk in Terminal A, I boarded the AirTrain for what is supposed to be an 11-minute trip to the Newark Airport train station.

Twice it inexplicably stopped for extended periods. During the second of these stops, within sight of our destination, I watched in frustration as my train to Manhattan came and went.\n\nComplaints about the AirTrain have been mounting for years, and the Port Authority has conceded it\u2019s \u201cunreliable.\u201d It has been periodically shut down for repairs, and passengers have had to be evacuated after being stuck on board.\n\nThough the AirTrain is less than 25 years old, and cost $769 million ($1.3 billion adjusted for inflation) to build, the Port Authority concluded it must be demolished and replaced. The current capital plan calls for $385 million in repairs to the existing AirTrain, and $40 million for planning its replacement, but doesn\u2019t include the cost of the new train system. The planning proposal anticipates \u201csubstantial completion\u201d in 2022, though that seems overly ambitious.\n\nOnce I reached the station, I learned that the next New Jersey Transit train wouldn\u2019t arrive for 50 minutes. When I went to the enclosed (and presumably heated) waiting area, it was empty, and entry was barred by a guard at the door.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Port Authority official said the area was closed because of an unattended bag. Some time after I left, it reopened when a police dog certified in bomb detection determined the bag was harmless.\n\nA New Jersey Transit spokeswoman, Nancy Snyder, explained that weekend service from Newark Airport is \u201climited\u201d because of Amtrak maintenance work. Only three trains run per hour, clustered within the first 20 minutes of the hour, she said, and I evidently missed the last of those.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe number of New Jersey Transit trains is also constrained by tunnel capacity under the Hudson River. Although a new rail tunnel has been one of the country\u2019s top infrastructure priorities for years, in January the Trump administration cast doubt on the federal government\u2019s commitment to fund half the cost of the first phase of the project, estimated at $11 billion. (New York and New Jersey have pledged to pay the rest.)\n\nIn 2010, of course, Mr. Christie famously canceled a project for a new Hudson River tunnel, citing cost overruns, a decision whose reverberations continue to be felt by New Jersey\u2019s beleaguered commuters.\n\nThe train, when it finally arrived, was packed. I found a seat, but other passengers were standing. Mr. Christie\u2019s successor as governor, Phil Murphy, has called New Jersey Transit a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and has pledged better funding and improvements.\n\nOnce we reached Penn Station, the escalator leading from the platform was broken, creating a logjam at the narrow stairways as passengers struggled with heavy luggage.\n\nMs. Snyder said that New Jersey Transit maintains nine escalators on the Seventh Avenue side of Penn Station and that, as of this week, all were functioning. But she recommended passengers use the Eighth Avenue side of the station, which offers better access to and from platforms.\n\nAfter I passed through Penn Station (no further comment needed) the final indignity was a broken escalator leading to Seventh Avenue, which is Amtrak\u2019s responsibility. The 39 escalators in Penn Station maintained by Amtrak, many of them dating to the 1960s, are notorious for malfunctioning. They can take months to repair, as The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015.\n\nLast year, referring to commuters\u2019 \u201csummer of agony,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said conditions at Penn Station had become \u201cintolerable\u201d and sent a letter to the White House asking Mr. Trump for emergency funding. The governor also called for removing the station from cash-starved Amtrak\u2019s jurisdiction as part of a \u201clong-term solution.\u201d\n\nOther than acknowledging receipt of the letter, the White House hasn\u2019t responded.", "title": "From (Crumbling) Airport to (Broken) Escalators: An Infrastructure Odyssey", "authors": ["James B.

At times she reminds me of a musician jamming, or one of those enviable cooks who can take five random ingredients lying around the kitchen and whip up a meal. Her loose, roving essays cohere because they are rooted in her sensibility, in what Elizabeth Hardwick called \u201cthe soloist\u2019s personal signature flowing through the text.\u201d\n\nHow to characterize Smith\u2019s sensibility? Above all, she\u2019s allergic to dishonesty, hypocrisy, sanctimony, cant. \u201cFor many people in London right now,\u201d she writes in \u201cFences: A Brexit Diary,\u201d \u201cthe supposedly multicultural and cross-class aspects of their lives are actually represented by their staff \u2014 nannies, cleaners \u2014 by the people who pour their coffees and drive their cabs, or else the handful of Nigerian princes you meet in private schools.\u201d She takes a wide-lens, Olympian view, often empathizing with both sides of an issue \u2014 her arguments can thus be difficult to pinpoint \u2014 but she is ultimately pragmatic. \u201cOne useful consequence of Brexit,\u201d she writes, \u201cis to finally and openly reveal a deep fracture in British society that has been 30 years in the making.\u201d\n\nAt root she believes that art is a realm where knotty issues can be safely explored, and that we should not draw neat boundaries around its subjects. Such is the argument of her much-discussed essay on \u201cGet Out,\u201d which first appeared in Harper\u2019s: It\u2019s a fantasy that \u201cwe can get out of each other\u2019s way, mark a clean cut between black and white,\u201d she concludes in that essay, which also examines the controversy over the white artist Dana Schutz\u2019s painting of Emmett Till. In an open letter, the artist Hannah Black had asked the Whitney Biennial to remove and destroy the painting, on the grounds that Schutz had no right to depict black suffering; the request, Smith writes, was \u201cthe province of Nazis and censorious evangelicals.\u201d The problem with such racial essentialism, she suggests elsewhere in this collection, is that it can run both ways. See the narrow, patronizing tendency to \u201cascribe to black artists some generalized aim,\u201d like \u201cinserting the black figure into the white canon.\u201d This trivializes the formal and technical concerns of the artist, Smith writes, \u201cthe unique problem each art work poses.\u201d", "title": "From Justin Bieber to Martin Buber, Zadie Smith\u2019s Essays Showcase Her Exuberance and Range", "authors": []}

The Times art critic Roberta Smith gave \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d a commendatory review, repositioning its standing in the art world. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as much a part of American culture as Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, W.P.A. murals and the AIDS quilt,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes,\u201d Ms. Chicago said in an interview with The Times when asked about her reaction to Ms. Smith\u2019s 2002 write-up.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Smith says she \u201cdidn\u2019t set out to correct\u201d any previous receptions of Ms. Chicago\u2019s work, including Mr. Kramer\u2019s. \u201cThe thing that I\u2019m most conscious of is wanting people to have an interesting experience when they take my word that they should go see something,\u201d she says.\n\nMs. Smith describes her process of writing art criticism as one involving a complicated relationship between her own personal reactions, interests and opinions, her and her editors\u2019 satisfaction with her writing, and a tangential awareness of the power and authority she wields as an art critic for The Times, a role she began in 1986. \u201cAt The Times I felt like I was being handed \u2014 I hate to use this metaphor \u2014 but that I was being handed this really big kind of gun, and that if I weren\u2019t careful I would take people out. And so I got kind of careful for a while,\u201d Ms. Smith said, adding that eventually, her caution subsided. In its place, she says, was the sense that choosing to write about a show, whether positively or negatively for The Times, meant it would get noticed.\n\nHow much does a Times art review matter for an artist? Some, like Yayoi Kusama for instance, get noticed whether they\u2019re in The Times or not \u2014 and there are hundreds of thousands of posts about her art on Instagram to prove it.\n\nThat is a different kind of notice from a critic\u2019s review, however. The Times art critic Jason Farago said there have been substantial shifts in art media and the general news media since Mr. Kramer\u2019s time. Notably, exhibitions that may have received half a dozen reviews from experienced critics in the press now may get only one. \u201cSo although digital media may have made it easier than ever for a show to get \u2018exposure,\u2019 a review in The Times carries greater weight insofar as reviews themselves are fewer than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because my colleagues Roberta Smith and Holland Cotter have earned their spurs as voices worth paying particular attention.\u201d\n\nAs for Ms. Chicago, she said that despite the art media\u2019s early disparagement of her work, her way of overcoming the disappointment was to go into her studio and continue making art. She found a supportive community in Southern California\u2019s Ferus boys, notably the American artist and sculptor Billy Al Bengston, from whom she said she learned quite a bit.\n\n\u201cEarly on, he told me: \u2018Never read reviews.

Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, said recently about the female-fueled wave of liberal energy.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s remarks illustrated a broader problem: Republican congressional leaders and strategists have pleaded with lawmakers and candidates to stay focused on economic growth and December\u2019s tax cuts, a message they hope will be their salvation before the elections in November. But that may be little more than fantasy in a campaign that will turn more on the president\u2019s conduct than any policy issue.\n\n\n\nHis comments on Friday, the first he had offered since images emerged of one of Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives bearing a black eye, were the culmination of a week\u2019s worth of politically ill-advised steps that suggest that the president and his lieutenants cannot stop themselves from blunting positive political momentum. By the weekend, Mr. Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, strong employment and wage figures as well as the onset of tax cuts seemed washed away by the latest White House controversy.\n\nThe frustration in the Republican political class is bursting forward.\n\n\u201cFor members or anybody else who cares about keeping control of Congress, if you find yourself talking about anything but the middle-class tax cut, shut up and stop talking,\u201d fumed Corry Bliss, who runs the primary House Republican \u201csuper PAC,\u201d the Congressional Leadership Fund. \u201cAny time spent on TV talking about anything but how we\u2019re helping the middle class is a waste of time and does nothing to help us win in 2018.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have grown accustomed to the president\u2019s lack of discipline and inability to reliably carry a message. But operatives overseeing the midterm effort and some lawmakers facing difficult re-elections are growing more alarmed that Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation on the Russia inquiry, personal slights and personality clashes inside and outside his White House are only encouraging his congressional and conservative news media allies to swerve off message.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe party has finally gotten some good signs. The president\u2019s approval ratings have been inching up in recent polling, fewer voters are indicating a preference for a Democratic Congress and some polls show Mr. Trump starting to get more credit for the booming economy than former President Barack Obama.\n\nBut even as voters begin to see more take-home pay, companies add jobs and employees receive bonuses, their votes are not necessarily going to drift to the Republicans in November. Many Americans are still uncertain that they will benefit from the tax measure, Mr. Bliss conceded. He cited a wave of private polling and focus groups that his organization has conducted this year revealing much of the electorate to be skeptical that they would receive a tax cut from the bill, which was signed into law in December.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat is in part because of what mainstream Republicans describe as a destructive cycle of incentives: Mr. Trump reacts to Fox News segments about the Russia investigation or another controversy, encouraging more such coverage and prompting House conservatives from largely safe seats to make their own incendiary comments, which win them television invitations and attention from the president. Such notoriety might help those lawmakers in their deep red districts, but they do nothing for the party\u2019s overall political standing.\n\n\u201cThese guys are performing for the president when they go on TV,\u201d said Jason Roe, a longtime Republican strategist who is consulting on a series of at-risk House districts in California.\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a first-term Republican who is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most visible champions outside the White House staff, all but said as much.\n\nMr. Gaetz, who used the State of the Union speech to snag a selfie with Mr. Trump in the House chamber, has said the president is \u201cabout as popular in my district as oxygen.\u201d He acknowledged that the tax bill was far more politically urgent than arguments about Russia and conceded that his on-air denunciations of Mr. Mueller served no electoral purpose.

Senior lawmakers have used private meetings to implore the president and their colleagues to stay focused on taxes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a gathering last month at Camp David, House Republican leaders invoked the example of Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump, who is often eager to act differently than his predecessor. The lawmakers told the president that Democrats suffered such deep losses in 2010 in part because Mr. Obama did not make a sufficient case for his economic stimulus measure, Republicans in attendance said.\n\nLast week at a congressional Republican retreat in West Virginia, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the head of the House campaign arm, opened and closed his presentation to lawmakers with \u201cthree takeaways,\u201d according to a Republican in attendance: \u201cBe ready, sell tax reform and run a campaign.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, another member of the leadership, has even created a kit for lawmakers about how to stage district events to \u201ctell the story of the tax cuts and jobs,\u201d offering a \u201cGipper of the Week\u201d award to Republicans who do top-flight communications works (the award: a jar of jelly beans, a favorite of Ronald Reagan\u2019s).\n\nDavid Winston, a veteran Republican pollster, made a presentation at the retreat arguing that many voters remained highly flexible in their views of the tax law, giving Republicans a chance \u2014 but so far, only a chance \u2014 to close the sale. But in an interview, Mr. Winston, who advises Speaker Paul D. Ryan, warned that the party could not trust public opinion on the law to continue improving on its own.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a need to make people aware of what\u2019s in the legislation,\u201d Mr. Winston said. \u201cThere is a large portion of the electorate that is aware of it, but there\u2019s probably a larger portion of the electorate that\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan has been uneasy about the attention devoted to the release of the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s memo about the F.B.I. Instead, the speaker has mapped out a series of visits to businesses affected by the tax law to showcase his preferred 2018 message by example.\n\nIn a revealing sign of the party\u2019s anxiety about Mr. Trump, the Republican National Committee has taken to trumpeting the \u201cTrump tax cuts\u201d and has urged campaigns and other Republican committees to credit Mr. Trump explicitly and often with enacting the new law, but has faced skepticism from Republicans wary of introducing Mr. Trump\u2019s name into competitive elections.\n\nMr. Trump himself underscored the risk involved in tying him, as a personality, to the Republican economic agenda during a visit to Ohio this week. His speech was intended to showcase the health of the economy, but he veered into an extended digression about his recent address to Congress and accused Democrats of \u201ctreason\u201d for refusing to clap at points. The economic message was lost.\n\nThe conundrum, several strategists and lawmakers conceded, is that Mr. Trump\u2019s legal and culture wars are more politically galvanizing to the party\u2019s conservative base than Ryanesque sermons on the free enterprise system.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe G.O.P. base just doesn\u2019t eat that up the way it does trending memo hash tags and firing-Mueller conspiracies,\u201d Nick Everhart, a Republican strategist based in Ohio, said of the party\u2019s economic message. \u201cThus, it\u2019s no surprise members of Congress in super-red districts, immune to the perilous political environment we\u2019re headed toward, put themselves and feeding the base first.\u201d", "title": "G.O.P.

Its roots date to 16th-century Scotland.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut it was not until 2006 that one of South Korea\u2019s first curling facilities was built \u2014 here in Uiseong. A former government official had seen the sport while traveling in Canada and thought it would appeal to a wide range of people. So the county cobbled together the funds to build the Gyeongbuk Uiseong Curling Centre.\n\nKim Joo-soo, the current county mayor, said in an interview at his office that four friends (including two sisters) from Uiseong Girls High School soon became regulars. They thought it was a fun after-school activity.\n\nNobody knew they would become Olympians.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sisters and they\u2019re friends,\u201d Kim said, \u201cso their communication is so important. You can tell that teamwork is a big factor in their success.\u201d\n\nAnother factor: the sterling play of Kim Eun-jung, 27, who goes by the nickname Annie and operates as the team\u2019s skip, which means she orchestrates the team\u2019s strategy and throws the most important shots. Some of those shots already have led the South Koreans past powerhouses like Canada, Switzerland and Britain, sealing a berth in Friday\u2019s semifinals.\n\nKim Eun-jung, who wears eyeglasses that have become the most iconic fashion accessory at the Games, plays with a sort of poker-faced intensity that has made for internet memes. But her teammates, who have fun nicknames like Steak, Sunny and Pancake, have become nearly as recognizable to a growing number of fans across the country. They are Kim Kyeong-ae, 24, and Kim Yeong-mi, 26, who are sisters; and Kim Seon-yeong, 24. A fifth player, Kim Chohi, is the team\u2019s alternate. (Her nickname is ChoCho.)\n\nTheir path to Olympic stardom was not without obstacles. In recent years, the Korean curling federation was roiled by a sexual abuse case that involved a former coach and by the misappropriation of training funds. But the players on the current team persevered, and banners featuring their faces and the Olympic rings are now scattered across Uiseong.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re inspiring a lot of young kids to participate in winter sports, and not just curling,\u201d said Do Ki-min, 29, who got an excused absence from work at the county office so he could watch Tuesday\u2019s match at the high school. \u201cMy boss is here, too.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nKim Sung-hee, the woman who lost her voice from cheering too hard, said she was from the same neighborhood as the two sisters on the team. She had been watching their matches at a community center, she said. But as the wins kept piling up, it was starting to get pretty crowded.\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s match, an announcement was posted on the county\u2019s official website that a viewing party would be held at the high school. Word spread around the county. Lee Jung-yong, an actor and entertainer from Seoul, was brought in to rev up the crowd \u2014 but that hardly seemed necessary.\n\nAs Kim Sung-hee watched Kim Eun-jung and her teammates rough up the Americans, she cited one other possible reason for the team\u2019s success.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He admired Gandhi less for his ethical commitment to the cause than for his rejection of passive submission and his tactical success with nonviolent alternatives.\n\nCharacterized variously as the \u201cMachiavelli of Nonviolence\u201d and the \u201cClausewitz of Nonviolent Warfare,\u201d Mr. Sharp argued that nonviolent resistance draws its strength from basic human nature.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t build on the capacity of people to love each other and turn the other cheek,\u201d he told The Boston Globe in 1983, \u201cbut on people\u2019s capacity to be stubborn and cussed, and we\u2019re all good at that.\u201d\n\nDr. Sharp worked out of his East Boston townhouse (where he cultivated rare orchids); it had doubled as his institution\u2019s cramped headquarters since funding began withering in 2004.
