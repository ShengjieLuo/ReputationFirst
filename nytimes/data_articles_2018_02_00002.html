Questions about their immigration status were raised in recent months as the administration emphasized stricter immigration reform.\n\nAbout seven million of the 11 million immigrants who obtained green cards between 2007 and 2016 did so through familial relations, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\u201cIn some ways, lawful permanent resident status is the best of all visas,\u201d said Kevin R. Johnson, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Davis, who has taught immigration law. \u201cIt\u2019s the Cadillac of immigrant visas because it allows you a path to citizenship.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Trump has vilified the program as a way for terrorists to enter the United States and has called for aspects of the program to be eliminated as part of immigration reform.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCHAIN MIGRATION must end now!\u201d he wrote on Twitter in November. \u201cSome people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!\u201d\n\nIt also might have been possible, Mr. Johnson said, for the Knavses, both in their 70s, to obtain residency through an investment visa or a work visa, although the latter would involve employer sponsorship. Mr. Knavs, a former traveling car salesman, and Mrs. Knavs, who used to design patterns for children\u2019s clothes, both appear to be retired.\n\nImmigrants can also apply for asylum or enter the diversity lottery, a path that offers limited numbers of visas. Mr. Trump has also criticized the diversity lottery, which allows admission to immigrants from countries that do not send many people to the United States.\n\n\u201cIf somebody came to me and asked me how to become a citizen, the first question I would ask is \u2018Do you have an American citizen as a relative?\u2019\u201d said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. \u201cThat is the fastest and most direct route to getting a green card.\u201d\n\nIn his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump described a four-pillar immigration plan and continued to criticize the family-based immigration program, eliciting boos from Democrats in the chamber.\n\n\u201cUnder the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThis vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future.\u201d", "title": "Questions Swirl as Melania Trump\u2019s Parents Obtain Green Cards", "authors": ["Emily Cochrane"]}
{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook:\n\n\u201cThis equals about four-thousandths of 1 percent (0.004 percent) of content in News Feed, or approximately one out of 23,000 pieces of content.\u201d\n\nAnd on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election.\n\nQuoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information. But the company\u2019s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.\n\nQuestions for Facebook:\n\nHas Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people? If so, can Facebook share them? And how did the ads perform before and after the election?\n\nTo what extent did Russia target swing states?\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting \u201cpurple states,\u201d or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning.\n\n\u201cOn or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the \u2018Florida Goes Trump\u2019 rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.\u201d\n\nOthers have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states. As Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted last year:\n\n\u201cWhat you haven\u2019t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin\u2019s 55, wasn\u2019t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.\u201d\n\nQuestions for Facebook:\n\nDo the company\u2019s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States? If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?\n\nThe Russia-backed groups were incredibly successful at gaining followers.\n\nJonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, has done revealing work on Facebook\u2019s Russia-linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public. Mr. Albright\u2019s data, obtained using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows the speed with which the Russia-backed groups grew.\n\nBlacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright\u2019s data \u2014 a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist\u2019s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers.\n\nQuestions for Facebook:\n\nHow exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly? Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook? To what extent did Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups? And one from Mr. Albright: What were the follower totals and other data for any private Facebook pages that were backed by the Russians?\n\nWhy this issue isn\u2019t going away for Facebook.\n\nIt may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation\u2019s understanding of what went on.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,\u201d Mr. Albright said.", "title": "Questions for Facebook About Russia\u2019s Use of Its Network", "authors": ["Peter Eavis"]}

(By coincidence, the Rangers, who have said they are planning to rebuild, will be honoring Ratelle the day before the trading deadline.)\n\nRatelle, 35 at the time, went on to play six seasons with the Bruins, for whom he wore No. 10. His time in Boston included trips to the Stanley Cup finals in 1977 and 1978 before he retired at 40 in 1981. Ratelle finished his career with 491 goals and continued to work for the Bruins for another two decades, first as an assistant coach, then as a scout. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1985.\n\n\u201cI felt loyalty to the Bruins,\u201d he said. \u201cI was with them for 26 years.\u201d\n\nRatelle developed a bond with Jeff Gorton, the Rangers\u2019 general manager, who spent 15 years in the Bruins\u2019 front office before joining the Rangers in 2007.\n\n\u201cI used to go to high school and college games with him,\u201d Gorton said. \u201cI remember those times. You look at his numbers, everything he\u2019s accomplished, and you look up to the rafters knowing Jean Ratelle belongs there.\u201d\n\nRatelle will be the ninth Rangers player to have his number honored, joining Giacomin (1), Gilbert (7), Harry Howell (3), Andy Bathgate (9), Mark Messier (11), Mike Richter (35), Brian Leetch (2) and Adam Graves, whose No. 9 hangs next to Bathgate\u2019s.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the right time,\u201d Ratelle said.\n\nHe will be joined on Sunday by his wife, Nancy, their three daughters and their families.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMy wife and I were watching a Rangers game last winter, and they were talking about the players with their sweaters retired,\u201d said Ratelle, whose No. 19 was worn most recently by Jesper Fast until he switched to No. 17 this season. \u201cShe said, \u2018The Rangers should really retire your sweater because you had a great career in New York.\u2019 \u2018O.K.,\u2019 I said. \u2018If Glen calls me, I will say yes.\u2019 A month later, he called.\u201d\n\nRatelle will be on the ice with other former teammates, including Park, Giacomin, goaltender Gilles Villemure and forward Pete Stemkowski.\n\n\u201cJean didn\u2019t say much,\u201d said Stemkowski, who played seven seasons with the Rangers. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a rah-rah guy, and I don\u2019t think I ever heard him swear. He just worked hard at his craft.\u201d\n\nAlso expected to partake in the festivities will be Ratelle\u2019s longtime coach and general manager, Emile Francis. He first coached Ratelle when he was a teenager playing for the Rangers\u2019 junior team in Guelph, Ontario.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier for Jean,\u201d said Francis, 91, who lives in Florida and remains close with his players from the GAG line era. \u201cNo doubt about it, he was one of the best players who ever played for me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThat group is synonymous with a glorious but unfulfilled Rangers era. The chance to stand together again on Garden ice is special.\n\nHadfield, who became the first Ranger to score 50 goals in a season, on the last day of the 1971-72 season, was more enforcer than goal scorer throughout the 1960s, when the Rangers failed to win a single playoff series. Hadfield, who was born one day after Ratelle in October 1940, joined the Rangers in 1961-62 and stayed through the 1973-74 season, after which he was traded to Pittsburgh.\n\nHadfield said what made Rangers teams of that era unique was the players\u2019 closeness, exemplified by the mild-mannered yet intense Ratelle, whose 109 points in 1971-72 are second-most in franchise history (behind Jaromir Jagr\u2019s 123 in 2005-06).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And now we\u2019re both in the Hall of Fame. It\u2019s magical.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Hall of Famer Yvan Cournoyer, who played against Ratelle throughout his career, said there was a parallel between Ratelle and the Montreal Canadiens great Jean Beliveau, Cournoyer\u2019s longtime teammate.\n\n\u201cJean Ratelle had the same elegance and style as Jean Beliveau,\u201d said Cournoyer, a 10-time Stanley Cup winner with the Canadiens. \u201cAnd he was a gentleman off the ice. What is too bad is that Jean Ratelle never won a Stanley Cup. But the Rangers were a team we respected because of Jean and Rod and all their guys.\u201d\n\nIn 1971-72, Ratelle and his linemates were on pace to break all sorts of records and possibly lead the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup since 1940. But in early March, Ratelle\u2019s ankle was fractured by a shot taken by his teammate Dale Rolfe, and he was not a factor in the playoffs. The Rangers beat Montreal in six games, then swept Chicago to set up a showdown against Bobby Orr and the Bruins in the finals.\n\nRatelle had only one assist in six games as the Rangers lost to the Bruins, who lifted the Cup at the Garden that May 11.\n\nRangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, whose No. 30 will surely take its place above the Garden ice one day, said he had enjoyed visiting with the greats of yesteryear. Ratelle and his linemates attended the team\u2019s preseason golf outing last September.\n\n\u201cThey are all super nice and funny, those guys, and you can see they care for each other,\u201d Lundqvist said. \u201cIt was a different time that\u2019s for sure \u2014 a different game and a different approach. But it looks like they always had fun.\u201d\n\nFor Rangers followers of his era, the chance to honor Ratelle feels like a long-overdue welcome-home party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTime goes by,\u201d Ratelle said. \u201cIt will be nice to be with the guys.

I take pride in having honed my high-low niche; absent the presidential biographies, big-name literary novels and academic histories my peers pore over, my bookshelf feels quirkier, a little irreverent, always stimulating.\n\nSo it came as little surprise when, back in August, a book landed on my desk with the title \u201cBuzz: The Stimulating History of the Sex Toy,\u201d and a cover that made subtle but skillful use of open- and close-parentheses to suggest female genitalia.

An assassination attempt on the president of the United States. \u201cHomeland\u201d is bound up in so many complex conspiracies, it can be hard to unravel them all.\n\nBut let\u2019s separate wheat from chaff: You don\u2019t need to remember, for example, all the ins-and-outs of the plot to manipulate the United States into thinking that Iran was violating its nuclear agreement. You need only know that the shadowy Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) was behind it. He lurks behind most of the show\u2019s major events lately: the Sekou Bah bombing; the creation of a propaganda machine to undermine the president-elect; the Child Services investigation into Franny\u2019s welfare; some dirty deals with Mossad; the betrayal of a double agent; and the confinement, in a freezer, of a United States senator, who was also in his underwear. (Dar really gets around.)\n\n\u2018Homeland\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime, Amazon, Hulu, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne thing Dar wasn\u2019t responsible for? The assassination attempt on the president-elect, Elizabeth Keane, which has since turned her into a frightening authoritarian. Our heroine Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) is, of course, troubled, and Carrie being Carrie \u2014 despite also being out of a job, frozen out of the White House and short on allies \u2014 we know that she will take it upon herself to try to fix this mess in Season 7. So before she returns to Showtime on Feb. 11, let\u2019s take a look at where we left off:\n\n#NotMyPresident\n\nMandy Patinkin and Elizabeth Marvel in \u201cHomeland.\u201d Jeff Neumann/Showtime\n\nIt\u2019s a constitutional crisis. In the United States of \u201cHomeland,\u201d 60 million people elected Elizabeth Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) to be president, and she immediately began creating the kind of police state she once decried.\n\n0\n\nWhat happens when a seemingly progressive candidate becomes a fascist-in-chief? Keane has expanded the Patriot Act. She has also arranged for a large number of government officials from the Departments of Defense and State, and from the Central Intelligence Agency (including Saul Berenson, played by Mandy Patinkin), to be arrested \u2014 sorry, detained \u2014 on dubious legal authority. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware we were about to go full-on Joe Stalin,\u201d Carrie complains. Apparently, we were.\n\nCarrie\u2019s take is that this is political housecleaning run amok. Keane\u2019s new chief of staff, David Wellington (Linus Roache), may or may not be able to talk some sense into an increasingly isolated and paranoid Keane, who feels that the deep state is against her. If it wasn\u2019t before, it is now.\n\nWhy So Many Conspiracies?\n\nF. Murray Abraham, left, and Rupert Friend in \u201cHomeland.\u201d Jeff Neumann/Showtime\n\nDar Adal was part of a cabal to manipulate the presidency, but to what end? Keane was proposing reform and the demilitarization of the C.I.A., but Dar is the ultimate company man. He didn\u2019t want to dismantle the system but to reign over it \u2014 to keep the national security establishment free from interference. So he used false-flag operations, fake intelligence and propaganda in order to change Keane\u2019s policies and undermine Carrie\u2019s influence.\n\nHe also attempted to surround Keane with his puppets and allies (such as his proposed secretary of state candidates, Senator Kevin Westlake, Senator Rachel Mercer and Gov. Glenallen Stewart). At least when Dar discovered that his collaborators were going so far as to stage a coup, he intervened. But we still don\u2019t know who all of his \u201cconstituents\u201d are. Were they all rounded up, or do any of them remain at large?\n\nCoup de McClendon\n\nGoing against Dar\u2019s wishes, Gen. Jamie McClendon (Robert Knepper) orchestrated the assassination attempt \u2014 seemingly because Keane wasn\u2019t a fan of the war effort or big-budget lethal programs. His Delta Force hit squad didn\u2019t get its target, but its casualties include F.B.I. agents, Secret Service agents, the incoming head of the Justice Department and poor, poor Quinn, the framed \u201ctoxic soldier\u201d who sacrificed his life to save Keane.\n\nMcClendon\u2019s sedition is a capital offense, and he will have to face a court-martial or military tribunal of some sort. Keane no doubt expects the maximum punishment, but she should be aware that the last time the military executed one of its own was in 1961, for a case of rape and attempted murder.\n\nAdventures in Babysitting\n\nClaire Danes, left, in \u201cHomeland\u201d; her character\u2019s daughter, right, is played by Claire and McKenna Keane. JoJo Whilden/Showtime\n\nTalk about a difficult childhood. Franny has been taken \u201chostage,\u201d placed in foster care and carted around the world \u2014 all before the age of five. But the show needs Carrie free from taking care of Brody\u2019s love child for a while so that she can attend to sorting out conspiracies.\n\nHer help in this area, however, keeps dwindling. When the billionaire Otto D\u00fcring was paying her a salary, Carrie could afford a nanny. But without a job, she\u2019s going to have to recruit family members to help out again. Her older sister Maggie and Maggie\u2019s husband, Bill, were living in Rome during Season 6. Once they return to Washington, they might be a big help, so long as Carrie doesn\u2019t wear out her welcome. (Take your meds, Carrie!)\n\n0\n\nMiracle Max\n\nCarrie\u2019s loyal and long-suffering tech-support guru, Max (Maury Sterling), is one of her few trusted colleagues, and he is overdue to play a larger part in the plot. When he was applying for the job at the Office of Policy Coordination, he explained away a missing year on his resume by writing \u201cM+M\u201d \u2014 meth and masturbation. Should Carrie decide to self-medicate for any reason, Max might be able to help Carrie procure some street drugs. Does that merit hazard pay?\n\n\u2018Real Truth\u2019 and Fake News\n\nBrett O\u2019Keefe (Jake Weber) is the alt-right mouthpiece of \u201cHomeland,\u201d a pseudo-journalist who claims to channel the voice of the people in his web videos and radio show, \u201cReal Truth.\u201d But he\u2019s actually a part of Dar\u2019s plan to help manipulate public opinion through the Office of Policy Coordination, which operates as a domestic propaganda factory. And O\u2019Keefe\u2019s website traffic (supposedly 15 million visitors a day) is inflated by bots and professional trolls.\n\nO\u2019Keefe criticizes Keane for \u201ctricking\u201d the public about her son\u2019s war record, but he is the trickster, disseminating falsehoods and then self-righteously claiming he is a truth-teller. But what happens when his lies start coming true? He called Keane dangerous before she was, in fact, dangerous. Now that his paranoid conspiracies don\u2019t seem so paranoid, could he end up becoming a legitimate voice of resistance? Or revolution?", "title": "Ready for Season 7 of \u2018Homeland\u2019?

It\u2019s touching that the secretary can now afford an extra McDonald\u2019s coffee every week, but the deficit, thanks partly to the tax cut, is projected after years of decline to explode to a trillion dollars annually.\n\nTax cuts, regardless of the deficit, are an obsession with Republicans and a source of shameless hypocrisy. During the recent shutdown crisis, the House Freedom Caucus balked at a deal to avert an impasse because it contained additional domestic spending, while in the Senate, Rand Paul of Kentucky held up the vote because the spending creates debt that threatens \u201cthe livelihoods of our children.\u201d Yet the senator and every single Freedom Caucus member enthusiastically had voted only a few weeks before for a fiscally irresponsible tax bill.\n\nRepublicans were once the party of conservation and the environment: from Abraham Lincoln, who set aside Yosemite for what later became a national park, to Theodore Roosevelt, preserving 230 million acres of public land, to Richard Nixon, who signed the Clean Air Act and created the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nNow the E.P.A. is being systematically gutted. Its administrator, Scott Pruitt, has named as chairman of its science advisory board a person who criticizes the E.P.A.\u2019s standards for exposure to mercury (a neurotoxin causing severe brain damage) and believes ozone pollution rules are unnecessary because Americans spend most of their time indoors. Another of the board\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d scientists is a man who has stated that \u201cmodern air is a little too clean for optimum health.\u201d\n\nRepublicans always counted themselves as strong supporters of law and order. Whenever a crime bill was considered in Congress, I used to joke with my colleagues that any minute, a Republican would offer an amendment proposing the death penalty for jaywalking. But the president\u2019s high-decibel smear campaign against the professionals of the F.B.I. destroys the party\u2019s pretense of being a friend of law enforcement, as does the administration\u2019s dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency and its rules against consumer fraud. The fact that Mr. Trump and his senior appointees are scofflaws regarding conflict-of-interest statutes does not enhance their reputation as straight arrows.\n\nSo what do Republicans have left? The tax cut, the sole important legislation from the Republican Congress, shows that catering to its rich contributors is the party\u2019s only policy. The rest of its agenda is simply tactics and trickery.\n\nAs the party has become unmoored from positive belief, it has grown manipulative, demagogic and contemptuous of truth. This was foreshadowed in 2004 when a senior adviser to George W. Bush boasted that \u201cwe create our own reality.\u201d It has culminated in the president\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway\u2019s appealing to \u201calternative facts,\u201d meaning lies, on behalf of her boss, who has made an average of 5.6 false or misleading claims a day since his inauguration.\n\nToday\u2019s Republican Party is incapable of honest and coherent governance, with \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d reduced to a question of whether it helps the party.

And if they don\u2019t know or understand their own feelings, how can they care about anyone else\u2019s?\n\nThis has become something of a clich\u00e9. And the truth is, there\u2019s no single culture of boys, but many. In my memories of adolescence, beneath the constant ribbing and occasional pyromania, we had tremendous affection for one another. And we longed to connect with women with an intensity that was difficult to contemplate.\n\nBut what the critique gets right is that early on, we learn to wear masks. As a father, the most obvious way to address this is by example: Take off your mask. Don\u2019t shame your son. Treat women well. From a list by the actress Nicole Stamp come more concrete recommendations: Don\u2019t use gendered insults; don\u2019t call her \u201csweetie\u201d; and when other guys demean women, tell them to knock it off.\n\nBut just modeling a better man is not enough. You also have to talk to your sons (and daughters) about what a healthy relationship looks like. Sarah Edwards, an assistant professor of psychology at Minnesota State University, told me that discussing \u201cgray zones\u201d \u2014 times when explicit consent hasn\u2019t been given \u2014 was important, because that\u2019s often when assaults happen. Her research suggests that men may not even know they\u2019ve done something wrong.\n\nAccording to a survey of 3,000 18- to 25-year-olds by Harvard\u2019s Making Caring Common Project, we are failing horribly at this task. Eighty-seven percent of the young women said they had been sexually harassed. And three-quarters of respondents said they\u2019d never talked with their parents about how to avoid harassing others. Richard Weissbourd, who led the study, said this revealed a \u201cdumbfounding abdication of responsibility.\u201d\n\nLittle data exists on whether kids actually listen to what their parents say, he concedes, but if you don\u2019t talk to your children, he argues, they\u2019re left to absorb norms from, most likely, pornography. And what boys learn from porn is that men must dominate and that women like it that way \u2014 neither of which is necessarily true.", "title": "Opinion | Real Men Get Rejected, Too", "authors": []}

My classmates often let me know that they detested the way I talked, the way I wore my hair and the food I brought from home for lunch.\n\nSo when my English teacher introduced her poetry unit, using Langston Hughes as the first poet, my spirit leapt for joy just as it did at church. I recognized the vernacular in his poems. I knew that mother who told her son that life for her had been no crystal stair. I understood the stench of rotting dreams, I knew the longing of a people wanting America to make good on its promise. When Hughes called his people beautiful like the night sky, my grandpa and cousins and neighbors came to mind. I said \u201camen\u201d in that classroom for the first time. The lesson spoke directly to me, about me.\n\nPoetry became my sanctuary.\n\nI grew up in a state where black people make up 2 percent of the population, so I needed a refuge for my blackness. I needed permission to celebrate and critique where I came from. It was validating to know that the struggle of someone like my mother was worthy of a poem, that my dreams were important enough to be recorded. Hughes\u2019s poetry was a witness to my experience, my existence.\n\nThroughout my schooling, there were many more poetry units of study, and almost always there was one black poet on the syllabus: Langston Hughes.

The poet who wrote about deferred dreams was the same writer who wrote, \u201cIf the government can set aside some spot for a elk to be a elk without being bothered, or a fish to be a fish without getting hooked, or a buffalo to be a buffalo without being shot down, there ought to be a place in this American country where a Negro can be a Negro without being Jim Crowed.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Remember Langston Hughes\u2019s Anger Alongside His Joy", "authors": []}

But it is also likely that, if the allegations are true, their programs would have violated N.C.A.A. rules, which bar teams from paying players beyond a scholarship and related costs; from offering recruits inducements beyond ones strictly delineated in the N.C.A.A. rule book; and from playing athletes who were ineligible because, for example, they accepted illicit money.", "title": "Report Ties Players at Top College Basketball Programs to Illicit Payments", "authors": []}

The government was spending too much, it was borrowing too much and it was sowing \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the business world with expiring tax cuts and other bitter policy battles, they said.\n\nIf Republican leaders still believe that, they\u2019re not acting like it.\n\nIn a year of controlling power in Washington, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have run up federal spending, approved deficit-swelling tax cuts and presided over a marked increase in \u201cpolicy uncertainty\u201d in the economy. They still talk about the importance of fiscal discipline, but they have yet to enforce it.\n\nThe $4.4 trillion budget Mr. Trump released on Monday spends as much over 10 years as any budget offered by President Barack Obama, whose policies Republicans blamed for ballooning the size of the federal government and hobbling the economy. It does not attempt to achieve balance at the end of that time, despite optimistic economic growth projections that far exceed what most economists say is possible.\n\nInstead, it projects that deficits will grow $7 trillion over the next decade as the United States continues borrowing huge sums of money \u2014 a number that could double if the administration turns out to be overestimating economic growth and if the $3 trillion in spending cuts the White House has floated do not materialize in Congress.", "title": "Republicans Have Forgotten They Hate Deficits", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "The seeds of this ballooning debt load are already taking root \u2014 the Treasury Department said last month that it expects to borrow $955 billion this fiscal year and more than $1 trillion in both 2019 and 2020. That money appears set to get only more expensive to borrow, as the Federal Reserve looks to continue raising interest rates and investors demand higher returns from an increasingly debt-laden government.\n\nIndeed, the borrowing spree is contributing to recent volatility in financial markets, as investors fret that the additional fiscal stimulus, paired with a strengthening economy, could fuel inflation and translate into higher interest rates more quickly than anticipated. Major stock indexes dropped sharply again late Thursday afternoon, falling into a market correction, or a drop of more than 10 percent from their peak, largely on comments from the Bank of England that it might raise interest rates sooner and higher as it looks to fend off possible inflation. Investors poured into bonds in a flight to safety, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury bill to a four-year high of 2.88 percent.\n\n\n\nFor many Republicans, backing the budget agreement is a break with conservative fiscal orthodoxy that carries risk going into the midterm elections. The party\u2019s professed commitment to limited government and deficit reduction helped Republicans regain control of the House and Senate during the Obama administration and also helped President Trump win election, with the candidate promising to get federal spending under control.\n\n\n\nLast May, the Trump administration released a budget projecting the United States would swing from a deficit of $440 billion in 2018 to a surplus of $16 billion in 2027. The budget called for deep cuts to domestic programs and a robust increase in military spending.\n\nInstead, the opposite has happened as Washington has opened the spending spigot in ways once unimaginable to the Republicans\u2019 fiscal discipline wing.\n\nSome budget experts have pointed out that the budget deal, which Mr. Trump supports, is more costly than the fiscal plan that Hillary Clinton proposed during her 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nPaul Winfree, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, calculated that the 2019 base level of nondefense discretionary spending surpasses what President Barack Obama sought in his final budget request.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is getting comical,\u201d Mr. Winfree, who recently left a job as an economic adviser to Mr. Trump, said in a post on Twitter.\n\nWhile the current pact is only for 2018 and 2019, those who preach fiscal restraint fret that the spending spigot is unlikely to be shut off after that. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projects that the two-year deal would set the stage for $1.7 trillion in additional deficits over the next 10 years because Congress will be operating from a higher budget baseline and will be unlikely to adopt a fresh round of austerity.\n\n\u201cThis is the new baseline,\u201d said Steve Bell, a senior adviser at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cWith this and the tax cuts, a balanced budget becomes a pipe dream.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers are re-entering a \u201cdeficits don\u2019t matter\u201d phase, like the ones that persisted during the Reagan and Bush presidencies. That has conservative economists queasy, as they look at a government budget that is only going to face more stress as an aging population turns to Medicare and Social Security and drives up spending levels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration repealed the penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate in the tax act that passed in December. Now they need to replace the mandate with something that will address rising premiums and command broader support. Automatic enrollment into health insurance plans is a good place to start.\n\nA replacement for the mandate is needed because the A.C.A.\u2019s insurance rules are still in place. Those rules, which enjoy bipartisan support, protect the sick by requiring insurers to charge the same premiums to all consumers of the same age without consideration of their health status. The mandate was supposed to encourage the healthy to stay continuously insured, through a federal tax assessment for every month without coverage, even though they could drop coverage and later acquire it when needed, without paying higher premiums. With enforcement of the mandate ending in 2019, more healthy people may leave the A.C.A.\u2019s exchanges, driving up premiums even faster for those who remain in the market.\n\nAutomatic enrollment counters the natural human inclinations toward myopia and inertia. Many people do not plan adequately for contingencies, either because they don\u2019t want to or because they lack the resources to do so. Further, the natural disinclination toward taking action means some consumers will not jump through the hoops necessary to sign up for benefits even if they find what is being offered attractive.\n\nEmployers use automatic enrollment today in their pension plans, and it works. Firms place workers into plans and set default contribution rates for them. Workers retain the right to change their rates or their investment funds, or to stop contributing altogether. More than two-thirds of all firms sponsoring pension plans use automatic enrollment to increase participation among workers who do not opt in to the plans on their own. The percentage of firms with at least an 80 percent participation rate in their defined contribution retirement plans has increased to 64 percent in 2014 from 50 percent in 2010, largely because of automatic enrollment.", "title": "Opinion | Republicans Need a Nudge to Lower Health Care Costs", "authors": []}

In 2015, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges raised questions about a student code forbidding \u201chomosexual practice\u201d at Gordon College, a Christian school near Boston. But the association let Gordon College keep its accreditation after it agreed to expand its support to gay, lesbian and transgender students.\n\nBarbara E. Brittingham, president of the commission that oversees higher education for the association, said the agency tried to ensure that one group of students was not treated differently from another. \u201cThere are many things in motion about American higher education,\u201d she said, \u201cand with that comes the obligation to make sure they are treating all students in a way that supports the students personally and academically.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Everett Piper, the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, said it was unfair to equate religious belief with discrimination. His college\u2019s handbook forbids behavior that promotes a \u201csexual identity outside of the scriptural expectation,\u201d such as \u201chomosexual P.D.A.,\u201d or public displays of affection, part of a catalog of sexual behavior that may result in suspension or dismissal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between discriminating against behavior and discriminating against a person,\u201d Mr. Piper said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother element of the bill addresses a common college practice \u2014 requiring religious student groups that want school funds or meeting space to admit any student, regardless of their faith, and to grant them all the same access to leadership positions. The measure, which would apply only to public universities, would prohibit them from having such policies if they wanted access to federal aid.\n\nIt would counteract a Supreme Court decision in 2010 that allowed the University of California Hastings College of the Law to withhold recognition from a student group, the Christian Legal Society, because it blocked gay students from having voting privileges or leadership roles.\n\nAnother provision is aimed at universities where controversial, or sometimes merely conservative, speakers have sought to appear. Schools have denied speaking slots or put restrictions on them after some protests against the speakers have become unruly. After violent protests last February, the University of California, Berkeley, canceled an appearance by the conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, leading Mr. Trump to take to Twitter to threaten to withhold federal funds from the university. Several universities have turned down speaking requests from Richard Spencer, the white supremacist, citing the potential for violence.\n\nThe bill criticizes the use of campus \u201cfree speech zones\u201d where such speakers are sometimes asked to stay within, but it would not bar the zones or stop colleges from setting rules. It would force colleges to publicly declare their speech policies, so if they tried to change the rules ad hoc, depending on who was speaking, they would be vulnerable to free-speech lawsuits.\n\nThough Republicans had been energized by attempts by students or colleges to mute conservative ideas, speakers of all political stripes would stand to benefit from the law, said Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a free-speech advocacy group.\n\n\u201cPeople are censored by who they disagree with,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cStudents are censored from all parts of the political spectrum for a variety of motives.\u201d\n\nIn a broad freedom of association provision, the bill would prevent colleges and universities from disciplining students based on their membership in a single-sex student organization, including fraternities and sororities. Republican congressional aides said this provision was inspired by Harvard\u2019s new policy of denying certain privileges \u2014 like leadership positions and recommendations for fellowships \u2014 to members of single-sex social clubs. Harvard officials have said the organizations are anti-egalitarian and foster an atmosphere of sexual harassment, while club members say they should be allowed to associate with whomever they wish.\n\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican and Harvard alumna, was among those who worked on this provision, her spokesman, Tom Flanagin, said. Although Ms. Stefanik was not a member of a single-gender group at Harvard, he said, \u201cshe believes all schools should respect students\u2019 right to freely associate.\u201d\n\nIn a twist, though, the bill, as currently written, apparently would not apply to Harvard: It would affect only colleges that recognize such clubs, and Harvard stopped recognizing its all-male final clubs about 30 years ago. And some officials of other universities fear the impact could become quite broad, restricting their ability to combat the perennial problem of hazing and binge drinking at fraternities. But other administrators said they did not believe the authors of the bill intended for it to go that far.", "title": "Republicans Stuff Education Bill With Conservative Social Agenda", "authors": ["Anemona Hartocollis"]}

What does it say about school shootings in the United States? What does that make them think and feel? Why?\n\nIn the related article, Jugal K. Patel writes:\n\nMore than 40 \u201cactive shooter\u201d episodes in schools have been recorded in the United States since 2000, according to F.B.I. and news reports. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors. With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.\n\nIn fact, lockdown drills are now such a common feature of the school experience that a high school student who was one of the winners of our Editorial Contest last year wrote an essay, \u201cStopping Bullets With Locked Doors and Silence Is Already Pulling the Trigger.\u201d In it she argues:\n\nIt has become very familiar for high-school students to practice the infamous level-three lockdown. In all cases, we all share the semi-nervous chuckle of \u201cwow, maybe we get Swiss-cheesed today\u201d and sit in a corner, stare at our phones and text our friends. Only very recently, after a vivid dream \u2014 more a nightmare \u2014 of a school shooting, did I realize that sitting in the dark and stopping bullets with locked doors and silence is the exact opposite of what one would want to do. It wasn\u2019t until I stumbled upon the fact that the \u201cpeople shot and killed in the Columbine library sat there for five minutes before the shooters entered and shot them.\u201d My school is full of able-bodied kids, and surprisingly, a great chunk that has had experience with self-defense and even marksmen training. So why sit and wait?\n\nHas your school been affected by gun violence? What measures do you have in place to prevent future violence, or to respond to threats? Ask students to investigate if they can\u2019t answer that question, then discuss: Do you think your school and community are doing enough to prevent future shootings? If not, what else do you think they should do? What do you think individual students can do, if anything?\n\n_________\n\nAre We Becoming \u201cNumb\u201d to School Shootings?\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nThousands of readers have commented on the article about the Parkland shooting. One by Tom from Vermont sums up what he\u2019s read:\n\nThe comments here seem so stark and brief. Understandably so, what is left to say? It is becoming so easy to see a headline like the one on this story and shrug. This is the new America. But is it? Something inside me still makes me think we have the resolve to turn this terrible tide.\n\nOn The Learning Network, we responded to a shooting in Benton, Ky. in January by posing the question, Are We Becoming \u2018Numb\u2019 to School Shootings? It was in reaction to an article headlined, \u201cSchool Shooting in Kentucky Was Nation\u2019s 11th of Year. It Was Jan. 23.\u201d Seventy students answered, and the question is still open to comment if your students would like to weigh in.\n\nNathanie Doralus from Florida wrote:\n\nAs a student, I agree that we\u2019ve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think it\u2019s an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some won\u2019t take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldn\u2019t have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how it\u2019s hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence.\n\nAnd Jocelyn Savard from North Carolina shared this perspective:\n\nIn Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads \u201cAmericans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook\u201d and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed. I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number. When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me, I cried for days. Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky, I barely blinked an eye. Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanity\u2019s downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy \u2018looks like a school shooter\u2019, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home.\n\nDo your students agree with these teenagers that \u201cwe are rapidly becoming detached to the horror\u201d of school shootings? Why or why not?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow has this latest attack affected them? What do they think we might do to keep from becoming \u201cdetached\u201d?\n\n_________\n\nThe Role of Students: Cellphones and Social Media\n\nVideo\n\nTechnology has allowed the public to witness mass shootings in new and terrifying ways. The students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used their cellphones and social media accounts in real time to share their experiences and spread messages of pain, anger and gratitude, as well as calls to action.\n\nIn \u201cAs Shots Ring Out, a Student Texts: \u2018If I Don\u2019t Make It, I Love You,\u2019\u201d Audra D.S. Burch and Patricia Mazzei write:\n\nOne student hit her record button while being led out of the school to safety by sheriff\u2019s deputies. On her way, her cellphone\u2019s shaking camera lens passed over several bodies sprawled on the floor. In another cellphone video, several dozen gunshots were audible not far away. \u201cOh my God! Oh my God!\u201d one student shouted. Like many school districts, Broward County\u2019s allows high school students to bring cellphones to school, so long as they don\u2019t interfere with class work. On Wednesday, many students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School held onto their phones for dear life as a 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, stalked the grounds and fatally shot 17 people. They used them to keep their terrified parents informed about what was happening. And they used them to keep a visual record of an awful crime. Hiding in a sweltering storage room with about 40 other students, she typed out a text message to her mother, Stacy, for what she thought might be the last time.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t make it,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI love you and I appreciate everything you did for me.\u201d\n\nStudents also took to Twitter to post the texts they thought might be their last to their family and friends:\n\nAsk your students:\n\nWhare are your reactions to these firsthand accounts of the violence that took place in Parkland, Fla.?\n\nHow have these videos impacted the public conversation around guns and school safety? Why do you think they have had such a dramatic effect? Do you think the fact that your generation is so fluent in social media gives you a voice previous generations did not have? What might be the benefits and drawbacks of that if so?\n\n__________\n\nThe Role of Students: \u201dThey Survived the School Shooting. Now They\u2019re Calling for Action\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 15, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School implored lawmakers to act to prevent future violence, calling the frequency of school shootings in the United States \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdeas are great, ideas are wonderful and they help you get re-elected and everything, but what\u2019s more important is actual action,\u201d the student, David Hogg, said on CNN.\n\nMr. Hogg, whose younger sister lost two friends in the shooting, called on politicians to act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re children,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys are the adults.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince then, as The Times writes, \u201cyouthful voices have resonated where those of longtime politicians have largely fallen flat,\u201d and many see in that a reason for hope.\n\nAs David Leonhardt writes:\n\n...the movement to reduce gun violence seems to have a new energy, driven by students \u2014 who of course have provided much of the energy for previous political movements. Individual schools have already held or planned walkouts. A nationwide protest is scheduled for March 14, with help from organizers of the Women\u2019s March. Teachers are also talking about mass protest, as Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick explains.\n\nIn \u201cA \u2018Mass Shooting Generation\u2019 Cries Out for Change,\u201d The Times points out that teenagers today have grown up with code-red drills, and they have a perspective many adults do not:\n\nThis is life for the children of the mass shooting generation. They were born into a world reshaped by the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, and grew up practicing active shooter drills and huddling through lockdowns. They talked about threats and safety steps with their parents and teachers. With friends, they wondered darkly whether it could happen at their own school, and who might do it. Now, this generation is almost grown up. And when a gunman killed 17 students this week at Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., the first response of many of their classmates was not to grieve in silence, but to speak out. Their urgent voices \u2014 in television interviews, on social media, even from inside a locked school office as they hid from the gunman \u2014 are now rising in the national debate over gun violence in the aftermath of yet another school shooting. While many politicians after the shooting were focused on mental health and safety, some vocal students at Stoneman Douglas High showed no reluctance in drawing attention to gun control. They called out politicians over Twitter, with one student telling Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, \u201cYOU DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND.\u201d Shortly after the shooting, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and a few friends started a \u201cNever Again\u201d campaign on Facebook that shared stories and perspectives from other students who survived the rampage.\n\nVideo\n\nWhat do your students think about these activist teenagers and their messages? What messages or ideas resonate with them the most?\n\nCan their generation effect real change on gun violence? How? What examples are they reading or hearing about \u2014 or witnessing themselves \u2014 that seem to be having an impact? What are their own personal opinions about what should be done, how and why? What can each of us do as individuals, and what can people their age do together?\n\nAs many have pointed out, it was widespread student activism during the era of the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam that helped \u201cchange history.\u201d And as we learned from the students who participated in our recent News Diet Challenge, teenagers can feel overwhelmed by the news unless they can find a way to act on what they read.\n\nTo learn more, invite them to read \u201cEmma Gonz\u00e1lez Leads a Student Outcry on Guns: \u2018This Is the Way I Have to Grieve\u2019\u201d and watch the related videos, including the one below:\n\nThey can also read an Op-Ed in The Times by a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In \u201cDon\u2019t Let My Classmates\u2019 Deaths Be in Vain,\u201d Christine Yared writes:\n\nWe can\u2019t let innocent people\u2019s deaths be in vain. We need to work together beyond political parties to make sure this never happens again. We need tougher gun laws. If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be able to legally purchase a weapon of mass destruction. This could have been prevented. If the killer had been properly treated for his mental illness, maybe this would not have happened. If there were proper background checks, then those who should not have guns would not have them. We need to vote for those who are for stricter laws and kick out those who won\u2019t take action. We need to expose the truth about gun violence and the corruption around guns. Please.\n\nInvite your class to respond to the Student Opinion question we have posted: Can High School Students Make a Real Impact on the Problem of Gun Violence in the United States?\n\nAnd if they are interested in more ideas for taking action beyond those these young people have already suggested, our lesson plan Ideas for Student Civic Action in a Time of Social Uncertainty might offer ideas.\n\n_________\n\nThe AR-15 and Gun Control\n\nVideo\n\nThe New York Times reports that the gunman who killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School used an AR-15 assault rifle. This style of rifle was also used in the attacks in Newtown, Conn.; Aurora, Colo.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex., among others.\n\nStudents might watch the video above, then discuss: What are some of the reasons that the AR-15, and other weapons like it, have become so common in mass shootings? How does it compare with other types of guns?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn recent years the regulation of the sale of this style of rifle has come to the forefront of the national gun debate. In a 2017 appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court, relatives of victims in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School argued:\n\nThe companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman should be held responsible for the 2012 attack. A lawsuit filed by the relatives said that the AR-15-style Bushmaster used to carry out the shooting in Newtown, Conn., that killed 26 people, including 20 first graders, was specifically marketed as a weapon of war, with slogans and product placement in video games invoking the violence of combat. The lawsuit claims that such promotions were a deliberate effort to make the weapon attractive to young men, like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cthe National Rifle Association has taken to calling the AR-15 \u2018America\u2019s rifle\u2019\u201d and \u201cgun owners say that the AR-15 is used for hunting, sport shooting and self-defense.\u201d\n\nAsk students: Do you think AR-15-style rifles should be more strictly regulated in the United States? Why or why not?\n\nDo you think any other measures should be taken to restrict access to guns? If so, what? If not, what else can be done to prevent more mass shootings like this one?\n\nStudents might read how others responded to these questions after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., and add their voices to the conversation by commenting here since that post is now closed.\n\nOr, take a look at the forum on guns we posted during the 2016 election as part of our Civil Conversation Challenge for teenagers. We invited students to have productive, respectful conversations on several issues dividing Americans, and more than 700 responses came in to the questions we posed about gun rights, the Second Amendment and more.\n\nUpdate: The Times has now published a piece that summarizes political responses: \u201cRight and Left React to the Gun Control Debate After the Florida Shooting.\u201d\n\n_________\n\nOnly in the United States?\n\nPhoto\n\nIn \u201cHow to Reduce Shootings,\u201d the columnist Nicholas Kristof writes:\n\nInevitably, predictably, fatefully, another mass shooting breaks our hearts. This time, it was a school shooting in Florida on Wednesday that left at least 17 dead at the hands of 19-year-old gunman and his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. But what is perhaps most heartbreaking of all is that they shouldn\u2019t be shocking. People all over the world become furious and try to harm others, but only in the United States do we suffer such mass shootings so regularly; only in the United States do we lose one person every 15 minutes to gun violence.\n\nHe writes that we should \u201clearn lessons from these tragedies, so that there can be fewer of them. In particular, I suggest that we try a new approach to reducing gun violence \u2014 a public health strategy.\u201d\n\nInvite your students to take a look at the graphics from a visual essay he did in November after the church shooting in Texas. What do they see? What questions do the charts raise? To what extent do they agree with Mr. Kristof\u2019s conclusions?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n___________\n\nThe Gunman\n\nWhat do authorities know so far about the shooter? What is not yet known?\n\nIn \u201cNikolas Cruz, Florida Shooting Suspect, Was Expelled From School,\u201d Matthew Haag and Serge F. Kovaleski write:\n\nThe man suspected of opening fire inside a Florida high school on Wednesday, killing at least 17 people, is a former student who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, the authorities said. \u2026 In the hours after the shooting, people who knew Mr. Cruz described him as a \u201ctroubled kid\u201d who enjoyed showing off his firearms, bragging about killing animals and whose mother would resort to calling the police to have them come to their home to try to talk some sense into him. At a school with about 3,000 students, Mr. Cruz stayed to himself and had few friends but struck fear in some students with erratic behavior and an affinity for violence.\n\n\u2026 In the interview with the Miami news station, the student said Mr. Cruz was a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School when he was expelled last year. He said that students would joke that if anyone were to open fire inside the school, it would be Mr. Cruz. Because of that, students feared him and mostly stayed away from him, the student said. \u201cA lot of people were saying that it would be him,\u201d the student told WFOR-TV. \u201cThey would say he would be the one to shoot up the school. Everyone predicted it.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cNikolas Cruz\u2019s Lifetime of Trouble: Family Loss, Flashes of Rage,\u201d The Times writes that he has been \u201ccausing trouble as long as anyone here could remember.\u201d\n\nDo you think this attack could have been prevented? If so, how? If not, why not?\n\nWhat might school administrators, teachers and students be able to learn from this attack to prevent others like it from happening?

{"date": "2018-02-19 00:00:00", "text": "This has been an emotional week. We greet tragedies like the school shooting in Florida with shock, sadness, mourning and grief that turns into indignation and rage. The anger inevitably gets directed at the N.R.A., those who support gun rights, and the politicians who refuse to do anything while children die.\n\nMany of us walked this emotional path. But we may end up doing more harm than good. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned, it is that guns have become a cultural flash point in a nation that is unequal and divided. The people who defend gun rights believe that snobbish elites look down on their morals and want to destroy their culture. If we end up telling such people that they and their guns are despicable, they will just despise us back and dig in their heels.\n\nSo if you want to stop school shootings it\u2019s not enough just to vent and march. It\u2019s necessary to let people from Red America lead the way, and to show respect to gun owners at all points. There has to be trust and respect first. Then we can strike a compromise on guns as guns, and not some sacred cross in the culture war.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been thinking about a group that\u2019s in the trust and respect business.

And while Rachmaninoff\u2019s Second and Third Piano Concertos are staples of the repertory, his Fourth Concerto tends to turn up only when an orchestra is surveying all four.\n\nWell, the pianist Leif Ove Andsnes has come to the rescue. For his stint this season as artist in residence with the New York Philharmonic, he made the adventurous decision to play these overlooked works on three programs. In October he gave an incisive account of Rachmaninoff\u2019s Fourth that made a case for this episodic piece as its composer\u2019s most experimental score. He will play the Debussy in April.\n\nOn Thursday, with Antonio Pappano on the podium, Mr. Andsnes gave an exhilarating performance of Britten\u2019s unconventional four-movement concerto, last heard at the Philharmonic 36 years ago. Britten was just 25 when he composed it, in 1938, though seven years later he revised it (replacing the third movement, a Recitative and Aria, with an Impromptu).\n\nI yield to no one in my admiration for Britten, and I\u2019ve always liked this early concerto.

What sort of chemistry might have developed between a once-brash wunderkind, now 37, and one of Old Europe\u2019s most august ensembles?\n\nThere was, for one thing, the matter of Leonard Bernstein, the quintessential New York maestro and a sort of Dudamel archetype, born a century ago this year. After ignoring invitations to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic for years because of its deep involvement with the Nazi regime during World War II, Bernstein finally acceded in 1966 and became a favorite of the ensemble in later decades.\n\nIt was surely too much to hope that Mr. Dudamel, the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, would lead the players, twirling their instruments, in a raucous account of \u201cMambo\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d as he has often done as an encore with the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. But sure enough in the concert on Friday, which opened an Americas Tour with the Philharmonic, there was a Bernstein trifle to start off a rich slate of encores: the Waltz from his Divertimento for Orchestra. (The other encores were by Josef Strauss on Friday and Saturday, and Tchaikovsky on Sunday.)\n\nThere was another possible nod to Bernstein in the program itself on Sunday afternoon: Charles Ives\u2019s Second Symphony, a somewhat baffling cornucopia of Americana, and a bit of an adventure for the Viennese. Bernstein gave the premiere of the work with the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie in 1951, nearly half a century after it was written. It is entirely possible, given the Vienna Philharmonic\u2019s incremental (not to say glacial) and often indirect way of deviating from its norms, that this was intended as a significant tribute to Bernstein.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn any case, the orchestra rewarded Mr. Dudamel and a packed house with a bang-up performance of the work. The players seemed to enjoy traipsing through the cluttered attic of Ives\u2019s musical mind and memory as much as Mr. Dudamel did.

(With two lengthy intermissions, the performance lasted nearly six hours.)\n\nDuring the first sighing unison phrase of the prelude, the strings played with hushed yet penetrating tone, rising with a touch of hesitation and slowly swelling in sound and radiance, until the upper strings crested into delicate, lacy arpeggios. Mr. N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin took a daringly restrained tempo here.

And before we settle in for a cozy, chilly chat with some loquacious drinkers at their local, we get to see our leading executioner in action. His name is Harry (Mark Addy, first-rate), who has the complacent, well-fed look of an eater of beef and death-dealing servant of the crown.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the opening scene, set in 1963, Harry, aided by his stuttering assistant, Syd (a creature of Dickensian furtiveness, as played by Reece Shearsmith), secures the noose around the neck of a convicted young murderer who dies protesting his innocence. Played with blazing desperation by Gilles Geary, the doomed man gasps out a last-minute promise to haunt his assassins. (\u201cWell, that\u2019s not a nice thing to say, is it?\u201d says a peeved Syd.)\n\nRemember his name: Hennessy. Harry and Syd certainly will.\n\nTwo years later, Hennessy inevitably comes up in the conversation at the pub that Harry now owns. It is, as Harry puts it \u201ca momentous bloody day,\u201d the date on which capital punishment has been made obsolete.\n\nA young reporter (Owen Campbell) is there, asking for a few commemorative words from Harry, and if Harry is smart (which he ain\u2019t) he\u2019ll say nothing. In the meantime, our Mr. Mooney slithers into the pub, bringing the disharmonious vibe of a swinging, sexed-up London into this frozen outpost of the middle-class 1950s.\n\nThat\u2019s about all you need in the way of setup, though I suppose you should know that Harry has a very bored wife, Alice (Sally Rogers), and a restless, terminally na\u00efve 15-year-old daughter, Shirley (Gaby French). The denizens at Harry\u2019s bar \u2014 a sheeplike herd of enjoyably varied bleats \u2014 include an ineffectual policeman (David Lansbury), and three wilting barflies (Billy Carter, Richard Hollis and John Horton) who are drawn to the place by its owner\u2019s notoriety. Lurking at the plot\u2019s edges is Harry\u2019s archrival from his hanging days, Albert (Maxwell Caulfield).\n\nThe big subject of \u201cHangmen\u201d is the uses and abuses of vengeance, a theme evidently much on Mr. McDonagh\u2019s mind. \u201cThree Billboards\u201d traces the wayward forms taken by the urge to get even in a small American town. Since \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is a Hollywood movie, there is sunlight, real and metaphoric, throughout, including glimmers of that audience-pleasing essential known as Redemption.\n\n\u201cHangmen,\u201d in contrast, is every bit as dark as Mr. McDonagh\u2019s early, bloody plays set in rural Ireland (including \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane\u201d and \u201cThe Lieutenant of Inishmore\u201d). As for redemption, forget about it. People are either foolish or dangerously flawed in the world of \u201cHangmen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a writer of Mr. McDonagh\u2019s scalpel-edged gifts, these unadmirable qualities are joyous opportunities, allowing for the sort of conversation in which stupidity and pettiness achieve the sparkle of wit. \u201cHangmen\u201d is often very funny. But as you laugh, you may feel the walls of Anna Fleischle\u2019s clammy pub set closing in on you.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere will be thunder and lightning before the play ends, during a dark and stormy day in which someone goes missing and light thickens, as surely as it does in \u201cMacbeth.\u201d (All credit to Joshua Carr, the lighting designer.)\n\nReplacing the estimable David Morrissey, whom I saw in London two years ago, Mr. Addy brings an extra layer of fatuity and vanity to Harry, which makes you suspect that any comeuppance he receives won\u2019t seriously dent this thick skin. The excellent Ms. Rogers returns as Harry\u2019s frowzy helpmeet, a woman narcotized by monotony, who can still put on the dog for a handsome stranger.\n\nAn affectingly awkward Ms. French, new to the cast, and Mr. Flynn work up a thrilling fly-meets-spider chemistry in their scenes together. And though the play features two simulated deaths (though without the usual McDonagh carnage quotient), its most viscerally disturbing moment finds Mooney slowly, slowly tracing an arc in the air with his hand, to show Shirley he knows what a curve is.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(Interestingly, he registers as more of a shrewd disciple of Alfred Hitchcock in his plays than he does in his movies.)\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson that\u2019s perfectly grasped by the sensational Mooney of Mr. Flynn, an original cast member whose resume includes Shakespeare with Mark Rylance and his own folk-rock band. Mooney revels in scrambling notions of what\u2019s funny and what\u2019s frightening.\n\nNiggling arguments about words abound in Mr. McDonagh\u2019s world. \u201cHanged\u201d versus \u201chung\u201d as a past tense crops up at the darnedest times here. And Mooney is given to earnestly weighing the adjectives that best suit him, as if they were neckties: creepy (no!), funny (well, not really) and menacing (absolutely).\n\nHe\u2019s wrong, though. Mooney is hilariously menacing, or do I mean menacingly hilarious? In any case, he\u2019s a happy-creepy reminder that Mr. McDonagh can still work his double-edged, sinister magic on a stage, making breathless, alarmed and deeply satisfied dupes of us all.", "title": "Review: A Criminally Enjoyable \u2018Hangmen\u2019 From Martin McDonagh", "authors": ["Ben Brantley"]}

So when the work, which opened at the Chocolate Factory on Tuesday, began in silence and dim light, I settled in for a meditative experience, a slow reveal. But the first sound came as a shock: a floor-shaking rumble that felt like the start of an earthquake.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. Ms. Monson, who has been a revered figure in experimental dance for decades, has lately been known for researching outdoors and for bringing a sense of nature inside. But while her nature studies incorporate much stasis and quiet, her vision of nature is of forces larger than herself \u2014 wild, powerful forces that can unexpectedly erupt.\n\nThat initial rumble comes from the sound artist Jeff Kolar, who tweaks the dials and levers of his electronics onstage, making visible his technological manipulation of radio waves, storm surges and cricket chirps. The lighting designer Elliott Cennetoglu also works in full view of the audience, brightening and dimming the world, shading it blue and green. The musician Zeena Parkins is sometimes onstage, brushing a microphone against her clothing, connecting sound with touch. She also plays her harp next to viewers\u2019 seats. Her music can be dulcet, as you might expect, though other times it sounds \u2014 and feels \u2014 like heavy metal.\n\nJoining Ms. Monson is the dancer Mauriah Kraker, an effective foil \u2014 younger and more svelte. Although it can be difficult to take your eyes off Ms. Monson, Ms. Kraker is essential. Some of the dance is in unison, all of it interactive. Early on, the two women wrestle, grappling with hooked ankles rather than hands. Near the end, they transfer the activity to their arms, seeming at once to desire entanglement and to push each other out of the way.\n\nIn one strangely captivating section, they stand side by side, as still as figures in a double portrait. Or almost as still, since their faces do move, nearly imperceptibly. Ms. Monson\u2019s face tightens, in concern or anger, following something with her eyes.\n\nSuch subtle change is what is most like the dawn in \u201cbend the even.\u201d Both the music and the dance often work in loops, with large facets repeating while small parts shift until the whole is utterly different. But, again, this nuance doesn\u2019t preclude shocks. Suddenly, the dancers twist, wrench, lunge and leap with a kind of fight-or-flight desperation.\n\nWhen Ms. Monson is in the zone, her performances can seem, without any conventional drama, like an extraordinary event that is happening to her, the emergence of some greater aliveness to which she has opened herself. But if you keep yourself open, suspending impatience (it takes effort), you too can tune into that frequency and feel those vibrations. It\u2019s like adjusting your ears to listen to a butterfly\u2019s wings and being inundated instead with the roar of the ocean.", "title": "Review: A Dance About the Dawn, but Not the Quiet Dawn", "authors": ["Brian Seibert"]}

The woman\u2019s weeping may be sad, at least given the circumstances, office decorum and social norms.

Setsuko may be mean, but in a movie that is very much concerned with identity and the roles that we assume and reject, it\u2019s clear that she isn\u2019t entirely unjustified.\n\nAt first, Ms. Terajima\u2019s subtle performance works like a roadblock to easy sympathy.

And sure enough, the work, which had its United States debut at the Joyce Theater on Tuesday, was partly generated through science. Mr. McGregor had his genome sequenced. Before each performance a computer algorithm based on that biographical data determines the sequencing of the dance\u2019s 23 sections. So each performance is different.\n\nYet for a work to be reordered meaningfully, it must have some comprehensible order to begin with. In \u201cAutobiography,\u201d the title and number of each section are flashed as that section starts, and the titles suggest parts of a life, or ideas about one: Nature, Nurture, Aging, Sleep. Yet if these titles were decoupled from their sections and reshuffled, it would make little difference. The one called \u201cMemories\u201d could just as well be \u201cChoosing.\u201d\n\nThe cause is within, less the ordering of sections than the ordering of steps. Mr. McGregor\u2019s troupe is no longer called Random Dance \u2014 it\u2019s Company Wayne McGregor \u2014 but his sense of sequence is still random in effect, section to section and moment to moment. As ever, his androgynous dancers are a hyper-flexible tribe, able to stretch, splay and bend every which way. Amid this signature elasticity, Mr. McGregor now adds emotional gestures: heads in hands, bodies cradling bodies. But these gestures are just extra bits in the blender, no more or less affecting.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead of shape or heart, there is impressive surface style. The set by Ben Cullen Williams is a spiky metal grid that hangs above the dancers and sometimes descends upon them like a cage contracting. Lucy Carter\u2019s lighting does even more to slice and dice the stage space. Its sweeping planes of illumination are sculptural and dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll this technical sophistication, though, seems to be at the service of a fundamentally unsophisticated sensibility, most glaringly exposed by the music. When the piece debuted in Britain, some critics complained about harsh blasts in the electronic score by Jlin.

Except for a brief respite of Corelli, we might have been in the lounge of a boutique hotel.\n\nThe combination of this music with the preening, aggressive-recessive manner of Mr. McGregor\u2019s choreography is often close to unbearable, and the scrambled structure offers no path through the mire. For all the intellectual effort that his work has long flaunted \u2014 this program credits institutes across Europe as \u201congoing scientific partners\u201d \u2014 it has never been dry movement research.

The restaurant visits and chef interviews are broken up with fake commercials, animations, film clips and parodies of Japanese TV comedies or the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Julia-Child-bleeds-out skit. The season finale is structured as a debate between Mr. Chang and the chef Mario Carbone over the relative merits of Italian filled pastas and Asian dumplings.\n\nThese techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.\n\nThe visual curlicues and the attempts to impose a larger thematic structure and narrative \u2014 there\u2019s an awful lot of tired talk about how food tells stories \u2014 don\u2019t hide the reality that there isn\u2019t a whole lot new or surprising about \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d (The exception: the openness with which it discusses racism as a fundamental force in culinary culture.) Its primary influence, as with other food shows, will probably be to max out reservations at impossibly cool-looking restaurants like the Tokyo pizzeria Seirinkan or the locavorish Salare in Seattle.\n\nWhat the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness. With the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar 14 years ago, he fortuitously caught the waves of both millennial casualness and fangirl-fanboy-style fetishization (of ingredients, of methods, of chefs) that swept through the restaurant business.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.\n\nAnd in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.\n\n(African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)\n\nThe show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera.

Adam Winkler, a professor at the law school at the University of California Los Angeles, has nonetheless managed to produce a work that is both engrossing and surprising. Professor Winkler has identified a secret parallel universe of civil rights whose beneficiaries are not the \u201cdiscrete and insular minorities\u201d whose protection were once the focus of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n\nFrom pre-Revolutionary times to now, \u201cWe the Corporations: How American Businesses Won Their Civil Rights\u201d charts the strategies and philosophical battles that have now earned state-created corporate entities much the same civil rights as individual citizens. Professor Winkler argues that this has occurred because corporate rights \u201chave largely been won in the courts, not in the streets, and have developed largely without much public scrutiny.\u201d\n\nRecent Supreme Court decisions in the Citizens United and Hobby Lobby cases have brought the apparent triumph of corporate rights to the forefront of the national consciousness. But the nature of the role of corporations in United States history is poorly appreciated, often undermining the quality of the resulting debate. We celebrate the persecuted Pilgrims\u2019 landing at Plymouth Rock in 1620 every Thanksgiving, but years earlier \u201cthe Virginia Company of London founded England\u2019s first permanent New World colony in Jamestown.\u201d And few realize that key portions of the earliest state constitutions \u2014 including the recognition of individual rights \u2014 are lifted wholesale from the corporate charters of these early colonies.\n\nThat said, given the absence of any mention in the Constitution of corporations or, with the exception of the First Amendment\u2019s reference to \u201cthe press,\u201d businesses of any kind, the ability of these \u201cartificial persons\u201d to secure many of the same rights as real people is a little shocking.

On social media and elsewhere, a 2003 sexual assault case against Mr. Bryant (which was later dismissed) was cited as a reason not to honor the movie.

A wolf (superbly voiced by Dominic West) regales a baby sitter with the real lowdown on Red Riding Hood and Snow White, with couplets including \u201cThen this is the disgusting part/the Queen sat down and ate the heart.\u201d The computer animation here yields a fun variety of facial caricatures for the beloved figures being deconstructed.\n\nThe really outstanding nominee is \u201cGarden Party,\u201d directed by a French collective of six that calls itself Illogic. It\u2019s a simple narrative in which a few animals, mostly amphibious \u2014 a tree frog and a bullfrog among them \u2014 trudge out of water and down from branches into a mysteriously deserted mansion. The mastery of computer animation here is staggering. The rotting food in the kitchen that the animals snack on is a vivid metaphor for human overconsumption, and the reason for the house\u2019s desolate state is both horror-movie grim and mordantly funny. Watch out for Illogic \u2014 these artists are sure to be heard from more decisively in the future.", "title": "Review: In These Oscar-Nominated Animated Shorts, Riveting Fairy Tales and Kitchen Rot", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny"]}

The filmmakers trail Jan Rader, who becomes the city\u2019s fire chief, on tense overdose calls, and sit in the courtroom of Judge Patricia Keller, who speaks to the recovering addicts before her with the patience of a parent. Necia Freeman hands out food to addicted prostitutes.\n\nVideo\n\nAt 39 minutes, \u201cHeroin(e)\u201d sprawls; each thread could sustain longer-term treatment.

The movie combines the dashcam footage of the arrest with Ms. King\u2019s reflections on the incident. The biographical details, meant to warm the heart and stoke outrage, feel superfluous. (A violent arrest would be a violent arrest even if Ms. King weren\u2019t a model citizen.)\n\n\u201cHeaven Is a Traffic Jam on the 405\u201d tells the story of Mindy Alper, who spent her life grappling with mental illness, and emerged as a successful artist.

Set in a future that looks pretty much like today, it centers on a biologist, Lena (Natalie Portman), who shortly after the movie opens reunites with her husband, Kane (Oscar Isaac), who she thought was dead. As he sits in their kitchen, the camera slinking about, Lena\u2019s surprise gives way to happiness and then to mounting wariness that, like some kind of contagion, soon slithers under your skin. To understand what has happened and why, Lena sets off on a heroic journey, one that \u2014 like most such adventures \u2014 inevitably leads inward with each searching step.\n\nThe setup turns on one of those alien mysteries (an extraterrestrial or a monolith or floating spaceships) that have come to Earth to wreak havoc or hatch conspiracies and force humans to make bad choices. The foreign body here takes the form of what\u2019s called the shimmer: a glistening, ever-growing force field that has descended on a swath of Florida marshland like an opalescent shower curtain. The shimmer\u2019s whirling pinky purples and blues evoke the rainbow colors you see in oily patches on a road after it rains, which suggests there\u2019s something toxic about its beauty. The rainbow can\u2019t help but also evoke the adventurous Dorothy, another traveler to a strange land.\n\nLena heads off on her own far-out trip soon after arriving at a government bunker at the edge of the shimmer. There, anonymous types scurry around or stare into computers; some carry guns, others clipboards; still others wear Hazmat suits. After a banging start \u2014 an inquisition, a homecoming \u2014 the writer-director Alex Garland fumbles putting these pieces in place. He rolls out the introductions, drops a little mumbo jumbo and some data points (mostly from Dr. Ventress, a shrink played by the perfectly chilled Jennifer Jason Leigh); he also engages in too much narrative throat clearing.

(The title is relentless, too.) The structure of \u201cAthena\u201d can feel too pat, the culminating bout predictable.\n\nBut to the director Emma Miller\u2019s credit, that bout is a long, real-time slog up and down the piste, effortful and tough, and a little ugly. (The simple set, with the girls\u2019 foils playing against Jack\u2019s aluminum foil walls is by Emmie Finckel. The costumes, little more than white sneakers and electrified uniforms, are by Dara Affholter.) And the play never diminishes or mocks the importance of a relationship that flourishes and maybe dies over a couple of months during junior year. It treats these girls and their ambitions with the seriousness they deserve.\n\nMs. Awe and Ms. Greer play their roles with humor, grit and team spirit \u2014 palpable even behind those mesh masks. Ms. Awe plays Mary as childlike, but also as the more confident of the pair. Ms. Greer\u2019s Athena is more worldly, but also much needier and more fragile.

On Thursday at Danspace Project, during the premiere of Mina Nishimura\u2019s \u201cBladder Inn (and X, Y, Z, W),\u201d such a development often seemed imminent. In a loosely knit hourlong show that spilled from the sanctuary of St. Mark\u2019s Church into its back rooms and balconies, Ms. Nishimura, one of eight dancers, created not so much a world as an atmosphere, a web of activity on the brink of dissolving.\n\nAn entrancing performer in her own work and others\u2019 \u2014 like that of her husband, Kota Yamazaki, and the choreographer Dean Moss \u2014 Ms. Nishimura can\u2019t help but be a focal point onstage.

She doesn\u2019t demand attention, she just attracts it, in part through her ability to embody multiple qualities at the same time. An action as simple as walking becomes riveting through the illusion of a floating torso supported by weighted, wooden legs. Details as fine as a corner of the mouth, isolated and upturned while the opposite corner rests, spring into view. Often she appears animated, spookily, by forces outside of herself.\n\nLike other dancer-choreographers with distinctive ways of moving, Ms. Nishimura faces the challenge of translating that style onto fellow performers. In \u201cBladder Inn\u201d (what to make of the title?), no one quite matches her strange interiority and specificity. But rather than fighting that difference, she folds it into the format of the work. The piece takes shape as a suite of concurrent solos, each dancer roaming around on his or her own phantomlike terms: crawling backward through open doors, grazing bare walls, staggering out from hallways and stairwells we can\u2019t see.\n\nThe house lights, for the most part, stay up. Distant murmurs and slamming doors mingle with the clacking and oceanic undulations in Masahiro Sugaya\u2019s unobtrusive score.

Lauren (Aya Cash, a star of \u201cYou\u2019re the Worst\u201d on FXX) is more polished but finds Sydney\u2019s ethical intransigence just as mystifying. If the congresswoman would just go along with that carried interest loophole for private equity fund managers, she could reap millions in donations from that sector alone. So what if it\u2019s hypocritical?\n\nAlas, Sydney is no hypocrite. She is willing to humiliate herself, as the party requires, by dunning donors while on enforced fund-raising retreats in Vail, but she won\u2019t let anyone buy her. \u201cI will take their money,\u201d she tells voters. \u201cI will not do as they say.\u201d\n\nThis paints Sydney, and \u201cKings,\u201d into a self-righteous corner. When McDowell (a wily Zach Grenier) threatens to close off the spigots of cash that Sydney needs for re-election, she makes the only choice she (or the play) has left: to mount an even unlikelier campaign than the one that got her to Washington in the first place.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhenever it focuses on Sydney\u2019s dash through the minefields of democracy, \u201cKings\u201d is entertaining and informative, if not surprising theatrically. Its high point, two-thirds of the way through, is a town-hall-style debate in which she declaims, in perfectly formed phrases, the kinds of things many of us have been rehearsing for months in front of our televisions and on Twitter feeds. The greed of special interests, the mendacity of politicians, the cockroach endurance of lobbyists: If these are familiar, they are also endlessly compelling.\n\nBut with no items on the agenda beyond transparency, the bridge between politics and policy is down. Nothing Ms. Burgess gives Sydney to say connects meaningfully to the daily lives of people outside the Beltway.\n\n\u201cKings,\u201d you eventually realize, is not really about Sydney, anyway; her story \u2014 the only one you care about \u2014 basically dribbles away after the debate. Her entire existence within the play seems designed as a placard to announce one thing: When politics neutralizes the ethically excellent it leaves the field open to everyone else.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She sweeps in and out to stock up on provisions, breezing past locals with rude manners and wagging tongues.\n\nThe twins have an unfortunate history to go with their exceedingly troublesome tenants, who scuttle into a movie that takes entirely too long to spill its dark secrets. Working from David Turpin\u2019s script, the director Brian O\u2019Malley drapes the house in cobwebs and pours on the dust (the look is Miss Havisham without the cake), and sets the camera loose while he tries to rustle up the scares.

Ms. De Vita, in the smaller male role of Tancredi, proved yet more remarkable, with incisive diction: Her vocalism burns like a dark flame.

In its Carnegie debut, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra and its music director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, played two of his lesser-known orchestral pieces \u2014 \u201cDays and Nights in Rocinha\u201d (1997) and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000) \u2014 on a program that also included Silvestre Revueltas\u2019s \u201cLa Noche de los Mayas.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to squint to identify the connecting thread here. The incandescent Revueltas suite, derived from one of his film scores, is a touchstone of the Mexican repertoire; pairing it with Mr. Glass\u2019s tribute to Rocinha, a Rio de Janeiro favela, gives the program a vaguely Latin American theme. The Concerto Fantasy doesn\u2019t share that theme, even vaguely. But it does spotlight percussionists, which puts it in a stylistic neighborhood adjacent to some of Revueltas\u2019s higher-octane passages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s neat enough on paper. But the problem is that these two Glass pieces aren\u2019t close to his most interesting.\n\nThe Concerto Fantasy\u2019s beginning, with its uncanny similarity to the stomping opening of the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme, is, at best, distracting. (Mr. Glass has denied plagiarizing, saying that he doesn\u2019t watch television.) More disappointing is how nothing else in the work manages to be as melodically memorable. During the Louisiana Philharmonic\u2019s performance, the strings were frequently swamped by the timpanists (Jim Atwood and Paul Yancich, stationed at the front of Carnegie\u2019s stage).", "title": "Review: Philip Glass Is Celebrated, but Not With His Best", "authors": ["Seth Colter Walls"]}
{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Jaap van Zweden, the music director designate of the New York Philharmonic, built up good will with the orchestra\u2019s extended audience on Tuesday evening when he announced the details of his first season, which begins in September. He enthusiastically discussed his plans and programming, including five premieres he will conduct, the introduction of two new-music series tied to themes the season will explore, and much more. It was an auspicious occasion for the Philharmonic.\n\nLess auspicious was Mr. van Zweden\u2019s conducting on Wednesday night at David Geffen Hall. The concert, a program pairing the New York premiere of a short, recent work by John Luther Adams with a concert performance of Act I from Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d was an opportunity to find out more about what he might bring to the Philharmonic, and to New York audiences. If anything, Mr. van Zweden can be too feisty and forceful in his performances of the standard repertory. So I was surprised that his account of this 70-minute Wagner act often lacked tension and urgency.\n\nThe performance started strongly. In the dark, pulsing orchestra music of the opening scene, Wagner simultaneously depicts the stormy weather that pummels a wounded young Siegmund as he is pursued through a dense forest, and the internal despair that never leaves him. Mr. van Zweden conducted this music with lean textures and crisp attacks.\n\nBut once Siegmund (here the veteran tenor Simon O\u2019Neill), seeking shelter in a hut, chances upon the fearful young Sieglinde (the radiant soprano Heidi Melton), Wagner\u2019s music turns mysterious and quietly suspenseful. The isolated Siegmund and beaten-down Sieglinde, who is trapped in a marriage to the bullying Hunding, look at each other longingly. In fact, they are twins, separated since their early childhood. And during these passages Mr. van Zweden\u2019s performance often went slack.", "title": "Review: Restrained Wagner at the New York Philharmonic", "authors": []}

Opened in 1835, the building spent a few years as a private residence, and also had a short stint as a brothel around the end of the 19th century. But for most of its history it has been one of the central business district\u2019s most popular pubs.\n\nThe last renovation happened a decade ago, leaving the interior with wood-paneled walls covered in various memorabilia: old photos, vintage advertisements, license plates, taxidermied animals (a kookaburra, a raven, a ringtail possum). In the winter, bartenders pull double duty slinging drinks and stoking the leaping flames in the huge brick fireplace.\n\nAlistair Derham, the owner, has been proactive in balancing tradition with the needs of a modern urban clientele. There are no televisions, but there are USB outlets under the bar to charge your phone. There are cheap beers, and there are craft beers. The back bar holds some truly exciting local whiskeys and gins. And in terms of food, the pub classics are all available, done very well with little to no gourmet pretensions.\n\nYou can also order a tasting menu. Part of that menu will be cooked at your table by a waiter brandishing a blowtorch. A large portion of the New Sydney\u2019s food offerings can be credited to the creative impulses of the chef, Klee Clemens. Mr. Clemens was born and raised in Tasmania, but he spent time in the kitchens of Melbourne, most notably that of Vue De Monde, one of the country\u2019s most established fine-dining restaurants. Mr. Clemens has been at the New Sydney for a decade now, and his kitchen manages to achieve remarkably varied aims.\n\nHere is a chicken Parma, the classic Australian pub meal that puts a breaded, fried chicken cutlet under a slice of ham, a layer of red sauce and melted cheese, and over a pile of fries. The sauce is house-made, with a hint of smokiness; the cheese is blistered perfectly. There\u2019s no tinkering with the form, no cleverness. It is just a very good Parma.", "title": "Review: The New Sydney Hotel in Hobart, Tasmania", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nImages become cinema in \u201c24 Frames,\u201d the last movie from the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami (1940-2016). \u201cI always wonder to what extent the artist aims to depict the reality of a scene,\u201d he reveals in the opening text. \u201cPainters capture only one frame of reality and nothing before or after it.\u201d This wondering led him to digitally transform 24 still images into short, visually and thematically linked sequences that make up this alternately charming and frustrating labor of love, which he worked on during the final three years of his life. (It was completed under the supervision of one of his sons.)\n\nIt opens on the painting \u201cHunters in the Snow,\u201d one in a series of seasonal landscapes by Pieter Bruegel the Elder dating from 1565. On the left side of the canvas, a group of men and dogs can be seen walking near people clustered close to a fire and a line of buildings; the right side of the painting shows a smattering of structures in the near distance and, beyond these, still more distant people skating and milling about on lakes of dark ice. Over the next few minutes, the painting begins to stir as smoke streams from a chimney, snow falls, a dog urinates against a tree and crows caw and fly.\n\nThe addition of these modest sounds and movements is intriguing but adds no insight and certainly no beauty to the Bruegel, which needs no such interventions. The rest of \u201c24 Frames\u201d is more appealing. It consists of 23 segments that turn Kiarostami\u2019s own photographs, many in starkly beautiful black and white, into animations of about four and a half minutes. Filled with desolate vistas, a feathered and furred menagerie, and multiple aperture-like windows, these fragments quickly establish a moody tone and over time become dolorous refrains. Each section is divided by fades to black and individual titles (Frame 2, Frame 15) that create a kind of countdown effect.\n\nA fine-art photographer as well as a filmmaker, Kiarostami could set your heart to leaping with cinematic landscapes that sometimes linger longer than his stories: a rough, dusty hill delineated by a zigzagging path in \u201cWhere Is My Friend\u2019s House?\u201d; two travelers motoring through a swaying field in \u201cThe Wind Will Carry Us.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise then that the images in \u201c24 Frames\u201d are consistently pretty and at times striking, harmoniously composed and filled with visual tension that make the shots vibrate even before something \u2014 birds, horses, an unfortunate deer or an opportunistically placed cat \u2014 starts moving in them. Many of the views are organized around an obvious center point, a leafless tree or bush, for instance, roughly set in a brilliantly white wintry expanse.\n\nAt other times, Kiarostami flattens the picture, turning it into a stack of horizontal wedges. In one frame, a slab of darkly brooding sky seems to loom down on a skeletal railing that runs across the shot, cleaving it in half. Beyond the railing, water (ocean, sea or lake) surges and, with a bird, gives the image a frisson of drama. Repeatedly, a movement \u2014 a bird raising its head, a horse its hooves \u2014 turns an image into a tidy narrative fragment. Every so often (a watery panorama with a balustrade, tall poles and complaining gulls), the compositions seem to nod at Yasujiro Ozu, the Japanese filmmaker to whom Kiarostami dedicated \u201cFive\u201d (2003), another experimental work.\n\n\u201c24 Frames\u201d can\u2019t help but be affecting because it is Kiarostami\u2019s final movie. But it\u2019s intellectually uninvolving, and its technical limitations prove frustrating. In a few shots, snow or rain falls, for instance, on the same left-to-right diagonal, creating a distracting pattern that suggests the software wasn\u2019t altered for each photograph. This synthetic quality may be an intentional imitation of life; certainly it\u2019s obvious that Kiarostami was thinking a great deal about cinema. Intriguingly, while winter and all it implies loom large here, they are gently offset by a glimpse of the film \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives\u201d playing on a computer as the sounds of a deeply unexpected love song fill a lonely room.", "title": "Review: The Persistence of Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s Vision in \u201824 Frames\u2019", "authors": ["Manohla Dargis"]}

And their program at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening was decidedly eccentric, yet utterly winning. Mr. Trifonov conceived the event as part of his Carnegie Perspectives series this season, and the respect and affinity he showed toward Mr. Goerne were clearly mutual.\n\nTheir program somewhat typically placed romantic love and loss at its core, with Schumann\u2019s great song cycle \u201cDichterliebe\u201d (\u201cA Poet\u2019s Love\u201d); then it took a wide turn to Christian charity as its endpoint, in Brahms\u2019s late, biblical \u201cFour Serious Songs.\u201d Otherwise it worked the fringes of the repertory with a subtext of death, in Berg\u2019s early Four Songs (Op. 2); three songs to poems of Michelangelo by Wolf; and three more by Shostakovich.\n\nBut it was the manner of presentation that really set this intermissionless evening apart. By going immediately from one song to the next \u2014 and from one composer to the next \u2014 Mr. Goerne and Mr. Trifonov created an overall intensity that proved captivating. Though you would have thought the game had become obvious after the four songs by Berg and the 16 by Schumann, a sprinkling of listeners started to applaud after \u201cDichterliebe,\u201d only to be squelched by an arresting gesture from Mr. Goerne and an immediate leap into the Wolf by Mr. Trifonov.\n\nStill more striking, this unified fabric created new contexts for the various sets, placing each in a different light and revealing subtexts usually hidden. \u201cDichterliebe,\u201d in fact, perhaps should have come with a spoiler alert.

For how do you represent invisible weapons? How do you tell of battles where combatants never face each other and death comes out of nowhere in seconds? Movies such as \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d and \u201cGood Kill\u201d have looked at the price exacted by drones on those who remote-control them, an approach also adopted by the 2015 solo play \u201cGrounded,\u201d in which Anne Hathaway portrayed a pilot now dropping hellfire while sitting thousands of miles away from her targets.\n\nSylvia Khoury\u2019s earnest new drama, \u201cAgainst the Hillside,\u201d looks at the effect of drones both on those who guide them and those who endure them. The show toggles between Pakistan, where the married Sayid (Babak Tafti) and Reem (Mahira Kakkar, \u201cWhen January Feels Like Summer\u201d) are constantly \u201clistening to the sky,\u201d and America, where one Capt. Matt Walker (Jack Mikesell) is doing the watching. Both parties live in anxiety, though of course the stakes are quite different \u2014 it\u2019s in Pakistan that a corpse\u2019s limbs, torn by a sudden strike, have to be recovered for a proper burial.\n\nMatt, a pilot who took the drone job when he and his wife, Erin (Caroline Hewitt), decided to start a family, is becoming way too \u201cinvested,\u201d as he puts it, in the Pakistani couple\u2019s life. He is particularly fascinated by Reem, and feels as if he knows her. That\u2019s a mistake, of course. First, he doesn\u2019t have access to her inner life, and second, there\u2019s a reason farmers don\u2019t name the animals they\u2019re raising for slaughter \u2014 being invested in your victims is a bad idea.\n\nThis setup is an intriguing one, and we should be grateful a young playwright has at least chosen to engage with it. But \u201cAgainst the Hillside,\u201d which just opened at Ensemble Studio Theater under William Carden\u2019s direction, does not live up to its potential. It is somehow too descriptive and too elusive, at once over-explaining and vague.\n\nInitially, Ms. Khoury seems most interested in Reem, who pleads with her husband to move to a big city, where the anonymity of crowds will protect them from those unseen threats. He won\u2019t budge, so one night she takes their baby and leaves. On the other side of the world, Matt unravels. Plot strands wither on the vine: Why this obsession with Reem? Why does Sayid abandon his store and start teaching math after Reem\u2019s departure?\n\nPhoto\n\nTime moves on. Major characters drop out of the story, never to come back; uninteresting peripheral ones are gifted unnecessary scenes.\n\nAnd then the unexpected happens: Ms. Khoury pulls a nifty epilogue out of her hat.\n\nTime has moved on again, and we are now seeing the long-term aftermath of drone warfare. The narrative and stylistic jump is jarring, yes, but somehow it works \u2014 we are left wanting more \u2014 and makes for a satisfying coda to a frustrating show.", "title": "Review: \u2018Against the Hillside\u2019 Is an Eye on Drone Warfare", "authors": ["Elisabeth Vincentelli"]}

The first move cost his family its land and money, the second its status as part of the majority culture. During the decades of dead-end manual labor in London, Akeel often vented his accumulated frustration on Malika (Rita Wolf) and she in turn vented hers on their daughter, Javeria (Angel Desai).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Each path looks suspicious to those who favor the other. Azeem lurches back and forth, letting his frustrations at work infect his family life and vice versa. He ends up alienating white colleagues like his pal David (Andrew Hovelson) by telling them that their professed liberality is in fact more treacherous than bigotry.\n\nThis is already a great deal for one play to shoulder, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned the thread of the plot that considers the pressures on Azeem that come from within the Muslim community. (No single way of practicing his faith will please everyone.) As those pressures start to drag him down, his behavior becomes even more erratic \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019ve gone from no Islam to Nation of Islam in five seconds,\u201d Saima says \u2014 and the play\u2019s point of view blurs. By the time it tries to connect Azeem\u2019s personal crisis to the rise of Muslim extremist violence in the West, it has lost its ability to sustain an argument.\n\nThe high-thread-count plot, the theme of moral confusion and the politico-economic framework that looms over the family drama are all hallmarks of the work of Tony Kushner, who mentored Mr. Chaudry as he worked on \u201cAn Ordinary Muslim.\u201d And New York Theater Workshop, which produced Mr. Kushner\u2019s \u201cHomebody/Kabul\u201d in 2001, has put its considerable expertise \u2014 and the strong director Jo Bonney \u2014 at the production\u2019s disposal. Few first-time playwrights receive such support.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cAn Ordinary Muslim\u201d is an important work still struggling to emerge from a text filled with freshman problems. The argumentative plot (Mr. Chaudry was studying to be a lawyer when the theater bug bit him) makes sense only for short stretches, after each of which the character logic seems to reset. Because the key conflicts are mostly described by unreliable narrators instead of enacted directly for us, they feel imposed or even doubtful. So even though everything about the play\u2019s take on assimilation and racism is convincing in the abstract, nothing about the people experiencing it is.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat isn\u2019t the cast\u2019s fault. No one could steer smoothly through all of Azeem\u2019s hairpin turns, but Mr. De Silva is charismatic while trying. All of the others (including Sathya Sridharan and Harsh Nayyar as representatives of the local Muslim community) have strong moments too, and Ms. Wolf, as a mother who is somehow both amusing and terrifying, has nothing but.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe production doesn\u2019t help those strong moments hang together. Visually it seems to be caught between genres, unable to settle on domestic realism or Kushnerian poetics. (The set is by Neil Patel.) Ms. Bonney, who has staged thrilling productions of several recent plays by Suzan-Lori Parks, can do little but help this one move swiftly, though it seems to me it should have been shorter or longer than its two and a half hours.\n\nPlays are mysterious machines; even veteran playwrights find them hard to operate. The most promising thing about \u201cAn Ordinary Muslim\u201d is the way its best moments seem to creep delicately out from under the rock of the author\u2019s determination to make heavier points.\n\nIn my favorite of these, Akeel, just when he seems ready to apologize to Malika for his lifetime of failures as a husband and father, suddenly switches from English to Urdu. Here Mr. Chaudry is using an inherently theatrical gesture to force an understanding, among the non-Urdu speakers in the audience anyway, that not everything true is universally comprehensible.

Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only to hit the same exhausted story and franchise-expanding beats. Not this one. Its axis point is the fantastical nation of Wakanda, an African Eden where verdant-green landscapes meet blue-sky science fiction. There, spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls, touching down in a story that has far more going for it than branding.\n\nWakanda is home to Black Panther, a.k.a. T\u2019Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the latest Marvel hero to leap off the comic-book page and into his own movie. Created in 1966 by Stan Lee (script) and Jack Kirby (art), the original Black Panther \u2014 a hepcat in a slinky suit with claws and ears \u2014 debuted alongside the Fantastic Four in an adventure in Wakanda, which is powered by a mystery metal, vibranium.

Though his inquiry is intensely, at times painfully personal, Mr. Wilkerson is above all concerned with unpacking the mechanisms of racial domination. The procedure is akin to performing surgery on a half-conscious subject, or digging up a buried land mine that has lost little of its explosive power.\n\nVideo\n\nThe focus of his excavation is a killing that took place in Dothan, Ala., in 1946, when S.E. Branch, a white shopkeeper, shot Bill Spann, a black man who was in his store. Branch, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s great-grandfather, was charged with first-degree murder, but no trial was ever held, and the crime faded from memory. Or rather, the memory of it was quietly and systematically suppressed. All that remains are a short newspaper article and a few photographs and home movies of the killer.\n\n\u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d proceeds on several parallel tracks. Mr. Wilkerson returns to Alabama and tries to discover both how Bill Spann died and how he was forgotten. His investigation, accompanied by haunting images of Southern back roads and quiet houses, is punctuated by reminders that Bill Spann\u2019s death is hardly a unique or anomalous event. The names of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and other recent victims of racist violence appear onscreen, and two songs of protest loop into the soundtrack: Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d and Phil Ochs\u2019s \u201cWilliam Moore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat song, about a white postal worker and civil rights activist murdered on an Alabama highway in 1963, is the source of the film\u2019s title and a part of its wider cultural context. \u201cDid You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u201d is a passionately political film, aflame with rage in spite of its director\u2019s measured, ruminative tone of voice. It is also a horror movie, full of specters and silences and a terror that is pervasive, intimate and elusive.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wilkerson, whose previous films include \u201cAn Injury to One\u201d and \u201cFar From Afghanistan,\u201d dispenses with many of the usual techniques of historical documentary. There are a few on-camera interviews, with neighbors and relatives, but more frequently Mr. Wilkerson narrates encounters that took place off camera. And his sleuthing often leads not to moments of revelation but to dead ends and deeper mysteries. The insertion of clips from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d provides a chilling and ironic counterpoint to the grim story this movie is telling. S.E. Branch is the opposite of Gregory Peck\u2019s brave and decent Atticus Finch, and the truth about what happened to Bill Spann resists the kind of redemptive, healing conclusion that remains a cornerstone of American racial fantasy.\n\nInstead of consolation, Mr. Wilkerson offers commitment. Instead of idealism, honesty. He doesn\u2019t suppose that his film will solve anything, but there is nonetheless something profoundly useful about the way he confronts past and present manifestations of white supremacy. He links his great-grandfather\u2019s crime to the contemporaneous gang rape of Recy Taylor (the subject of an excellent recent documentary by Nancy Buirski), and uncovers patterns of abuse within his family. He corresponds with a relative who is part of a white nationalist, \u201cSouthern secessionist\u201d group. He notes the way racial injustice dwells in apparently mundane facts. The killer is immortalized in pictures and a well-kept tombstone. His victim has been almost entirely erased from memory, a kind of second death beyond the reach of redress or revenge.", "title": "Review: \u2018Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?\u2019 Reckons With White Supremacy", "authors": ["A.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nIn the opening scene of \u201cDouble Lover,\u201d its protagonist, Chlo\u00e9 (Marine Vacth), is seen getting her hair cut. Her wet hair, pale face and the gray background impart a simple elegance to the sequence. The following scene takes place in the bleaker confines of a gynecologist\u2019s office. In one shot, the screen fills with the colors pink and silver. Viewers may wonder exactly what they are seeing at first, but as the camera zooms out it becomes clear: a speculum seen from the point of view of a doctor conducting a vaginal examination. The shot dissolves into a geometrically corresponding close-up of Chlo\u00e9\u2019s eye.\n\nThe straightforward explicitness of the imagery is a hallmark of Fran\u00e7ois Ozon, the film\u2019s director (his best known films include the thrillers \u201cSee the Sea\u201d and \u201cSwimming Pool\u201d); the juxtaposition is very Georges Bataille (he wrote a piece of outr\u00e9 eroticism titled \u201cStory of the Eye\u201d). Some might say it\u2019s all very French, and perhaps it is. But it does make one sit up and take notice. The clever thing about it is that it\u2019s not until the movie is almost over that the viewer can fully understand this imagery as something more than an effective, but perhaps idle provocation.\n\nVideo\n\nChlo\u00e9, looking underweight, has complained about chronic stomach pains to her gynecologist. And on that doctor\u2019s advice, she starts seeing a psychoanalyst, Paul (J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Renier). He\u2019s handsome, gentle, compassionate. He \u201ccures\u201d her, they confess romantic feelings for each other, and they move in together. One small glitch is that he does not much care for her cat Milo. A bigger glitch comes soon after that: Chlo\u00e9 meets another psychoanalyst, Paul\u2019s double, who claims to be his twin brother. He\u2019s a rougher character who likes his own cat, a specimen of a rare breed. He thinks he can cure Chlo\u00e9 of a new complaint, and there\u2019s lots of athletic sex involved in the treatment.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on here? The doubling imagery, the recurring spiral staircases, and so much else engulfing Chlo\u00e9 make this thriller unusually engrossing. \u201cDouble Lover\u201d nods a bit to David Cronenberg\u2019s \u201cDead Ringers\u201d (1988) and Roman Polanski\u2019s \u201cThe Tenant\u201d (1976), two arguably classic thrillers on doppelg\u00e4ngers and madness, and Mr. Ozon\u2019s stylistic gymnastics sometimes bring to mind Brian De Palma, who made a film about good/bad twins early in his career. But \u201cDouble Lover,\u201d which Mr. Ozon \u201cfreely adapted\u201d from the Joyce Carol Oates book \u201cLives of the Twins,\u201d spins its influences into a frenzy that ultimately reveals the story to be very much its own thing. And a crazy, and eventually strangely moving, thing it is. As elaborate as its visuals are, the movie is also intimate. There aren\u2019t many characters besides Chlo\u00e9 and the twins, which adds to the frisson late in the movie when the great Jacqueline Bisset makes her entrance.\n\nMr. Renier is clearly having a blast as the twins, but Ms. Vacth, who worked with Mr. Ozon on the 2014 film \u201cYoung and Beautiful,\u201d does more than hold her own opposite him. She modulates Chlo\u00e9\u2019s mood from slumping vulnerability to hip-swinging confidence, from a whirlpool of self-doubt and near despair to defiance. \u201cDouble Lover\u201d is as much, if not more, Ms. Vacth\u2019s movie as it is the director\u2019s.", "title": "Review: \u2018Double Lover\u2019 Is a Knotty Delight of a Thriller", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny", "Fran\u00e7ois Ozon"]}

I\u2019m a little sorry that this utterly silly feature from Nick Park and Aardman Animations was not around when I was 7 or 8 years old, or when my children were wearing out the Wallace and Gromit videocassettes that someone had given them for Christmas. Not that anyone could outgrow this kind of movie, which manages to be fresh and delightful even as some of its jokes are so old \u2014 how old? So old that the last time I heard them, I fell off my dinosaur I was laughing so hard.\n\nAbout that: In prehistoric times, according to Mr. Park and the screenwriters (Mark Burton and James Higginson), cave men and giant lizards shared the planet for a while. A bit later, descendants of those same cave-dwellers \u2014 a band of genial, not-too-bright hunter-gatherers in a verdant valley near what is now Manchester, England \u2014 coexisted uneasily with a more aggressive and arrogant breed of humans, who mastered metallurgy, stadium-building and sports commentary. \u201cThe age of stone is over. The age of bronze is here,\u201d they proclaim as they drive the Stone Agers into the wasteland.\n\nIt would be pedantic in the extreme to fault this movie for its inaccurate rendering of the past. Did mammoths\u2019 feet in ancient times walk upon England\u2019s green and pleasant land? Does the fossil record contain evidence of a mallard the size of a 727? You might as well ask if there are La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland. As Bugs Bunny will tell you, there are no La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland.\n\nVideo\n\nBut I would not go so far as to say that \u201cEarly Man\u201d is entirely devoid of historical interest. Its structuring myth is the loss of Arcadia. A peaceful and authentic way of life is threatened with destruction by the forces of modernity, and the threat is resisted in a stirring and potentially tragic show of courage. The encounter between the simple, primitive folk and their more sophisticated would-be conquerors may remind you of the films of Mel Gibson.

Or, to put the argument in \u201cEarly Man\u201d terms, we were happier when we were chasing rabbits instead of building monuments, fighting wars and paying taxes.

But instead of offering a short burst of terror followed by the prospect of a quick escape, this immersive, sensorially complex movie evokes the terrifying disorientation and loneliness of migration: the eerie sounds of sand crunching underfoot; the surreal sights of jugs of water left by well-wishers; fragments of voices heard over radio transmissions.\n\nTold in three movements, the second being the longest and least cryptic, the film is the work of J.P. Sniadecki (a veteran of Harvard\u2019s Sensory Ethnography Lab) and Joshua Bonnetta, who are as concerned with the possibilities of the film medium as they are with this particular subject. The human presence is largely limited to voice-over testimonies. A resident talks about taking in a shivering young man. We hear of migrants\u2019 experiences with getting lost.

But it also speaks to antihero dramas\u2019 long history of giving men \u2014 generally only men \u2014 license to be bad.\n\nFor Walter White and his many TV cousins, crime has often been about self-worth, even virility. (Tony Soprano\u2019s big boat is named \u201cThe Stugots,\u201d after an Italian male-anatomical slang term.)\n\nFor Beth, Annie and Ruby, the money is more about self-determination: freedom from reliance on lousy men or the whims of the economy. When Ruby, flush with cash, sees an expensive doctor who offers her cucumber water, she cries a little bit at the upgrade in attention that money can buy.\n\nThe series, created by Jenna Bans, is tartly funny, less heavy than its cable kin and more concerned with righteous payback than ethical angst.\n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely light, either.

To deliver on the ironies of that \u201cGood\u201d in the title, there needs to be moral conflict \u2014 the possibility that these protagonists, however much we like them, might make a wrong choice that will get somebody hurt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut because \u201cGood Girls\u201d has an offbeat tone \u2014 and airs on a broadcast network \u2014 you get the feeling that the guardrails are up.

It tells of a cheerful, underemployed scholar, Ho Yunqing (Shih Chun), who makes a meager living as a copyist. Soon after the movie opens, he is entrusted to copy a Buddhist sutra (a dialogue or sermon) that can liberate souls stuck in limbo. Ho isn\u2019t a believer, but he needs the money and so enthusiastically heads out on a seemingly simple mission, one that eventually leads to an isolated outpost where curious and curiouser things occur.\n\nFilled with lovely natural landscapes that have been meticulously framed and photographed, \u201cLegend of the Mountain\u201d is often a visual ravishment.

And while King Hu certainly likes to move the camera \u2014 it sweeps, swoops and sometime breaks into a near-run \u2014 he also likes to linger on images as if encouraging you to admire their compositional harmony. You can get lost in these pictorial reveries as you trace the rays of light piercing the trees, brightening the dark waters and the reality-softening haze.\n\nDespite being warned away by a stranger, Ho at last makes it to the outpost, where a story of sorts emerges, along with allies and other figures who prove more sinister.

There are digressions and some wonderful visual fillips \u2014 beautifully curved trees and noble stone statues lined up like soldiers.

He is a charming guy, to be sure, but also smug and self-pitying. Whether or not he entirely deserves what he eventually gets, his complacency and passivity set him up for a fall.\n\nBut \u201cSubmission\u201d isn\u2019t just his story. Angela is in many ways more interesting, even though, at the end, her motives are flattened in the interest of a narrative payoff. Ted is taken with her writing, and also with her na\u00efve, admiring eagerness for his approval. She writes about sex with older men, in her novel and in an earlier book of poems, in a way that seems calculated to trigger inappropriate fantasies in the mind of a creatively frustrated, self-consciously aging teacher marooned in academia.\n\nTed is an easy mark, and hardly an unwilling participant in his own ruin. He is less pathetic than the professor played by Emil Jannings in Josef von Sternberg\u2019s \u201cThe Blue Angel\u201d (which serves as both a model for \u201cSubmission\u201d and point of reference within it), and Angela is hardly a siren in the mold of Marlene Dietrich\u2019s cabaret singer. But Angela does turn out to be amoral, manipulative and dishonest, traits that make her both a caricature of feminine guile and a promising fiction writer \u2014 perhaps more fully committed to the art than her vain, bumbling teacher.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Levine, directing his second feature after working mainly in television (on \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d and \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d among other series), is a lesser artist than Ms. Prose. \u201cSubmission\u201d feels more like an act of devotion, or perhaps of submission, than a free-standing adaptation.

The detour also allows him to delay the return trip down the mountain of plot he has spent the first half of the play climbing. What Mr. Harrison, the character, says he is avoiding is the very object of that trek: the play\u2019s catharsis, which he doubts he can earn. In a world of endless suffering, a catharsis is \u201cinnately complacent,\u201d he concludes.\n\nLike the rest of \u201cThe Amateurs,\u201d this despairing contemporary interlude is frantically funny, even when it veers into an art history lecture. Playing Mr. Harrison, Michael Cyril Creighton, who in the medieval scenes is handy Gregory, paints a witty, affectionate portrait of a neurotic playwright afraid of his own tools. It can\u2019t be a realistic portrait; Mr. Harrison could hardly wield those tools so expertly if his hands were shaking. As in his 2015 play \u201cMarjorie Prime\u201d \u2014 a superbly controlled exercise in speculative fiction that elicits profound feeling without appearing to solicit it \u2014 \u201cThe Amateurs\u201d works by a kind of indirection. The magic happens, by design, wherever the playwright isn\u2019t pointing.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo the postmodern gewgaws are a bit of a decoy. They might work even better if there were fewer of them, as Mr. Harrison seems to know. (\u201cHopefully you aren\u2019t allergic to these sorts of shenanigans,\u201d his stand-in says.) When Ms. Bernstine interrupts his interruption with her own take on Hollis\u2019s story, you begin to wonder whether the material has gone a bit too deep into the theatrical weeds, too far for civilians to follow. But just as she did in Anne Washburn\u2019s heady backstager \u201c10 out of 12,\u201d Ms. Bernstine, so legible and relatable and seemingly guileless, grounds even the most meta material with quiet feeling.\n\nStill, I kept thinking that a fully cooked play shouldn\u2019t need so much exegesis and counterpoint. It didn\u2019t seem likely that Mr. Harrison\u2019s self-parodying seminar, however amusing, could deepen the play\u2019s action when it returned to medieval Italy. Eventually, though, I understood that deepening wasn\u2019t the point; distancing was. \u201cThe Amateurs\u201d wants to be seen with a form of double vision in which the past and the present are both present. We are meant to be vigilant about the \u201cluxury of fiction,\u201d with its false sense of endings.\n\nWhich is why these medieval actors all have names you might expect to find on a teen soap opera. At every turn, Oliver Butler\u2019s gutsy production supports rather than tries to disguise such anachronisms. The singsong verse of the morality plays is countered by ribald cross talk delivered with naturalistic verve. And whenever the troupe\u2019s pageant wagon \u2014 a cabinet of curiosities filled with handmade surprises \u2014 sits in the middle of the Vineyard\u2019s modern stage (both designed by David Zinn) you see in one image the continuity of human creativity in the face of disaster.\n\nThe cast, which also includes Greg Keller as a newcomer to the troupe, is a cabinet of curiosities in itself, a collection of Off Broadway treasures. Of course, all actors love to re-enact theatrical disaster stories, and Mr. Harrison loads \u201cThe Amateurs\u201d with plenty of gags. But Ms. Bernstine and the others are seriously funny, by which I mean funny in a serious way: a good thing in a play that has so much on its mind. Among the themes that light up like fireflies here and there are the nature of sin, the purpose of art, the low status of actors and the low status of humans in general. If history has been a drama, it has consigned almost everyone throughout time to the chorus.\n\nAnd so it really is a thrilling, expansive, world-changing moment in a very sneaky play when Hollis, contemplating Mrs. Noah, first asks, What\u2019s my motivation? Which is a question you can only begin to contemplate after asking, What is God\u2019s?\n\nThe Amateurs NYT Critic\u2019s Pick Vineyard Theater 108 E. 15th St. Flatiron/U.

Other inventions are more problematic. A hookup between an F.B.I. agent and an American diplomat (both fictitious) is thrown in just to squeeze some tears. And a heroic act that in real life was performed by a dying Kenyan, during the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, is shifted to a dying American.\n\nCutting out 50 years of the story and most of the cast of characters (the book begins in the 1940s with the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb; the show skips decades of Arab history and opens in 1998) allows more time for fiction-friendly details. In the book, Mr. Wright gives a few pages to the Mr. O\u2019Neill\u2019s byzantine romantic life, as a counterpoint to Islamist attitudes toward women and sex. This gets a fuller, but (so far) less relevant treatment on screen.\n\n\u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d is not alone in favoring a detective story over ideas and import. \u201cManhunt: Unabomber,\u201d \u201cUnsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.\u201d and \u201cWaco,\u201d to cite current or recent examples, all do it to some degree. (Though Paramount Network\u2019s \u201cWaco\u201d has gained depth in its later episodes, with the Branch Davidians captive inside their compound.)\n\n\u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d does benefit from good performances, including those of Mr. Rahim, Peter Sarsgaard as a querulous C.I.A. agent (seemingly based on the real-life Michael Scheuer) and Bill Camp as an F.B.I. gumshoe (a composite of New York-based agents). Mr. Daniels is fun to watch, but his Midwestern affability and natural courtliness don\u2019t match up at all with the book\u2019s description of O\u2019Neill. (He\u2019s also 15-plus years older than O\u2019Neill was at the time.)\n\nIn 2018, \u201cThe Looming Tower\u201d sits in an odd place. So much has happened since the events it depicts that it feels like ancient history. But so much has happened \u2014 and continues to happen \u2014 precisely because of the events it depicts, that the book now feels unequal to its task.

At my first live encounter with this 2012 work at the Academy of Music here on Friday, for the premiere of a new staging by Opera Philadelphia that runs through Feb. 18, I was struck by how reserved George Benjamin\u2019s score is.\n\nNot that there aren\u2019t passages of loud density or idiosyncratic instrumentation \u2014 a typewriter, pebbles, sets of small tablas and glass harmonica augment the traditional orchestra \u2014 but on the whole the music gives the sense of being artfully curbed.

The set, designed by Tom Rogers, is a giant gray box that rotates on a turntable and reveals, as doors open and walls push aside, a labyrinth of shifting spaces: raw wood incompletely painted a radiant blue and studded with panels with the jewel tones of stained glass.\n\nThis is the home of a married couple in medieval times. The wife (referred to sometimes as the Woman, sometimes as Agn\u00e8s) is restive; the husband (the Protector), controlling. Commenting on and guiding the action from our own moment, and dressed in this staging in futuristic, Sprockets-style black, is a trio of angels, vaguely sinister in its affectlessness. One of them doubles as the Boy, who enters the household under commission to depict the Protector\u2019s dominion in images and letters.\n\nPhoto\n\nRepresenting the world in art is portrayed by Mr. Benjamin and the librettist, the playwright Martin Crimp, as a complex, empowering, exposing, explosive, inevitably destructive enterprise. (Their next opera, \u201cLessons in Love and Violence,\u201d has its premiere in London in May.) Her mind fired with new possibilities, Agn\u00e8s begins an affair with the Boy. When they\u2019re discovered \u2014 the Protector, of course, reads about it in the book \u2014 he is murdered and she, after a cannibalistic climax that suggests \u201cSalome\u201d and \u201cTitus Andronicus,\u201d kills herself.

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "European diplomats said there was scope for an agreement on missiles and inspections, but not yet on the length of the deal. They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again.\n\nThe upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department\u2019s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump\u2019s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord \u201cis under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.\u201d\n\nEven if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project \u2014 a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors \u2014 that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years.\n\nStill, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal.\n\nThe president\u2019s national security team \u2014 Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster \u2014 has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder.\n\nThere is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it?\n\n\u201cThe supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,\u201d said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBy law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But they could provide a pretext for Iran to resume uranium enrichment.\n\nThe Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as \u201cinseparable,\u201d and said that \u201cIran\u2019s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.\u201d The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet.\n\nInspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration\u2019s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway.\n\nOnce a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China\u2019s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran\u2019s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said.\n\nWhile American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short.\n\nReimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement.\n\nHe could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July.\n\nFor the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it. One diplomat compared it to humoring an angry relative who controlled a family vacation estate, and periodically threatened to burn it down.", "title": "Rewrite Iran Deal?

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Besides the agreement with Mr. Gates, the special counsel\u2019s team has already secured guilty pleas from two of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy aide during the campaign, have both pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and agreed to cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nMr. Gates\u2019s plea deal came together over the past few days, according to people familiar with the process. In a letter to friends and family, Mr. Gates said there had been false news stories about an impending plea deal over the past two weeks.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cDespite my initial desire to vigorously defend myself, I have had a change of heart. The reality of how long this legal process will likely take, the cost, and the circuslike atmosphere of an anticipated trial are too much. I will better serve my family moving forward by exiting this process.\u201d\n\n[Read our 2017 profile of Rick Gates \u00bb]\n\nTestimony from Mr. Gates could give Mr. Mueller\u2019s team a first-person account of the criminal conduct that is claimed in the indictments \u2014 a potential blow to Mr. Manafort\u2019s defense strategy. On Friday, Mr. Manafort pledged to continue the fight.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding that Rick Gates pleaded today, I continue to maintain my innocence,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI had hoped and expected my business colleague would have had the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence. For reasons yet to surface he chose to do otherwise. This does not alter my commitment to defend myself against the untrue piled up charges contained in the indictments against me.\u201d\n\nAfter Mr. Gates\u2019s plea hearing, prosecutors filed a new indictment against Mr. Manafort. That indictment did not allege new charges against him, but was done for procedural purposes as prosecutors pursue separate cases in Washington and Northern Virginia.\n\nThe court papers give few specifics about how Mr. Gates came to be charged with lying to the F.B.I. On Feb. 1, as he was negotiating with prosecutors about a possible deal, Mr. Gates misled investigators about a conversation he had with Mr. Manafort in March 2013, after Mr. Manafort had met with the congressman to discuss the situation in Ukraine. The documents do not name the lawmaker, but news accounts have identified him as Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, a Republican long known for his pro-Russia views.", "title": "Rick Gates, Trump Campaign Aide, Pleads Guilty in Mueller Inquiry and Will Cooperate", "authors": []}

But the interview went well, and she connected him to some of her famous friends. He used her connections and those of his own friends in show business as entree to an ever-wider circle of celebrities.\n\nMr. McKay was persistent in his pursuit of different actors, and once he got them on camera he was a convivial, sympathetic interviewer.\n\nThe secret to getting stars to open up about their lives was easy, he said on the podcast: Do extensive research and \u201cmake it about them, constantly about them.\u201d\n\nJulie Harris, Stephen Sondheim, Ben Gazzara, Elaine Stritch, Carol Burnett, Diahann Carroll, Alec Baldwin and Shirley MacLaine were among the luminaries he interviewed.\n\n\u201cMost people will never work with a cast like this,\u201d Mr. McKay told The Los Angeles Times in 2004.\n\nIn \u201cBroadway,\u201d which Mr. McKay produced, directed and edited, Ms. MacLaine reminisced about making lemonade for herself out of free lemons, water and sugar at a Manhattan automat. Mr. Gazzara recalled skipping school for more than a month to see every play on Broadway. And Ms. Burnett remembered sharing an audition dress with three other aspiring actresses.\n\nMr. McKay also tracked down rare archival footage, including an audio recording of Marlon Brando in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d during the play\u2019s original Broadway run in the late 1940s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe documentary was shown at art-house cinemas and won more than a dozen awards at film festivals. Critics were mostly enthusiastic.\n\n\u201c \u2018Broadway: The Golden Age\u2019 is all chatter all the time, but that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Desson Thomson wrote in The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cThe chatterers, you see, are actors of a certain vintage,\u201d he continued. \u201cA Broadway vintage, that is. And the stories they tell in this warm, evocative documentary crackle with humor and glow with reverence.\u201d\n\nMr. McKay\u2019s brother said he was not sure when the two subsequent parts of the documentary would be released.\n\nRichard Charles McKay was born on Aug. 30, 1955, in a suburb of Boston. His mother, the former Alyce Monroe, was a homemaker and theater buff, and his father, James McKay, was an engineer.\n\nWhen Rick was still young the family moved to Beech Grove, Ind., near Indianapolis, where he was active in musical theater and graduated from high school. He taught at the Indiana School for the Deaf, moved to Boston in the early 1970s, then lived in Japan, where he was an English teacher and nightclub singer.\n\nAfter moving to New York, he kept singing in clubs and on cruises and later turned to broadcast and print journalism.\n\nAt his death Mr. McKay was also working on a documentary about the actress Fay Wray, a friend of his for years.\n\nIn addition to his brother, he is survived by four sisters, Stacie Stevenson and Sandy, Hope and Linda McKay.", "title": "Rick McKay, Who Documented Memories of Broadway, Dies at 62", "authors": ["Daniel E.

{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "The meeting that nearly led to Mr. Sessions\u2019s resignation came last May shortly after the president fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was heading an investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any cooperation with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The dismissal of Mr. Comey, which Mr. Trump in an interview with NBC News linked to his unhappiness with the Russia investigation, triggered the appointment of a special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to the ire of the president.\n\nMr. Trump was furious with Mr. Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and therefore losing control over it. Mr. Priebus\u2019s account confirms and adds more detail to a New York Times report that the president berated Mr. Sessions in a meeting in the Oval Office, leading him to offer his resignation. Vice President Mike Pence and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, were in the meeting, but Mr. Priebus was not.\n\n\u201cDon McGahn came in my office pretty hot, red, out of breath and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got a problem,\u2019\u201d Mr. Priebus recalled. \u201cI responded, \u2018What?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, we just got a special counsel and Sessions just resigned.\u2019 I said, \u2018What? What the hell are you talking about?\u2019 And I said, \u2018That can\u2019t happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Priebus bolted down the back stairway of the West Wing and out the door to the parking lot and found Mr. Sessions in the back of a black sedan with the engine running and about to leave. \u201cI knocked on the door of the car and Jeff was sitting there and I just jumped in and shut the door and I said, \u2018Jeff, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cAnd then he told me that he was going to resign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You cannot resign. It\u2019s not possible. We are going to talk about this right now,\u2019\u201d Mr. Priebus continued. \u201cSo I dragged him back up to my office from the car. Pence and Bannon came in,\u201d he added, referring to Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist, \u201cand we started talking to him to the point where he decided that he would not resign right then and he would instead think about it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn the end, Mr. Sessions still drafted a resignation letter later that night and sent it to the White House. Mr. Priebus then went to work on Mr. Trump, arguing that he should not accept it. The president reluctantly agreed and Mr. Sessions stayed.\n\nBut that did not end the danger to the attorney general. A couple months later, Mr. Trump took his anger with Mr. Sessions public by telling The New York Times in an interview that he would not have appointed him attorney general had he known that he would recuse himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBehind the scenes, Mr. Trump once again demanded Mr. Sessions\u2019s resignation. Citing a White House insider, Mr. Whipple\u2019s book says the president told Mr. Priebus to act on his order. \u201cDon\u2019t try to slow me down like you always do,\u201d Mr. Trump told him. \u201cGet the resignation of Jeff Sessions.\u201d\n\nMr. Priebus, however, did try to slow him down and argued that pushing out Mr. Sessions would result in the resignations of the second- and third-ranking Justice Department officials too. \u201cIf I get this resignation, you are in for a spiral of calamity that makes Comey look like a picnic,\u201d Mr. Priebus warned him. Again, Mr. Trump backed down.\n\nBut in other ways he did not. Mr. Priebus said he and other aides \u2014 including Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter; Jared Kushner, his son-in-law; and Hope Hicks, his communications director \u2014 regularly tried to convince Mr. Trump that his random, often incendiary Twitter messages were self-destructive.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Some of it\u2019s not helpful, it causes distraction. We can get thrown off our message by tweeting things that aren\u2019t the issues of the day,\u2019\u201d he said. But he did not get through. \u201cEverybody tried at different times to cool down the Twitter habit \u2014 but no one could do it. Not me, Jared, Ivanka, Hope.\u201d\n\nEven the first lady weighed in when her husband addressed Congress. \u201cAfter the joint session, we all talked to him and Melania said, \u2018No tweeting,\u2019\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018OK \u2014 for the next few days.\u2019 We had many discussions involving this issue. We had meetings in the residence. I couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d\n\nThe challenge was clear from the very start when Mr. Trump called him the morning after he was sworn in ranting about news coverage comparing the size of his inaugural crowd with that of his predecessor. Mr. Priebus tried to calm the new president, but ultimately had to go along. \u201cAm I going to go to war over this with the president of the United States?\u201d he asked himself.\n\nMr. Priebus\u2019s inability to control Mr. Trump or even control who could wander in and out of the Oval Office caused consternation. Mr. Bannon told Mr. Whipple that John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, complained to him about it. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018It really upsets me that I walk in the Oval Office and it\u2019s like Grand Central Station,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Bannon.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Trump would pick Mr. Kelly to replace Mr. Priebus. But Mr. Kelly, who initially earned plaudits for imposing more order on the West Wing, lately has come under fire for his management of the White House, particularly his handling of spousal abuse allegations that resulted in the resignation of the staff secretary, Rob Porter.\n\nMr. Priebus said that Mr. Trump has spent his whole life resisting the sort of organization that others would like to impose on him. \u201cThe idea that he was suddenly going to accept an immediate and elaborate staff structure regulating every minute of his life was never in the cards,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cAt least not on Day 1.\u201d", "title": "Riding an Untamed Horse: Priebus Opens Up on Serving Trump", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

Moreover, he argues that even if Mr. Steele had a personal bias against Mr. Trump, it should not disqualify his information as unreliable. \u201cBeing biased is hardly a disqualifier,\u201d Mr. Sipher writes. \u201cIf it were, we would have a tough time finding sources in most countries around the world.\u201d Read more \u00bb\n\n_____\n\nDouglas M.

Annual sales of hummus in the country total more than 100 million pounds, or about $140 million, up about 50 percent from four years ago, according to the research firm Kantar Worldpanel.\n\nIndeed, worldwide demand for hummus has driven up interest in chickpea production, and analysts expect a shift toward healthier eating will continue to bolster the dish\u2019s popularity. Farmers in the United States, for example, were forecast to drastically raise their chickpea harvests last year, according to official data, after what was already a record year in 2016.

Shore succeeds admirably, particularly because she tells the story through their words. Her sympathy for their courage and her support for a democratic Ukraine aligned with the West are evident, her depictions of the sights, sounds and smells on the Maidan superb. In lucid, if occasionally overwrought, prose she draws evocative portraits of people who braved the bitter cold \u2014 and truncheons and bullets \u2014 to create a \u201cparallel polis\u201d with barricades, soup kitchens, libraries, rock concerts, fiery speakers and solidarity among Ukrainians of disparate backgrounds.\n\nImage\n\nThis is not a work of historical scholarship, nor is it comparable to the detailed eyewitness reportage of writers like Keith Gessen or Sophie Pinkham. Shore strides through centuries of Ukraine\u2019s past, but the result verges on potted history: It offers little to readers familiar with Ukraine and not nearly enough for novices seeking to understand the stark cultural and political variations within the country or the complex forces that produced the Maidan revolution. Shore wishes to give the movement a human face, but she devotes so much space to people\u2019s appearances, professions, families, ruminations and inner thoughts that her account resembles a collage of personalities.\n\nShore does not dispute that Yanukovych was elected fairly in 2010 yet fails to explain how a crook and a thug (\u201choodlum\u201d is her apt description), who betrayed even the inhabitants of the Donbass, his political bastion, prevailed, or why he suddenly shelved the association agreement. Given her overwhelming focus on Kiev and parts west, she says little about those Ukrainians in Crimea and the Donbass who opposed the Maidan revolt. Generally, they are voiceless \u2014 spoken for by Shore herself, or by her pro-Maidan interlocutors (who tend to characterize them as troglodytes). The internal political differences produced by Ukraine\u2019s history are obscured, or dismissed as backward when they do not align with the ideals of the Maidan.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian Night\u201d vividly depicts life on the Maidan.

He grew up Mormon in a family with close ties to the elite Mormon enclave of Belmont, Mass., collected degrees from Harvard and Oxford University and amassed prestigious job titles.\n\nThough many described him as composed and calm, others in his ultracompetitive workplaces described him as tightly wound, revealing occasional glimpses of how angry he could become, particularly if anyone got in his way.

His mother, the former Charlotte Wittenberg, who had immigrated from Germany, worked at RCA, specializing in Morse code.\n\nAt some point Robert adapted his mother\u2019s last name and began going by Pincus-Witten \u2014 perhaps, Mr. Hecht speculated, to separate himself in the professional sphere. \u201cI think he wanted to be distinctively different,\u201d Mr. Hecht said.\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten also had a distinctively different speaking voice with a hard-to-define timbre that suggested erudition. Some who heard him lecture mistook it for an accent or an affectation, but Mr. Hecht, who had known him since early childhood, said those impressions were mistaken.\n\n\u201cAs a little boy in school, he spoke the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, of course, the teachers loved him, he was so witty and bright.\u201d\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten received a degree from the Cooper Union in Manhattan in 1956 and a master of arts from the University of Chicago in 1962, adding a doctorate from that institution in 1968. He joined the CUNY faculty in 1964, retiring in 1990.\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten began writing for Artforum in the mid-1960s. (He also held editing titles at times during his long association with the magazine.) About the same time, various artists began expanding beyond Minimalism; a 1966 show at the Fischbach Gallery in Manhattan called \u201cEccentric Abstraction\u201d was one important indicator of change.\n\nBut it was not until 1971 that Mr. Pincus-Witten came up with the label for these efforts that stuck, when he used Post-Minimalism in an Artforum article about the sculptor Eva Hesse, who had died the year before.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was also tangentially involved in one of Artforum\u2019s most incendiary moments from the 1970s: a 1974 issue of the magazine that featured a color photograph of the artist Lynda Benglis nude and holding a dildo between her thighs.\n\nThe photograph ran as an advertisement \u2014 it carried the name of the Paula Cooper Gallery, her dealer \u2014 but Ms. Benglis had initially hoped that it would appear with an article about her, written by Mr. Pincus-Witten, in the same the issue. The magazine\u2019s editor, John Coplans, would not allow that.\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten may have been a vital voice in the Post-Minimal moment, but he also knew that the art world would move on to new trends and ideas, at it always did.\n\n\u201cThe taste for the successful and celebrated is fickle,\u201d he noted in 2008 in Artforum. \u201cWhat waxes, wanes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk to a displaced middle-aged abstractionist today and listen to what is said,\u201d he added. \u201cWalk the display floors of the contemporary day sales \u2014 not the uncontested important lots of the evening sale \u2014 of the reigning auction houses and have a revelation: What was passionately acquired ten or twenty years earlier forms the bulk of lot upon lot of discredited art.\u201d\n\nHe thus remained ever curious.\n\nThe curator Scott Rothkopf wrote of him in Artforum in 2003, \u201cAfter fifteen years on the front lines of new art \u2014 an interval that could spawn almost as many generations of artists as fruit flies \u2014 Pincus-Witten wasn\u2019t about to desert the new recruits.\u201d\n\nMr. Rothkopf was writing in praise of the diarylike pieces that Mr. Pincus-Witten wrote for Arts magazine from 1976 to 1990. A mixture of feature article and critical assessment, they recounted his visits to shows and artists\u2019 lofts.\n\n\u201cHis reportage often illuminates the personal and commercial machinations that inevitably inform art\u2019s checkered past and present,\u201d Mr. Rothkopf wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten was the author of several books, including \u201cPostminimalism\u201d (1977), \u201cEye to Eye: Twenty Years of Art Criticism\u201d (1984) and \u201cPostminimalism Into Maximalism: American Art, 1966-1986\u201d (1987). He worked at the Gagosian gallery from 1990 to 1996 and continued to contribute essays to its publications thereafter. Later that year he joined C&M Arts (now the Mnuchin Gallery) as director of exhibitions, a post he held for 11 years.\n\nMr. Hecht is his only immediate survivor.\n\nMr. Pincus-Witten thought that collectors of contemporary art enjoyed a special privilege not shared by those who focus on established artists: the chance to help determine what is ultimately viewed as significant.\n\n\u201cThe collector of contemporary art actually participates in the discourse of the day,\u201d he wrote, \u201cadding through acquisition his or her particular inflection to this tumultuous conversation. Hence, the collecting of contemporary art \u2014 whatever other benefits it may provide or deficits it may incur \u2014 confers a voice upon the collector with regard to the formation of the larger culture.\u201d\n\nAnd what of the critic\u2019s role? \u201cI see the critical task as being essentially that of pointing to the new,\u201d he wrote.", "title": "Robert Pincus-Witten, Art Critic and Historian, Is Dead at 82", "authors": ["Neil Genzlinger"]}

The main event at the museum this season is a terrific show on T-shirts, which I could see was likely to be a crowd-puller, but the idea of this little show on scissors fascinated me. I pitched a short feature to Vanessa Friedman, the fashion director at The Times, under an honest subject line: \u201cOdd story \u2026 but I\u2019m a little obsessed with it.\u201d\n\nIt was my milliner friend Gabrielle Djanogly \u2014 a font of good stories and folklore \u2014 who first told me of the connection between sewing scissors and midwifery, the same instrument cutting both embroidery thread and umbilical cord. It was revelatory: I\u2019d grown up using the little stork scissors in my own mother\u2019s sewing box, and it had never occurred to me that such a story might have lurked behind their design. Of course, once you make that connection, you see immediately that the spindly metal bird with its snipping bill is a sibling to the stork on the spoon handle that records details of a baby\u2019s birth.\n\nThe stork scissors in my own mother\u2019s sewing box were part of an orderly feminine realm populated by objects designed for delicate hands and sharp eyes \u2014 little silver thimbles, slim needles, fine thread \u2014 to be called upon for acts of maintenance and repair. They occupied quite a different technical vocabulary from the medieval-looking shears she later used in her sheep shed to trim rank wool. And yet technically, the only difference was one of scale: Dagging shears and tiny stork alike were both fitted to the mechanism of the human hand.\n\nThey threatened human hands, too: I was haunted as a child by the long-legged scissor man in Heinrich Hoffmann\u2019s \u201cStruwwelpeter,\u201d who \u201calways comes to boys and girls who suck their thumbs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite all the above, I don\u2019t feel I have a distinct personal history with scissors \u2014 I think my experiences are quite universal. After all, these are some of the most basic and ancient of human tools. I sensed that \u201cThe Secret Life of Scissors\u201d and its curator would yield some wonderful stories, and I wasn\u2019t wrong. The exhibition is actually based on the curator Teresa Collenette\u2019s personal collection, and I think she would forgive me for suggesting she has something of an obsession. Toward the end of the installation period, we met for tea at a hipster cafe in Bermondsey. Ms. Collenette heaved a laden cotton bag \u2014 printed with the scissored crest of the Craftivist Collective \u2014 onto the wooden countertop and drew out a procession of highlights from her collection for me to examine.", "title": "Rock and Paper Had No Idea", "authors": ["Hettie Judah"]}

That means winning three matches, the first against the Belgian qualifier Ruben Bemelmans on Wednesday night in what will be their first meeting.\n\nWin that and Federer\u2019s second-round opponent will be the 36th-ranked Philipp Kohlschreiber, whom Federer has beaten in all 12 of their singles matches. Make it 13-0 and Federer is guaranteed to face a Dutchman ranked no higher than 42 \u2014 perhaps Robin Haase \u2014 in the quarterfinals with the top ranking at stake.\n\n\u201cIt would be absolutely incredible,\u201d Federer said of reaching No. 1, in an interview with Tennis TV. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this close, but No. 1 has never been simple, never been easy to get there. So I know it\u2019s going to be a lot of hard work for me this week mentally just to cope with everything, just also not thinking too far ahead.\u201d\n\nStill, the odds appear to be heavily in his favor, all the more so now that Stan Wawrinka, still working his way back from knee surgery but the only other major winner in Federer\u2019s quarter of the draw, was upset on Tuesday by the Dutch wild-card Tallon Griekspoor.\n\nFederer even gets the chance to keep playing indoors, which is where he played his last two matches at the Australian Open.\n\nHis semifinal with Hyeon Chung was contested under a closed roof in Melbourne because of rain. The final against Marin Cilic was played under a closed roof because of heat and humidity, a decision that caught the finalists and many others by surprise because the match was played in the evening.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is time for the Australian Open to revisit its extreme heat policy and not leave quite so much to the tournament referee\u2019s discretion. The sentiment in some sectors of the tennis community that the Australians may have been protecting Federer from the elements this year does no one any favors and distracts from a remarkable achievement that Federer was perfectly capable of managing without caveats.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fact that Tennis Australia and Federer are now in business together does not help.\n\nTennis Australia, like the United States Tennis Association, is a partner in the Laver Cup, the team event Federer\u2019s management group started in 2017. The Laver Cup advertisements that were visible in Melbourne Park raised some eyebrows in the player lounge (there were also signs on site for Rafael Nadal\u2019s academy in Majorca).\n\nGiven all that, the Australian Open should be bending over backward to eliminate any impression that the tournament is favoring Federer (or Nadal). So should the United States Open come August.\n\nBut then tennis runs on conflict of interest like few sports. It also runs on breaking records, which has long been Federer\u2019s forte.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He is more than three years older than top-ranked Andre Agassi in 2003; Serena Williams, the oldest No. 1 singles player in WTA history, was 35 when she last held the top spot in 2017.\n\nThat Federer is this close even after skipping the clay-court season last year is a big surprise and also an indicator of how much his younger rivals \u2014 Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, both 30 \u2014 have struggled with injuries. Even though Federer won last year\u2019s Wimbledon and this year\u2019s Australian Open without facing any of the so-called Big Five, he has been an inspiration, picking his spots and proving that less can lead to more.\n\n\u201cThe thing that is amazing is Roger having the ability to play less and yet not lose confidence due to lack of reps,\u201d said Paul Annacone, his former coach. \u201cThat is a tough balance for anyone.\u201d\n\nConsidering the unlikely confluence of circumstances that have led to this moment, it is tempting to think it may never be matched.\n\n\u201cI do think Novak could make a similar run to the top at 36 if he is able to regain full health,\u201d Courier said. \u201cI could see his professionalism and talent taking him back to the pinnacle in his mid-30s.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAgassi was 33 when he last was No. 1. He was in the midst of a late-career surge animated by regret over missed opportunities in his less-committed youth and by the desire to play for a higher cause: the school he had opened in Las Vegas.\n\nHe was also racing the clock and a degenerative back problem that already was requiring cortisone injections.\n\nFederer, who has had back problems of his own, seems to be feeling no such pain at this stage and is even talking about playing the tournament in Dubai this month, too. He then intends to defend his hardcourt titles at Indian Wells (all but certain) and Miami (we\u2019ll see). After that, he presumably will play as little clay-court tennis as possible, perhaps none at all, which was his winning formula last year.\n\nThat is not because he has no chance at the French Open. He needs to pace himself and avoid too much risk to his postoperative knee, as Pierre Paganini, his longtime fitness trainer, explained to me late last year.\n\n\u201cThe advantage when you play on clay for the joints is there is less shock because there is the slide, and the disadvantage on hard courts is there is that shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the advantage on hard courts is that the shock is brief. It\u2019s bang and the foot leaves the ground and a player who is as coordinated and a dancer like Federer, he crushes his joints a bit less at that bad moment.\n\n\u201cIn contrast, the disadvantage with the slide on clay is that in the joints there is a lot of vibration. We don\u2019t see it from the outside, but to control this slide there is instability in the knee, the foot, the ankle. And that in some cases can be bad for the knee or joint in question.\u201d\n\nHowever logical, skipping the French Open again would still be a sacrifice. Federer has been the third-best clay-courter of this era, behind Nadal and Djokovic. He won the French Open in 2009, securing his spot in the greatest-ever debate.\n\nBecoming the oldest No. 1 in ATP history could turn that debate into a filibuster, and here he is, tantalizingly close without having been single-minded about the chase.", "title": "Roger Federer Pursues the No. 1 Ranking Again.

The two had many phone chats and exchanged numerous texts over the course of a month, learning, among other things, that they both lived in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. \u201cBut that was fine,\u201d she thought. \u201cIt\u2019s a big neighborhood.\u201d\n\nFinally, they agreed the time had come to meet, and the man suggested a restaurant two avenues west and several blocks north of Ms. Roberson\u2019s studio apartment in a high-rise rental.\n\n\u201cI assumed it was close to where he lived, but I was fine walking that distance,\u201d Ms. Roberson said. All the more so because it was a truly great first date. The couple talked for hours, later adjourning to the jazz club next door.

My friends and I would be hanging out in front of the building, and someone would ask my girlfriend to join us. And if we\u2019d be having a fight, it meant one of us had to leave.\u201d\n\nEver since, Mr. Kennedy said, \u201cmy first question before I\u2019d consider going out with someone was \u2018Where do you live?\u2019 It had to be a different borough. If the answer was \u2018the Bronx,\u2019 I wouldn\u2019t be interested.\u201d\n\nHe is now married.

He found 81 by the United States and 36 by the Soviet Union or Russia between 1946 and 2000, though the Russian count is undoubtedly incomplete.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in any way justifying what the Russians did in 2016,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cIt was completely wrong of Vladimir Putin to intervene in this way. That said, the methods they used in this election were the digital version of methods used both by the United States and Russia for decades: breaking into party headquarters, recruiting secretaries, placing informants in a party, giving information or disinformation to newspapers.\u201d\n\nHis findings underscore how routine election meddling by the United States \u2014 sometimes covert and sometimes quite open \u2014 has been.\n\nThe precedent was established in Italy with assistance to non-Communist candidates from the late 1940s to the 1960s. \u201cWe had bags of money that we delivered to selected politicians, to defray their expenses,\u201d said F. Mark Wyatt, a former C.I.A. officer, in a 1996 interview.\n\nCovert propaganda has also been a mainstay. Richard M. Bissell Jr., who ran the agency\u2019s operations in the late 1950s and early 1960s, wrote casually in his autobiography of \u201cexercising control over a newspaper or broadcasting station, or of securing the desired outcome in an election.\u201d A self-congratulatory declassified report on the C.I.A.\u2019s work in Chile\u2019s 1964 election boasts of the \u201chard work\u201d the agency did supplying \u201clarge sums\u201d to its favored candidate and portraying him as a \u201cwise, sincere and high-minded statesman\u201d while painting his leftist opponent as a \u201ccalculating schemer.\u201d\n\nC.I.A. officials told Mr. Johnson in the late 1980s that \u201cinsertions\u201d of information into foreign news media, mostly accurate but sometimes false, were running at 70 to 80 a day. In the 1990 election in Nicaragua, the C.I.A. planted stories about corruption in the leftist Sandinista government, Mr. Levin said. The opposition won.\n\nOver time, more American influence operations have been mounted not secretly by the C.I.A. but openly by the State Department and its affiliates. For the 2000 election in Serbia, the United States funded a successful effort to defeat Slobodan Milosevic, the nationalist leader, providing political consultants and millions of stickers with the opposition\u2019s clenched-fist symbol and \u201cHe\u2019s finished\u201d in Serbian, printed on 80 tons of adhesive paper and delivered by a Washington contractor.\n\nVince Houghton, who served in the military in the Balkans at the time and worked closely with the intelligence agencies, said he saw American efforts everywhere. \u201cWe made it very clear that we had no intention of letting Milosevic stay in power,\u201d said Mr. Houghton, now the historian at the International Spy Museum.\n\nSimilar efforts were undertaken in elections in wartime Iraq and Afghanistan, not always with success. After Hamid Karzai was re-elected president of Afghanistan in 2009, he complained to Robert Gates, then the secretary of defense, about the United States\u2019 blatant attempt to defeat him, which Mr. Gates calls in his memoir \u201cour clumsy and failed putsch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt least once the hand of the United States reached boldly into a Russian election. American fears that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated for re-election as president in 1996 by an old-fashioned Communist led to an overt and covert effort to help him, urged on by President Bill Clinton. It included an American push for a $10 billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia four months before the voting and a team of American political consultants (though some Russians scoffed when they took credit for the Yeltsin win).\n\nThat heavy-handed intervention made some Americans uneasy. Thomas Carothers, a scholar at the Carnegie Institute for International Peace, recalls arguing with a State Department official who told him at the time, \u201cYeltsin is democracy in Russia,\u201d to which Mr. Carothers said he replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not what democracy means.\u201d\n\nBut what does democracy mean? Can it include secretly undermining an authoritarian ruler or helping challengers who embrace democratic values? How about financing civic organizations?\n\nIn recent decades, the most visible American presence in foreign politics has been taxpayer-funded groups like the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, which do not support candidates but teach basic campaign skills, build democratic institutions and train election monitors.\n\nMost Americans view such efforts as benign \u2014 indeed, charitable. But Mr. Putin sees them as hostile. The National Endowment for Democracy gave a $23,000 grant in 2006 to an organization that employed Aleksei Navalny, who years later became Mr. Putin\u2019s main political nemesis, a fact the government has used to attack both Mr. Navalny and the endowment. In 2016, the endowment gave 108 grants totaling $6.8 million to organizations in Russia for such purposes as \u201cengaging activists\u201d and \u201cfostering civic engagement.\u201d The endowment no longer names Russian recipients, who, under Russian laws cracking down on foreign funding, can face harassment or arrest.\n\nIt is easy to understand why Mr. Putin sees such American cash as a threat to his rule, which tolerates no real opposition. But American veterans of democracy promotion find abhorrent Mr. Putin\u2019s insinuations that their work is equivalent to what the Russian government is accused of doing in the United States today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just apples and oranges,\u201d said Kenneth Wollack, president of the National Democratic Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s comparing someone who delivers lifesaving medicine to someone who brings deadly poison.\u201d\n\nWhat the C.I.A. may have done in recent years to steer foreign elections is still secret and may not be known for decades. It may be modest by comparison with the agency\u2019s Cold War manipulation. But some old-timers aren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cI assume they\u2019re doing a lot of the old stuff, because, you know, it never changes,\u201d said William J. Daugherty, who worked for the C.I.A. from 1979 to 1996 and at one time had the job of reviewing covert operations. \u201cThe technology may change, but the objectives don\u2019t.\u201d", "title": "Russia Isn\u2019t the Only One Meddling in Elections.

But Mr. Pompeo said that the president has made clear that the C.I.A. has \u201can obligation, from the foreign intelligence perspective, to do everything we can to make sure there\u2019s a deep and thorough understanding of every threat, including threats from Russia.\u201d\n\nRussia appears eager to spread information \u2014 real and fake \u2014 that deepens political divisions. Bot armies promoted partisan causes on social media, including the recent push to release a Republican congressional memo critical of law enforcement officials.\n\nThe bots have also sought to portray the F.B.I. and Justice Department as infected by partisan bias, said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cOther threats to our institutions come from right here at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some, aided and abetted by Russian internet bots and trolls, who have attacked the basic integrity of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.

They took advantage, a sophisticated advantage of social media. They are doing that not only in the United States but doing it throughout Europe and perhaps elsewhere.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo was also asked about reports last week by The New York Times and The Intercept that American intelligence agencies spent months negotiating with a Russian who said he could sell stolen American cyberweapons and that the deal would include purportedly compromising material on Mr. Trump. The negotiations were conducted through an American businessman who lives in Europe and served as a cutout for American intelligence agencies.\n\nMr. Pompeo called the reporting \u201catrocious, ridiculous and inaccurate\u201d and said the C.I.A. had not paid the Russian. The Times, citing American and European intelligence officials, said only that American spies had paid the Russian $100,000 for the cyberweapons using an indirect channel. Those weapons were never delivered. The Russian did provide information on Mr. Trump, which intelligence agencies refused to accept and remains with the American businessman.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur story was based on numerous interviews, a review of communications and other evidence. We stand by it,\u201d said Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times.\n\nMr. Pompeo did appear to acknowledge the operation itself, saying that \u201cthe information that we were working to try and retrieve was information we believed might well have been stolen from the U.S. government.\u201d\n\nHe and the other intelligence chiefs, including Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the departing director of the National Security Agency, also addressed the slew of other threats they see facing the United States. They cited North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, Islamist militants in the Middle East and even illicit drug trafficking, especially the smuggling of cheaply made fentanyl, a powerful opioid responsible for thousands of deaths each year.\n\nBut as has been the case for years, the intelligence leaders presented cyberactivities of rival nations and rogue groups as the foremost threat facing the United States. They warned that such risks were likely to only grow, citing China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, along with militant groups and criminal networks, as the main agitators.\n\nTo ease the flow of information, the Department of Homeland Security is trying to get at least one election official in each state a security clearance. To date, 21 officials in 20 states received at least interim \u201csecret\u201d-level clearances, Ms. Manfra said in the interview.\n\nThe federal government is also working to provide states with enhanced online security \u201cto ensure the American people that their vote is sanctioned and well and not manipulated in any way,\u201d Mr. Coats said.\n\nHomeland Security has added 32 states and 31 local governments to a system that scans internet-connected systems in the federal government every night for vulnerabilities, offering weekly reports and fixes to any issues they find, Ms. Manfra said.\n\nSpecialists also spend weeks auditing cyberdefense systems in both federal agencies and state elections offices, and last month, the department decided to prioritize requests for the latter to ensure that they get done swiftly, she added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVirtually every state is taking steps to harden voter databases and election equipment against outside attacks and to strengthen postelection audits. When the National Association of Secretaries of State holds its winter meeting this weekend in Washington, half of the sessions will be devoted wholly or in part to election security.\n\nNew standards for voting equipment were approved last fall that will effectively require manufacturers to include several security improvements in new devices. States are moving to scrap voting machines that do not generate an auditable paper ballot as well as an electronic one; Virginia has decertified most of its devices, Pennsylvania has declared that all new devices will produce paper ballots, and Georgia \u2014 a state whose outdated equipment produces only electronic voting records \u2014 has set up a pilot program to move to paper.\n\nBut a host of problems remains. Roughly one-fifth of the country lacks paper ballots, and replacing digital-only machines costs millions of dollars. Federal legislation that would allot funds to speed up the conversion to paper is crawling through Congress.\n\nMany experts, meanwhile, believe that Russian meddling in the presidential race was but a foretaste of what is to come \u2014 not just from the Kremlin, but also from other hostile states and private actors.\n\n\u201cRussia learned a lot last year in what really, I think, can be seen as a series of probing attacks,\u201d Douglas Lute, a retired Army lieutenant general, deputy national security adviser to President George W. Bush and ambassador to NATO under President Barack Obama, said in an interview. \u201cI think we should expect that they learned and they\u2019re going to come back in a much more sophisticated way.\u201d", "title": "Russia Sees Midterm Elections as Chance to Sow Fresh Discord, Intelligence Chiefs Warn", "authors": ["Matthew Rosenberg", "Charlie Savage", "Michael Wines"]}

The trio had something more than opposition to Mrs. Clinton in common: A central theme of their campaigns was that the American political system is fundamentally rigged \u2014 the same claim that had so incensed Mr. Putin.\n\nThis same theme crops up in many of the Russian front groups\u2019 attacks: \u201cHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa caucus,\u201d one social media post declared. One of the more memorable stunts the Russian team sponsored \u2014 hiring an American to attend rallies dressed as Mrs. Clinton in prison garb, toting an ersatz jail cell \u2014 fits the same pattern: She had to be cast not merely as an inferior candidate, but as a criminal who could win only through corruption.\n\nMr. Trump was vehemently committed to the same message, not only leading those infamous chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d but routinely declaring that if he were defeated \u2014 which polls throughout the campaign suggested was the most likely outcome \u2014 it would only be because Democrats had rigged the vote.\n\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s natural to think that Russia\u2019s primary aim was to achieve the upset Trump victory we now know occurred.

Scores of athletes, coaches and officials tainted by the scandal have been barred, though the International Olympic Committee has been considering allowing the Russian athletes to march under their national flag and in their country\u2019s uniforms for the closing ceremony, which they were not permitted to do during the opening ceremony. The Olympic anthem will be played instead of Russia\u2019s national anthem for any winners of gold medals, although no Russians have won so far.\n\nThe failed test is likely to figure in the thinking of the three-person I.O.C. panel charged with deciding whether Russia\u2019s team could be reinstated for the closing ceremony and its athletes allowed to parade with the Russian flag.\n\nThe panel is also closely monitoring the reaction from Russian officials to the failed test. Should they dispute the verdict or make critical comments it would be practically impossible to restore the Russian team before the end of the Games, said a person familiar with the group\u2019s thinking. Complicating matters further is Russia\u2019s continued failure to pay a $15 million fine levied by the I.O.C. as a response to the doping scheme. The fine is nonnegotiable.\n\nThe Russians allowed to participate in South Korea were subjected to what Olympics officials described as a rigorous testing regimen, and have found themselves under scrutiny from testers as the event has progressed.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the antidoping system at the Games, which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,\u201d the International Olympic Committee said in a statement Sunday.\n\nMeldonium caused confusion among Russian athletes when it was added to the list of banned substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Scores of athletes, including the five-time Grand Slam tennis champion Maria Sharapova, tested positive for it.\n\nThe antidoping agency eventually ruled that more research was required to understand how long the substance, known as mildronate in Russia, remained in the system, as some athletes claimed they had consumed it before the ban had come into force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExperts have said it is possible that trace amounts of the substance would still be detectable for a few months after an athlete stopped taking it, but it is unlikely it would still be present if an athlete stopped taking the drug before the ban went into effect in January 2016.\n\nEastern European scientists have promoted meldonium\u2019s health benefits, saying it increases blood flow. Increased blood flow also provides more oxygen to muscles and could increase endurance. While curling is far from cross-country skiing in terms of exertion, curlers spend hours on their feet and vigorously sweep the ice at regular intervals.\n\nMany of the athletes involved, though not Sharapova, eventually had their suspensions lifted because it was not clear when they had taken the substance.\n\nKrushelnytsky was part of the mixed doubles team that won a bronze medal last week, a rare bright spot for the depleted Russian Olympic squad, which has struggled without some of its top stars.\n\nIn the curling event, he appeared to do most of the pair\u2019s sweeping. They defeated Kristin Skaslin and Magnus Nedregotten of Norway in the bronze medal match, 8-4.\n\nThe Russian team actually had a chance to win its semifinal against Switzerland, but Krushelnytsky overshot a target on his final shot of the match, and Switzerland advanced to the final, where it was defeated by Canada.", "title": "Russian Athlete Leaves for Seoul After Failed Doping Test", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"]}

Alexander Krushelnytsky, who won a bronze in mixed doubles curling, subsequently left the Games and dropped his appeal.\n\nThe head of Russia\u2019s delegation in Pyeongchang told Sport Express, a Russian sports newspaper that broke the news of both failed tests, that the federation would conduct its own investigation into each one.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this case speaks of the negligence shown by the athlete,\u201d said Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the leader of the Olympic Athletes from Russia delegation. \u201cI can say that she seriously let us all down.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Bobsled Federation president, Alexander Zubkov, told The Associated Press that Sergeeva had a clean test as recently as Feb. 13, and the banned substance was in a sample she provided five days later.

Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has denied that the state-sponsored program was in place.\n\nThe efforts produced striking results at the Sochi Games, where Russia won a total of 29 medals, 11 of them gold, the most of any country. (Four of those medals were ultimately stripped over doping violations.)\n\nThe meager haul this year does not surprise Russians because so many of their greatest contenders are not contending.

The hockey star Ilya Kovalchuk has reportedly asked flag-bearing fans who want a selfie to, at least momentarily, hide the flag. The athletes from Russia had to agree not to register any protests. Even a selfie with a flag in it could be construed as dissent.\n\nThere are no such restrictions in the stands, of course, and, other than the South Koreans, Russian fans might be the most visible cohort here. It is difficult to discern whether these Russians are here as true \u201cfans\u201d or whether they are part of sponsored group that has been sent here \u2014 by the government, or the collection of oligarchs who support Olympic sports \u2014 to stick up for the country and wave banners in a language that is not their own. Regardless, for sheer enthusiasm, their only rivals are the Norwegians, who are avid face painters with access to an apparently limitless supply of plastic Viking helmets.\n\nThey are not nearly as loud as the Russians, however. At the hockey game against the United States on Saturday, Russian fans camped in a mass of blue and red behind both nets. Many sported stickers and hats that read \u201cRussia in My Heart,\u201d a phrase that became a rallying cry of sorts of a few months ago, as it became clear that \u201cRussia\u201d would not appear in the Olympics. They sang Russian folk songs. They screamed \u201cRussia, forward!\u201d\n\nThey also erupted at each goal into a hopping, joyful horde. Their side won, 4-0, so they had plenty to hop about.\n\nBy contrast, there was not a single Russian who qualified for the men\u2019s 15-kilometer mass start biathlon. The country\u2019s best prospect, Anton Shipulin, was among a few dozen athletes whose appeal for admission to the Olympics was denied just as the Games began. He had been training right up to the final decision, skiing with his cellphone in his pocket and hoping for a text message with some good news, according to the British publication Express.\n\nIt never came. Russian fans showed up at the race anyway, falling into a distinctly foul mood when talk turned to the event.\n\n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Shipulin here?\u201d said Shkarin, the white-hatted fan from Vladivostok. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nOnce his pique had passed, he pivoted to a note of optimism.\n\n\u201cI love the Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to the 2022 Games in Beijing.\u201d", "title": "Russian Fans at the Olympics Are Loud, Proud and Angry", "authors": ["David Segal"]}

Another targeting black voters implied that the government had implicitly supported the Ku Klux Klan by dismantling the Black Panthers.\n\nIf this had any effect, research suggests it did so by tapping into existing polarization, rather than creating new divisions.\n\nA recent study found that the people most likely to consume fake news were already hyperpartisan and close followers of politics, and that false stories were only a small fraction of their media consumption.\n\nAmericans, it said, sought out stories that reflected their already-formed partisan view of reality. This suggests that these Russians efforts are indicators \u2014 not drivers \u2014 of how widely Americans had polarized.\n\nThat distinction matters for how the indictment is read: Though Americans have seen it as highlighting a foreign threat, it also illustrates the perhaps graver threats from within.\n\nAn Especially Toxic Form of Partisanship\n\nRussian interference tended to focus on telling the targeted group to fear and distrust the other side. Posts that targeted Republicans, for instance, portrayed Mrs. Clinton as a threat to the Constitution and public safety, and in one memorable example said that her election would be a victory for Satan himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn taking this approach, the Russians were merely riding a trend that has been building for decades. Since the 1980s, surveys have found that Republicans and Democrats\u2019 feelings toward the opposing party have been growing more and more negative. Voters are animated more by distrust of the other side than support for their own.\n\nThis highlights a problem that Lilliana Mason, a University of Maryland political scientist, said had left American democracy dangerously vulnerable. But it\u2019s a problem driven primarily by American politicians and media outlets, which have far louder megaphones than any Russian-made Facebook posts.\n\n\u201cCompromise is the core of democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we can govern.\u201d But, she said, \u201cwhen you make people feel threatened, nobody compromises with evil.\u201d\n\nThe claim that, for example, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s victory might aid Satan is in many ways just a faint echo of the partisan anger and fear already dominating American politics.\n\nThose emotions undermine a key norm that all sides are served by honoring democratic processes; instead, they justify, or even seem to mandate, extreme steps against the other side.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nFracturing by Race and Party\n\nThe Russians\u2019 apparent focus on heightening racial division touched on something much deeper than even the Russians may have understood.\n\nAmerican democracy can function only when its citizens accept the right of all others to participate regardless of their background.\n\nThat applies to party divisions. But, increasingly, partisan identity is aligning with racial and religious identity, according to research by Dr. Mason. This, along with deepening partisan distrust, is creating one of the worst possible conditions in a multiethnic democracy: a growing belief that elections are a zero-sum contest for control among racial and religious groups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRussian misinformation hit repeatedly on this fear, spreading fake news and even rally posters that declared the allegiance of Muslim Americans to Mrs. Clinton.\n\nPolarization by race, building since the 1990s, poses \u201cthe greatest challenge to established forms of mutual toleration and forbearance since Reconstruction,\u201d the political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky write in their book, \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d\n\nThe idea that all demographic groups must cooperate rather than compete is one of the most important norms for a multiethnic democracy like that of the United States. The claims pushed in Russian posts demonstrate, precisely because they are so implausible, how rapidly that norm is weakening.\n\nWeakened Guardrails and Guardians\n\nThe Russian campaign targeted not just democracy\u2019s guardrails \u2014 the norms of cooperation and inclusion \u2014 but also political parties, which are supposed to function as democracy\u2019s guardians. For instance, posts and individuals alleged that the Democratic Party was outright stealing the primary for Mrs. Clinton \u2014 well beyond what actually occurred \u2014 and attempted to sow infighting among Republicans.\n\nAlthough parties compete by design, they also play a stabilizing role, weeding out candidates with anti-democratic or extreme views, for instance, and ensuring that legislators\u2019 individual interests don\u2019t crowd out the state\u2019s ability to govern. Or they\u2019re supposed to, anyway.\n\nBut the Russians entered a political scene already defined by the parties\u2019 weakness and inability to control their own field.\n\n\u201cThe defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are weak while partisanship is strong,\u201d Julia Azari, a Marquette University political scientist, wrote the day after the vote.\n\nIt may have been party weakness that even gave the Russians a Trump campaign to support. Though the G.O.P. tried repeatedly to halt Mr. Trump\u2019s advance in the primary, it failed, revealing both its powerlessness and its unpopularity with its own voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFox News had displaced the party\u2019s power over Republican voters, according to Vanessa Williamson, a political scientist who is the co-author of the definitive academic book on Tea Party politics, which revealed that shift long before the Russians arrived. Though the foreigner-pushed posts may be more striking than homegrown partisan media, it is a reminder that the latter plays a far greater role in weakening parties.\n\nTurning Against Institutions\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has already committed voter fraud during the Democrat Iowa Caucus,\u201d announced a 2016 Facebook post allegedly written by the Russians named in the indictment.\n\nWarnings of voter fraud were a frequent theme, and one with some irony; the Russians, it seems, sought to undermine American democracy by suggesting it had already been undermined.\n\nBut if Americans were susceptible to messages seeking to discredit democratic institutions, it was because many already believed them.\n\nThe Tea Party movement, for instance, rose on a fear that Barack Obama was more dictator than president, and that his health care reforms would send elderly Americans to \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Mr. Trump rose on the lie that Mr. Obama is secretly foreign-born. Some supporters of Bernie Sanders, a Democratic senator, suspected that Mrs. Clinton had engineered the primary vote against him, a notion later hit upon by Russian misinformation.\n\nAnd if institutions behave in ways that partisans dislike, for example by issuing a court ruling or releasing a vote tally that hurt their side, those partisans can come to see the institutions as threats to democracy rather than its bedrock foundation.\n\nMr. Trump, for instance, has attacked the F.B.I. as part of a \u201cdeep state\u201d seeking to unseat him from office. In several states, lawmakers unhappy with unfavorable court rulings are increasingly responding with calls for limiting the powers of the judiciary.\n\nThis can lead partisans to believe that by attacking those institutions, they are saving democracy from its enemies within. To the other side, this only affirms suspicion that their opponents are innately anti-democratic and must be excluded. It is a self-perpetuating cycle, one that Russian meddling may have only sped up a bit but that remains almost entirely American-driven.", "title": "Russian Meddling Was a Drop in an Ocean of American-Made Discord", "authors": ["Amanda Taub", "Max Fisher", "The Interpreter"]}

The plane went down near the village of Stepanovskoe, about 50 miles southeast of Moscow in the Ramenskoye District, according to the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry.\n\nThere were no survivors, Moscow\u2019s regional transportation prosecutor-general confirmed. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.\n\nThe Russian aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said the flight departed at 2:21 p.m. from Domodedovo Airport. The Antonov AN-148, a small regional jet, was headed to the city of Orsk in the Orenburg region, about 1,000 miles southeast of Moscow, near the border with Kazakhstan.\n\n\u201cSeveral minutes after takeoff, radio connection with the crew disappeared, the plane\u2019s mark disappeared from radars,\u201d the Emergency Situations Ministry said.\n\nFlightRadar24, an online site that tracks real-time flight information, shows the plane losing altitude just six minutes after takeoff. It reached 6,400 feet before dropping to 5,800 feet, rising again briefly and falling sharply \u2014 all within one minute.\n\nThe Emergency Situations Ministry posted the names of the passengers and crew members online Sunday afternoon, showing that at least three children were on board the plane. A spokeswoman for the Orsk city administration, Yelena Abramova, told Interfax that one of the passengers was a Swiss citizen.\n\nPhoto\n\nFragments of the plane and many bodies were discovered near Stepanovskoe, the official news agency Tass reported, citing a spokesman for the Emergency Services Ministry.\n\n\u201cThe snow is deep \u2014 we need heavy-duty equipment,\u201d Andrei Kulakov, head of the Ramenskoye District, said in an interview broadcast by the news channel Rossiya 24.\n\nVideo broadcast from the site showed safety workers slogging through snowy fields scattered with low shrubs to try to reach the crash site and a piece of the plane burrowed into the snow. The news agency RIA Novosti later reported that one flight recorder had been found.\n\nFootage from the Orsk airport showed Russians pacing and wailing as news of the crash spread.\n\nOutdated equipment and a lack of government oversight plagued Russian aviation for years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, and there were frequent crashes. But in recent years, the industry\u2019s safety record has improved markedly as major airlines have invested in fleets of Western airplanes.\n\nThe most recent devastating crash occurred on Dec. 25, 2016, when a Tupolev TU-154 operated by the Ministry of Defense and headed for Syria plunged into the Black Sea moments after taking off from the southern resort of Sochi. All 92 people on board died, including many members of a military choir traveling to Syria to entertain the troops.\n\nIn March 2016, all 62 people on board a FlyDubai 737 died when it crashed on landing at Rostov-on-Don.\n\nThe third most recent aviation disaster was attributed to a terrorist act. In October 2015, a Russian charter flight ferrying 224 passengers and crew members to St. Petersburg from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, crashed soon after taking off, killing everyone on board.\n\nEgypt later acknowledged that terrorists had most likely brought down the plane.\n\nSaratov Airlines has a fleet of 12 airplanes, five AN-148 aircraft among them. They were built by Antonov Enterprise, a Ukrainian company. One crashed in 2011 during a training flight, when the crew exceeded its maximum speed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "R.S.: One thing that I\u2019ve learned is that the perceptions of what it takes to be a leader are often based on prototypical models that don\u2019t have much truth in reality. People look at the institutions that I have led and they see dissimilarities. I see similarities. When people think in terms of leadership, they\u2019re often thinking about the kind of specific skills needed for different types of enterprises. I think of leadership as more of a disposition \u2014 the ability to step into a situation to learn about the history of the enterprise, the opportunities that it faces, the culture that exists and the people who are served by it. To look at all of that, to listen to stakeholders and then to think about how that enterprise or institution should best be served. There is no one model of leadership if you approach it that way. What I have tried to do wherever I go is to start where the institution is rather than try to import particularly rigid constructs from other places. In that sense, I think a leader is more than anything else a facilitator. A person who is able to come in to show a community a picture of what it is, to provide some insight into what it could be \u2014 how it could be different or improved perhaps \u2014 and then enlist the help of people who are there and others who support that institution in order to move forward together.\n\nI don\u2019t subscribe to the model of hero leadership, which is identifying somebody who can come in and have magical powers and then wield the wand and fix things that have not been fixable before. I don\u2019t see that. I think leadership is a community affair.\n\nM.J.: That makes sense. So how do you approach educating the current generation of students at Prairie View to lead in the way you described?\n\nR.S.: People today are fond of leadership programs that theorize about the profile and tenets of leadership. And students anxiously get involved in those programs. I rather think that our entire campuses are incubators of leadership even without the formality of such programs because if we\u2019re doing what we should be doing, we are acclimating students to an environment in which they have to learn to work with others who are very different from themselves. And that seems to me to be the first requirement of leadership. To actually learn to work with people in a respectful and inclusive way is inordinately important. A campus provides one of the best opportunities for people to be able to do that because you sit in class alongside people whom you initially don\u2019t know. You are discussing your ideas, having people respond to them and often rejecting what you\u2019re saying. You are joining organizations that have certain aims that are being advanced by the collective, so you\u2019re learning how to facilitate. You are asked to step into leadership roles either through student government or organizations. Even in the classroom context you might play a leadership role. You have to learn to express yourself, to be convincing, to write out your ideas, to be more thoughtful than you\u2019d ordinarily be. All of those things are components of leadership.\n\nM.J.: Some would argue that social media, or perhaps disagreements over the concept of safe spaces, have made it more challenging for people to come together and to work together.\n\nR.S.: Yeah, I would say that people frequently say that, but that has certainly not been my experience. I would say that in my days as a student, the tensions were higher, the disagreements were greater, the separation among us was certainly more pronounced. And people are kind of inventing a new narrative, that things are so much worse today than they were in the past. I don\u2019t buy that. I think we have new terminology, because the modern sciences of psychology and sociology and so forth and modern media have enabled us to peer into areas that we were not able to see as easily as before. And so when you have social media and all of the ways in which people can now say whatever they want to say \u2014 in an unartful or offensive way \u2014 that turns the volume up to be sure. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there before.\n\nI would say that the current situation ought to give us much more practice in how to engage with each other because it is not underground. It\u2019s out front, it\u2019s in the open. The media today and the things that are being reported should be upsetting or troubling to students, my goodness. But it may be an even better opportunity to engage students.\n\nAs a teacher, as an educator, I would say these times are especially fertile for teaching the skills that are needed in a world in which there are many types of people, many perspectives and so forth. Students don\u2019t need to feel silenced by the current situation. When students at Brown came to me and said, you know, they were hurt because somebody asked them about their hair, and they were tired of that and they didn\u2019t want any part of it, I would say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just too bad!\u201d Somebody asked you about your hair, tell them about your hair. You are in college not to hide from that. You\u2019re there to teach the world about yourself, you\u2019re there to learn about others and to teach them about who you are. So I\u2019d rather think this whole notion of protecting people from that is something that we have to take in hand and deal with. And help students see the opportunity in that because if they engage with people who have those kinds of perspectives, they are going to be much stronger in the end than if they run away.", "title": "Opinion | Ruth Simmons on Cultivating the Next Generation of College Students", "authors": []}

As a result, the best American players are back home, while Russia has a roster filled with members of its Kontinental Hockey League, including the former N.H.L. stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk. The Russian team is the favorite on paper, but it has a history of underperforming at the Olympics of late.\n\nThen there is Donato, a junior at Harvard and the son of Ted Donato, the Harvard coach and a former N.H.L. and United States national team player. Donato may be the top player on the American squad and may end up playing for the Boston Bruins by the spring. He has also got a ton of work to do on papers for his classes in social psychology and the sociology of immigration while he\u2019s at the Games.\n\n\u201cThankfully I don\u2019t have any exams,\u201d he said in recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty difficult.\u201d\n\nFor Donato, hockey appears to be less so. He is among the fastest players on the ice. Defensemen get twisted and panicky when he is skating at them. He\u2019s the guy who always seems to get the puck in the surprising open spots on the ice where he can wreak the most havoc.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason he is on the power play. Both goals Friday came when the United States had the man advantage. The first happened after Troy Terry left the puck for him as he sliced into the slot. On the second, he performed a 360 on the edge of the crease and slipped the puck past Laco.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe international game, with its larger sheet of ice and less banging than is typical in the United States, suits Donato\u2019s talents, although with eight minutes to go Friday, he took a crosscheck to the neck from Slovakia\u2019s, 6-foot-4, 240-pound defenseman Michal Cajkovsky and popped right back up.\n\nThe people at Harvard are familiar with all this. Donato had 21 goals and 40 points last season, and he already has 21 goals in 23 games this year. His emergence on the United States team, along with three other college players Coach Tony Granato selected rather than going exclusively with minor league or Europe-based pros, makes the showdown with Russia somewhat different than four years ago. Back then, two rosters packed with N.H.L. All-Stars dueled to a 3-2 shootout win for the Americans in Sochi.\n\nTerry, who plays for the University of Denver and got an assist on Donato\u2019s first goal, said he grew up worshiping Kovalchuk and Datsyuk. Now he is trying to get used to the idea of facing them on the ice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTwo weeks ago, Donato and the forward Jordan Greenway, who plays for Boston University, were going up against each other in the Beanpot, the annual college hockey tournament in Boston. Now, they account for three of the four goals scored by the United States at the Games. (The Americans lost in overtime to Slovenia on Wednesday).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big stage for them, and they\u2019re doing great,\u201d said the captain Brian Gionta, who is 39 and was on a practice-only, minor league contract when he was named to this team. Gionta played against Ted Donato in the N.H.L.\n\nDonato said he talked to his father before the game against Slovakia. His father told him to shoot low. When he got the puck in the slot in the first period, that\u2019s what he thought of.\n\nGranato said he might have mentioned similar advice before the game, too, but if Donato wanted to give credit to his father, that was fine with him. Granato said Donato and the other college players have been fearless both in practice and games. He doesn\u2019t expect that to change against the Russians.\n\n\u201cThese guys are confident,\u201d Granato said. \u201cThey want to be over the boards and on the ice and in the action.\u201d", "title": "Ryan Donato Goes From Harvard to Olympic Hockey Stardom", "authors": ["Matthew Futterman"]}

Amazon also courted him seriously, which played a role in driving up the price for the 52-year-old writer, director and producer from Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cThe history of this moment is not lost on me,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in a statement. \u201cI am a gay kid from Indiana who moved to Hollywood in 1989 with $55 in savings in my pocket, so the fact that my dreams have crystallized and come true in such a major way is emotional and overwhelming to me.\u201d\n\nPaving the way for Mr. Murphy to make the jump to streaming was the $100 million deal Netflix reached in August with the producer Shonda Rhimes, the creator of the ABC series \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Ms. Rhimes had been with Disney\u2019s ABC network for a decade and made the move days after Disney announced that it would expand its streaming offerings and eventually pull many of its products from Netflix.\n\nThe moment was certainly right for someone like Mr. Murphy to find himself in the final months of a contract. The Hollywood economy is buzzing, with fast-moving digital disrupters taking on the studios that have been dependable providers of mass entertainment since the silent-movie era.\n\nApple and Amazon have lately joined Netflix and Hulu in moving aggressively to sign heavyweight creators and entertainers, and the old-line companies are in danger of losing relevance if they do not put up a fight against their new, free-spending rivals. Netflix, which began offering original programming in 2012, has said it will spend up to $8 billion on content this year, and Apple has pledged at least $1 billion for original programming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe upshot is that proven show runners and big stars are in an enviable bargaining position.\n\nA factor in Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to join Netflix was the uncertainty brought on by the agreement between Disney and Fox. He had close working relationships with Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox; Dana Walden, the chairwoman of Fox\u2019s TV group (and the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children); and John Landgraf, the chief executive of the FX network, a cable channel under the Fox banner.\n\nIf the Disney-Fox deal wins governmental approval, as expected, it is not a sure thing that those executives will stay in their roles. Mr. Rice said at the Code Media conference on Tuesday that he didn\u2019t know whether he would remain with the company after the planned merger went through.\n\nMaking things even more muddled: Reports on Monday had it that Comcast was revisiting its bid for portions of 21st Century Fox.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Fox allowed him to sign a deal with the streaming service in September for a two-season order of a series centered on Nurse Ratched, the villain from the Ken Kesey novel \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d which was made into an Oscar-winning movie. Last week, the streaming company signed up yet another project from Mr. Murphy that may star Barbra Streisand and Gwyneth Paltrow. Both projects come from Fox\u2019s television studio.\n\nThe exclusive, five-year deal for the high-profile producer is yet another coup for Netflix. In addition to signing Ms. Rhimes last summer, the company has brought aboard Dave Chappelle, David Letterman, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler with lucrative deals.\n\nMr. Murphy did not have his hands tied at Fox, which allowed him to push boundaries. And he did not lack for respect: The first season of the FX anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story: The People vs. O. J. Simpson,\u201d for which Mr. Murphy served as an executive producer, was a huge hit with critics and won nine Emmys. The Netflix deal, though, will allow him potentially bigger budgets and gives him the latitude to try movies, television or even documentaries.\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Murphy expressed his gratitude toward Netflix\u2019s chief executive officer, Reed Hastings; its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos; and its vice president for original content, Cindy Holland.\n\n\u201cI am awash in genuine appreciation for Ted Sarandos, Reed Hastings and Cindy Holland at Netflix for believing in me and the future of my company, which will continue to champion women, minorities and L.G.B.T.Q. heroes and heroines,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am honored and grateful to continue my partnership with my friends and peers at Fox on my existing shows.\u201d\n\nIn his own statement, Mr. Sarandos said, \u201cRyan Murphy\u2019s series have influenced the global cultural zeitgeist, reinvented genres and changed the course of television history. His unfaltering dedication to excellence and to give voice to the underrepresented, to showcase a unique perspective or just to shock the hell out of us, permeates his genre-shattering work.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Murphy\u2019s vast slate at Fox will not disappear overnight. All future seasons of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFeud\u201d will continue to air on FX. His procedural drama, \u201c9-1-1,\u201d which is only six weeks old and is becoming something of a sleeper hit, will continue on Fox. And his new drama about the 1980s New York vogue scene, \u201cPose,\u201d with a largely transgender cast, will proceed at FX.\n\nMr. Murphy began his career as a journalist before moving into television script writing. His first show, \u201cPopular,\u201d on the WB, didn\u2019t last long but has become the source of cult fascination. \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d one of the earliest successes for FX, gave Mr. Murphy his first hit and transformed FX from a crusty basic cable outpost into a premier entertainment destination. In 2009, when Mr. Murphy brought some Broadway pizazz \u2014 along with an affection for misfit adolescents \u2014 to Fox\u2019s prime-time lineup with \u201cGlee,\u201d he entered the top ranks of show runners.\n\nThroughout his career, he has shown a penchant for taking the stuff of camp and making it popular. No one expected an eight-hour limited series about the rivalry between Joan Crawford and Bette Davis \u2014 \u201cFeud,\u201d on FX \u2014 to be a hit, but it was.\n\nMr. Murphy signaled his restlessness last month, at the Television Critics Association media event in Los Angeles, when he expressed angst over his future. For years, he said, he thought he would \u201cliterally be buried on the Fox lot.\u201d Once Rupert Murdoch made the decision to sell the company, however, Mr. Murphy was not so sure.\n\nHe approached Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A.

The transition to \u201cnormal\u201d life is difficult \u2014 for some it is emotionally devastating \u2014 and even Olympic gold medals can\u2019t protect you. I was shocked to learn that the swimmer Michael Phelps, who won 23 Olympic gold medals in his career, suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide after he retired.\n\nThe challenge of adjusting to post-Olympic life is something that I, like most Olympians, was poorly equipped to face. How do you deal with being a has-been at 21? On Sunday, after the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, many of the athletes will confront their own versions of this question. I hope sharing my experiences might provide some guidance about what to expect.\n\nAt first, I confess, retirement felt like a much-needed vacation. I loved being able to sleep in, not needing to coax my aching body into hours of training or to worry about carrying my own immense expectations, let alone those of my country. But after a few months, life felt flat. Without the ready-made purpose of training for the next season, I was lost. I missed the highs \u2014 and the lows \u2014 that made me feel alive when I was a competitive athlete.\n\nIt is also a strange feeling, after having thought of yourself for years as one of \u201cthe best in the world,\u201d to find that you are now behind many of your peers. Like many Olympians, I was home-schooled and received a subpar education. I didn\u2019t go to college until I was 26. I hadn\u2019t attended school since the seventh grade, and getting up to speed academically after all that time away was daunting. When I did my first summer internship I was 29; the other interns were a decade younger.\n\nThese challenges didn\u2019t always translate to emotional difficulties, but when they did, I often didn\u2019t know what to do about them. As athletes, we are taught to suck it up, to deny pain and fear, to push through debilitating injuries, to persevere through anxiety and depression.

His move was, he added, \u201ca dream come true.\u201d\n\nShortly after, Dawsari and his entourage had their pictures taken with the club\u2019s falcon, a seemingly astute piece of cultural sensitivity on the club\u2019s part, given the popularity of falconry in Saudi society.\n\nThe bird\u2019s handler, however, was a little confused. He and the falcon had come to the stadium for pest control, to catch rats. But he didn\u2019t let on.\n\nNobody wanted to ruin the moment.\n\nThe Deal\n\nIn October, the General Sports Authority, the government body that effectively runs sports in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi Arabian Football Federation announced that they were embarking on a soccer experiment. It was time to showcase the country\u2019s players, nearly all of whom play domestically, to the outside world. A heavily subsidized deal was signed with La Liga, opening the way for the country\u2019s best players to be lent to Spanish teams ahead of the World Cup.\n\nIt will not be Saudi Arabia\u2019s first World Cup finals. At the 1994 tournament in the United States, Saudi Arabia became the first Middle Eastern team to reach the knockout phase. Along the way, midfielder Saeed al-Owairan scored what is considered one of the finest solo goals in World Cup history.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia had not reached the finals since 2006, and in June it will play the opening game against host Russia at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. A repeat of the team\u2019s opening game of the 2002 World Cup, an 8-0 mauling by Germany, had to be avoided at all costs.\n\nThe Spanish arrangement is a rare foray for Saudi players outside the kingdom, where they enjoy high wages and big crowds in their domestic league. But it is not the first deal of its kind. Qatar, the 2022 World Cup host, has invested in a network of clubs across the Europe, and last year, the Chinese soccer federation signed a deal with its German counterpart to place its under-20 national team in the fourth tier of German soccer. (That venture ended after pro-Tibet protesters attended the first game and the Chinese team left the pitch, never to return.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo decide which Saudi players would be sent to Spain, La Liga invited scouts from Spain\u2019s top two leagues to attend two international friendlies involving Saudi players in October in Portugal. Sixteen of La Liga\u2019s 20 clubs sent scouts, although the two largest and best-followed teams in the Gulf, Barcelona and Real Madrid, did not. Later, another Spanish scouting team traveled to Riyadh to see the Saudi professional league in action.\n\nThe Spanish clubs would get the players free, and pay them only the league\u2019s mandated minimum wage. Saudi Arabia would pick up the tab for the rest of their salaries, as well as for the Spanish coaches who would later travel to Jeddah to help set up a soccer academy. There would be a commercial fee, too, unannounced but believed to be in the millions \u2014 rather than the whispered tens of million \u2014 of dollars, but no requirement compelling the Spanish clubs to play their Saudi players.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore important, according to Fernando Sanz, a former Real Madrid and M\u00e1laga player who oversees the Middle East and North Africa for La Liga, it was a chance for some of Spain\u2019s smaller clubs to make a name for themselves.\n\n\u201cFor clubs like Legan\u00e9s and Levante, who are not very popular around the world, they have a big opportunity to enter into a big market like Saudi,\u201d he said. Commercial deals with Saudi sponsors could follow, Sanz suggested.\n\nNot everyone was as happy as Sanz and La Liga. The Madrid-based sports newspaper Marca announced the Saudi deal on its front page with the headline, \u201cPetrodollars and La Liga.\u201d The Spanish players\u2019 union released a statement criticizing the arrangement for putting profit before talent.\n\n\u201cThese deals may become global and the spots on teams become auctioned in exchange for sponsorships,\u201d one union official said. \u201cWhat we should probably ask is: \u2018Would these players have come to Spain in the absence of a sponsorship agreement? Would the clubs have signed them?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Player\n\nTo Dawsari, it should not be unusual for a Saudi to play in Europe.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabian football is very good and Saudi players are very strong,\u201d he said, pointing out that the Saudis are playing in the World Cup for the fifth time. If a higher level of competition ahead of the World Cup sharpens the edges of his game, he said, that will be a plus. But, he added, \u201cI can play very well.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

I am representing Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nDawsari was chosen, according to Villarreal\u2019s chief executive, Fernando Roig Jr., primarily for what he brought to the team. The club is at a crucial stage in its season: It has reached the knockout stages of UEFA\u2019s Europa League and, at fifth place in La Liga, is pushing for Champions League qualification for next season.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is a deal to open markets,\u201d Roig said, acknowledging critics of the arrangement, \u201cbut we think he is a good player.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt that point, Dawsari had only been in the country for three days, and he was still finding his feet. The food was different, he said, but the club had made sure everything was halal. Once his introductory obligations were completed, he planned to go into the city and look for a suitable mosque for Friday prayers.\n\nDawsari wasn\u2019t sure whether he would be on the squad for the weekend\u2019s game against Real Betis in Seville, or the ones after that, but he was sure he was ready.\n\n\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said when asked whether he believed he would be picked. \u201cBut the decision is from the coach.\u201d\n\nThe Game\n\nWhen match day arrived in Seville, though, Dawsari was left off the squad. The social media reaction was ferocious.\n\nVirtually every Twitter post by Villarreal, Levante and Legan\u00e9s since the January transfers were announced has been inundated with tweets extolling the virtues of the teams\u2019 new Saudi players, or demanding that they play. When Dawsari did not, his fans rained criticism on the club.\n\nWhere\u2019s Salem?\n\nD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 Salem?\n\nNo Salem, no party.\n\nOther Saudi fans vowed to avoid the club until he played. When Villarreal lost, 2-1, thousands gleefully pointed to Dawsari\u2019s absence as the reason.\n\nMeanwhile, an hour\u2019s drive south, in Valencia, thousands of people had lined the streets outside Levante\u2019s stadium to await the arrival of Real Madrid. Levante is Valencia\u2019s second team, and in the midst of a forgettable season. It had gone two months without a win in the league. Few expected that would change against Real, or that Levante\u2019s new Saudi player, the lightning quick wing Fahad al-Muwallad, 23, could do anything to turn the tide.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf the reason to buy this player is a sporting reason and because he\u2019s a good player, then that is O.K.,\u201d said Jordi Palau, a 34-year-old Levante supporter.\n\nThe club had posted a video of the Levante team warmly welcoming Muwallad during the week, and tens of thousands of Saudis had responded positively online.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Palau\u2019s guarded approval was a moot point. Muwallad, who signed from the Saudi giants Al Ittihad, wasn\u2019t on Levante\u2019s squad, nor was the third Saudi, Yahya al-Shehri, at Legan\u00e9s. As they had with Villarreal, angry Saudis flocked to social media to threaten to abandon the Spanish club (at least online) if their countrymen were not picked.\n\nInstead, Muwallad watched a brilliant Levante comeback, and the crowd reveled in a late draw with Madrid. His debut would have to wait.\n\n\u201cFootball in Saudi Arabia is strong, it is a strong league,\u201d Muwallad said the next day. \u201cBut Spain is stronger and faster.\u201d\n\nHe was confident that soon enough, he and his countrymen would get the chance to show the league what they could do, and perhaps calm the Saudi fans back home.\n\n\u201cI will show them my skills, inshallah,\u201d he said, \u201cand I will make the fans very happy.\u201d", "title": "Saudi Stars Arrive in Spain, With One Eye on Russia", "authors": ["James Montague"]}

First, they look into what research and milk analysis have been done for the particular species. If there is no research, they look to animals that might have similar milk. The matches can be surprising, like using the composition of horse milk as a guide to create something for a baby rhinoceros. The two animals have similar digestive systems and lifestyles, according to the Gordon Rich.\n\nThe base of each Wombaroo formula is derived from cow\u2019s milk. But a custom mix of different nutrients, fats, proteins and sugars, like vegetable oil and whey protein, are then added to match as closely as possible with the mother\u2019s milk from each animal species. Among the more than two dozen ingredients in the kangaroo formula: biotin, choline, inositol, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, iodine and selenium.\n\nAmong the other organizations researching milk for exotic baby animals is the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, which has a milk repository with samples from 184 animals.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, the number of species that we know about their milk has probably gone up two or three times,\u201d said Michael L. Power, the scientist who heads up the repository. \u201cNot that long ago, we almost knew nothing about gorilla or orangutan milk.\u201d\n\nBesides building a better understanding of lactation across species, the repository also shares its research with zoos around the world that are hand-rearing young animals. Mr. Power is also tracking down more milk samples, especially from endangered species like pangolins and sloths.\n\nLaws against the trafficking of endangered species can complicate the legal export of an animal\u2019s milk samples. Transportation costs are also significant, with dry ice required so the milk doesn\u2019t spoil.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just put a sample of milk in a bottle and put it in your pocket and get on an airplane,\u201d Mr. Power said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWombaroo has its own exporting problems. Its formulas are considered dairy products, and the company says it has been too costly to comply with local regulations to ship its formulas to zoos in Europe and the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nObtaining the milk samples in the first place can also be a challenge.\n\nSince 2003, Garry Osthoff, a professor at the University of the Free State in South Africa, has gathered milk samples from animals including gorillas, lions and springbok. Often this happens when the animal is tranquilized.\n\nFor an elephant, keepers had to trick a nursing mother into letting them stimulate one of her teats. Professor Osthoff described the milk flow as \u201clike a shower\u201d rather than the linear stream from a cow\u2019s teat.\n\nAs human activity continues to put pressure on animal habitats around the world, more species are likely to have to be hand-reared in zoos, Professor Osthoff said, making it an imperative to learn more about the milk of endangered species.\n\nAt the Adelaide Zoo in Australia, which shares a research lab with Wombaroo, Ian Smith, a senior veterinarian, was in and out of urgent meetings in late January. A giraffe had given birth a day earlier at Monarto Zoo, the Adelaide Zoo\u2019s open-range counterpart about 43 miles outside the city.\n\nThe baby was not feeding, and caregivers had \u201cobserved negative interactions\u201d with its mother, Mr. Smith said. \u201cThe mum was pushing her away, avoiding it, nudging it away with its head.\u201d\n\nIf the situation did not improve within hours, caregivers would isolate the animal and begin a feeding program, starting with colostrum, an ultranutritious substance that mammals produce for a few days after birth to build a baby\u2019s immune system. It could take nine months and about 550 gallons of milk mix before the giraffe is weaned.\n\nWombaroo had its colostrum product and giraffe formula ready to go. \u201cYou have this opportunity to improve its immune system,\u201d said Gordon Rich. \u201cIn a couple of days, it goes downhill and you\u2019ve lost that opportunity.\u201d", "title": "Saving Koalas, and Other Marsupials, With Milk Almost as Good as Mom\u2019s", "authors": ["Serena Solomon"]}

When she and her friends poured out of the school, they grabbed cellphones from strangers and broke the news to their parents. Brooke\u2019s mother found her shaken near their subdivision.\n\nThat day, Brooke and two friends had sat at her house and feverishly tried to confirm which of their friends was safe. They sent group text messages asking who was missing and who had been found. They posted photos on social media.

They wonder if their classrooms are properly equipped, if they would recognize the signs of a dangerous student, and most of all, if they are prepared to jump in front of a bullet.\n\nIn the last few days, teachers wrote to Congress, urging bans on assault weapons, and to state lawmakers, seeking permission to carry firearms to school. They attended local protests and reviewed safety plans with students.

So let\u2019s peg guns to cars. Gun owners must take a class before owning a gun. Guns must be licensed and registered annually. Guns must be insured and proof of insurance must be kept with the owner. You can\u2019t drive a dragster on the street so you can\u2019t have a high capacity gun. There is no absolute right to drive a car provided in our constitution and there is no absolute right to own a gun. Guns are not \u201cwell regulated,\u201d so let\u2019s regulate them.\n\nJocelyn Savard from N.C. answered the prompt with a personal perspective:\n\nIn Boston, there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness. One reads \u201cAmericans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook\u201d and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed.

Of course, my heart plummeted and I could feel humanity\u2019s downfall one step closer but there was no tears, at church this weekend there was no announcement, no prayer. As a country, we have normalized school shootings so much, made books and movies out of them, make offhand comments about how that guy \u2018looks like a school shooter\u2019, that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our home.\n\nMaggie Yang from King of Prussia, Pa., thinks the nation has become numb to school shootings:\n\nI was in a school club after school just the other day when my phone buzzed. I had gotten a News notification about the Kentucky school shooting. I was so shocked about it that I shared the news with other people in the club. I was expecting a reaction similar to mine, but I was so wrong. They simply looked at me and said \u201cso?\u201d I was feeling a confusing mix of emotions: sadness, anger, disgust. The world is becoming more and more \u201cnumb\u201d to school shootings which deeply saddens me. I think that it\u2019s because 1) it happens so often now, and 2) it doesn\u2019t affect those outside of the area.\n\nNathanie Doralus from Florida says schools can do more:\n\nAs a student, I agree that we\u2019ve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States. My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus. It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence. In some ways, I think it\u2019s an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to. But in other ways, I think some won\u2019t take it seriously until it hits close to home. If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before, then there wouldn\u2019t have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year. Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously. I think that is just an example of denial and how it\u2019s hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know. Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills. They can also invest in the mental health and well-being of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violence.\n\nDenislav Kasaivanov from Wilmington, N.C., thinks counseling is part of the answer:\n\nI feel as if our society as a whole has become a bit \u2018numb\u2019 concerning this subject since it has become all too common ever since the Columbine shootings have taken place. The stigma associated with school shootings has become now an option to many misguided and mentally unstable teenagers who want their names in the headlines \u2014 whether it to be for them to desperately seek attention (good or bad). I believe that the remedy for this situation is to provide effective counseling for kids whom exhibit mentally unstable qualities and to always have an emergency-responding force on campus at all times. In addition, I believe that the state should mandate stricter rules around families which own guns; Whilst I still believe that any family has the right to protect themselves with a firearm, it is up to the parental figures to make sure that their children are kept away by all means necessary from any firearms in the house. Schools, families, and first-responders all have a key role in preventing situations like these from occurring; and, if the state could imply far more effective rules concerning entrance on campus, counseling, and school emergency drills, I believe that we could see a substantial drop in school shootings across the nation.\n\nFred Pierre from Ohio believes we should model peaceful solutions:\n\nOur warrior society glorifies guns and assault rifles in nearly every TV show and movie, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that we place the constitutional right to own these weapons above the right to life, enshrined in our Declaration of Independence. We spend more on our military than any other country, quite a bit more. Taxpayers fund promotions for violent, video war games, as a military recruiting tool. Then we act surprised when someone \u201csettles a score\u201d using firearms. We don\u2019t act like we want to de-escalate conflicts, talk about problems, or reach out to someone who is hurting. We model a Wild West approach to problems \u2014 take ten paces and fire. Could we model a peaceful resolution? Heroes that use wisdom and conversation to connect and resolve issues? A better world is possible.\n\nKylie Lundy from Wilmington, N.C., wrote about a school lockdown:\n\nOver the years, I have participated in a multitude of active shooting drills. The typical procedures are the classroom lights are turned off, classroom doors are locked, and children are rushed to a side of the classroom that would be difficult for an intruder to spot through a window. They have to remain quiet until the entire school has \u2018passed\u2019 the drill. However, one I remember in particular was when my school was shut down for about an hour. The school did not announce if it was a drill so we had to assume there was indeed a threat. I was in the seventh grade. I remember turning down my brightness on my phone and checking to make sure my ringer was off so I could text my parents and closest friends that I loved them very much (just in case). However, I had an escape plan if I needed to evacuate or the shooter were to enter my classroom. My plan was to either jump out the window onto the ground outside or rush to the other door in the back of the room. I was terrified, but I knew I had to remain calm. Eventually, the school announced the lockdown was over, and I later discovered that there was a robbery at a bank near our school. Ultimately, I was relieved.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nPredictably, students had a lot to say about this latest internet sensation.\n\nAbby Tank from Wilmington, N.C., was ashamed of her generation\u2019s association with the challenge:\n\nTide pods. Who would have thought that teens would start a trend of ingesting chemicals we use for cleaning our laundry? It\u2019s definitely a sad time in our lives when we have to lock up and monitor teens to make sure they don\u2019t willingly consume deadly chemicals. There have been so many challenges over the years: the ice bucket challenge, the mannequin challenge, the straight arm challenge, the floor is lava, the silly salmon, etc., but this is pushing it way to far. It\u2019s one thing to raise awareness for ALS or embarrass a friend in public, but eating Tide pods is just plain stupid. It may start out as a joke, but the consequences of eating Tide pods, also referred to as \u201cthe forbidden fruit,\u201d is not a joking matter. Dying due to chemical ingestion all in seek of approval and attention is an absolutely terrible way to die. It\u2019s a pity our generation has to be associated with theses ignorant and foolish challenges.\n\nMeghan Miraglia from Massachusetts suggests the reason people join these trends is to have their 15 minutes of fame:\n\nWhen I first heard about the Tide pod challenge, it took every tendon, muscle, and piece of sinew in my body to stop myself from looking up at the sky, throwing my palms up in disgust, and asking the clouds what in the world has happened to humanity, for us to have been brought to a place where we look at pods of detergent and think it\u2019s a brilliant idea to eat them. The internet finds imbecilic activities to do, then challenges other people to do it with them, then watches videos of other people doing the challenge and chortles at clip after clip of so-and-so shoving a spoonful of cinnamon down their throat, or stuffing seven saltines into their gullet without any water, or sprinkling salt on their wrist and rubbing ice on it. We find dumb things to do because it gives us a few precious seconds of fame. For an instant, we become another \u201cchallenge video\u201d on the explore page, or the suggested sidebar on YouTube, and the possibility of being Discovered and Liked and Commented On bursts before us like a packet of detergent being bitten open. Then there is the other half of the population that doesn\u2019t think at all, whose brain cells have very likely been replaced by bits of cinnamon and saltine from the previous (and equally stupid) challenges they have done. These are the ones who take it too far. These are the kids that went to your elementary school and jumped off of the monkey bars for the sake of Looking Cool and ended up with two broken arms and a chipped tooth.\n\nMaggie Yang from King of Prussia believes teenagers are searching for a sense of belonging:\n\nThe Tide pod challenge is one of the most seemingly innocent yet extremely dangerous challenges circling the internet. Teenagers are attracted to these trends because they want to have a sense a belonging. They want to be able to relate to people they look up to on social media by replicating their actions. Even though most people know that this can be dangerous, the sense of belonging skews their judgment for the worse.\n\nJillian Lancaster from Wilmington, N.C., thinks some people will do anything for amusement:\n\nLook, this shouldn\u2019t be such a surprise to everyone. Every year there\u2019s some new dangerous challenge that captures the attention of teenagers across the globe. The reason being, we find the discomfort of others funny. Why do you think that \u201cfail compilations\u201d on YouTube have so many views, or why the reality show \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\u201d consists mostly of people falling and/or getting hit with something? It\u2019s what the people want, so the internet provides. While this Tide pod Challenge makes me question the sanity of humanity slightly more than challenges in previous years, it\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s such a ridiculous idea \u2014 I mean, who eats laundry detergent? \u2014 that people find it intriguing to watch. However, this challenge has gained much more exposure than your average dangerous fad because the Tide pod challenge turned into a meme. Even those who haven\u2019t tried to eat Tide pods are posting about it. Like the article said, many of these memes are about putting Tide Pods on food. I\u2019ve seen a real life example of this when a local donut shop in my town created a donut that resembled a Tide pod. Things like making a Tide pod shaped donut aren\u2019t meant to be harmful and further spread the challenge, but they inevitably end up doing so. The only way to stop this fad is to stop posting about it because once teens see something has gone out of vogue, they no longer want to do the challenge.\n\nBut, Alexis Lariviere from Hoggard High School says this latest trend is no laughing matter:\n\nSocial media seems to promote new challenges almost weekly. The latest obsession is eating a tide pod because it looks like candy and the liquid explodes into your mouth. Let me tell you what else explodes\u2026 the pain shooting through your body as these pods burn your throat and mouth. Is it worth it to risk your life for social media views? Last year, 10,570 children under five years old were said to have had exposure to laundry detergent packets. These children see these colorful pods as \u201ccandy\u201d or a treat. While young children don\u2019t know any better, it is just sad that young adults are stupid enough to eat something that could kill them. Before you consider eating a Tide pod, think about the 40 hospital cases that have occurred this year just in January alone because of teens willingly eating them. Many social media sites are banning videos of people eating these pods and I support it all the way.\n\nRobert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the fad is overblown, but brings up an important conversation:\n\nWhile I admit that I\u2019m the first to ridicule every facet of our society that I believe to convey how much the intelligence gap is growing, the \u201cTide pod challenge\u201d is something that I can\u2019t completely dismantle in good heart. I\u2019ve heard more adults ask me why kids are eating Tide pods than I\u2019ve heard teens talking about it themselves, which is a sure way to know that it\u2019s being blown way out of proportion. I have faith that no one actually believes they can consume laundry detergent and be absolutely fine, and those that do probably can\u2019t reach the shelf any Tide pods would be stored on. The Tide pod challenge is reminiscent of the bleach drinking challenge, in that no one with half of a brain would ever consider partaking in the challenge, however the idea of both play into the suicide culture unfortunately found in many modern teenagers. Not only does this undermine the danger of depression and anxiety, it can also encourage impressionable young teens to possibly have thoughts of suicide as well. So while I won\u2019t scrutinize the Tide pod challenge, I do strongly believe that these dangerous challenges can be potentially harmful to the mental health of susceptible young people\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the spirit of Super Bowl weekend, we asked students, \u201cAre You a Football Fan?\u201d\n\nJosh Failla from Wilmington, N.C., is and he is looking forward to this year\u2019s matchup:\n\nFootball has always had a special place in my heart. It is a ritual that me and my dad do every Sunday. When one o\u2019clock hits, we sit watching the TV religiously until the games are over. It is something that I love to do, and that includes watching the Super Bowl in a couple weeks. While I don\u2019t agree with the football aspect being out of the spotlight this season, this will not stop me from watching the big game. I am most excited to see in this game if Nick Foles can pull off beating the goat, Tom Brady. Coming in for one of the best quarterbacks in the league (Wentz), Foles has been able to beat expectations and rise above some of the best defenses in the N.F.L. Even the article believes that Foles is blowing up, \u201cAbsolutely everything is going Nick Foles way. Philadelphia\u2019s backup quarterback has looked like a superstar.\u201d Even though I believe the Eagles don\u2019t have enough to beat the dynastic Patriots, I feel like the game will be one for the ages.\n\nYadriel Matos from Apopka also loves the game, but acknowledged its controversies:\n\nBoth of these games were very exciting and very action-packed. Both teams had to overcome insurmountable odds to get to the point where they are at right now. Whether it is losing your top receiver in the middle of the game or losing your rookie quarterback midway through the season, getting to the Super Bowl is very hard. Of course, I am going to watch the Super Bowl because it will a game for the ages. I have been watching the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles throughout the season because they have two of the top offenses in the league.\n\nKate Silver from Wilmington, N.C., however, had this to say about the sport:\n\nWarning: Unpopular Opinion. Football is the most overrated sport ever. I\u2019m a sports fan. I love to watch basketball and follow tennis matches, but you couldn\u2019t pay me a million bucks to sit down and watch a whole football game. I can\u2019t stand the sport. It is outdated, barbaric, and down right deadly. It amazes me how despite how far humans have evolved within the last millennia, men still injure each other in front of thousands as a form of entertainment. Football is no better than a gladiator tournament or the running of the bulls. It\u2019s a fight to the death. This year\u2019s Super Bowl will be no different than the other 51 before it. Overpaid jocks will rush around a field carrying an inflated piece of leather as if it were their own child. Cult like fans will be glued to their TVs, clinging on to every play like their life depends on it. And me? I\u2019ll be in my room hiding from the madness. Believe me, I won\u2019t be anywhere near the TV during the big game... except for maybe Justin Timberlake\u2019s halftime performance.\n\nMichael DiCenzo from NC is ready to see the Patriots go down in history on Sunday:\n\nI have grown up watching my idol Tom Brady. I\u2019ve been watching since the beginning of his career with my dad. I was born the first year of the dynasty of TB 12 and Bill Belichick. I have sadly never been to an NFL game, I want to see him play before he retires. Watching Tom on TV go through so many offensive players and still continue to reign the GOAT is incredible. I wish people would stop hating on him. Tom is gonna win and lead the organization to his 6th ring. The Patriots are like the Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan. Everyone wants to see them finally get taken down. Never count the miracle Brady out. The Patriots have always been a great second half team. I am really excited we have made it again after the tough win against the Jaguars. The Eagles are next.\n\nKasey Kiser from Wilmington, N.C., replied enthusiastically:\n\nBeing a Patriots fan is brutal for 51 weeks of the year. Even in the offseason, I receive countless remarks, mainly on how the Patriots cheated to win their games. However, Super Bowl Sunday and the following week can bring me the most joy an NFL fan can have. Not only can I relish in the victory of a Super Bowl, but my joy is impenetrable by any rude retorts. It\u2019s a win-win-win. Plus, this year is extra special, as Tom Brady can have as many Super Bowl titles as any other NFL franchise. Additionally, if he wasn\u2019t already, he will be the GOAT in football and maybe even in professional sports. Every year I watch the Super Bowl, because, in general, it\u2019s good football. But when the Patriots are on the big stage, I will not be removed from the couch. So, this year, don\u2019t contact me from kickoff to the awards ceremony, and we\u2019ll be on good terms. Good luck to the Eagles, but be ready for a beatdown.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Picture Prompt \u201cHeadphones,\" yielded a wide range of perspectives on what the image is meant to convey.\n\nIsabelle Silva from Massachusetts thought about escapism:\n\nBlindfolded and a duct taped mouth, this man is oblivious to the world around him. Some people may see that he is closed off to life outside the humming sounds of the red headphones.They could feel that the headphones are shutting him up and shutting him out. With blocked senses, he has lost his ability to express himself. However, though I can recognize this counterpoint, I believe that the headphones are actually opening him up to new experiences and new feelings he may never had gone through without them. Everything except the headphones in this image is in black and white revealing how monotonous and plain life can end up being without the pop of color. His cookie-cutter hairstyle and a clean-cut suit represent the boxes that society tends to put us in. As well, the blindfold and his mouth being taped shut adds to the ways life is restricting him from having a voice and truly seeing. With the headphones however, this man is being brought to life with varied colors, emotions and flourishing in a whole different world outside reality. In my personal experience, headphones, and further music, has become my escape from reality. Though my reality is oftentimes amazing (which I am grateful for), it can be difficult and hard to deal with. Listening to music enables me to reflect as well as enjoy solidarity. This piece of art represents a feeling to me; a feeling of being trapped but then being able to let go and experience color through a different lens (music).\n\nHal Warren from Massachusetts examined the facts:\n\nWhen first examining this image, I wanted to not think solely about the symbolism. I wanted to examine the facts about the picture itself. One may think at first glance that these are regular headphones, meaning he might be listening to something. I noticed quite quickly that these are noise cancellation headphones. This means he can\u2019t speak, see or hear. It can also be observed that he is dressed like a businessman, someone with power. After observing I then started to think about what it could be a symbol for. I believe the meaning behind this is that this man could represent the managers behind all the powerful men being accused of sexual misconduct as of late. The higher ups had to know something, yet they allowed their clients to walk free. This would mean they chose not to see anything, hear anything or say anything. Though that theory is very specific, I also feel that it could be more general. There are so many powerful people who see bad things happen and choose to keep quiet about it due to fear of losing their power. When I went to read the article, the first paragraph opened my eyes. I knew of the Presidents many twitter scandals and I often wondered why he wasn\u2019t banned from the social media. When initially thinking about the pictures meaning, this completely slipped my mind though makes so much sense. The use of the word \u201ccomplicit\u201d is perfect and is completely in line with my thoughts regarding the picture.\n\nCollin MacRae from Massachusets thinks it important that people think for themselves:\n\nPersonally, I believe that the image is trying to convey the idea that with all of the new forms of media and all that is going on in politics right now, people are losing the ability to form their own opinions, the just listen to what other people say and do not think for themselves or craft an original idea. The fact that the man in the image only has headphones on and his mouth and eyes are covered suggests that all he does is passively listen to the ideas others try to force upon them and do not look at the situation themselves and try to speak their mind. I think that this rings true especially nowadays because with the news stations, political magazines and other forms of media trying to force their opinion into the minds of their audience, the audience members have begun to stop thinking about the situation themselves and just take in what other people have to say about the issue. This is very relevant because whenever people try to argue about a topic especially in politics it just seems like everybody is regurgitating the same point made by some news anchor or political analysts and nobody has their own personal view on the situation. I think that it is very important that people begin to think for themselves again because without the ability to create an idea for themselves society is going to drift into a mind numbing state were nobody is even able to think for themself any more and there will be no variety in peoples opinions.\n\nIshan Patel from Wilmington, N.C., found a political meaning:\n\nThe image in the prompt shows a person who is blindfolded and duck taped on mouth, that could symbolize many things but I personally thought it represents something like rumors that are shared because you hear a rumor, but you haven\u2019t seen what the rumor is or even discuss with the person to who the rumor relates to. As I examine the picture the picture more I seem to realize that the person was wearing a headphone not only that but it was red while the other part of the picture was black and white, red could represent our country\u2019s government because it is republican which is red. So, I thought that the picture here relates to our current government and the steps that they are taking. The image could represent that the people who fail to recognize the perspective of the government or are not able to talk about it.\n\nTyler Rouse from Wilmington N.C., hopes for a better way for teens to find their voices:\n\nMy first thought was how many teenagers and kids use headphones constantly and are cut off from society. They don\u2019t have a voice in today\u2019s politics or opinions. I disagree with this completely. I love to listen to headphones to calm myself down or jam out in the car. I think I notice more and I am more attentive with headphones, especially in the car while listening to music. It\u2019s great to notice where I am and what\u2019s going on outside. I think that the tape over the eyes and mouth are symbols for how teenagers don\u2019t have a big of an impact on society as adults do. Unfortunately, I believe that this is true. Let me explain. There aren\u2019t many platforms or places for teens to discuss situations or problems in the real world with adults or politicians. Adults either won\u2019t listen or think their own ideas or better. You could argue that there are social media platforms that teens can access. Many adults and politicians aren\u2019t able to see the comments that are made by teens because teens don\u2019t have many followers or social media sites don\u2019t show their comments. I think there should be a better way for teens to put their voice out into the world and not be blindfolded by adults. This is one reason I enjoy commenting in The New York Times because I know that adults and teens alike are able to access my comments.\n\nMcKenzie Ingram from Wilmington, N.C., says complaints often go unnoticed:\n\nThe first thing that I thought of when I saw this image was that sometimes we are forced to take orders or listen to something that we aren\u2019t allowed to speak up about. We are sometimes forced to receive information and there\u2019s nothing that we can do about it. We hear these things and we can\u2019t see them for what they truly are, and we can\u2019t voice our opinions on them. I find that this relates to changes that are being made today in the world politically. The people of our nation most of the time are forced to sit and listen to what our president wants to happen. We can try and reach out discussing our complaints but sometimes they go unnoticed. We are forced to sit and listen to the new laws of our land, without being able to say anything to stop it and without being able to see the long term effects.\n\nAnd Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts said headphones are a buffer:\n\nWelcome to America \u2014 home of the blind eye and the closed mouth, home of the perpetually open ears, perfectly coifed hair, and pressed suits. Land of the tainted minds and unoriginal thoughts, where, somehow, everyone hears everything but says nothing. We absorb. We immerse. We are always taking in, even if we are not aware of it. The headphones are a double-sided metaphor. They are America\u2019s security blanket \u2014 we can choose what we hear, and we can make it agree with the little voice in our head, and that can be all that we hear if we want it to be. They are the buffer between the real world, where things aren\u2019t as perfect and poised as we\u2019d like them to be, where opinions aren\u2019t in perfect correlation with ours, where there are voices other than the one that we feed our minds with. Or, they are world itself. They are all we ever hear, they are all we ever absorb, they are all we have ever or will ever know, and we let them speak for us. The headphones become our voices, and soon they become louder than the inkling of conscience inside of us. I\u2019d like to say that I can\u2019t relate, that I refuse to let the roaring wildfire of the world overcome the spark in me, but I suppose in some ways, I can relate. I let the voice of everyone else, the roar of television and the scream of media overtake me, until sometimes, I find myself tainted and unoriginal. But, I suppose in many ways, every teenager, every adult, every American, feels that way at some point.\n\n_________", "title": "School Shootings, Super Bowl, the Tide Pod Challenge: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "A researcher seeking instruction in the sophisticated use of such techniques may want to consult OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT: An Introduction to Causal Inference (Harvard University, $35), by the statistician Paul R. Rosenbaum. The methodology of statistical significance, along with that of randomized experimentation, was developed by the statistician R. A. Fisher in the 1920s and \u201930s. Fisher was aware that statistical significance was not a measure of the likelihood that, say, a certain drug was effective, given the data. He knew it revealed the likelihood of the data, assuming the null hypothesis that there was no treatment effect from the drug. But as Rosenbaum\u2019s book demonstrates, this was by no means an admission of inadequacy. Fisher\u2019s aim was to show, through proper experimental design and analysis, how the investigation of the null hypothesis speaks \u201cdirectly and plainly\u201d to a question we want to answer: Namely, is there good evidence that the drug had any treatment effect? That many researchers are careless with this technique is not the fault of the methodology.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(This is Diaconis and Skyrms\u2019s sixth \u201cgreat idea\u201d about chance.) Bayesian statistics purports to show how to rationally update your beliefs over time, in the face of new evidence. It does so by mathematically unifying three factors: your initial confidence in your hypothesis (\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this coin is weighted\u201d); your confidence in the accuracy of the data, given your hypothesis (\u201cI\u2019d fully expect to see a weighted coin come up heads five times in a row\u201d); and your confidence in the accuracy of the data, setting aside your hypothesis (\u201cI\u2019d be quite surprised, but not shocked, to see a fair coin come up heads five times in a row\u201d). In this way, Diaconis and Skyrms argue, the Bayesian approach reckons with the \u201ctotality of evidence,\u201d and thus offers researchers valuable guidance as they address the replication crisis.\n\nThough psychological and biomedical research have received the most attention, neuroscientific experiments involving brain-scanning machines have also been criticized for generating hard-to-reproduce results. For the psychologist Jerome Kagan, brain-scanning technology holds out the exciting prospect of learning the relationship between brain states and mental phenomena. But as he notes in FIVE CONSTRAINTS ON PREDICTING BEHAVIOR (M.I.T., $30), most of the psychological conclusions drawn from brain-scanning data are \u201ctentative\u201d and others \u201care simply wrong.\u201d The reason for this, he argues, is a group of five obstacles, often overlooked, that prevent making \u201cconfident inferences\u201d from what our brains are doing to what our minds are doing.\n\nOne obstacle is the potentially disruptive effect of the laboratory context. A research subject lying horizontal in the tight confines of a brain-scanning machine is \u201cin an unusual psychological and bodily state.\u201d This can influence what is going on in the brain. Feeling hemmed in, mindful of being evaluated, asked to hold physically still, the subject may exhibit a brain reaction in response to an image of a deadly snake that is different than he would have, had he seen a deadly snake in the course of a pleasant mountain hike. Or consider the distorting effect of expectation. Kagan notes that unexpected events activate \u201cmany brain sites.\u201d Police detectives studying a gruesome crime scene may experience fear or disgust, but they are seldom startled by what they see. On the other hand, volunteers for an fMRI study may not \u201cexpect the examiner to show them pictures of violence, sex, blood or diseased bodies.\u201d If those pictures, say, activate the amygdala, how do we know we are detecting fear or disgust as opposed to surprise?\n\nPerhaps the most difficult challenge Kagan describes is the mismatching of the respective concepts and terminologies of brain science and psychology. Because neuroscientists lack a \u201crich biological vocabulary\u201d for the variety of brain states, they can be tempted to borrow correlates from psychology before they have shown there is in fact a correlation. On the psychology side, many concepts can be faddish or otherwise short-lived, which should make you skeptical that today\u2019s psychological terms will \u201cmap neatly\u201d onto information about the brain. If fMRI machines had been available a century ago, Kagan points out, we would have been searching for the neurological basis of Pavlov\u2019s \u201cfreedom reflex\u201d or Freud\u2019s \u201coral stage\u201d of development, no doubt in vain. Why should we be any more confident that today\u2019s psychological concepts will prove any better at cutting nature at the joints?", "title": "Science\u2019s Inference Problem: When Data Doesn\u2019t Mean What We Think It Does", "authors": ["James Ryerson", "Ivory Tower"]}

For decades, the government\u2019s war with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a guerrilla army known as FARC, made this a risky place to visit.\n\nAfter the Colombian military established a stronger presence in the area about 12 years ago, a trickle of tourists began arriving. With Colombia\u2019s civil conflict winding down \u2014 a peace accord was signed in 2016 \u2014 the trickle became a flood.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore than 15,000 tourists visited the rainbow river last year, and Ms. D\u00edaz is one of more than 130 local guides. On busy days, hundreds of tourists disperse among seven designated sites managed by Cormacarena, a regional government agency focused on sustainable development. Several of the sites, including Ca\u00f1o Cristales, are part of Sierra de La Macarena National Park.\n\nIn 2009, Hupecol, a Colombian subsidiary of the Dan A. Hughes Company of Beeville, Tex., began seismic studies to look for oil on land it had leased near the small town of San Vicente del Cagu\u00e1n, west of here.\n\nThe Colombian government revoked the lease in 2016, and President Juan Manuel Santos wrote on Twitter that the decision would protect Ca\u00f1o Cristales and the surrounding area.\n\nThe revocation was popular in La Macarena, where Mayor Ismael Medellin Due\u00f1as, whose desk sits beneath a painting of Ca\u00f1o Cristales, said residents are very concerned about possible environmental impacts of oil development. The region\u2019s economic future rests on dairy farming and ecotourism, he said.\n\nPosters and murals against oil drilling emblazon the walls and windows of the town. \u201cOnce it was a FARC war,\u201d said Miguel Ortiz, an English teacher and interpreter who has lived here for 13 years. \u201cNow it\u2019s the fracking war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScientists are trying to learn more about the diverse and unique environment, where jaguars and margays roam the savannah and jungles, and river dolphins swim in the Guayabero River.\n\nCarlos Lasso, a senior investigator at the Humboldt Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to studying Colombia\u2019s biodiversity, has co-authored a 180-page guide to the fauna of Ca\u00f1o Cristales, part of a four-year regional study.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn late January, he led a two-week expedition in large dugout canoes to survey the Duda, Guayabero and Losada rivers. The team identified more than 50 species of aquatic birds, four species of aquatic snakes, and more than 150 species of fish, including three that may be new to science.\n\nThey also found Orinoco crocodiles, a critically endangered species that can grow to seven meters in length.\n\nThe humble M. clavigera plays a key role, not least because it attracts the tourists that drive the economy. The plant is endemic to the clear, acidic, nutrient-poor waters rivers flowing from the Serrania de la Macarena, an isolated mountain range east of the Andes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To start, she said, Hupecol\u2019s oil lease was far from Ca\u00f1o Cristales.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no possibility of any impact, because it\u2019s 68 kilometers away,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. (That\u2019s about 42 miles.) Further, she said, the company had no interest in fracking, as some feared, only in conventional oil drilling.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez described the decision to revoke Hupecol\u2019s permit as political, an opportunity for government officials to burnish their environmental credentials by protecting a popular tourist site.\n\nMs. Rodr\u00edguez said the seismic studies were promising, and Hupecol had hoped to drill an exploratory well. The company is seeking $21 million in damages in a court case against the government.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut now there is a new complication. A group of FARC dissidents, who did not disarm in the recent peace deal, is active in the area. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to drill a well in that area if the licenses comes back to us,\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said, citing the instability.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJavier Francisco Parra, the regional coordinator at Cormacarena, acknowledged that the Hupecol lease is not very close to Ca\u00f1o Cristales, but said it is hard to know whether it would pose a direct threat to the river.\n\nAnd oil drilling is incompatible with a regional management plan Cormacarena developed with the input of local residents, he said.\n\nMr. Parra sees another emerging threat: In recent years, there have been dry periods during the rainy season, and rain during the dry season.\n\nDr. Lasso said there is no long-term water flow data for Ca\u00f1o Cristales, but agreed that things appear to be changing. The river is closed to tourists during the dry season, and over the past decade, he said, the season has seemed to arrive earlier each year.\n\nThe timing could be part of a natural cycle, Dr. Lasso said, or related to local forest clearing. But it could also be linked to broader patterns of climate change.\n\nBack on Ca\u00f1o Piedras, Ms. Diaz, who works as a firefighter during the off-season, stood on the ancient rocks between M. clavigera and an oil seep, and said she is looking forward to May. The tourists will return, and the rivers will again run red.\n\nAnd Ms. D\u00edaz was clear about where she and her co-workers stand on the local controversy. \u201cThe guides,\u201d she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t want the oil drilling.\u201d", "title": "Scientists Fear for Colombia\u2019s \u2018Melted Rainbow\u2019", "authors": ["Murray Carpenter"]}

Because it\u2019s certainly not the only sexual abuse scandal that has unfolded under Blackmun\u2019s watch.\n\nTo his credit, Blackmun spearheaded the efforts to create the Denver-based U.S. Center for SafeSport, a national nonprofit organization providing education and resources, including a hotline, to promote respect and prevent abuse in sport. It took seven years.\n\nOther sports, like swimming, taekwondo and judo, have had major abuse problems, and Blackmun was introduced to some of them soon after he took over as chief executive in 2010. Right away, he should have recognized that the U.S.O.C. needed to oversee the federations with a sharper eye and make it a priority to address abuse. He should have seen that it was the U.S.O.C.\u2019s duty to keep all athletes safe.\n\nIn 2010, three months after Blackmun was hired, U.S.A. Swimming came under fire for mishandling dozens of sexual abuse cases. That year, the swimming organization set up a program to investigate sexual abuse accusations within its own sport. But letting a federation investigate itself is never a good idea, and the abuse continued.\n\nIn 2016, U.S.A. Taekwondo told the U.S.O.C. that it had been investigating sexual assault accusations involving two of its biggest Olympic stars.

He\u2019s living with a brain tumor right now.\n\nSo in the fall of 2014, when Hamilton reached out to Jim Bell, NBC\u2019s president of Olympics production and programming, to find out if he would be working on Skate America that October, Bell called him back to break the news. NBC valued him and adored him, Hamilton recalled Bell saying, and the network appreciated all his years at the top. But it was time for a change.\n\n\u201cThere was a sadness for about 10 minutes,\u201d Hamilton said last week at the Olympic figure skating arena. \u201cI lamented it being over. I thought, \u2018Oh, man, that was such a beautiful part of my life and now it\u2019s over.\u2019 But change happens to everyone \u2014 even me.\u201d\n\nHamilton gets it. Something like this happens to even the best of us \u2014 eventually \u2014 right? Corporate America decided that his shelf life had expired. There was nothing he could do about it.\n\nBesides, after he had spent so many years just trying to stay healthy \u2014 and alive \u2014 how could being replaced by the next big thing really matter? In his heart, Hamilton knew it did not. He would bounce back, almost out of habit.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI calculated once how many times I fell during my skating career \u2014 41,600 times,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the funny thing: I got up 41,600 times. That\u2019s the muscle you have to build in your psyche \u2014 the one that reminds you to just get up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLooking ahead, Hamilton knew there was so much more to worry about and, in the end, so much he decided not to worry about.\n\nAfter overcoming testicular cancer in 1997, he learned that he had a pituitary tumor in 2004, one that had wrapped itself around his optic nerve. The tumor was benign, but it threatened to grow in ways that dangerously crowded his brain.\n\nHamilton said he had prayed about 12 times a day for it to go away. Doctors treated him with radiation, and the tumor did go away.\n\nIn 2010, it reappeared. Surgery caused an aneurysm that temporarily blinded him in one eye.\n\nHamilton said he would never forget what his wife, Tracie, said to him during a pep talk: \u201cJoy is not the lack of suffering or fear, it\u2019s how you choose to handle the suffering and fear.\u201d It finally hit him that it was true.\n\nSo when the tumor returned for an encore in 2016, Hamilton decided to react differently. There was no \u201cwhy me?\u201d anymore.\n\n\u201cI figured I needed to go through this with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was just a muscle I needed to build, like the muscles I built skating.\u201d\n\nWhen one of his four children asked about the tumor, Hamilton said: \u201cYep, it\u2019s back. It\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s really fine.\u201d\n\nFine \u2014 but also time to fight back in a new way. There was no chance to undergo radiation treatment again. It would only have fried his brain, he said. The tumor was still relatively small, so Hamilton didn\u2019t need to rush into surgery. He tried to tackle the problem differently: He stopped eating sugar, red meat and other things he considered bad for his body. He started eating organic food and drinking only coffee or water with high pH. He hit the treadmill and the weight room.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Hamilton went back to the doctor several months later, he learned that his tumor hadn\u2019t grown. During his next checkup, he heard even better news.\n\nThe tumor had shrunk, by about half. Hamilton choked up when describing what happened next.\n\n\u201cHave you ever had one shrink without treatment before?\u201d he said he asked the doctor. \u201cAnd the doctor said, \u2018Nope, never.\u2019\u201d\n\nHamilton asked, \u201cSo how can you explain this?\u201d\n\nThe doctor said, \u201cGod.\u201d\n\nIt floored him. He was in the process of losing three friends to colon cancer, yet he, somehow, someway, was given this miracle?

There\u2019s something that I need to be doing. I just have to figure out what that is.\u201d\n\nDuring the figure skating events last week, Hamilton stood on a riser just above Lipinski, Weir and Terry Gannon, the third member of the main broadcasting team. Hamilton couldn\u2019t miss them when the lights came on and they were on center stage, just as he used to be. He looked on, often peeking at them over his reading glasses. But he said the change hadn\u2019t been awkward, and Lipinski echoed that.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started as a commentator, I listened to all of Scott\u2019s tapes and learned so much because he was so incredible,\u201d said Lipinski, who won the Olympic gold medal in 1998. \u201cHe called my Olympics and was like a big brother to me when we toured together.

At a hearing in January, he slammed Mr. Trump for his \u201crecurring redundant drumbeat of anti-Latino commentary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t ordinary,\u201d Judge Garaufis said. \u201cIn this country, in over 250 years, it\u2019s extreme, it\u2019s recurrent and it\u2019s vicious.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same hearing, Judge Garaufis also took a shot at Mr. Sessions, who had rebuked him at a speech in October for an earlier remark the judge had made calling the repeal of DACA \u201cheartless.\u201d Citing the speech, Judge Garaufis said in open court that Mr. Sessions \u201cseems to think that courts don\u2019t get to have their own opinions.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling on Tuesday, Judge Garaufis based his decision to keep DACA in place for now on the Administrative Procedure Act, which forbids the government from acting arbitrarily or capriciously in changing federal policy. He noted that lawyers for the government had initially claimed that DACA was ended out a fear that the program would be struck down as illegal, much as a federal court in Texas had done in 2015 with a similar program known as DAPA, which protected the parents of young immigrants.\n\nBut, Judge Garaufis wrote, \u201cthe administrative record does not support defendants\u2019 contention that they decided to end DACA for this reason.\u201d In fact, he added, the government had showed \u201ca failure to explain their decision\u201d at all.", "title": "Second Federal Judge Issues Injunction to Keep DACA in Place", "authors": ["Alan Feuer"]}

{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "Plenty of companies, small and large, work with university plant breeders to distribute new seed varieties. But Row 7 aims to give breeders the chance to reach a big market with their most esoteric and groundbreaking work \u2014 by connecting them with chefs.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs they develop new varieties, plant breeders will kick around ideas with chefs across the country, using feedback from the kitchen to guide their research. While Row 7 will consider the needs of regional growers, its founders say that flavor will always come first.\n\n\u201cPart of the goal of the company is not only to increase the flavor of vegetables: It\u2019s to look at how we, as chefs, can change the culture of eating,\u201d said Mr. Barber, who started Row 7 with the seedsman Matthew Goldfarb and the plant breeder Michael Mazourek.\n\nStarting Tuesday, Row 7 will sell organic seeds, developed in the United States, on its website, row7seeds.com. At first, it will sell seeds for the Badger Flame; three varieties of squash (including one that announces its ripeness on the vine by changing from dark green to a rusty orange); a small, creamy potato; a pleasingly bitter cucumber; and a floral-tasting habanero pepper without even a pinprick of heat.\n\nRow 7\u2019s founders are betting that as plant breeders and chefs conspire to grow what\u2019s most delicious, they will grab the attention of home gardeners and small- to mid-scale farmers, who can order the seed in bulk. Their new varieties may then pop up at farmers\u2019 markets and high-end grocery stores, and, if demand is high enough, in national supermarket chains and manufactured foods.\n\nIt sounds ambitious for a new company with such a small selection, not to mention one whose prices are high, from $3.50 for 100 seeds to $4.95 for just 12. But the founders have seen what happens when high-profile chefs flex their marketing muscles.\n\nEIGHT YEARS AGO, Mr. Barber asked Mr. Mazourek, an associate professor of plant breeding and genetics at Cornell University, if he could develop a better butternut squash. Mr. Mazourek had been working on what he calls \u201csquash innovation\u201d for many years, and came back to Mr. Barber with the Honeynut.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike all breeders, Mr. Mazourek had reached plenty of dead ends throughout his career. He didn\u2019t see why this miniature squash should be any different, even if it was notably cute and tasty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Barber pitched the new variety, calling it out by name at food conferences and cooking with it at his restaurants, where the servers tell diners detailed stories about ingredients. The squash elbowed its way beyond an elite dining scene, through more and more restaurant kitchens, from social media and articles in Vogue and Cooking Light, right into the aisles of national grocery chains and onto dinner tables across the country.\n\nIn about five years, the Honeynut had risen from academic obscurity. (That\u2019s fast for a squash.)\n\n\u201cThe Honeynut could not have happened without chefs,\u201d Mr. Barber said. \u201cThey Instagrammed it, they talked about it, it was on their menus, and it went from zero to 60.\u201d\n\nMr. Barber, Mr. Mazourek and Mr. Goldfarb all wondered what might happen if more chefs had a say in which new seeds went to market \u2014 if they played a part in shaping their own food supply.\n\nWas it a freakish anomaly, or could the Honeynut effect be repeated over and over again? Could chefs create a demand for new varieties that were more experimental and interesting and diverse, more nutrient-dense and more thoroughly delicious, from root to stem to leaf?\n\nMr. Mazourek\u2019s colleagues \u2014 plant breeders with creative streaks, experts on the substance of cauliflower, corn and carrots \u2014 found all of these questions exciting. When Mr. Barber spoke to chefs, they were just as enthusiastic. Row 7\u2019s partners brought in investors, including Walter Robb, a former chief executive of Whole Foods Market, and Adam Neumann, the chief executive of WeWork.\n\nPhoto\n\nRow 7\u2019s seeds are not patented; the company\u2019s founders say they don\u2019t believe in patenting life, and want researchers to have access to information. \u201cAs the climate changes and pests and disease evolve, we have to keep up,\u201d Mr. Mazourek said.\n\nFor now, all profits from the seed sales will be used to support each plant breeder\u2019s research. (Later, the model could look more like that of other seed companies, which pass only a portion of profits to breeders, or license out particular seeds for royalty fees.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichael Sligh, the director of a sustainable agriculture program at Rural Advancement Foundation International, said that as the seed market has become more consolidated in the last two decades, there has been an alarming decline in the number of public plant-breeding programs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

MAZOUREK FIRST ASKED the Boston chef Ana Sortun to imagine editing a vegetable, any vegetable she liked, Ms. Sortun was stumped.\n\n\u201cWhy would I want to change something in nature?\u201d she said. \u201cNature is perfect.\u201d\n\nBut tasting some of Mr. Mazourek\u2019s squash trials gave her a sense of the possibilities. \u201cIt had just never dawned on me that I could talk to a seed breeder and have a conversation like this,\u201d said Ms. Sortun, who has served the Honeynut at her restaurants for years.\n\nShe is one of dozens of chefs who plan to cook with Row 7\u2019s new varieties as they\u2019re available. They include Mashama Bailey, of the Grey in Savannah, Ga. Ms. Bailey was drawn to Mr. Mazourek\u2019s work with another variety of squash, bred to have stems that taste too good to throw away.\n\n\u201cI like the focus on utilizing the entire plant,\u201d she said, \u201cand on reducing waste.\u201d\n\nHeirlooms, which are older varieties of open-pollinated plants, are prized for their origin stories and their flavors \u2014 though they can be risky for growers. The newer seeds that plant breeders produce, whether open-pollinated or hybrid, are manipulated to thrive, and aren\u2019t idealized in the same way, except by the breeders.\n\nIn interviews, some described the work as beautiful, as both an art and a science, practiced in the lab and the field. Mr. Goldman said that like many of his peers, he considered every plant to be imperfect and unfinished \u2014 a work-in-progress on a continuum that stretched all the way back to each plant\u2019s domestication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Mazourek kept working on the Honeynut, even after its initial success, selecting for higher yields on the vine and longer storage. The palm-sized 898 squash is his latest version, and among Row 7\u2019s first group of trial seeds.\n\nEvery year or so, the company plans to release more seed varieties, and newer versions of previously sold seeds. But that\u2019s not the only reason Mr. Goldman, who worked for more than a decade on his sunset-colored beet, continues to tinker on a new generation of the Badger Flame, even as the seed goes on sale.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a raising a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really never done.\u201d\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

The North Korean figure skaters seemed to enjoy a variety of global food in the athletes\u2019 cafeteria, said Kam Alex Kang Chan, a South Korean skater who also trained with Mr. Marcotte.\n\nMegan Duhamel, who with her skating partner, Eric Radford, won a bronze medal in pairs figure skating and is married to Mr. Marcotte, said that the North Korean skaters became fans of protein bars made by a friend of hers in Montreal, and that she gave them several to take home.\n\nIn the locker room before a game between the unified Korean women\u2019s ice hockey team and Sweden, some of the South Koreans taught their teammates from the North how to dance to K-pop music, said Sarah Murray, the Korean women\u2019s hockey coach.\n\nThe subtext of some of the curiosity is whether the North Koreans, exposed to glimpses of popular culture or the higher standard of living in the South, might be tempted to defect, as athletes from other Communist countries have done at previous Olympic Games. No North Korean athletes have defected during an Olympics, although one defected in 1991 during a world judo championship in Spain.\n\nSome analysts theorize that exposure to the outside world could eventually drive change back home.\n\n\u201cIt might be better to think that an information inflow will slowly alter the preferences of North Koreans by inevitably poking holes in the ideology,\u201d said Robert E. Kelly, a professor of political science at Pusan National University in South Korea. \u201cOver time, this should change the regime and make it easier to deal. That\u2019s the hope anyway.\u201d\n\nSome American officials espouse a version of this view. \u201cOur sense is the more North Koreans that come here and can see how successful the South has been, the better,\u201d Marc Knapper, the deputy chief of mission at the United States Embassy in Seoul, said during a news conference before the Games.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll discover what good things accrue when they decide to rejoin the international community and make the right decisions,\u201d Mr. Knapper added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet even North Korea watchers who support greater athletic and cultural exchanges say none of it will slow down the country\u2019s nuclear ambitions.\n\n\u201cOf course they will proceed with their nuclear program,\u201d said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. \u201cNothing can be done, short of a military invasion, to reverse it. The best we can hope for is to achieve some kind of freeze.\u201d\n\nAny North Korean who might try to steer the government in a new direction risks severe punishment. Dissidents are thrown into prison camps, and Kim Jong-un has had hundreds of people killed, including his own uncle, and, it is widely believed, his half brother.\n\nCritics say countries hosting North Koreans become susceptible to propaganda designed to soften the North\u2019s image. They point to the regime\u2019s charm offensive at the Olympics, including a visit by Kim Yo-jong, Kim Jong-un\u2019s sister.\n\n\u201cWhile North Korea, the target of engagement, remains a menacing nuclear state, the outsiders have become beholden to the enchanting possibility of their efforts bearing fruit one day,\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose who promote more engagement with the North say change will be evolutionary, not revolutionary. \u201cNorth Koreans, including North Korean officials, will see they are lagging very behind the world,\u201d Mr. Lankov said. \u201cSome of them will say, \u2018Let\u2019s overthrow the government,\u2019 but many more will say, \u2018Let\u2019s change our policy a bit.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is not even clear how much the North\u2019s athletes and supporters have seen or heard while at the Games. The dozen female players on the joint ice hockey team sleep in separate dorms and ride a separate bus from their South Korean teammates.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe North Korean cheerleaders and journalists are staying in a remote resort in Inje County, at least a 90-minute drive from many of the Olympic venues.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Would-be defectors \u201cknow their entire family, extended relatives, friends will get executed or rounded up and sent to labor camps,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she said, the athletes and cheerleaders at the Olympics are \u201ccarefully handpicked and vetted North Koreans, children of the elite ruling class\u201d who have decent living standards. \u201cWhy risk bringing serious harm to your loved ones when you are living a pretty good life?\u201d Ms. Terry said.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnalysts say it is also presumptuous to assume any North Korean who goes abroad would immediately want to move.\n\n\u201cIf you use the analogy of someone coming from the Midwest or a small town and you go to New York for a weekend, and there\u2019s all of a sudden all of this stuff \u2014 a lot of people that I know from quieter cities tend to get very overwhelmed,\u201d said Jenny Town, assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.\n\nDefectors say those who have been abroad are likely to receive some kind of ideological \u201cre-education\u201d session upon returning home.\n\nStill, some experts say exposure to the outside world may ultimately undermine the regime\u2019s efforts to keep citizens in line.\n\nIdeological education \u201ccan\u2019t take away people\u2019s thoughts after they experience what it\u2019s like in a democratic society,\u201d said Kang Dong-wan, professor of North Korean culture and politics at Dong-A University in Busan, South Korea. \u201cWouldn\u2019t the cheerleaders and the athletes wonder why they are being controlled while other South Koreans in the crowd sitting right next to them are cheering naturally and moving about freely?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe North\u2019s athletes at the Olympics have said little in public, but have generally conveyed their loyalty to their nation.

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nTHE BOAT PEOPLE\n\nBy Sharon Bala\n\n352 pp. Doubleday. $26.95.\n\nTwo pieces of Canadian history lie behind Sharon Bala\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Boat People.\u201d The first involves the arrival \u2014 in August 2010 \u2014 of the merchant vessel Sun Sea at Equimalt naval base in British Columbia, carrying hundreds of Sri Lankan asylum seekers. The second involves the internment of almost 24,000 Canadian citizens of Japanese origin in the Slocan Valley by the British Columbia Security Commission between 1941 and 1949.\n\n\n\nThe arrival of the refugees is fictionalized through the voices of the widower Mahindan, a resourceful father rendered unscrupulous by the circumstances of a terrible war, who has arrived with his 6-year-old son, Sellian, and Priya Rajasekaran, a law student assigned to represent the refugees. Grace Nakamura, an adjudicator for the Immigration and Refugee Board, provides the connection to 1941 through her mother, Kumi. The latter, her mind laced with dementia, sallies forth like a Greek chorus to insist that subjecting foreign asylum seekers to the processes established by rule of law is the same as the forced removal and incarceration of law-abiding citizens. It\u2019s a false equivalence that blights a novel already struggling under the weight of political opinion: Bala vilifies the Canadian Border Services Agency and the draconian immigration laws and penalties that can be traced to the prime minister at the time, Stephen Harper, and sings the praises of the Canadian Tamil Congress, which appears here as the Tamil Alliance.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe \u201ccompassionate\u201d lens promised on the jacket copy proves elusive. The novel is burdened by a heavy-handed use of emotive prose. Bala is particularly fond of the diminutive, the \u201csmall\u201d of things, hands, wounded children \u2014 all designed to elicit sympathy. Stock characters crowd the narrative. One of them, Grace\u2019s world-weary colleague Mitchell Hurst, shows up no fewer than four times to make declarative statements about what a neophyte she is at this business of adjudicating asylum. Bala also labors to explain things that do not require explanation, from immigration law (\u201cthere can be a gap between policy and practice\u201d) to Border Services (\u201cthe agency responsible for patrolling the perimeter, the country\u2019s official boundaries\u201d).\n\nLess than 10 pages into this novel, a lawyer says: \u201cThe truth is immaterial. \u2026 Do the claimants appear to be telling the truth? That is what matters.\u201d His words are echoed by Mahindan toward the end of the book: \u201cWhat is important is not what is true or false. The important thing is what these people, the Canadian authorities, believe is true and false.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting premise that, if allowed to float, might have permitted the novel to reach safe harbor. Instead, Bala frog-marches readers toward a foregone conclusion: The government is vindictive; the refugees, innocent.\n\nThe author plays with time through flashbacks told in the present tense, an innovative approach well suited to capturing the upside-down nature of refugee narratives. With a treasure trove of material \u2014 what can\u2019t a writer do with a boatload of refugees? \u2014 it is mystifying that Bala has chosen to ignore the obvious: letting us see the refugees as perfect in their imperfections rather than rendered as pawns in this political narrative, just as they were trapped in a war not of their choosing. There is one character, Mahindan\u2019s champion bargainer of a wife, Chithra, who in flashbacks lights up the page with her presence and prescience, the energy she brings to her marriage, her friendships and her pregnancy. One is left wishing Chithra had made it to Canada. Her youthful vitality and fierce personality would have helped the author dispense with a multitude of middling characters and political invective and given us a heroine worth cheering for.", "title": "Seeking Asylum but Finding Heartbreak", "authors": ["Ru Freeman", "Sharon Bala"]}

Another 1.1 million young immigrants are eligible for DACA but did not apply. But Mr. Trump suspended the initiative in September and gave lawmakers until March 5 to come up with a replacement that would protect the young immigrants, known as Dreamers, after proposed legislation called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, or DREAM Act.\n\nLiberal interest groups and immigration rights activists have mobilized to insist on legal status for the Dreamers without the concessions demanded by the president and immigration hard-liners: billions for a wall on the Mexican border, an even more aggressive crackdown on illegal immigrants and dramatic changes to the legal immigration system that would favor skilled immigrants over the family members of citizens and green-card holders.\n\n\u201cAs the Senate is poised to start debate on the humanitarian crisis Donald Trump caused when he cruelly ended DACA, here\u2019s what every sitting Senator should remember: Americans want the Dream Act \u2014 not cruel deals that go against basic American values,\u201d said Corinne Ball, campaign director for MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group.\n\nConservatives and anti-immigration groups are just as vociferous.\n\n\u201cIt was President Obama who created a cruel situation by making promises to a group of illegal aliens who he had no authority to promise what he gave them,\u201d said Rosemary Jenks, the director of government relations for NumbersUSA, a group that advocates limiting immigration. \u201cPresident Trump had a duty to rescind that policy, because the Constitution makes very clear that Congress, not the White House, sets the laws in this land.\u201d\n\nIn such a polarized environment, there is a significant chance that the Senate will pass nothing by the end of the week \u2014 or that whatever measure the Senate does adopt will be thwarted by the House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have something in the Senate that we haven\u2019t had in a while,\u201d Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said Sunday on the NBC program \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real debate on an issue where we really don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nImmigration is one of the most emotional, contentious issues in Washington.

A number of Republican senators, led by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, have drafted legislation that mirrors the White House plan, which will almost certainly be introduced as an amendment. Mr. McConnell said on Monday that he supported it.\n\nThe American people have \u201cheard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist this issue requires swift action,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cNow is the time to back up the talk with the hard work of finding a workable solution.

A bipartisan group calling itself the Common Sense Coalition, led by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, has been working on its own measure but has not released a plan.\n\nThat group is focused on a narrower bill than the president would like, one that would pair a path to citizenship for the Dreamers with funding for the border wall.\n\n\u201cThe only way to achieve a solution to the DACA crisis is to keep it simple,\u201d Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the coalition, said on the Senate floor Monday.\n\nBut Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, said he could not support a bill that addresses only DACA and border security. \u201cThe president\u2019s indicated he would not sign such a bill, so that really doesn\u2019t meet my definition of success,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, the idea of an open-ended debate is so novel that many newer senators say they have never experienced one, and are scurrying to learn the rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFor a lot of us, we\u2019re going to have to learn this process,\u201d said Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, who was elected in 2014.\n\nSenator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, marveled, \u201cBeen here seven years \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nImmigrant rights groups are nervous, and do not know quite what to expect.

Two federal courts have issued injunctions ordering the Trump administration to keep DACA in place for those already receiving its protections, but the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to intervene and overturn lower court rulings.\n\nThursday\u2019s votes came after Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had set aside this week for senators to try to write a bill from scratch. Some senators said it was possible that lawmakers would attach an immigration bill to a catchall spending measure that must pass by March 23, when funding for the federal government expires.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSenator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said he did not envision Mr. McConnell allowing more time for lawmakers to debate the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t get it together this week, I mean, we\u2019ve got other things we have to do, which are pressing.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to the debate, the bipartisan Common Sense Coalition measure, sponsored by seven Democrats, eight Republicans and one independent, was thought to have the best chance to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate.\n\nIt would have appropriated $25 billion for border security, including construction of the president\u2019s proposed wall, over a 10-year period \u2014 but not immediately, as Mr. Trump demands.\n\nIt also included an eventual path to citizenship, over 10 to 12 years, for 1.8 million of the young undocumented immigrants, but would have precluded them from sponsoring their parents to become citizens. And it did not make changes to the diversity visa lottery system, which Mr. Trump wants to end.\n\nThe White House attacked the plan as a grievous threat to national security and asserted that its sponsors were either complicit in wanting to undermine the United States\u2019 immigration laws or misinformed about the drastic effects that the proposal would have.\n\nIn a conference call with reporters before voting began, a senior White House official lashed out at Mr. Graham. Speaking only on the condition of anonymity despite repeated requests to be on the record, the official accused Mr. Graham of attacking homeland security officials and standing in the way of needed immigration changes.\n\n\u201cSenator Graham has been an obstacle for those reforms,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe official accused Mr. Graham of misleading other senators, including Democrats, about the damage the proposal would do, and said that Democrats should not let \u201cLindsey Graham dictate what Democrat senators ought to do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Mr. Graham took aim at Stephen Miller, a top White House aide and an immigration hard-liner. \u201cAs long as the president allows Steve Miller and others to run the show down there, we\u2019re never going to get anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the legislative failures in the Senate, top White House officials said they plan to turn their attention to the House, where Republicans are working on a similar hard-line immigration plan that Mr. Trump has also embraced.\n\nRepublicans may have more success approving the bill in the House, where they control the chamber and need only a simple majority to pass legislation. Mr. Trump praised the House legislation on Thursday, saying that it \u201censhrines\u201d his immigration principles.\n\nLater Thursday night, the White House released a statement in support of advancing that legislation and denouncing the \u201cSchumer Democrats,\u201d referencing Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. The statement said that the Democrats \u201care not serious about DACA, they are not serious about immigration reform, and they are not serious about homeland security.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, advocates estimate that more than 100 of the young immigrants lose their protected status each day. On March 5, they say, the number could rise to as many as 1,400 a day.\n\nAnd while the president has said repeatedly that he wants to protect the Dreamers \u2014 at one point he called on Congress to pass a bipartisan \u201cbill of love\u201d \u2014 many blame him for refusing to accept the bipartisan deal.\n\n\u201cThe president is not negotiating in good faith,\u201d said Juan Escalante, 28, who was born in Venezuela and now works for America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant rights group. \u201cIf you ask me, as an impacted party who essentially has everything to lose \u2014 my driver\u2019s license and my work permit and my livelihood in this country \u2014 that is not any way to negotiate a deal.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials are betting that House passage of a bill to protect the Dreamers will put enormous pressure on Democrats in the Senate. But immigrant rights activists and Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans in the Senate \u2014 have repeatedly vowed to oppose the House legislation, which they call outrageous and hurtful.\n\nThat could leave the issue mired in stalemate as neither chamber can embrace legislation that the other chamber is willing to pass.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNo one comes out a winner in this,\u201d a dejected-sounding Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and a chairman of the Common Sense Coalition, said after the Senate vote. \u201cWe tried everything.\u201d", "title": "Senate Rejects Immigration Plans, Leaving Fate of Dreamers Uncertain", "authors": ["Sheryl Gay Stolberg", "Michael D.

This could get broad bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s attempt to revive the legislation has slowly been gaining momentum in recent months, though it has attracted little of the fanfare that accompanied the previous effort. Thursday\u2019s vote, for example, was eclipsed by a high-stakes debate consuming the Senate over the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\n\nA small group of Republicans on the committee, including Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, opposed the bill. Mr. Cornyn was one of the foremost advocates of similar legislation in the last Congress, but he has come to believe that a narrower set of changes to prisons is more realistic than a sweeping sentencing overhaul.\n\nMr. Grassley\u2019s legislation, which so far has the support of more than 20 Democrats and Republicans, would significantly reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses and institute a new system for determining which offenders would be eligible for early release. It would also create programs to better prepare them to return to life out of prison.\n\n\u201cMandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin, the lead Democratic author, said in a statement after the vote. \u201cIn reality they have too often been unfair, fiscally irresponsible and a threat to public safety.\u201d\n\nThe plan has support from groups as ideologically diverse as the billionaire conservatives Charles G. and David H. Koch and the American Civil Liberties Union, and its authors expect it could easily win majorities in both chambers of Congress if given a vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it runs against the prevailing philosophy of the Trump administration and, in particular, the Justice Department under Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who was instrumental in derailing the 2015 effort when he was still in the Senate, has ordered federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges and sentences for crime suspects, reversing Obama-era efforts to ease such penalties for some nonviolent drug offenders. Many Republicans in the House and Senate agree with that philosophy.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe conflict was laid bare on Wednesday when Mr. Sessions wrote a letter to Mr. Grassley calling the bill \u201ca grave error\u201d that would put more dangerous criminals back on the streets and tie up resources needed to fight violent crime and gang action.\n\n\u201cPassing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation\u2019s history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe letter pushed Mr. Grassley, who has shouldered the legislation for three years, into a rare fury. He wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cincensed\u201d and told reporters that he resented the attorney general trying to tell a senator \u2014 especially one who guided his confirmation proceedings despite Democratic support \u2014 how to write the law.\n\n\u201cDo you realize that he\u2019s carrying out laws? He\u2019s no longer a senator,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cThat letter sounds just exactly like he still thinks he\u2019s a senator.\u201d\n\nHolly Harris, the executive director of the Justice Action Network, a bipartisan coalition advocating an overhaul, said that urgency had only grown since 2015, largely because of the opioid crisis that has ravaged communities across the country.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform is only controversial in one place in this country, and that\u2019s Washington, D.C.,\u201d she said, urging Republican leaders to move forward with the bill.\n\n\u201cThere is a high expectation across the country that Republicans will be supportive of these reforms,\u201d she added. \u201cAny effort by the opposition will not be well received not just by progressives but by conservatives, as well.\u201d", "title": "Senate\u2019s Renewed Push for Sentencing Overhaul Hits a Familiar Roadblock", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"]}

But if you liked Anderson\u2019s breathtaking final twist, you\u2019ll love the one at the end of this classic.\n\nIf You Wonder What Inspired It\n\nCelia Johnson and Trevor Howard in \u201cBrief Encounter.\u201d Universal Pictures\n\n\u2018Brief Encounter\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Filmstruck, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNo film has come up more frequently in Anderson\u2019s interviews about \u201cPhantom Thread\u201d than Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cRebecca,\u201d which, unfortunately, isn\u2019t available to stream. But Anderson has also mentioned this early masterpiece from David Lean, the British director who went on to make era-defining epics like \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d and \u201cDoctor Zhivago.\u201d Like the relationship between Reynolds and Alma, the adulterous love affair that fuels \u201cBrief Encounter\u201d is relatively chaste, but psychologically harrowing and deeply claustrophobic. And Anderson isn\u2019t the only contemporary filmmaker who has cited the movie as an inspiration: Todd Haynes borrowed its circular structure for his 2015 movie, \u201cCarol.\u201d\n\nIf You\u2019re Intrigued by Vicky Krieps\n\nVicky Krieps in \u201cThe Chambermaid.\u201d Film Movement\n\n\u2018The Chambermaid\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWho is Vicky Krieps?

Krieps, who hails from Luxembourg and has been appearing in European productions for a decade, stars as a compulsively thorough hotel maid who is drawn into a sadomasochistic relationship with a dominatrix. Anderson told Rolling Stone that he noticed, while watching the movie, that Krieps \u201chas one of those faces that turns in about 45 directions at once.\u201d\n\nIf You Want More Day-Lewis and Anderson\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis in \u201cThere Will Be Blood.\u201d Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Vantage\n\n\u2018There Will Be Blood\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Google, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAnderson\u2019s male leads are his muses. He seems to build each of his films around their strengths and quirks, from Tom Cruise\u2019s role as a manic motivational speaker in \u201cMagnolia\u201d to Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s turn as a mumbly stoner in \u201cInherent Vice.\u201d Daniel Day-Lewis, an accomplished method actor, is a more difficult actor to pin down. He won an Academy Award for his larger-than-life performance in Anderson\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d as Daniel Plainview, a ruthless early-20th-century oilman who terrorizes a local evangelist (Paul Dano). With its epic scope and operatic monologues, it\u2019s a very different film from \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d But if there\u2019s a through line connecting Woodcock to Plainview, it\u2019s an obsession with control.\n\nIf You\u2019re Fascinated by Artist-Muse Relationships\n\nJavier Bardem and Jennifer Lawrence in \u201cMother!\u201d Niko Tavernise/Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018Mother!\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes, Google, Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSpeaking of muses, Alma isn\u2019t just Reynolds\u2019s soul mate \u2014 she\u2019s the person who inspires his greatest creations.

Aronofsky\u2019s maximalist biblical allegory certainly isn\u2019t for everyone, but for those who can get on its histrionic level, this story about a blocked poet (Javier Bardem) and the young wife who devotes herself to caring for him (Jennifer Lawrence) offers another compelling take on a complicated type of relationship.\n\nIf you loved \u201cDunkirk\u201d as well, here are six films to watch next; we also have six more to watch with \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d", "title": "Seven Films to Stream if You Loved \u2018Phantom Thread\u2019", "authors": ["Judy Berman"]}

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nHistorical docudrama, timely political allegory, quicksilver newspaper comedy \u2014 Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Post\u201d is a movie that has it all, all at once. Set amid a period of soaring opposition to the Vietnam War, the film dramatizes the internal battles at The Washington Post over the Pentagon Papers, after an injunction by the Nixon administration suppressed their continued publication by The New York Times. And although it takes place in 1971, the film deals in matters of First Amendment freedom, authoritarian rule and female empowerment that are anything but dated.\n\n\u201cThe Post\u201d nabbed two Academy Awards nominations this year: best actress for Meryl Streep (as the The Post\u2019s publisher, Katharine Graham) and best picture. And the intersection of germane history and snappy newsroom banter offers up plenty of comparisons for related viewing. Here are six that are currently streaming:\n\nIf You Want to Know More About the Pentagon Papers\n\nDaniel Ellsberg in Vietnam as seen in \u201cThe Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers.\u201d via Daniel and Patricia Ellsberg\n\n\u2018The Most Dangerous Man in America: Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Kanopy\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cThe Post\u201d is mostly concerned with the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d of the Pentagon Papers, the massive study detailing the history of American involvement in Vietnam. Spielberg\u2019s film does, however, delve briefly into the \u201cwhat\u201d of the document dump in the film\u2019s early passages. If you want more about the study\u2019s contents, you can\u2019t do better than this Peabody Award-winning and Oscar-nominated feature by Judie Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith, which takes the form of a documentary but runs with the speed and intrigue of a good political thriller. Ehrlich and Goldsmith aren\u2019t only preoccupied with the specifics of the Papers (though they certainly cover those bases). Their film also has the insight and sensitivity of a character study, probing the personal and political journey of Mr. Ellsberg, whose deep dive into the Vietnam conflict turned him from a hawk into an antiwar activist.\n\nIf You Want a Classic Newspaper Movie\n\nCary Grant and Rosalind Russell in \u201cHis Girl Friday.\u201d Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018His Girl Friday\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, FilmStruck\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cThe Post\u201d fits the tradition of the \u201cnewspaper picture\u201d best defined by Pauline Kael: \u201ca tough modern talkie,\u201d in most cases \u201ca melodrama with crime and political corruption and suspense and comedy and romance\u201d \u2014 often with snappy titles like \u201cScandal Sheet\u201d and \u201cLibeled Lady.\u201d And the best of those movies, or at least their screwball comedy subset, is this 1940 barnburner from Howard Hawks. A gender-swapped rewrite of the earlier film and play \u201cThe Front Page,\u201d it features Cary Grant in top form as a ruthless newspaper editor who will tell any fib and pull any string to get his star reporter (the peerless Rosalind Russell), who is also his ex-wife, to cover one last story rather than quit her job and disappear with her fianc\u00e9 (a wonderfully dopey Ralph Bellamy). Grant and Russell\u2019s mile-a-minute, love-hate banter is priceless, but don\u2019t undervalue the snappy, wiseacre dialogue of the supporting players, a crew of seen-it-all newsmen who talk shop and swap lingo with growling, offhand wit.\n\n0\n\nIf You Want a Modern Newspaper Movie\n\nGlenn Close and Michael Keaton in \u201cThe Paper.\u201d Universal Pictures\n\n\u2018The Paper\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe traditional \u201cnewspaper picture\u201d faded away in the mid-20th century, but it was lovingly resurrected in this terrific 1994 comedy from director Ron Howard. Set at a thinly veiled stand-in for the tabloid New York Post, it jazzily tick-tocks 24 harried hours in the life of a tightly wound metro editor (Michael Keaton), who\u2019s attempting to juggle a big story and a lucrative career opportunity while also managing a fraught relationship with his boss (Glenn Close). Co-writer Stephen Koepp spent years in the journalistic trenches, and that background lends the picture a documentary verisimilitude \u2014 particularly in the editors\u2019 meetings, which buzz with an improvisational energy \u2014 that lets Howard get away with some of the film\u2019s later, showier moments. But it\u2019s hard to begrudge them; as a supporting character notes, how often do you actually have an excuse to shout, \u201cStop the presses!\u201d?\n\nIf You\u2019re Thrilled by People in Rooms Talking\n\nA scene from \u201c12 Angry Men.\u201d United Artists\n\n\u201812 Angry Men\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\n\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn a post-screening talk at the Directors Guild of America, Spielberg named the famously efficient director Sidney Lumet as a guiding light for the film, in no small part because of the quick turnaround required for \u201cThe Post\u201d (just nine months from the time Spielberg read the script to delivery of his finished print). He pinpointed Lumet\u2019s 1957 feature debut as particularly influential: It\u2019s a film in which 12 men sit in a room and exchange dialogue (in this case, they\u2019re jurors hashing out their verdict in a capital murder case), but it\u2019s as thrilling as any action franchise, thanks to the crackerjack writing, precise movements, thoughtful composition and masterly performances. \u201cI saw what he did with the camera, to open it up,\u201d Spielberg said. \u201cI look to Lumet movies to inform me: How can I make this exciting?

For a portrait that\u2019s a bit more up-close, watch this operatic 1995 biopic from Oliver Stone, which views this peculiar life through a Shakespearean prism \u2014 it\u2019s a story of a man who strove for greatness, but could not ultimately overcome his own pettiness and insecurity. The Welsh-born Anthony Hopkins is a peculiar casting decision on the surface, but he quickly overcomes any concerns, psychologically immersing himself in the role with a feverish intensity. Stone\u2019s shuffled-up chronology \u2014 which owes no small debt to \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d (another newspaper picture of sorts) \u2014 further complicates this compelling portrait of an American enigma.\n\nIf You Love the \u201970s Aesthetic\n\nRobert Redford in \u201cThree Days of the Condor.\u201d Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018Three Days of the Condor\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime, Starz\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe scandals of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate, coupled with a general post-\u201960s distrust of authority and institution, led to a miniboom of taut, paranoid conspiracy thrillers like \u201cThe Conversation,\u201d \u201cThe Parallax View,\u201d and \u201cWinter Kills\u201d \u2014 films whose tension, speed and aesthetic for depicting drab, everyday evil clearly influenced the look and style of \u201cThe Post.\u201d One of the best is this 1975 spy scorcher from director Sydney Pollack, inspired by the James Grady novel; Robert Redford stars as Joseph Turner, a mild-mannered researcher at a low-profile C.I.A. outpost in New York City, whose entire office is executed while he\u2019s out to lunch. On the run and unsure of whom to trust, Turner must transform himself from an analyst into an agent and figure out who is trying to kill him (and why). Redford and Faye Dunaway generate considerable heat in the leading roles, while Owen Roizman\u2019s gritty cinematography nicely captures the uncertainty of the era.\n\nIf You Want to Know What Happened Next\n\nDustin Hoffman, left, and Robert Redford in \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men.\u201d Warner Bros.\n\n\u2018All the President\u2019s Men\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: HBO, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSpielberg\u2019s film ends with what amounts to a remake of the opening scene of this 1976 masterpiece from Alan J. Pakula, as burglars creep into the Democratic National Headquarters at the Watergate hotel, initiating the crime, cover-up and scandal that would ultimately bring down the Nixon presidency. The reporting of that story was first unpacked by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their 1974 book; aside from casting Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman to play them, Pakula and the screenwriter William Goldman steadfastly refused to glam up this decidedly un-Hollywood story, focusing not on the dramatic fall of the president but on the grunt work of shoe-leather reporting. And yet, by slogging through the trenches with these reporters and waiting patiently through a seemingly endless series of slammed doors, dead-end leads and \u201cnon-denial denials,\u201d the payoff is all the more satisfying.\n\nIf you loved \u201cDunkirk\u201d as well, here are six films to watch next; we also have six more to watch with \u201cCall Me by Your Name.\u201d", "title": "Seven Films to Stream if You Loved \u2018The Post\u2019", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

But Mr. Trump told Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto that he regarded his vow that Mexico would pay for the wall as a political imperative that he dared not relinquish.\n\nThe issue derailed the first attempt by the American and Mexican governments to coordinate a meeting between the two presidents. During a January 2017 visit to Washington by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray to arrange an announced visit, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to complain that Mexico seemed unwilling to pay for the border wall. Mr. Videgaray suspended all of his meetings and returned home. It was clear to Mexican officials then that there would be no benefit to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto in meeting with Mr. Trump.\n\nThe collapse of the new, tentatively scheduled March visit was similarly abrupt. When Mr. Videgaray returned from a visit to Washington 10 days ago, he seemed pleased with his progress. The Mexican Foreign Ministry published a picture of Mr. Videgaray at a working lunch with Mr. Kushner; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser; and various members of the cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.\n\nTucked into the account of the foreign minister\u2019s trip was news that came as a surprise to Mexicans: The two sides had agreed to begin planning a meeting between Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and Mr. Trump. The idea was met with astonishment in Mexico, where Mr. Trump is widely despised for his stream of insults against Mexican immigrants and his insistence on building a wall and sticking Mexico with the bill.\n\nA cartoon last Sunday in the newspaper Reforma asked incredulously why the trip was planned, noting that Mr. Trump had not changed any of his policies, and depicted Mr. Trump smashing a pie into Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s face.\n\nBefore the phone conversation, the two sides had agreed \u2014 at the behest of Mr. Trump\u2019s team \u2014 that the presidents should avoid talking about the thorny issues that had scuttled their first planned meeting, the Mexican official said, and Trump administration officials told their Mexican counterparts that they would ensure that the president would not dwell on past disagreements.\n\nBut during the call, the official said, Mr. Trump lost his temper. A White House official said Mr. Trump had simply become frustrated at Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s insistence on staying on the subject of the wall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Mexican government has more than the damage to Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s reputation to worry about. His handpicked candidate to succeed him, former Finance Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Meade, is running in third place in the July 1 presidential election. A botched meeting between the two presidents could ricochet and hurt Mr. Meade\u2019s struggling campaign.\n\nThe White House and the Mexican government issued separate short statements on Tuesday noting that the two presidents had spoken by phone to exchange condolences over the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., and a helicopter crash in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nThe Mexican statement said the governments would continue their bilateral agenda \u201cthrough the coordinated efforts of their teams.\u201d Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s spokesman, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez, said Saturday night that the Mexican government had nothing else to add to that statement.\n\nThe White House said Mr. Trump had \u201cunderscored his commitment to expanding cooperation between the United States and Mexico on security, trade and immigration.\u201d", "title": "Sharp Words Over Wall Halt Plans for Mexican President to Visit White House", "authors": ["Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Kirk Semple"]}

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nRecently, New York museums have presented retrospectives of all three of the most influential artists of Brazil\u2019s postwar avant-garde. Lygia Clark, with her hinged-metal sculptures you can fiddle with at will, filled the top floor of the Museum of Modern Art. Lygia Pape, known for bold, participative performances and sculptures of iridescent gold filaments, appeared at the Met Breuer. And H\u00e9lio Oiticica was the man of the hour this summer at the Whitney, live birds and all.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe generation that set the stage for them, however \u2014 the one that established Modern art in Brazil in the early 1920s \u2014 has received less attention here. You\u2019ll have to go back to the Guggenheim\u2019s 2001 blockbuster \u201cBrazil: Body and Soul\u201d for the last big-ticket appearance of Modernist painters like Emiliano di Cavalcanti, C\u00e2ndido Portinari and, above all, Tarsila do Amaral (1886-1973): the most popular artist of the last century in her home country, but still little known in the United States. Her mature paintings, featuring oversize bodies in flowing, stylized landscapes, provoked the modern Brazilian penchant for antropofagia, or \u201ccannibalism,\u201d that Clark, Oiticica and Pape would all draw from. In the art of Tarsila (like a Brazilian soccer star, she is always called by her first name), Brazil found a new cultural confidence that said goodbye to European envy and consumed Western, African and indigenous influences with equal relish.\n\n\u201cTarsila do Amaral: Inventing Modern Art in Brazil,\u201d a belated but very welcome exhibition at the Modern, at last introduces New York audiences to the painter who, more than any of her contemporaries, forged a Modernist vocabulary for the country\u2019s art. Trained in Paris, enamored of rural Brazil, Tarsila moved quickly from folksy, idealized depictions of the New World to a brawny, confident biomorphism. Her three most important paintings have all been united in this show: \u201cA Negra\u201d and \u201cAntropofagia,\u201d on loan from museums in S\u00e3o Paulo, and \u201cAbaporu,\u201d which has traveled from Buenos Aires. (This show appeared last year at the Art Institute of Chicago; it was organized by Luis P\u00e9rez-Oramas, who recently stepped down as MoMA\u2019s curator of Latin American art, and Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, now at the Met but previously at the Art Institute.)\n\nPhoto\n\nTarsila was born into a family of wealthy landowners on a coffee plantation outside S\u00e3o Paulo in 1886 \u2014 two years before the end of slavery in Brazil, the last country in the Americas to abolish it. She received an art education in S\u00e3o Paulo, but she found the instruction traditionalist, so she left for Paris in 1920. There she learned from Fernand L\u00e9ger, whose bold colors and rounded figures would be decisive for her mature art. There is much of L\u00e9ger in a 1923 academy (or nude figure study) of Tarsila\u2019s, in which the sitter\u2019s contoured flesh pops against a backdrop of blue, green and beige.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nParis had left her \u201ccontaminated by revolutionary ideas,\u201d Tarsila later wrote, and, while still abroad, she would soon redeploy her French lessons in the service of a new Brazilian art. Her 1923 breakthrough, \u201cA Negra\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Black Woman,\u201d in English, though Brazilian racial taxonomies are quite different from American ones \u2014 pictures its nude subject sitting cross-legged, and her oversize feet, complete with toes of childlike chubbiness, take up much of the bottom of the composition. Her body is flattened; her right breast droops over her crossed arm; and her lips are so large that they run right off her face. Her flesh is a rusty orange, which darkens at the edges, as in L\u00e9ger\u2019s paintings. And note the background: an abstract arrangement of cool-colored stripes, indebted to Brazilian textiles but also to new European painting.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor contemporary audiences in New York, now hyper-attuned to white artists\u2019 use and misuse of black bodies, \u201cA Negra\u201d will pose the toughest challenge in this exhibition. But context is critical here. In 1923, for a trained artist to imagine a black woman as the embodiment of a new national spirit would have constituted a direct attack on the old, wannabe-European establishment of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo. (We might add that Modern artists in 1920s Paris were besotted with African and Native American art, precisely what the Brazilian bourgeoisie disdained.) The Modernist tropes of \u201cA Negra,\u201d with its scrambling of scales and its simplified graphics, were to be the building blocks for the art of a multiracial society.", "title": "She Led Latin American Art in a Bold New Direction", "authors": ["Jason Farago"]}

Like many Italian men of that era, her father \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d why she needed to pursue an education. Instead, she said, her mother secretly helped her out.\n\nShe traveled, \u201cbut I always learned languages in the wrong place,\u201d picking up Spanish from a boyfriend at a school in Ireland, and English from a boyfriend she met during a course in France.

She cannot even remember voting in the referendum to legalize divorce, which the Radical Party spearheaded.

But a law legalizing abortion took effect in 1978, and the Radical Party successfully fended off efforts to repeal it three years later.\n\nIn 1976 the Radical Party ran in national elections for the first time, and Ms. Bonino was one of four members to be elected to Parliament. Three years later she was elected to the European Parliament, and she has remained in the political arena \u2014 in one form or another \u2014 ever since.\n\nShe spent nearly 30 years in the Italian parliament and 14 years in the European Parliament, holding both seats when that was still possible. She was also a member of the European Commission, where she was in charge of fisheries, consumer policy and the European Community humanitarian office. In that capacity, she oversaw management of several crises, including the one million refugees from the war in Kosovo in 1998.\n\nShe has constructed a web of international connections through her advocacy for women\u2019s rights, refugees, humanitarian aid and other causes.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a sponge.

That was another battle, Ms. Dass\u00f9 said, that ran \u201ccounter current to the mood of the country, but she sees migration as a long-term and structural problem that must be addressed.\u201d\n\nShe is winning one fight in which she has enjoyed widespread support. In January 2015, Ms. Bonino announced that she had lung cancer. Treatment took many months, but in October 2016 she said that she was free of cancer. The turbans she now wears are the only vestiges of that episode.

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Schneemann had little use for Abstract Expressionism\u2019s culture of angst. What interested her was the physical action in \u201caction painting.\u201d She took it seriously enough to slice into her canvases and layer them with collage material, and then move into assemblage (at one point she forged a mutually beneficial friendship with Joseph Cornell). For a while she used fire as a mark-making medium.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the early 1960s, after she had converted a Manhattan commercial loft into a studio, her assemblages grew to the size of environments, in which she performed, her nude body smeared and streaked with paint, for a series of photographs titled \u201cEye Body: 36 Transformative Actions for Camera.\u201d The performances, which included live snakes, shattered mirrors, and cow skulls as props, suggested archaic rituals, violence-tinged but executed with surrealist wit.\n\nIt was a short, logical step from the studio into a theater. Ms. Schneemann made the transition as a founding member, along with dancer-choreographers like Deborah Hay and Yvonne Rainer, of Judson Dance Theater, a company that was changing American dance. In the Judson aesthetic, everyday actions \u2013 walking, running, lovemaking \u2013 assumed expressive dimensions. In 1964, Ms. Schneemann, using a pop-song score composed by Mr. Tenney, directed nine performers in an epochal event she called \u201cMeat Joy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStaged first in Paris and then in New York, it had at least the appearance of being an erotic free-for all with men and women in bikini briefs rolling around among piles of newspapers, slathering each other with blood-red paint, and clutching the bodies of dead fish and raw chickens. Seen in blurry film montage, the work is a landmark, but also a period artifact. It again confirms the painterly impulse behind the artist\u2019s work: here she turns bodies into brushes. But of far more interest, with its mingling of creaturely flesh, living and dead, is the work\u2019s deep investment in ideas of transience and mortality.\n\nIf \u201cMeat Joy,\u201d which she termed \u201ckinetic theater,\u201d reflected the liberationist spirit of the proto-feminist early-60s, other work tapped into darker political realities, namely the war in Vietnam. In a flickering 1965 film called \u201cViet-Flakes,\u201d the artist\u2019s camera scans newspaper clips of battlefield atrocities as if from a fighter-plane perspective. Two years later, she incorporated this film into a performance piece called \u201cSnows,\u201d in which the audience had a role in dictating which live photo-derived tableaus would be staged.\n\nMost of her theater work, documented in photographs or on film, exists only as ghost traces in the show, organized by Sabine Breitwieser, of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, and Branden W. Joseph, a professor at Columbia University, along with Erica Papernik-Shimizu and Oliver Shultz of MoMA PS1. Yet some images, such as shots of the solo piece \u201cInterior Scroll,\u201d still startle. For the 1975 performance, the artist stood alone on a table, nude, posing like a studio model, and reading aloud from a book of her collected writings, \u201cCezanne, She Was A Great Painter,\u201d which includes a litany of misogynistic reactions a female artist could expect to encounter in her career:\n\n\u201cBE PREPARED:\n\nto have your brain picked\n\nto have the pickings misunderstood\n\nto be mistreated whether your success\n\nincreases or decreases\n\nif you are a woman (and things are not utterly changed)\n\nthey will almost never believe you really did it\n\n(what you did do)\n\nthey will patronize you humor you\n\ntry to sleep with you want you to transform them\n\nwith your energy\u201d\n\nShe then put the book down and slowly extracted a narrow strip of folded typewritten paper from her vagina, reading the text on the scroll as it emerged. It included, among other things, a direct appeal to a film historian \u2014 female, as it happened \u2014 who had been dismissive of her work, as a sizeable swath of the art world was at that time.\n\nMs. Schneemann has consistently run into resistance, often from conflicting directions. Some feminists have viewed her body-positive art as exploitive in an old, essentializing way, failing to see the claim to power implicit in her erotic self-portraiture. Yet in 1969 at Cannes, when she screened her film \u201cFuses,\u201d with its images of the artist and Mr. Tenney having sex, male critics were furious: the film wasn\u2019t pornographic enough for their taste.", "title": "Shock of the Nude", "authors": ["Holland Cotter"]}

Ethics, in its classical sense, was about being a good person \u2014 and living a good life. (The first thing being part of the second.) It was meant for everyday use. The point is that you\u2019re a participant in the situation you describe; your own prospects have to be considered, too.\n\nAnd suppose that by turning in these cheaters, you became a pariah; would you have helped or hurt the social norm of honesty? Still, there may be things you can do. You might write to the head of your school board and say that cheating is happening and not being detected. (Consult your parents first, of course.) In an ideal world, students could be trusted to refrain from cheating because, like you, they value honesty. But we\u2019re probably headed toward a world that\u2019s simply less dependent on trust: no unsupervised tests, regular use of plagiarism checkers and statistical methods for detecting cheaters; stiff penalties for those who are caught. Given this reality, you might suggest some simple measures that could be taken. For starters, it\u2019s not too much to ask that teachers stay in the room when an exam is being given.\n\nI used to play rugby in college. Two of my old teammates are now assistant coaches for the team. Recently, one of the players got wasted and then fell and hit her head getting out of her friend\u2019s car. She hit it hard enough to cause bleeding. Her friends called an ambulance.\n\nI heard about this from one of the assistant coaches. The team is going to championships soon, and so everyone is practicing even more than before. I told my friend, one of the assistant coaches, that she should have the woman take the concussion test again, even though the injury wasn\u2019t rugby-related. My best friend blew it off. I also texted the head coach, who also brushed it off.\n\nI find this deeply troubling, because it involves head trauma. I believe that the young woman should be looked at for her own health and recovery. It\u2019s the safest bet in my view.\n\nBecause I am no longer part of the team, do I have a right to speak up? If so, what should the next steps be? Name Withheld\n\nYou\u2019ve been told that this young woman hit her head and went in an ambulance to the hospital. Given the nature of the accident, she was presumably checked for a concussion. Your view is that she should be checked again. I\u2019m no physician, but because she was treated in an emergency room, we should assume that the doctor there would have told her if she needed to return for another examination. If the doctor didn\u2019t tell her that, I can\u2019t see why she has more reason to check than anyone else on her team.\n\nIt has been a great many years since I\u2019ve played rugby, but I know that given the nature of the sport, there will be a risk of concussion during practice and, especially, during play. So the coaches should be keeping an eye out for head impacts and for the symptoms of concussion. Still, you have no reason to think that the professionals involved here \u2014 in the hospital or on the field \u2014 haven\u2019t been doing their job. Especially given that you have no professional responsibilities in relation to the team, you\u2019re in no position to substitute your judgment for theirs.", "title": "Should I Tell on My Cheating Classmates?", "authors": []}

The battle started in early 2016, when Idaho was working to update its decade-old science standards for kindergarten through 12th grade, which outside education groups said were out of date.

Researchers have found similar plateaus in the 800-meter run, high jump, shot put and signs of plateauing in many other sports. Athletes still set some records, but barely. Last year, the Russian skater Denis Yuskov broke the nearly decade-old 1,500-meter race record, shaving 0.02 seconds off the finishing time. \u2026 Without as much of a physical edge over previous generations, athletes found gains using a new weapon: technology. In speedskating, the best example is the clap skate. Used widely by 1997, its hinged blade maintains contact with the ice longer during each stride, resulting in a more powerful thrust. Next came multi-fabric bodysuits. A version introduced in 2002 reduced drag by more than half a second in the 1,000-meter race, according to research that was supported by Nike, which made the suit. Bodysuits of the future could include 3D printing, which is being used to make track apparel with raised protrusions that produce \u201can incredible reduction in drag,\u201d according to researcher Len Brownlie of Simon Fraser University, who also consults for Nike.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Are you convinced by the authors that we have reached \u201cPeak Olympics\u201d?

Huawei, the Chinese manufacturer, was the No. 3 phone maker in the fourth quarter last year, IDC, a research firm, said. Sales of cheaper Honor smartphones and other low-end devices contributed to the company\u2019s growth.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd there\u2019s a silver lining for those who want to spend less: Cheaper smartphones have never been better. If you spend between $200 and $300, you can get a capable, fast smartphone for basic tasks like placing calls, using maps and sending texts. Of course, there are trade-offs, like lower-quality screens and less impressive cameras.\n\nIs a budget phone right for you? Here\u2019s an overview on the pros and cons of going cheap, with some phone recommendations from Wirecutter, a New York Times company that tests products.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nLet\u2019s start with the downsides of buying a cheaper phone.\n\n\u25a0 You won\u2019t get the best camera. Budget phones lack the advanced camera sensors found on high-end smartphones. So if you go cheap, your phone camera probably won\u2019t be very fast, won\u2019t do a great job at taking photos in low light and will lack features like optical image stabilization, which helps photos remain clear even when your hands are shaky. \u201dThe camera is a big one,\u201d said Andrew Cunningham, a Wirecutter editor. \u201cIf you\u2019re taking photos, especially in low light, performance is going to fall off a cliff.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Obviously, you won\u2019t get cutting-edge features like the infrared face recognition system on the iPhone X or the fancy stylus on Samsung\u2019s big-screen Galaxy Note. You also won\u2019t get the fastest computing processor, so your phone won\u2019t be as capable of running games with heavy graphics.\n\n\u25a0 You also won\u2019t get the brightest and most vibrant display. The fanciest smartphones have OLED screens, which have better color accuracy and contrast.\n\n\u25a0 You won\u2019t get many software updates, which are important because they introduce new features and security enhancements. For phone makers, the priority is issuing big software updates to more powerful smartphones. At best, with a cheap Android phone you will probably get one major software update and a few security updates over 18 months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith all that said, there are plenty of benefits to buying a good budget phone.\n\n\u25a0 You will get a decent camera. Many cheaper phones have high-resolution sensors that can take clear, rich photos. \u201cA cheap phone today is going to have a better camera than a cheap phone from three years ago,\u201d said Nathan Edwards, a senior editor for Wirecutter. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re truly awful.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

Budget phones still use LCD, an older display technology that has greatly matured and still looks quite good.\n\n\u25a0 Your phone will be fast enough for important tasks like placing calls, sending and receiving email, browsing the web and running lightweight apps. If you aren\u2019t an app-aholic or a gamer, maybe that is all you will need.\n\nSo here\u2019s the upshot. There is a strong argument for spending more on your smartphone: If it is your most important technology tool for work and play, you should probably invest in a superior device. But if you want a phone only for basic tasks and you\u2019re not in a hurry to adopt the latest and greatest technology, a cheaper phone may serve you well.\n\nPicking the Right One\n\nNow comes the tough part: picking a good budget phone and avoiding the duds. Wirecutter tested 20 of the best budget smartphones over the last few years to highlight a few. Expect to spend roughly $200.\n\nWirecutter\u2019s top budget phone is Motorola\u2019s Moto G5 Plus, which costs about $230. It has a high-quality camera, a good 5.2-inch screen, a fast fingerprint sensor and plenty of storage. The device also comes unlocked, meaning it works with all American carriers. (If you want to spend a bit more, you could buy the Moto X4, which is water-resistant and on sale for $300, down from $400.)\n\nWirecutter also highlighted Huawei\u2019s $200 Honor 7X, which has a better camera and bigger screen than the Moto G5 Plus. The downside is it runs an older version of the Android operating system, called Nougat.\n\nAnother option, if you prefer iPhones, is to buy an older iPhone model. Apple is still selling the iPhone 6s, introduced in 2015, which is reasonably fast with a nice camera and a good screen. It costs $449 through Apple, but you may find it much cheaper elsewhere. What\u2019s more, Apple typically supports its iPhones for about five years, so the 6s should continue to get software updates through 2020.\n\n\u201cA lot of things you\u2019d have to pay 600 or 700 bucks for three or four years ago, you\u2019ll get for $200 or less now,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cIf you just want the basics, a budget phone is going to do just fine for most people.\u201d", "title": "Should You Get a Cheaper Phone?

Ms. Hwang said it was probably for the best. \u201cI think it would have been a diss if we didn\u2019t even invite him at all,\u201d she said. \u201cBut maybe it would have been a little awkward if he was there. I told him some intimate things about myself.\u201d\n\nCristina Garcia, a 38-year-old dietitian and wellness consultant in Austin, Tex., who is happily married with children, was shocked when her high school sweetheart hand-delivered an invitation to his wedding. \u201cI knew he was dating someone and they were serious, and I was happy for him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I never expected the wife would be cool with inviting me to the wedding.\u201d\n\nShe attended and found the experience baffling. \u201cThe doors opened, the bride is there, and he was looking for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOur eyes locked. Then they continued with the ceremony, and I congratulated them after and watched them do their first dance. Maybe it was his version of closure.\u201d She added that it was a moment she will never forget for her entire life.\n\nThen there are the people left out of the festivities.\n\nJessica Birch, a 33-year-old special education teacher in Manhattan, felt isolated when she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding of an ex-boyfriend from college who ended up dating and later marrying a mutual friend. \u201cWe were all part of the same clique in our rowing club,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was similar to any club where you have both guys and girls. You all just end up dating each other at some point.\u201d\n\nShe found out she wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding when other mutual friends inquired whether she was going. \u201cI played it off not like I wasn\u2019t invited but that I couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw all my friends at the wedding on Facebook. It really sucked.\u201d\n\nWhile couples shouldn\u2019t invite an ex to their wedding just because he or she may feel left out, there are some motivations that are more respectful and more kind than others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAre you all friends now and the bride or groom is just jealous? If that\u2019s the case, that is a sign of bigger problems to come. That person is going to be jealous of co-workers and family members down the line,\u201d Ms. Gottsman said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a declaration that this is a fresh start for us, we are keeping it limited to close family and friends, that is different.\u201d\n\nOf course, not every situation with an ex is tricky. When Laurel Niedospial, a 33-year-old freelance writer in Chicago got married on June 17, 2012, she had no hesitation about inviting her ex-boyfriend, who was already married to her close friend, to the wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she said. \u201cI stopped thinking about him as an ex-boyfriend years before that.\u201d\n\nHe ended up being useful. When there was miscommunication with the wedding planner about making arrangements for a s\u2019mores bar, her ex picked up the skewers and ran the whole station, helping guests spread peanut butter and marshmallows on their graham crackers.\n\nShe had no doubt that she made the right decision in what could have been an awkward situation for others. \u201cThere were no feelings there,\u201d she said of the former romance. \u201cHe managed to save the day.\u201d", "title": "Should You Invite Your Ex to the Wedding?", "authors": ["Alyson Krueger"]}

On average, he said, his team cleans everything from the galley, floor, lavatories, seats and windows on more than a dozen airplanes every workday. \u201cTo clean, we need 10 to 15 minutes, but they give us seven or six,\u201d or even less time for quick turns, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big pressure for us.

You go down and look under the seats and go up, jumping in the overhead.\u201d\n\nCabin cleaners are also responsible for conducting periodic security sweeps in the airplanes, but Mr. Yousef said that he and his team are not given flashlights or mirrors for the task. He uses the flashlight on his own mobile phone.\n\nA report in 2015 by the Government Accountability Office detailed the \u201climited time\u201d cleaners have before passengers for the next flight begin boarding, and noted that cleaners might need to request more time for \u201cadditional cleaning necessary to decontaminate the aircraft.\u201d Cleaners told the G.A.O. that \u201cafter incidents when a traveler became ill during a flight, the cabin crew does not always notify them of potentially infectious bodily fluids that had contaminated the aircraft.\u201d The report concluded that the United States lacks \u201ca comprehensive national aviation-preparedness plan aimed at preventing and containing the spread of diseases through air travel.\u201d\n\nMichael Ostendorf, a senior vice president for aviation operations at ABM, said that the company cleans a variety of airplanes for United, American, Delta, Southwest and other airlines and that a typical turn time should be 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\u201cNow, during an operation that could change, it could get better, or it could get worse depending on the airline\u2019s on-time performance for that day,\u201d he said.

He said federal rules prohibited him from discussing the equipment ABM provides to cabin cleaners for security sweeps.\n\nRobert W. Mann Jr., an aviation consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y., said that a clean or dirty cabin is the first thing passengers take note of and that it colors their entire experience. \u201cWhen customers perceive cleanliness problems they conflate that with a perception that an airline might not be maintaining its airplanes, which is not a good thing,\u201d Mr. Mann said. But he noted that modern cabin designs are easier to clean because they don\u2019t have as many \u201cgrooves and recesses that tend to just collect dirt.\u201d", "title": "Should You Worry About Getting Sick From a Plane Flight?

Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. On Sunday, Mr. Sumwalt criticized the lack of the safety system on the track, saying that the technology could have prevented the accident, which killed an Amtrak engineer and a conductor.\n\nWith the railway\u2019s regular signal system inoperable, the Amtrak train would have navigated the track with help from a dispatcher at CSX, which owns and operates the railway in Cayce, S.C., just south of Columbus, Mr. Sumwalt said. Federal investigators interviewed the dispatcher on Monday but did not disclose what was said.\n\nStill, Mr. Sumwalt cautioned against casting all the blame for the accident on the crew that flipped the manual switch. He said that the Amtrak engineer on the train should have also noticed that the switch was positioned in the wrong direction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe investigation into the cause of the crash is far from over, and Mr. Sumwalt said that investigators would quite likely remain at the scene through the weekend. Nonetheless officials released some new details on Monday about the moments before Amtrak Train 91 rammed into the freight locomotive, the latest passenger train crash to deepen concerns about public rail safety in the United States.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before the crash, a CSX crew helping to move the freight train had flipped the switch and locked it in that direction with a padlock, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to find out why this switch was in that position,\u201d Mr. Sumwalt said.\n\nWhen the Amtrak train traveling south reached the switch about 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, the passenger train veered off the main railway and onto the side track.

{"date": "2018-02-10 00:00:00", "text": "Single motherhood is one of four major risks of poverty, which also include unemployment, low levels of education and forming households at young ages. Our research demonstrates a broader point about the risks of poverty. Poverty in America is not unusually high because more people have more of these risk factors. They are actually less common here than they are in the typical rich democracy, and fewer Americans carry these risks today than they did in 1970 or 1980. Even if one infers that risk factors result from bad choices and behaviors, Americans apparently make fewer such choices and engage in fewer such behaviors than people in other rich democracies or than Americans in the past.\n\nThe reality is we have unusually high poverty because we have unusually high penalties for all four of these risk factors. For example, if you lack a high school degree in the United States, it increases the probability of your being in poverty by 16.4 percent. In the 28 other rich democracies, a lack of education increases the probability of poverty by less than 5 percent on average. No other country penalizes the less educated nearly as much as we do.\n\nMore generous social policies would reduce the penalty for all four risk factors. In fact, increasing the generosity of American social policies would lower poverty more than increasing high school graduation or employment, and more than decreasing the number of people heading a household at a young age or the number of single mothers. Nor would reducing these penalties encourage people to drop out of high school, be unemployed, form households too young or become single mothers.\n\nUltimately, there simply aren\u2019t enough single mothers to explain our high poverty. Even if they all married or never had children, poverty would not be substantially lower. We should stop obsessing over how many single mothers there are and stop shaming them.\n\nInstead \u2014 even though we all get sick of hearing about how great Scandinavian countries are at handling these issues \u2014 we should be following the lead of countries like Denmark. If we did, we could reduce poverty among all American families, including those headed by single mothers. No amount of stigmatization could do the same. Rather than falsely claiming that single motherhood is a major cause of poverty, we should support single mothers in raising America\u2019s children.", "title": "Opinion | Single Mothers Are Not the Problem", "authors": []}

The barriers now have evolved into something more figurative. For 20 years, the sisters have lived in a convent isolated from a bustling corridor of shopping centers, offices and restaurants by a blanket of trees and a serpentine asphalt road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so quiet and peaceful,\u201d Sister Marie Aim\u00e9e said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re in the country.\u201d\n\nBut the sisters\u2019 opposition has also made them targets and they have been named as defendants, along with the town, in a $26 million federal lawsuit brought by the developer.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the center of the dispute is a two-acre site in Edgemont, an upscale hamlet of 7,500 in Greenburgh, not too far north of New York City. The site was zoned as part of a nearby commercial district in which multifamily housing could be built, but opponents have argued that the classification was the result of a clerical error, and it was intended for single-family homes. The sisters, in a counterclaim, are attempting to enforce a century-old residential covenant to thwart construction.\n\nThe developer, S & R Development Estates, had initially planned a four-story building with market-rate apartments after buying the property in 2006, according to court records. But later, as the dispute stretched over several years, the company shifted its plans to consist entirely of affordable housing units.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the company argues that the town and its residents conspired to keep out poorer and minority families \u2014 raising a thorny accusation in Westchester, which has had an especially difficult history of not-in-my-backyard fights over low-income housing. In 2009, the county reached a landmark desegregation agreement forcing it to develop hundreds of affordable housing units under the oversight of a federal monitor. (Town officials and others deny the accusation, arguing that the site is simply unsuitable for multifamily housing.)\n\nThe company, in a statement, described the development as having the potential to \u201cbecome a model for affordable housing.\u201d The company also contends that it would have minimal impact on its neighbors, with 255 feet between the 45-unit development and the convent and plans to include 41 trees and 183 shrubs as a buffer. Construction is on hold, pending the litigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe tree-lined development,\u201d the company said, \u201cis designed to be consistent with the surrounding neighborhood, and the development will feature areas for social, educational and recreational opportunities that are perfect for families.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe property sits on Dromore Road, a short roadway slithering uphill to the convent and a nature center. Dromore splinters off a busy thoroughfare, but all the commotion is hidden by a shroud of nature. The sisters regularly spot foxes and hawks, and turkeys have waddled up to their back door.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s the closest thing to heaven,\u201d said Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh town supervisor for more than 25 years.\n\nAs a cloistered order, aside from doctor visits and an occasional errand, the sisters\u2019 lives are confined to the convent. The level of the order\u2019s isolation was relaxed in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council, a sweeping set of reforms in the Roman Catholic Church known as Vatican II. Sister Marie Aim\u00e9e remembered the grille being brought down by a sister wielding an electric saw. \u201cI said, Holy Toledo!\u201d she recalled.\n\nBut even without the physical barriers, a peaceful cocoon to pray in solitude was no less important.\n\nBefore moving to Greenburgh in 1998, the order had a convent in an increasingly congested Yonkers neighborhood where they would have to pause their prayers for passing sirens. After a lengthy search, the sisters found the seven-acre property. The convent includes a large home that was expanded to include the chapel and a cottage for visitors.\n\nIn the United States, most sisters are considered part of \u201cactive\u201d orders, meaning their vows are defined by service \u2014 historically, that has meant as teachers and nurses, but has expanded over time, into providing social services and even protesting the death penalty. \u201cMany sisters have positioned themselves on the edge of society,\u201d said Kathleen Sprows Cummings, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame.", "title": "Sisters\u2019 Quiet Life of Prayer Disrupted by an Affordable Housing Fight", "authors": ["Rick Rojas"]}

The tensions in that period between the city\u2019s British and Pakistani people provide both the conflict and warmth that fuel this story of a young Pakistani man (Gordon Warnecke) who takes over his uncle\u2019s launderette with the help of his friend and eventual lover (a young Daniel Day-Lewis).

Set in May 1940, when the British war effort had reached a crucial inflection point, \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d follows the newly minted Prime Minister Winston Churchill as he overcomes intense political opposition and recommits the country to fighting the Nazi threat. As Churchill, Gary Oldman emerges from a heavy pile of latex \u2014 to say nothing of the haze of liquor and cigar smoke that trailed the historical Churchill \u2014 and powerfully asserts the country\u2019s willingness to sustain heavy losses in defense of its values.\n\nOldman\u2019s performance, which earned him a best-actor nomination, seems the element of \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d most likely to win a major Oscar. But the film scored five other nominations, including best picture, best production design, best cinematography, best makeup and hairstyling, and best costume design. \u201cDunkirk\u201d is only the most obvious film to compare it with, and their similarities end mostly with the subject matter.

The scene pays homage to the nationalist grit expressed through Churchill\u2019s speech to the House of Commons \u2014 \u201cWe shall go on to the end,\u201d and so on \u2014 but it also keys into the experience of an individual soldier (James McAvoy), who can think only about getting back to the woman he loves (Keira Knightley). Based the novel by Ian McEwan, \u201cAtonement\u201d has the elegance and sweep of a classic wartime romance, in which the emotion intensifies with each falling bomb. But it\u2019s also a literate period piece about the tragic ramifications of one falsely witnessed moment.\n\nIf You Want More Winston Churchill\n\nAlbert Finney in \u201cThe Gathering Storm.\u201d David James/HBO\n\n\u2018The Gathering Storm\u2019 (2002)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime, HBO\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cDarkest Hour\u201d opens as Churchill succeeds Neville Chamberlain as British prime minister, amid fierce debate over whether to seek a treaty with Nazi Germany. Produced for HBO and the BBC, \u201cThe Gathering Storm\u201d catches up with Churchill six years earlier, when he was plugging away on a biography on the Duke of Marlborough at his home in Chartwell, in rural Kent.\n\n0\n\nAs the title suggests, the film is about Churchill\u2019s growing alarm over German rearmament under Adolf Hitler and his difficult return to relevance, aided by government officials like Ralph Wigram (Linus Roache) who share his concerns and reject the appeasement policies of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (Derek Jacobi). Albert Finney won an Emmy for his dyspeptic Churchill \u2014 as did Brendan Gleeson\u2019s Churchill in the lesser 2009 sequel, \u201cInto the Storm\u201d\u2014 and Vanessa Redgrave lends fine support as his wife, Clemmie, whose faith in her husband sometimes wavers dramatically.\n\nIf You Want More About British Life During the War\n\nGreer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in \u201cMrs. Miniver.\u201d MGM\n\n\u2018Mrs. Miniver\u2019 (1942)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn \u201cDarkest Hour,\u201d Wright and his screenwriter, Anthony McCarten, granted themselves the poetic license to imagine a scene in which Churchill rides the tube, where he surveys ordinary Londoners about staying in the war. Their stout refusal to give up recalls the well-to-do characters in William Wyler\u2019s \u201cMrs. Miniver,\u201d whose cushy lives in a village outside London are ruptured by encroaching German forces.\n\nWyler went on to make the definitive coming-home drama, \u201cThe Best Years of Our Lives,\u201d four years later. But \u201cMrs. Miniver\u201d depicts another aspect of the home front in this story of a decent, loving family that shows courage and resilience when duty calls. The father (Walter Pidgeon) adds his boat to the evacuation effort at Dunkirk, the mother (Greer Garson) squares off with a German pilot who crash-lands in her garden, and their son (Richard Ney) leaves his fianc\u00e9e behind to enlist in the Royal Air Force.

For all of Wright\u2019s cinematic brio, \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d takes place almost wholly in tight quarters, to the point where a side journey to the London Underground feels like a respite. The third in a biographical trilogy that includes \u201cTaurus,\u201d about Vladimir Lenin, and \u201cMoloch,\u201d about Hitler, Alexander Sokurov\u2019s \u201cThe Sun\u201d (first released overseas in 2005) takes place in Japan during the waning days of World War II, as Emperor Hirohito (Issey Ogata) prepares not only for surrender but also for renouncing his perceived divinity.\n\nFilming through filters that seem coated in ash, Sokurov emphasizes the human qualities of a greatly diminished man as he putters around a bunker in the Imperial Palace, awaiting his inevitable humbling. But while Sokurov maintains the extreme austerity of his previous work, \u201cThe Sun\u201d allows for blessed moments of culture-clash humor, as when Hirohito meets a boorish Gen. Douglas MacArthur and puzzles over his gift of Hershey bars.\n\nIf You Want More Gary Oldman in Thick Makeup\n\nGary Oldman in \u201cDracula.\u201d Columbia Pictures\n\n\u2018Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\u2019 (1992)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMuch has been made of the four-hour makeup sessions that turned the gaunt Oldman into a jowly Churchill, but it\u2019s not as if Oldman hadn\u2019t put in the time before. In this hugely underrated gothic horror film from Francis Ford Coppola, Oldman is transformed from a dashing 15th century conqueror to a centuries-old creature of the night, but the effects don\u2019t smother a performance that\u2019s suffused with bloody terror and romantic woe.\n\nPast Draculas like Max Schreck in F.W. Murnau\u2019s \u201cNosferatu\u201d or Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog\u2019s \u201cNosferatu the Vampyre\u201d have played up the grotesque menace of the living dead, but Oldman and Coppola\u2019s interpretation is more haunting and sad, as the Count attempts to reclaim a lost love for eternity. Oldman is the standout in an unsteady ensemble, and he\u2019s supported by Coppola\u2019s ravishing visual conceit, which flashes back to early cinema through Michael Ballhaus\u2019s old-fashioned in-camera effects and looks forward with Eiko Ishioka\u2019s avant-garde costume design.\n\nIf You Want Another Tribute to the Power of Words\n\nColin Firth in \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech.\u201d Laurie Sparham/Weinstein Company\n\n\u2018The King\u2019s Speech\u2019 (2010)\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAt bottom, \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d is about the importance of political rhetoric, especially at those difficult times when language is necessary to rally the masses; Churchill\u2019s conviction that the Nazis must not be appeased may not have taken root otherwise. \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d is about another British leader who needs to sell the same message, this time King George VI (Colin Firth), who has to work through a terrible stammer before he broadcasts Britain\u2019s declaration of war over the radio in 1939.\n\n0\n\nThe heart of the film is the relationship between King George, known informally as \u201cBertie,\u201d and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian who has experience in ironing out speech defects but no formal or medical expertise. Director Tom Hooper never met a wide-angle shot he couldn\u2019t frame distractingly, but the back-and-forth between Firth and Rush bristles with tension and wit.\n\nIf you loved \u201cDunkirk\u201d as well, here are six films to watch next; we also have six more to watch with \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d", "title": "Six Films to Stream if You Loved \u2018Darkest Hour\u2019", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"]}

His third feature, \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d has similar dark-comic underpinnings, but it tones down the laughs and expands the moments of quiet pathos. It has also received seven Oscar nods, including one for best picture and three in acting: for Frances McDormand as the justice-seeking mother; for Woody Harrelson as the small-town police chief; and for Sam Rockwell as a racist, thuggish officer.\n\nAs with most of McDonagh\u2019s work, \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is ultimately about posturing, as the grieving mother and the local cops back themselves into separate corners over the unsolved murder of a teenage girl.

The billboards rile her neighbors, reopening old wounds and exposing grim secrets. This idea of a citizen who blurts out uncomfortable truths about her small-town community recalls the \u201cpoison pen\u201d letters in the French melodrama \u201cLe Corbeau\u201d by Henri-Georges Clouzot, in which an anonymous whistle-blower nicknamed the Raven exposes local secrets including extramarital affairs and illegal abortions. Civic harmony is a fragile thing, whether in a World War II-era European village or in 21st-century Middle America. And it is often held together by a thin net of shared lies.\n\nIf You\u2019re Fascinated by the Setting\n\nJennifer Lawrence in \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone.\u201d Sebastian Mlynarski/Roadside Attractions\n\n\u2018Winter\u2019s Bone\u2019 (2010)\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt\u2019s never made entirely clear, but Ebbing appears to be the kind of quaint little mountain town that might derive a lot of its income from visitors \u2014 tourists who are passing through to hunt, fish and camp. In other words, it\u2019s a cleaned-up version of the hardscrabble Missouri Ozarks community where Ree Dolly dwells in the magnificent rural noir \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone,\u201d directed by Debra Granik (who also helped write the screenplay). Jennifer Lawrence earned a best-actress Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ree, who, like Mildred Hayes, is a woman wronged by the law.

Set in the early 2000s, the film follows a creatively frustrated high-school senior, who\u2019s yearning to break free from her family and from Sacramento. Her plan is to escape to a pricey East Coast college her mom insists they can\u2019t afford. But any girl who renames herself Lady Bird is going to follow her own path.\n\n\u201cLady Bird\u201d is up for five Academy Awards, including best picture, best actress (for Saoirse Ronan) and best director for Gerwig \u2014 only the fifth time in Oscar history that a female director has earned an Oscar nomination. As refreshing as \u201cLady Bird\u201d is, the film comes from a long line of movies about headstrong young women.

Likewise in \u201cThe Edge of Seventeen,\u201d it\u2019s the troubled relationship between Nadine (Hailee Steinfeld) and her mom (Kyra Sedgwick). As in \u201cLady Bird,\u201d the drama doesn\u2019t stop at home, as Nadine struggles through an also awkward adolescent romance and a broken friendship. Meanwhile, her mother either can\u2019t or refuses to understand her daughter\u2019s behavior: The two of them fight, bicker and snipe at each other in almost every shared moment. In one scene, Nadine even steals her mom\u2019s car to escape an argument. Luckily, that\u2019s not the last word in a movie full of warm supporting characters like her caring teacher (Woody Harrelson) and a cute boyfriend (Hayden Szeto).\n\nIf You Wonder What Inspired It\n\nJon Cryer and Molly Ringwald in \u201cPretty in Pink.\u201d Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018Pretty in Pink\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAhead of the release of \u201cLady Bird,\u201d Gerwig curated a series of movies for Quad Cinema, in New York City, that influenced her debut film. As part of the program, she chose this \u201980s teen classic written by John Hughes. Like Lady Bird, Molly Ringwald\u2019s character, Andie, is a creative but frustrated high-school senior who feels embarrassed by her family\u2019s working-class background. She desperately wants to fit in with her wealthier classmates, and she tries her best with her D.I.Y. thrift-store aesthetic. Also like Lady Bird, Andie finds support from a well-meaning dad (tenderly played by Harry Dean Stanton) who\u2019s struggling with depression. Andie makes the best of a tough situation, even if fans still debate whether she makes the right choice for prom between the rich guy she likes or her quirky best friend.\n\n0\n\nIf You Loved the Story\n\nAmerica Ferrera, left, and Lupe Ontiveros in \u201cReal Women Have Curves.\u201d Nicola Goode/HBO Independent Productions\n\n\u2018Real Women Have Curves\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: HBO, Amazon\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cLady Bird\u201d and \u201cReal Women Have Curves\u201d share so many similarities that some critics, including the \u201cCurves\u201d writer Josefina L\u00f3pez, have accused Gerwig of copying elements of this 2002 movie. Both movies follow a promising high-school senior from California who dreams of going to college in New York, but whose mom won\u2019t let her. In \u201cCurves,\u201d the protagonist is Ana (America Ferrera), a gifted Mexican-American student whose mother forbids her from leaving their home in East Los Angeles for college. As the title suggests, the movie also tackles issues of body image and self-acceptance, as Ana\u2019s mother constantly criticizes Ana about her weight and about other aspects of her life. And yet there is hope for Ana as she struggles to make her own way, thanks to a supportive father and an encouraging teacher. The easygoing pace of \u201cCurves\u201d allows Ferrera a lot of time to work through her character\u2019s doubts and fears, and an awkward first romance.\n\nIf You Want Another Female-Led Coming-Of-Age Drama\n\nPernell Walker in \u201cPariah.\u201d Focus Features\n\n\u2018Pariah\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNothing says growing up like rebelling against your parents, and in the case of \u201cPariah,\u201d rebellion is practically a necessity. Alike (Adepero Oduye) is a 17-year-old black poet discovering her sexuality. Her much more conservative mother pushes Alike to hang out with a friend from church, with whom Alike finds more comfort in her identity as a lesbian. Despite her tenuous relationship with her mom, Alike bonds easily with her dad, who\u2019s much more lenient about her choice to wear men\u2019s clothes or spend time with friends her mom does not like. Although, he writes off Alike\u2019s behavior as a phase instead of her sexual identity, which causes problems later. Dee Rees, who more recently directed the Oscar-nominated \u201cMudbound,\u201d made her narrative debut with this powerful drama about family and acceptance.\n\nIf You Liked the Awkward Teen Romance\n\nKirsten Dunst and Josh Hartnett in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d Paramount Classics\n\n\u2018The Virgin Suicides\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Starz, Amazon, iTunes\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSofia Coppola spun together tragedy and whimsy for her directorial debut, \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d Set in a Detroit suburb in the 1970s, the movie follows a group of boys who fall for the five Lisbon sisters (one of whom is played by Kirsten Dunst), all of whom are kept watch over by their prohibitively strict Catholic parents. After the youngest Lisbon girl tries to kill herself, their parents take the sisters out of school and lock them away from the outside world. Not that that has ever stopped teenagers from finding ways to sneak around. The courtship of the girls is made even more awkward by their increasing sense of isolation, depression and desperation. The film looks like a dream \u2014 almost too pretty for a film filled with so much sadness \u2014 but it\u2019s a reflection of the fantastical way the boys view these girls. In one scene, a doctor tells the youngest Lisbon girl she doesn\u2019t know how bad life can get. She answers him, \u201cObviously doctor, you\u2019ve never been a 13-year-old girl.\u201d\n\nIf You Loved the Movie\u2019s Take on Friendship\n\nFrom left, Anita Skinner, Bob Balaban and Melanie Mayron in \u201cGirlfriends.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection\n\n\u2018Girlfriends\u2019\n\nWhere to watch: Vudu\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSometimes being best friends means having to say you\u2019re sorry \u2014 a prominent theme in \u201cLady Bird\u201d and shared by this fantastic independent film set in New York City in the gritty 1970s. The characters in \u201cGirlfriends\u201d may be a few years older than Lady Bird and her best friend, but they face some of the same problems: guys, money and what to do with their future. Susan (Melanie Mayron) is a struggling photographer sharing her rundown New York City apartment with her best friend and writer, Anne. The two have a falling out when Anne decides to move in with her boyfriend, and Susan is left to figure out what to do about her flailing photography career and their apartment. \u201cGirlfriends\u201d was made with very little money but a fondness for Susan\u2019s story and a great supporting cast (including Eli Wallach, Bob Balaban and Christopher Guest).

He has won five world championships across three different events, he is a four-time Olympian, and his five World Cup season-long titles in giant slalom make him one of the greatest racers in the history of that discipline.\n\nHe introduced giant slalom techniques that were considered revolutionary, tactics his rivals toiled for years to replicate. Outspoken and at times a provocateur, for a dozen years he was a magnetic personality on the World Cup circuit and one of the few American stars who bridged the gap from the Bode Miller era to the budding Mikaela Shiffrin era.\n\nLigety also worked hard to drag ski racing out of tedious, old-style ways. He co-founded a helmet, eyewear and snow sports accessories company called Shred that was aimed at, as he said, \u201cbringing a youthful vibe back to skiing \u2014 something the snowboarding movement stole from us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLigety was also at the center of a quarrel with the European-based ski establishment, a battle he ultimately won and probably lost at the same time.\n\nLigety had been the leading World Cup giant slalom racer for several years when F.I.S., as the ski racing\u2019s international governing body is known by its French initials, decided to lengthen the minimum ski length racers were permitted to use in the giant slalom.\n\nThe longer skis meant that turning around the gates would take more time and effort and Ligety immediately railed against the changes in an insightful blog post that was also a stinging poke in the eye for the federation\u2019s leaders.\n\nLigety, always one to tinker with his equipment, then decided to study his new skis with the meticulous eye of the engineer he never became. To further his examination, he also came up with gadgets that were meant to give him more data, like a curved post he affixed to his helmet on which he placed a mini-camera so he could better analyze his own skiing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

He stunned the field in the first race with the new skis, winning by nearly three seconds over the second-place finisher, an almost unheard-of margin of victory.\n\nThroughout the next two seasons, Ligety continued to dominate giant slalom on the World Cup. He also won the giant slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nBut ultimately, the longer skis, and perhaps the new and more demanding methods used to turn them rapidly, put added stress on the torso and legs of giant slalom racers, many of whom were suddenly experiencing debilitating lower body injuries. In early 2016, Ligety tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in a training session. Almost exactly one year later, he had back surgery meant to alleviate severe pain he had been dealing with for many months.\n\nBefore this season, the federation reduced the minimum lengths for giant slalom skis.\n\nLigety, however, who has shown flashes of his old self, has yet to regain his form in a consistent manner.

Running back and forth between stove and table, Mr. Poulmentis excitedly described the ingredients, saying more than once, hands pressed to his chest: \u201cYou are eating my heart. This is made with my heart.\u201d\n\nFor starters, there was a seaweed-like plant called kritamo, plentiful on the island of Ikaria, volvi onions from Crete (pickled with balsamic vinegar) and sliced charcoal-grilled octopus over black-eyed peas. A black taramosalata (caviar spread) made with herring roe, truffles and squid ink, was tart, delicious and unlike anything anyone at the table had ever tasted. Meeting it head on was a big pour of Theon Dora, an organic white wine from Crete which means \u201cGod\u2019s gifts.\u201d\n\nThe wine is from a small grower with only three hectares (about 7.5 acres), said Aris Soultanos, an importer whose company, Eklektikon, specializes in Greek natural wines. \u201cThis is an explosive wine with high acidity and high alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cChef Niko\u2019s recipes have a lot of emotion in them, so we want to choose wines that have a big personality and a clear sense of place.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe chef explained that even the thick, crusty honeycombed bread he was serving (made with a yellow flour from the island of Lemnos) was not something you find in America \u2014 not even in the Greek places in Astoria. With a quick flourish, Mr. Soultanos pulled out a Terra Ambera, a natural wine from Lemnos made from white muscat grapes. The flavor was flowery, like a mouthful of roses.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with this wine,\u201d Mr. Poulmentis said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d The small crowd agreed and drained their glasses. Mr. Soultanos explained that it\u2019s an orange wine, from white grapes but made like a red wine, with skin intact, the tannins producing the more robust, spicy flavor.\n\nMr. Soultanos and his business partner Maria Bakalopoulou had worked with Mr. Poulmentis at Theo\u2019s Restaurant and Oyster Bar, his former gig on the Upper East Side, and though they hadn\u2019t tasted any of the new dishes before, they knew what to expect.

The dish was matched by a white from Santorini that one of the other experts, Brian McCoy of Verity Wine, suggested, and a light retsina, with traces of pine resin.\n\nThough the Greeks have one of the longest winemaking histories in Europe, few restaurants carry Greek wines simply because they\u2019re unfamiliar with them.

So hopefully you\u2019re still on schedule to meet your goals, absent any big health or job changes.\n\nThis moment of checking your gut, however, is as good a time as any to consider whether you have the right proportion of your money in stocks versus other options like cash, bonds or real estate that don\u2019t experience this kind of volatility or may not rise or fall in tandem with stocks. In other words, are you taking too much risk? Or too little? If so, buy or sell some stocks accordingly \u2014 not because of what the stock market will or will not do next but because you are or are not on track to pay for the things you want to buy someday.\n\nCan You Predict What the Market Will Do Next?\n\nLet me answer that one for you: No. Perhaps you got lucky with some individual stocks as a teenager or used what you learned in finance class to buy just the right mutual fund at exactly the right time.\n\nCongratulations! But you\u2019re almost certainly more lucky than you are smart. Professionals rarely do so well over 50 years that their decisions about when to get in and out of a stock lead to better performance than they might have achieved by just putting money into an index fund that buys every stock in a particular category. And you can\u2019t know ahead of time whether you are that rare breed of market genius.\n\nStill tempted to sell and wait out this latest market hiccup? Plenty of studies warn against this, including one that shows that missing out on just 10 of the best days in the stock market over 160,000 daily returns in 15 markets around the world can cause you to end up with about half of what you would have earned if you had stuck with an index fund over time.\n\nHow Much Does This Affect Your Net Worth?\n\nAny decline hurts, even if it\u2019s only on paper and you don\u2019t plan on selling for decades. But consider everything else that might happen over that many years.\n\nYou will (hopefully) pay down your student loan debt. You will (hopefully) get promotions and raises or start a company that will increase your income. You will buy a home, and its value will probably go up over time, or at least match inflation. Or you\u2019ll rent and draw dividends from the freedom and flexibility that brings you.\n\nIn other words, you are not the stock market. There is so much more to your net worth (and, hopefully, self worth) than a bouncing S.&P. 500 chart. Check in with your life, and if it\u2019s better than it was a year or five years ago, think about that if the stock market keeps falling.", "title": "So It\u2019s Your First Market Hiccup.

It picks up where the epilogue to the seventh novel does: 19 years after Hogwarts, when Harry is a father of three, married to Ginny, Ron\u2019s little sister. (Cover your eyes if you don\u2019t want any spoilers.) Harry is doing well in his wizarding career \u2014 if not as well as Hermione, who\u2019s Minister for Magic \u2014 yet he fumbles at parenthood.

Severus is for Severus Snape, the acerbic potions professor Harry spent years loathing before he discovered that Snape was a brave and decent guy, just deep undercover. Snape was also the head of Slytherin House.\n\nAnd Slytherin House is what?\n\nBased on inner qualities divined by a hat (yes, a hat), each student at Hogwarts is assigned to live in one of four houses. The two that matter are Gryffindor, which was Harry\u2019s, and Slytherin, which might have a less ominous reputation if Tom Riddle hadn\u2019t belonged to it. Harry\u2019s son Albus, much to his initial dismay, is a Slytherin.

Don\u2019t count on getting discounted tickets to such a highly anticipated show (at present, they\u2019re not even an option for groups or schools), and remember that you will need a separate ticket to each part.

If hygge made you drowsy, and Marie Kondo saddled you with empty cupboards and regret, \u201cshake yoga\u201d is a way to masochistically jiggle these bad memories away with your thighs.\n\nThe book has sold more than a million copies; Eiko\u2019s instructional videos on YouTube have been viewed 6.7 million times.

First, Gumby-like bendiness is not the book\u2019s sole mandate \u2014 Eiko contends that the ancillary benefits of being able to do the splits include weight loss, improved balance, injury prevention and peace of mind. \u201cIf your body is stiff, it becomes harder and harder to do things like walk, step over things, pick things up, sleep or even sit,\u201d Eiko said in an email, adding that, outside of women in their 30s and 40s, the book has also been very popular with senior citizens. To back up its claims, the book cites studies from an array of sources ranging from the Journal of Applied Physiology and the Neuropsychoeconomics Conference Proceedings to The Sunday Tasmanian and Joe Weider\u2019s Muscle & Fitness magazine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second component of the book\u2019s power is less wholesome. It only takes several pages for Eiko to lay out her regimen \u2014 you do two minute-long exercises a day, one wherein you lie on your back and pull your outstretched leg backward with a towel and then bounce, and another where you do a legs-spread sumo stretch and then bounce. A third minute-long yoga position or exercise changes each week. Eiko recommends that, with any move, you push yourself to 70 percent of your capacity.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the bulk of the book consists of a slightly strange short story \u2014 \u201cHow Are You Going to Achieve Anything If You Can\u2019t Even Do the Splits?\u201d \u2014 about two shame-ridden employees of a corporation in Japan who discover the joys and benisons of shake yoga.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "When the whirlwind of the Winter Olympics spins to a close this weekend, the host city, Pyeongchang, South Korea, will settle down to a life beyond aerial flips, halfpipe pretzels and metronomic North Korean cheerleaders. The place will become, once again, a quiet spot where very few children live \u2014 its population a disproportionately elderly one, dependent on an imperiled social-security system. Pyeongchang played a happy Olympic host, but its everyday economic reality highlights an existential threat shadowing South Korea. It\u2019s not (or not only) the North Korean missiles and nuclear weapons arrayed across the border just 50 miles away. The more intractable danger is a demographic time bomb already starting to detonate across South Korea and all over East Asia.\n\nJapan, with its shrinking population, has long been the region\u2019s pace setter for demographic doom. But South Korea\u2019s fertility rate has plummeted to one of the lowest in the world, barely more than one child per woman. Throw in rising life expectancy, and South Korea is now aging faster than any other advanced economy on Earth. Between 1975 and 2015, its median age soared to 41.2 from just 19.6. In Gangwon, the potato-growing province that encompasses Pyeongchang, the median age is expected to pass 60 by 2045. (The median age in the United States, now 37.9, is predicted to creep up to 42 by 2045.) Thousands of South Korean schools have already been abandoned for lack of students.\n\nThe economic fallout of this demographic shift could be devastating. After transforming itself from a poor, war-ravaged agricultural society into a manufacturing giant in just a few decades, South Korea now faces one peril of prosperity: a labor shortage that will be a drag on both the economy and the pension system for its aging residents. Like the rest of East Asia, Seoul has tried to increase birthrates, offering child care bonuses, fertility treatments, even gifts of beef for families with newborns. Some of its efforts, though, come across as little more than pressuring women to marry and reproduce. In one instance, the government published (and then retracted) an online \u201cbirth map\u201d that showed, in shades of pink, the number of women of childbearing age by city and region.\n\nFailing in its push, South Korea opted to pull. It has brought in \u2014 cautiously, but still much more actively than China or Japan \u2014 a growing number of foreign migrants. Back in 1990, the country was so insular that it had fewer than 50,000 foreign nationals. Today there are more than two million, a 40-fold increase, most from China, Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia. \u201cWhat other options are there?\u201d says Mihyung Park, the head of the South Korea office of the International Organization for Migration. \u201cThe South Korean economy cannot function without foreign workers.\u201d", "title": "South Korea\u2019s Most Dangerous Enemy: Demographics", "authors": []}

I chose this grid in part for its pleasing symmetry, but also for its versatility. While it\u2019s true that there are no entries in the grid longer than seven letters, the fact that there are 36 of these slots meant that I had a good amount of flexibility in placing my marquee answers. This 72-word grid also allowed me to incorporate some Scrabbly letters into lively entries without too much difficulty, and to maintain a nice grid flow throughout the puzzle while still being able to work on sections one at a time.\n\nI started in the lower-left with CAPTCHA, which I found yielded promising letter combinations when paired with AM I RITE.

After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold.\n\nIn the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted.\n\nEven so, many artists remain skeptical of the streaming economy, which heavily rewards mainstream hits but has drawn complaints from other songwriters and musicians, particularly those outside the sphere of pop, who feel they are not being adequately compensated for their work.\n\nSpotify\u2019s prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business.\n\nAccording to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the \u201cfreemium\u201d model that has become Spotify\u2019s marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements.\n\nAs quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to their shares, they also have \u201cbeneficiary certificates\u201d granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus.\n\nThe major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed.\n\nSpotify\u2019s major competitor is Apple, whose co-founder Steve Jobs had long disdained music subscriptions. Apple finally entered the streaming subscription business in 2015 with Apple Music, and recently said that it had 36 million paying users. But according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has been outpacing Spotify in its growth in paid subscribers in the United States.\n\nThe market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\n\nAt least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly.\n\nLast week, for instance, the online file storage company Dropbox, valued by the private markets at about $10 billion, filed paperwork to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering.\n\nBut to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares.\n\nIf the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company\u2019s shares start trading.\n\nThat\u2019s effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGiven that it involves a direct listing, Spotify\u2019s debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile.", "title": "Spotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock Exchange", "authors": ["Ben Sisario"]}

And how did Spotify bolster its margins? A big factor: It signed more advantageous licensing agreements with music companies. \u201cThis decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of premium revenue was driven largely by a reduction in content costs pursuant to new licensing agreements,\u201d the filing said.\n\nBut can Spotify keep turning the screw? The music companies might be willing to compromise on price because the overall amount of dollars they receive is going up, making life easier for the first time in years. But, with Apple, Amazon and others adding subscribers, competition is intensifying. The music industry might be able to exploit that.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nSpotify\u2019s cash flow mystery\n\nAccounting nerds delving into Spotify\u2019s filing will have stumbled on an odd discrepancy.\n\nTwo metrics that attempt to capture how much cash a company is taking in had very different totals for 2017. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was negative to the tune of \u20ac324 million last year. But net cash flows from operations totaled \u20ac179 million in 2017. Both totals benefited from adding back large noncash financing costs. So what items bolstered operating cash flows but not Ebitda?\n\nIt looks like operating cash flows did better in part because Spotify waited to pay some of its bills. Such items make up what is often called working capital. Spotify wrung \u20ac439 million of cash out of working capital in 2017. The question for investors is whether the company can do that every year.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nSpotify files to go public.\n\nThe streaming music service filed its prospectus for a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual route that bypasses the traditional initial public offering process.\n\nDirect listings essentially move trading in a company\u2019s stock from private markets to public ones, with new investors buying shares on the open market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWall Street and Silicon Valley will watch Spotify\u2019s listing closely. If it goes well, it could spur other high profile start-ups to pursue a direct listing. Wall Street bankers are unlikely to cheer such a development. Direct listings generate lower fees than the typical I.P.O.\n\nSpotify won\u2019t embark on its roadshow, a series of meetings with investor ahead of the listing, for at least 15 days.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the details:\n\nTicker symbol: SPOT\n\nPrice range for private shares in 2017: $37.50-$125.00\n\nPrice range for private shares this year: $90.00-$132.50\n\nValuation range in 2017: $6.3 billion to $20.9 billion\n\nValuation range this year: $15.9 billion to $23.4 billion\n\nValuation based on the midpoint of its 2018 price range: $19.7 billion\n\nLoss: \u20ac1.2 billion in 2017, up from \u20ac225 million in 2015\n\nOperating loss: \u20ac378 million, compared with \u20ac235 million in 2015.\n\nRevenue: \u20ac4.1 billion last year, up from \u20ac1.9 billion in 2015.\n\nFree cash flow: \u20ac109 million in 2017\n\nEbitda: -\u20ac324 million in 2017\n\nMonthly average users: 159 million last year, up from 91 million in 2015\n\nPremium subscribers: 71 million, up from 28 million in 2015\n\nShare of global streaming music market: 42 percent\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe amount Spotify has paid in royalties to record labels since its inception: More than $8 billion\n\nPercent of total voting power controlled by co-founder and chief executive, Daniel Ek: 37.3 percent\n\nPercent of total voting power controlled by co-founder, Martin Lorentzon: 43.1 percent\n\nRisks of a direct listing: \u201cOur ability to sell your ordinary shares at or above the price you bought them for due to (i) our listing not having the same safeguards as an underwritten initial public offering, which may result in the public price of our ordinary shares being volatile and declining significantly upon listing, or (ii) the failure of an active, liquid, and orderly market for our ordinary shares to develop or be sustained.\u201d\n\nBig year for I.P.O.s so far.\n\nDespite a sharp selloff in financial markets in early February, the market for public offerings started 2018 with a bang.\n\nThrough late February, 30 companies publicly listed their shares on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters.\n\nThe pipeline of listings to come is also strong. On top of Spotify\u2019s listing, which should come in the next few weeks, Dropbox filed paperwork last week to go public.\n\nPhoto\n\nDick\u2019s takes a big step to limit gun sales\n\nOne of the U.S.\u2019s biggest gun sellers, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, said that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines, as well as limit sales of any gun to those 21 and older.\n\nIn doing so, the retailer is steering directly into the controversy that has embroiled companies that have taken on the American gun lobby.\n\nDick\u2019s C.E.O., Edward Stack, told the NYT:\n\n\u201cWhen we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset. We love these kids and their rallying cry, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 It got to us.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Mr. Stack wants what he calls \u201ccommon sense\u201d changes to gun laws, like the steps his company is taking and broader universal background checks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy it\u2019s remarkable: Other companies, big and small, continue to sever ties to the National Rifle Association. Delta has been openly dressed down \u2014 and potentially punished \u2014 by Republicans in Georgia after eliminating discounts for N.R.A. members.

That\u2019s after:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Ackman\u2019s frenemy, Dan Loeb, took the other side of that bet.\n\n\u2022 So did Carl Icahn, in one of the most prominent public spats in recent Wall Street history, before the two men made up. (That didn\u2019t stop Mr. Icahn from continuing to bet on Herbalife.)\n\nHow did Herbalife investors respond Wednesday? They pushed shares in the company up 8.5 percent to $94.04, an all-time high.\n\nBut Mr. Ackman has found a new investment: United Technologies.\n\nWhy? The hedge fund mogul told CNBC that he liked the company \u2014 which happens to be considering spinning off parts of itself as a way to get more value for the conglomerate\u2019s shareholders.\n\nShares in United Technologies were up 2.1 percent this afternoon, at $136.73.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nIs the family business a liability for Jared Kushner?\n\nFor months, the former real estate investor\u2019s inability to get a permanent top-secret security clearance has been a lightning rod for criticism.

Critics will ask, where would the money come from?\n\nUsers don\u2019t like the Snapchat redesign but\u2026\n\nIs it scaring off users? So far the answer seems to be no.\n\nCNBC reports Snap\u2019s download rates have remained strong, according to App Annie. And Snap\u2019s shares are up 5 percent.\n\nBackground\n\nSnap\u2019s redesign, which has been rolling out over the past few months, has faced growing criticism from users and weighed on the stock. Last week a tweet from Kylie Jenner, saying she did not open Snapchat, sent the stock tumbling 6 percent. Wall Street has picked up on the customer backlash and a couple of analysts have downgraded the stock.\n\nThe criticism has also overshadowed Snap\u2019s positive fourth-quarter results earlier this month that pushed its shares up nearly 50 percent.\n\nA lot of people are worried about E.T.F.s.\n\nBlackRock thinks that could be a risk to its business. From the risk factors in BlackRock\u2019s annual report:\n\nAs a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing, as well as perceived competition issues associated with asset managers managing stakes in multiple companies within certain industries, known as \u201ccommon ownership\u201d. The commentators argue that index funds have the potential to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.\n\nThe filing goes on to say:\n\nIf the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock\u2019s business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018Congratulations, Mr. Powell! You just hit America with a wake-up call!\u2019\n\nThat is how John D. Herrmann, an analyst who covers the bond markets for MUFG Securities Americas, reacted to the testimony in Congress of Jerome Powell. In a note to clients yesterday, Mr. Herrmann cataloged upbeat remarks that Mr. Powell made, and observed that Mr. Powell seemed optimistic not just about the current economic environment, but also the outlook for the next three to four years.\n\nWhat to make of Wall Street\u2019s response to Mr. Powell?\n\nOne interpretation is that Mr. Powell wants investors and others to be more prepared for higher interest rates. Wall Street seems to have settled on a scenario in which the Fed raises interest rates steadily over the next two years. Any sign that rates may rise much more quickly than expected could cause a panicky pullback in the financial markets, which could ultimately harm the economy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

Its initial release includes breakdowns of how individual companies will allocate their tax savings, based on their public statements and disclosures.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, a hedge fund titan who is a co-founder of Just Capital, said he hoped publication of that data would lead to a dialogue among executives and the general public \u201cabout what\u2019s the most equitable way to distribute this windfall we just received.\u201d By the middle of the year, he added, the group should have enough information from public disclosures and survey responses to get a fuller understanding of where the money is actually headed. \u201cWe\u2019ll learn a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group\u2019s initial findings suggest shareholders of 90 large corporations \u2014 including Home Depot, Pfizer and Capital One \u2014 are reaping far more of the benefits of the law than workers or consumers. Pay or benefit increases for workers account for 6 percent of the savings those companies report from the law, the group calculates, while job creation accounts for 22 percent. More than half of the money going directly to workers takes the form of one-time bonuses, as opposed to permanent raises or benefits.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Trump tweeted an article about it after it reached 100 companies. The influential Drudge Report linked to it for a day on its home page. Tips poured in, about bosses passing out bonus checks in break rooms or posting about them on company bulletin boards. A 19-year-old fan of the law emails Mr. Kartch frequently with any bonus news he can find. Conservatives credit the stream of bonus news, in part, for the bill\u2019s improving poll numbers.\n\n\u201cIt will get more detailed with time,\u201d Mr. Kartch said, \u201cbut for now, it\u2019s all the raw material up there for anybody who wants it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBonus and wage announcements are only one slice of the law\u2019s impact. In early December, researchers in the office of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, began tracking another slice: the surge in stock buybacks that has accompanied the law. The team scours earnings calls, Google and social media for buyback announcements, and frequently blasts the results out to reporters. Mr. Schumer has taken to denouncing the buyback increases regularly on the Senate floor.\n\nOutside groups are compiling a much broader array of data on what companies plan to do with their savings. Morgan Stanley has surveyed its stock analysts over their expectations of how companies they cover will spend their tax savings. Last week, its researchers released a 23-page report, counting appendixes, that contends stock traders may be overvaluing some companies by underestimating how much of their tax savings they will invest in workers and operations, as opposed to passing on to shareholders.\n\nJust Capital is hoping to round out the picture further, by pushing companies that have not disclosed their tax windfall plans to answer 11 questions \u2014 including spelling out how much of the savings they will put toward raising workers\u2019 compensation, lowering consumer prices and minimizing environmental impact. Mr. Jones said the group would follow up weekly, as necessary, with phone calls and other attempts to collect the information.\n\n\u201cMy attitude is,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to get the data one way or another.\u201d", "title": "Spreadsheets at Dawn: The New Tax Battle Is All About Data", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley"]}

I could feel that most precious jewel of corporate life \u2014 status \u2014 slowly engorging.\n\nWhen Bing\u2019s first book came out, I had been trying to become a vice president for quite some time but was assured that they simply didn\u2019t make any more of them, like Studebakers. So I was frustrated. The book put forth the theory that mental illness is actually an asset in business and government, not a liability \u2014 a hypothesis that has since been proved spectacularly true.

Toward the end of the last century, my company acquired one of the giants of our business and I got a pretty big new job. At the same time, Bing\u2019s column moved to what was then an important financial publication.

The reporter also called my boss at Fortune and rattled his cage. During this ordeal, I reached an exquisite level of trepidation known to those waiting to hear if the governor has canceled their appointment with Old Sparky.\n\nIn the end, the piece came out during a January blizzard. It was fine. My mom liked it. I was sure I was ruined.\n\nAnd a month later I was promoted again.\n\nSo what can we say, Bing and I? It\u2019s certainly been a long, scary ride for us both. Perhaps it would not be inappropriate, however, when considering this matter, for each of us to take this opportunity to thank the other for all the good he, uh, we, I mean, they have done for my, um, that is, our lives over the years.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Still, 300 years is a significant milestone for a city that often seems to be at risk of sinking into the sea. That it was so very nearly lost 12 years ago during Hurricane Katrina \u2014 or that there\u2019s another one coming \u2014 is not lost on residents, who defend their home turf with fierce pride. I experienced that pride a bit when I wrote something offhand on Twitter about how locals were ending conversations by telling me to \u201cbe safe,\u201d and that I got the impression that no one walked around after dark. It was a badly worded tweet, though not entirely off base. People were indeed telling me to be safe. New Orleans has a notorious violent crime rate, one that predominantly affects black men, but that sometimes spills over to tourists and residents. (Solo women travelers, as always, should exercise extra caution , no matter the outcry of locals. )\n\nBut the city also has, I\u2019ve learned, a very forgiving spirit. The same people who sent me angry messages had turned warm within minutes. One woman I met at the Pinettes show, Renee Lapeyrolerie, wrote me, \u201cBadly worded, not a crime, just a sin lol enjoy the rest of your stay,\u201d and then advised me to put my phone in a zip-lock bag in case it rained.\n\nThe city is certainly in the midst of a post-Katrina upswing, with plenty of new dining and drinking spots (the St. Roch food market, Latitude 29, for instance ), but there are still boarded-up houses in many neighborhoods and a kind of lingering sadness about the hurricane\u2019s most lasting impact, which was a loss of community. Almost every New Orleans native I met told me about friends and family who fled flooded homes and have yet to be able to return.\n\nAmong residents\u2019 other regular complaints are the roads, which often seem to be more pothole than concrete, and the water quality, which had much of the city on a \u201cboil water\u201d advisory ( including for bathing) due to frozen pipes just days before I arrived. At the satirical Krewe du Vieux, the first major parade of Mardi Gras season, most floats were rebukes of the Sewerage & Water Board, whose failure to maintain drainage pumps resulted in damaging floods this summer. (Other targets were President Trump and the celebrity chef John Besh, who stepped down from his local restaurant empire in the wake of sexual misconduct accusations.)\n\nWhat is thriving is the arts scene. There are, of course, world-class art museums, the slavery-themed Whitney Plantation Museum, and the international arts fair Prospect 4 (which ends on Feb. 25), not to mention the wig artists at Fifi Mahony\u2019s in the Quarter. But it\u2019s school-level performing arts where the most exciting work is taking place. I got a chance to visit ReNEW Cultural Arts Academy, a public arts magnet middle school in Irish Channel, as their marching band got ready for Mardi Gras. They were as impressive as any professional musicians you\u2019ll find on Frenchmen Street. \u201cA lot of these kids, their parents weren\u2019t in a band because of the migration to other states,\u201d said Tenell Moore, the band director. \u201cSo we\u2019re building new \u2018bandheads,\u2019 what we refer to them in New Orleans. We\u2019re pushing hard to get it back.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s working. Out in the Seventh Ward at a booming local spot called Bullet\u2019s Sports Bar , with no other businesses in sight, the Pinettes played to a packed Friday night house that included the New Orleans funk legend Mac Rebennack, better known as Dr. John. \u201cMy friend said, \u2018Come out and hang out with some sisters,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t believe how many white people are here. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going home!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cForget it, the Pinettes are the real deal. Overlooked way too long in New Orleans, maybe because they\u2019re women.\u201d\n\nThe group was formed at St. Mary\u2019s Academy, an all-female high school, and in 2013 won the Street Kings brass band competition. (Event organizers had to take a marker and cross out \u201cKings\u201d and write in \u201cQueens.\u201d) Natasha Harris, the saxophonist, told me that none of them are full-time musicians: \u201cWe all have families, we all have jobs, we\u2019re college-educated women, but we do this because it\u2019s our passion.\u201d They often have to perform without their full roster because there aren\u2019t enough women instrumentalists around to act as substitutes for members who can\u2019t make certain gigs. \u201cOur hope,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cis that middle school girls will come up and continue their passion, or that women will see us and realize it\u2019s never too late.

She said that \u201ccritical issues\u201d were \u201cnot adequately addressed\u201d and admonished the district to make changes.\n\nMs. Elia instructed the district to submit monthly progress reports to the education department.\n\nNew York has only taken over one school district in the past, the Roosevelt School District, also on Long Island. Like Hempstead, Roosevelt is a poor district in Nassau County that serves almost entirely black and Hispanic students.

What followed surprised some officials there: Almost no one used the law. For years, it was relegated to the back shelf of law enforcement, with only a few cases a year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe pace of cases began to quicken, Connecticut statistics show, after high-profile shootings occurred elsewhere, starting in 2007 with the deaths of 33 people on the campus of Virginia Tech. Advocates of red flag laws said they provided important protections, particularly as people became increasingly aware of the risks of mass shootings.\n\nStill, even states with the laws have not avoided such shootings. The gunman who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in December 2012 had access to guns, though people who knew him said he had shown troubling signs before the attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a country with hundreds of millions of guns in circulation, and that fact imposes real constraints on what policy can achieve and on what kind of policy makes sense,\u201d said Ramesh Ponnuru, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group.\n\nNo one, Mr. Ponnuru added, should expect any one law to fix everything. \u201cRealism is the right attitude,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Republicans oppose red flag laws, and the National Rifle Association has argued that a judge\u2019s order to seize a person\u2019s weapon may violate Second Amendment rights when no crime has been committed.\n\nBut law enforcement officials who have embraced red flag laws say that they allow the authorities to step in before something catastrophic occurs. The removals are temporary, these officials stress, meaning that guns are returned to people no longer deemed dangerous.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe laws allow weapons to be seized for a brief time \u2014 typically two or three weeks \u2014 after which a petitioner, usually a police agency, must go back to court to let a judge decide whether the gun owner\u2019s behavior amounts to a threat to himself or others and whether the weapons should be held longer.\n\nSome states, including New York and Texas, already allow guns to be taken from mental health patients deemed dangerous, but red flag laws hinge on outward behavior \u2014 a person\u2019s statements and actions regardless of medical diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThe reason I like gun violence restraining orders as an option is that we can use them even if the person hasn\u2019t been convicted of a crime,\u201d said Mara W. Elliott, the San Diego city attorney. California\u2019s measure, patterned after Connecticut\u2019s, took effect in 2016, and late last year, Ms. Elliott assigned an assistant city attorney to pursue gun seizure cases full time, one of the first cities in the nation to take such aggressive action.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, the office has pursued 10 cases, Ms. Elliott said, and officials there have seen circumstances involving more intimate situations than they had expected.\n\nPrompted by calls to the police, who then asked the city attorney to intervene under the new law, the authorities removed guns from Alzheimer\u2019s patients, alcoholics and people accused of domestic abuse.\n\nSince Connecticut passed its law, the state has seen 1,519 cases, about two-thirds of them since 2012. California\u2019s far newer law resulted in 86 cases in its first year. And Washington\u2019s superior courts have held about 65 hearings under the law since it was approved by voters in 2016.\n\nRed flag laws have evolved, too. Connecticut and Indiana, which passed its law in 2005 after the murder of an Indianapolis police officer, allow only law enforcement agencies to bring petitions for temporary gun removal. Newer measures, in California, Oregon and Washington, allow family members to bring such petitions to judges as well.\n\nThe effectiveness of the statutes has depended on the level of communication between the public and law enforcement agencies, according to social and health policy researchers who have studied the laws.\n\nIn some places, they said, residents have been far more willing to report troubling behavior than in others. And in some communities, law enforcement agencies are more familiar with the technical intricacies of applying the red flag laws than they are in others.\n\nEven in the states that have had the laws longer, like Indiana, state officials have said that many residents and police officers are unaware of the tools they have.\n\nCurtis T. Hill Jr., the Republican attorney general of Indiana, on Wednesday took the unusual step of reminding his colleagues around the state that the provision exists.\n\n\u201cIndiana\u2019s \u2018Red Flag Law\u2019 is a common-sense measure that in no way inhibits the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens,\u201d Mr. Hill said in a statement. \u201cThis useful provision is not as well-known, even among law enforcement, as one might expect. That\u2019s why this week we are distributing a public safety advisory raising awareness of the law and urging police and prosecutors to make full use of it as we work together to protect all Hoosiers.\u201d", "title": "States Mull \u2018Red Flag\u2019 Gun Seizures from People Deemed Dangerous", "authors": ["Kirk Johnson"]}

He finished 13th in the normal hill competition last weekend. In the large hill qualifications on Friday, he finished in 11th place. The final is Saturday.\n\nGenerally, the larger the hill, the better Kraft is. He holds the world record in ski flying, an offshoot of ski jumping, where the hills are larger than those used in the Olympics and where the landing zone is set more than 200 meters away from the takeoff point. He set the world record at a sky flying hill in Norway last year, soaring 253.5 meters (just over 831 feet) and then sticking the landing.\n\nAt 5-foot-5 and 123 pounds, Kraft has a slight build and strong legs that are tailor-made for flight. He isn\u2019t great at pushing off the jump, which is more important on the smaller normal hills, but once in the air, his technique is immaculate, and he appears to float on the wind.\n\n\u201cI am a flier,\u201d he said in an interview this week.\n\nSo what does it feel like to fly more than two and a half football fields down a mountain?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great,\u201d Kraft said.\n\nBefore his world-record flight, he said, the anticipation built as he sat on the bar, waiting for the starter to give him the green light.

From the Mirage, which he opened in 1989, to the Bellagio and the soaring Wynn Hotel and Encore towers, he introduced the idea that visitors to the Strip were not there just to gamble. He also offered them top-of-the-line staterooms, fine dining and Rodeo Drive-level shopping.\n\nHe first arrived in Las Vegas as a young boy with his father, Mike Wynn, an East Coast bingo parlor operator. After his father died, Mr. Wynn and his wife at the time, Elaine Pascal, took over the business. He called out the numbers while she counted the cash.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1967, he bought a small stake in the Frontier casino. More deals would follow, including the takeover of the publicly traded Golden Nugget, which operated a run-down casino in downtown Las Vegas. Mr. Wynn started an ambitious renovation and expansion project that would ultimately lead him back east to oversee the construction of the Golden Nugget in Atlantic City.\n\nBut his rising stature in Las Vegas in the 1980s resulted in frequent regulatory inquiries and investigations into possible ties to organized crime. Mr. Wynn was always quick to point out that the various examinations found no wrongdoing.\n\nHis relationship with his ex-wife, a force of her own in Las Vegas, has been tumultuous. Married when they were teenagers \u2014 she was 18 and he was 19 \u2014 they divorced, remarried and divorced again in 2010. Ms. Wynn sat on Wynn Resorts\u2019 board for years before she was removed in 2015.\n\nSince 2012, the two have been locked in a legal battle over control of Ms. Wynn\u2019s stake, valued recently at $1.6 billion, in Wynn Resorts. An agreement she signed with Mr. Wynn gives him the right to vote her stake in the company and limits her ability to sell her shares. A spokeswoman for Ms. Wynn declined to comment Tuesday evening.\n\nHis resignation may help stanch the bleeding for Wynn Resorts, which has a number of ambitious projects in the works. Besides the huge resort set to open next year in Boston Harbor, it is clearing land behind its Wynn and Encore hotels in Las Vegas for \u201cParadise Park,\u201d a sandy waterfront around a 38-acre lagoon that is to include a casino, a hotel and restaurants. And in January, the company began laying out its vision for another 38-acre property it acquired late last year, a resort and casino called Wynn West.\n\nMr. Wynn is the latest in a growing series of prominent men, from actors to politicians to journalists, who have been accused of sexual harassment or assault since The New York Times published an expos\u00e9 on the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein in October. Many have resigned or been fired as a result.", "title": "Steve Wynn Resigns From Company Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations", "authors": ["Maggie Astor", "Julie Creswell"]}

But he agreed to a two-year ban from the securities industry for failing to properly supervise some of his staff. He created Point72, which currently has more than 1,000 employees, to manage his personal fortune.\n\nThe ban from the securities industry expired at the end of last year. Mr. Cohen, 61, is preparing to relaunch Point72 as a hedge fund that will manage money for outside investors.\n\nWhile traditional Wall Street firms have overhauled their cultures in recent years and elevated women to positions of authority, the $3 trillion hedge fund industry has been far slower in breaking away from its male-dominated roots.\n\nAt Point72, women make up fewer than 3 percent of the managing directors, according to the discrimination lawsuit, which was brought on behalf of Lauren Bonner, an associate director. Of the firm\u2019s 125 portfolio managers \u2014 top traders who decide which stocks to buy and sell \u2014 one is a woman. There are no women on the firm\u2019s hiring or executive committee.\n\nFor several weeks last year, a whiteboard in the office of a top executive had the word \u201cpussy\u201d written on it, leaving the firm\u2019s few senior women feeling uneasy, according to the lawsuit. A person who worked at the firm confirmed the incident.\n\nMany of the allegations in the complaint could not be independently verified. But four people who worked at the firm, and who declined to be identified for fear of retribution, said Point72 could be a difficult work environment for women. They said, for example, that male colleagues regularly made comments on women\u2019s physical appearances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Bonner, who did not comment for this article, is represented by lawyers with Wigdor L.L.P., which has represented women in a number of notable sexual harassment lawsuits, including several against Fox News and 21st Century Fox.

Christensen, said.\n\nSuch lawsuits are rare on Wall Street because, women say, there is little to gain by challenging employers and they risk tarnishing their reputations and upending their careers.\n\nIt is even more uncommon for a current employee of a firm to file such a complaint.\n\nMs. Bonner is part of a recruitment analytics team at Point72 and supervises 14 people.

This year, she is slated to earn a base salary of $300,000 with a potential bonus of $225,000. The lawsuit alleges that similarly situated men earn at least twice as much.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction against Point72\u2019s violating state anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAs Point72 prepares to start trading as a hedge fund, the firm has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion from outside investors, although some institutional investors have balked at its high fees, people familiar with the matter previously told The New York Times.\n\nMr. Cohen has emphasized Point72\u2019s commitment to the highest ethical standards, which the firm boasts about in its mission statement. He brought in former federal prosecutors to oversee compliance at the firm.\n\nKevin O\u2019Connor, a former United States attorney for Connecticut, was hired as general counsel.

Nothing happened: The supervisor remained on a powerful internal committee that decides which employees get promotions, the suit said.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused Mark Herr, the firm\u2019s head of corporate communications, of making degrading comments about women. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one example of the firm\u2019s allegedly inhospitable culture, the lawsuit described a women\u2019s leadership forum that Mr. Cohen hosted in October 2016 at his 35,000-square-foot mansion in Greenwich, Conn.

His new book, \u201cEnlightenment Now,\u201d is a spirited and exasperated rebuke to anyone who refuses to concede that the world is becoming a better place. \u201cNone of us are as happy as we ought to be, given how amazing our world has become,\u201d he writes. \u201cPeople seem to bitch, moan, whine, carp and kvetch as much as ever.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, this spectacular ingratitude is lamentably bipartisan, he says, shared by anti-establishmentarians on both sides who refuse to see the light: \u201cLeft-wing and right-wing political ideologies have themselves become secular religions, providing people with a community of like-minded brethren, a catechism of sacred beliefs, a well-populated demonology and a beatific confidence in the righteousness of their cause.\u201d Of course, Pinker\u2019s confidence in the righteousness of his own cause may come across as similarly beatific (he\u2019s an atheist who\u2019s confident enough to use the word \u201cblessed\u201d without a hint of irony), but as he repeatedly tells us, the evidence is on his side. Scientific discovery and technological developments have ensured that \u201ceverything is amazing.\u201d He\u2019s merely expounding the obvious.\n\nNot so obvious, though, that he didn\u2019t need to write a 550-page book to make his case. Pinker is a scientist \u2014 a psychologist, to be exact \u2014 and he prides himself on being thorough, valiantly fighting \u201cprogressophobia\u201d with his voluble sentences and a fusillade of data. When he published \u201cThe Better Angels of Our Nature\u201d in 2011, he believed he unequivocally showed that modernity and liberal Enlightenment values had made people less violent, and so he was taken aback by skeptical reviews that had the temerity to question his research methods or his conclusions.\n\n\u201cI had thought that a parade of graphs with time on the horizontal axis, body counts or other measures of violence on the vertical, and a line that meandered from the top left to the bottom right would cure audiences\u201d of their delusions and \u201cpersuade them that at least in this sphere of well-being the world has made progress,\u201d he recalls near the beginning of \u201cEnlightenment Now.\u201d But Pinker\u2019s inability to \u201ccure audiences\u201d and \u201cpersuade them\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he has reconsidered his rhetorical approach; 300 pages after bemoaning those poor souls who read \u201cBetter Angels\u201d and weren\u2019t bowled over by his panoply of statistics, Pinker doubles down with still more data. \u201cWe have seen six dozen graphs that have vindicated the hope for progress by charting the ways in which the world has been getting better,\u201d he writes.", "title": "Steven Pinker Wants You to Know Humanity Is Doing Fine.

One of her most recent collages included candy wrappers from some chocolates she had eaten a few days before.\n\n\u201cI think of drawing as a dance,\u201d Mrs. Bratescu said. \u201cAnd a dance is a drawing in space. If you don\u2019t appreciate dancing, these things aren\u2019t possible to create.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMrs. Bratescu\u2019s studio has long played an essential role in her creative process. In 1978, she made an experimental black-and-white film titled \u201cThe Studio,\u201d and last year an exhibition in London explored how critical the space has been for her.\n\n\u201cMy family and friends, everyone, understood that the studio was a necessity,\u201d Mrs. Bratescu said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not very complicated; like for many artists, it\u2019s a place of my own.\u201d\n\nMagda Radu, a Bucharest-based curator and art historian, said in a telephone interview, \u201cIt\u2019s space of freedom, delineated from the outside world, but very fertile and productive.\u201d Ms. Radu has worked closely with Mrs. Bratescu for a number of years and curated both the Venice exhibition and the show in Los Angeles. \u201cFor artists in Eastern Europe, the studio represents a space of autonomy.\u201d\n\nInterest in Mrs. Bratescu\u2019s work centers on a paradox she is reticent to talk about: She worked freely as an artist in a period of political repression.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDuring communism it was almost mandatory to make political art, so the avant-garde had to be political in an unpolitical way,\u201d Sebestyen Gyorgy Szekely, an art historian who specializes in female Eastern European artists, said in a telephone interview. \u201cOne of Geta Bratescu\u2019s escape routes to make unpolitical art was to use mythology, and the other way she did it was in her handling of the process of art, using the act of drawing as a way to discover the world.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBorn in 1926 in Ploiesti, a town 50 miles north Bucharest, Mrs. Bratescu started drawing in her early childhood. Her father owned a drugstore and she said her parents encouraged her artistic ambitions: \u201cMy parents never forced me to become a pharmacist; they saw that I liked to draw and they left me to take my own course.\u201d\n\nIn 1945 she enrolled concurrently at the University of Bucharest, in the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, and also at the Bucharest School of Belle Arte, an art college. Her studies were interrupted in 1949 when she was expelled from university in a purge of the bourgeoisie: Her father was a landowner, and therefore unpalatable to the Communist regime.\n\nIn 1951, Mrs. Bratescu married Mihai Bratescu, an engineer and photographer with whom she sometimes collaborated, and they had a son, Tudor, in 1954. During the 1950s, Mrs. Bratescu worked as a children\u2019s book illustrator; by 1957 the regime had softened somewhat and Mrs. Bratescu became affiliated with the Union of Artists, a state entity that approved exhibitions and granted studios to its artists.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a book of sketches in her studio, Mrs. Bratescu has drawings from when she was sent by the union to draw peasants at weddings and in factories on the Danube Delta. It was through this affiliation that she had the rare occasion to exhibit in Romania and to travel a little, although she only left the country for the first time when she was 40.\n\nMs. Radu said that while being overtly political was never an interest for Mrs. Bratescu, an underlying current in her work deals with the freedom of artists and their role in the wider world. \u201cHer work functions on conceptual, literary and Aesopian levels,\u201d she said.\n\nAs such, the Los Angeles show, centered around Mrs. Bratescu\u2019s longstanding interest in Aesop, is perhaps the best way to read any sort of political statement into Mrs. Bratescu\u2019s work. Her interest the Greek author has less to do with his fables and instead is focused on the character of Aesop himself. \u201cFor her, Aesop is a disrupter, someone that is a fool but plays tricks on authoritarian figures,\u201d Ms. Radu said. \u201cHe creates mayhem.\u201d\n\nGiven that Mrs. Bratescu\u2019s oeuvre combines playfulness and dark humor, it is little surprise that she named her other major influences as Marcel Duchamp, Samuel Beckett and Charlie Chaplin. Clowns, chocolate-wrapper collages and childlike drawings are all Mrs. Bratescu\u2019s little jokes, but the punch lines remain hazy. \u201cIt\u2019s a game,\u201d Mrs. Bratescu said of her most recent collage. \u201cI like to draw and to work freely, like any other game.\u201d", "title": "Still Making Art, and Sly Jokes, at Age 91", "authors": ["Anna Codrea-Rado"]}

That means overly bullish sentiment often signals that the stock market is ripe for a pullback, while overly bearish sentiment often indicates that market may soon rally.\n\nPhoto\n\nQualcomm rejects Broadcom\u2019s revised offer.\n\nThe chip maker said its board had rejected Broadcom\u2019s revised $121 billion offer.\n\nThe reasons\n\n\u2022 \u201cThe Broadcom proposal materially undervalues Qualcomm.\u201d \u2022 The offer \u201cfalls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction.\u201d\n\nQualcomm said that it was willing to meet with Broadcom to see if its issues with the offer could be addressed.\n\nThe context\n\nOn Monday, Broadcom raised its takeover bid for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, a month before Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting where it hopes to unseat company\u2019s entire board. The improved offer was designed to entice shareholders to demand that Qualcomm\u2019s executives begin negotiations.\n\nQualcomm\u2019s management team and board have consistently argued that Broadcom\u2019s takeover approach is opportunistic since it is unfolding during Qualcomm\u2019s bruising legal fight with Apple, as well as priced too low.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom also-rans to worthy contenders?\n\nTill this week, many investors wondered whether Snap and Twitter had much of a future at a time when Google and Facebook are sucking up such a large share of digital advertising dollars. But after Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even as they remain in the shadow of Facebook and Google.\n\nBig stock moves. Twitter is up 16 percent in trading on Thursday after reporting fourth-quarter earnings. Snap, though down 8 percent on Thursday, is up over 30 percent since reporting its results earlier this week.\n\nTwitter and Snap are at very different stages of development. Though Snap added new users at a nice clip in the fourth quarter, the company still needs to prove that Snapchat is an effective and convenient place for big companies to advertise. In that sense, it is like Facebook in its early days as a public company. Twitter, however, needs to show that it can wring more revenue out of a slower-growing collection of users.\n\nThe bright spots shone out. Snap\u2019s strong user growth, up 18 percent in the fourth quarter, is a sign that it remains a draw to younger users that advertisers are keen to reach. While Twitter\u2019s user growth and advertising revenue for the United States was unimpressive in the fourth quarter, the company showed solid gains in both in the rest of the world. And there was evidence that Twitter is getting better at squeezing advertising revenue out of its users. Twitter\u2019s executives, without providing much numerical evidence, said that users are engaging more with ads, even while the costs of those ads fell for advertisers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nValuable breathing room. The fourth-quarter results bought both companies more time to prove themselves. And the financial pressure has lessened at Twitter. It is now churning out roughly half a billion dollars a year in cash flow, even including outlays for new plant and equipment.\n\nBut it will be a slog. The fourth quarter is generally bumper period for companies that rely on digital advertising, so the next couple of quarters could feel like a let down for Snap and Twitter. And if the companies disappoint, the stocks, far more highly valued than Facebook, could plunge. Twitter trades at 26 times the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect for the company in 2018. Facebook trades at 15 times forecast 2018 Ebitda. Analysts expect Snap\u2019s Ebitda to be negative this year.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nDoes Larry Fink want to be Buffett (or his old boss)?\n\nBlackRock is already the $6 trillion gorilla of the investing world. But its effort to raise more than $10 billion to buy and hold direct stakes in companies (as reported by the WSJ, citing unnamed sources) could put it more directly in competition with Mr. Fink\u2019s old firm, the Blackstone Group.\n\nBlackRock itself raises a different comparison, according to Sarah Krouse of the WSJ \u2014 to Warren Buffett:\n\nThe \u201cbest known\u201d example of BlackRock\u2019s approach with this new vehicle is Berkshire Hathaway, according to a fund-raising document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The Omaha conglomerate run by Mr. Buffett is well known for its long-term ownership of companies.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s Long-Term Private Capital fund would be a tenth of Berkshire\u2019s $101 billion in cash. But it too would look to buy and hold positions for more than 10 years. Over all, though, this seems more akin to private equity.\n\nThe bigger picture: BlackRock is competing against Blackstone and other asset managers for higher-fee investing products. (Mr. Fink\u2019s firm, of course, helped spearhead the rise of low-cost funds.)\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: There\u2019s an old rule. \u201cBeware of money managers saying that they will be like Buffett.\u201d\n\nA top WSJ editor heads to Lazard\n\nDennis Berman, the WSJ\u2019s financial editor, will join the investment bank\u2019s shareholder advisory practice, which helps defend companies against activist investors.\n\nThe practice has grown on Wall Street with the rise of activist investors, with investment banks touting their defense capabilities to corporate clients.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore becoming finance editor at the Journal, Mr. Berman oversaw the paper\u2019s business coverage and was its M.&A. reporter prior to that.\n\nMr. Berman, who will join as a managing director and be based in New York, will start on Feb. 26.\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nAndrew, with a bit of context\n\nDennis follows in the footsteps of Steven Rattner, who worked as a reporter at the NYT in the 1980s before going to work as a banker at Lazard and becoming an influential financier.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "Given the strength of the global economy, central banks, led by the United States Federal Reserve, have started to remove some of the supports that helped supercharge stock and bond prices over the last decade. The Fed started raising rates two years ago. And with the robust jobs report on Friday showing the fastest wage growth in years, some think the pace of rate increases could quicken.\n\nAverage hourly earnings for United States workers were 2.9 percent higher in January than the previous year, the fastest annual increase in years. Although a welcome development for workers, economists often view rising wages as an early indication of inflationary pressure. If faster price increases do begin to emerge, the Fed could try to head them off with more aggressive rate action.\n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s departing chairwoman who had her last working day on Friday, was viewed by some as being more concerned about measures of weakness in the job market than by the risk of rising inflation, and therefore more willing to keep rates low. Her successor, Jerome H. Powell, will face different challenges as the Fed charts a new course in raising interest rates.\n\nInterest rates that are set every day in the global bond markets are already leaping higher, in anticipation of central bank rate increases later this year. On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note \u2014 a widely used gauge for overall interest rates \u2014 rose to more than 2.8 percent, the highest level since early 2014.\n\nRising rates have myriad consequences, including making it more expensive for companies and individuals to borrow money, like for buying a home or a car. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 4.2 percent, up from less than 4 percent at the end of 2017.\n\nUncertainty about how the economy will react to rising borrowing costs has raised the blood pressure of investors. In one sign of a shift underway, a measure of expected market turbulence, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped by more than 25 percent on Friday. The so-called VIX has spent months at historically low levels, reflecting a placid market mood that seems to have evaporated over the last week.\n\nThe stock markets this week have reflected the jitters.\n\nThe energy sector was especially hard hit, with energy giants ExxonMobil dropping 5.1 percent and Chevron falling 5.6 percent on Friday after reporting lackluster earnings. The energy sector of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 6.4 percent during the week, the biggest drop of all industrial sectors in the benchmark.", "title": "Stocks Fall to End a Bad Week, and a Boom Begins to Look Shaky", "authors": []}

The 3.75 percent decline pushed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down more than 10 percent from its peak in late January. That means the market is technically in correction territory \u2014 a term used to indicate that a downward trend is more severe than simply a few days of bearish trading.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trained that the market does nothing but go up,\u201d Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said of investors. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they\u2019re anxious, they\u2019re sitting nervously on the sidelines, and then they can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nTrying to pinpoint the exact reasons for the last week\u2019s tumble is a fool\u2019s errand. But the most likely culprit appears to be fear that central banks will increase interest rates in an effort to fend off inflation and ensure that fast-growing economies don\u2019t overheat.

Fed officials, though, have remained upbeat on their outlook for the United States economy and sanguine about the market\u2019s tumble.\n\nThis week Robert Kaplan, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy that there is some correction, a little more volatility in markets\u2026can be a healthy thing.\u201d\n\nWilliam Dudley, the New York Fed President, said:\n\n\u201cIf the stock market were to go down precipitously and stay down, then that would actually feed into the economic outlook, and that would affect my view in terms of the implications for monetary policy.\u201d\n\nBut expectations for a March rate increase have begun to come down, reported Chelsey Dulaney of MoneyBeat. Traders are betting there is a 72 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates at its March meeting, down from 79 percent a week ago, according to CME Group data. For the year, investors now see only a 17.5 percent chance of four rate increases this year, compared to 24 percent a week ago, Ms. Dulaney wrote.\n\nThe big question remains: Is the underlying economy holding up? So far, probably yes.\n\nMore in markets\n\n\u2022 The LJM Preservation and Growth Fund, an options mutual fund, essentially collapsed amid the turmoil.

The government saw Mr. Lee as so pivotal to its Olympic dreams that after he was convicted of tax evasion in 2008, the country\u2019s president then pardoned him expressly so he could resume lobbying for Pyeongchang.\n\nAnd from Timothy Martin of the WSJ:\n\nSo extraordinary is the overlap between Samsung, South Korea and the Pyeongchang Games it is unlikely to be repeated, say IOC members and Olympics experts. Mr. Lee\u2019s lobbying and Samsung\u2019s close involvement are now considered inappropriate by some Olympics experts and voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nAre Twitter and Snap contenders again?\n\nAfter Snap and Twitter reported earnings this week, the view now seems to be that there is space for the two firms to make good money, even in the shadow of Facebook and Google, Peter Eavis writes:\n\nBright spots: Snap\u2019s strong user growth, up 18 percent in the fourth quarter, is a sign that it remains a draw to younger users. And while Twitter\u2019s U.S. user growth and advertising revenue were unimpressive in the fourth quarter, both looked solid in the rest of the world.\n\nBreathing room: The fourth-quarter results bought both companies more time to prove themselves. And the financial pressure has lessened at Twitter. It is now churning out roughly half a billion dollars a year in cash flow.\n\nBut it will be a slog: The fourth quarter is generally a bumper period for companies that rely on digital advertising, so the next couple of quarters could feel like a let down for Snap and Twitter. And if they disappoint, their stocks \u2014 far more highly valued than Facebook \u2014 could plunge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe tech flyaround\n\n\u2022 Eleven British lawmakers testily questioned executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter about fake news during recent elections.

That comes to a little less than one a year.\n\n\u2022 What made this correction unique? It was the first time the S.&.P. 500 crossed into a correction nine days after hitting an all-time high, Mr. Detrick wrote.\n\n\u2022 The S.&P. 500 has moved at least 1 percent in eight sessions, matching last year\u2019s number of 1 percent moves.\n\n\u2022 One trader made nearly $200 million on a bet that volatility would surge, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, the head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, via Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022 Bloomberg also reports that E*Trade added 64,581 gross new brokerage accounts in January, the most in a month since September 2016.\n\nHas the 30-year bond bull market reached a top?\n\nRay Dalio thinks so.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, the billionaire hedge fund manager said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how far we are from the top in the stock market and then the economy, though it is clear that we are past the top in the bond market.\u201d\n\nYet Jeff Rosenberg, the chief fixed-income strategist at BlackRock, said that it is a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d to call the end of the bond bull market. Mr. Rosenberg told CNBC that while he expects higher bond yields to persist for a period, he is not ready to call the end of the bond bull market.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat could be sold off in the Trump infrastructure plan\n\nIf the White House had its way, here\u2019s some of the government-run assets that could be sold to private financiers as part of the $1.5 trillion infrastructure investment program:\n\n\u2022 Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\n\n\u2022 Dulles International Airport\n\n\u2022 The George Washington and Baltimore Washington parkways\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 The Washington Aqueduct\n\nHere\u2019s what the plan says:\n\nThe vast majority of the Nation\u2019s electricity needs are met through for-profit investor-owned utilities. Federal ownership of these assets can result in sub-optimal investment decisions and create risk for taxpayers.\n\nSome context: Only one U.S. airport \u2014 Puerto Rico\u2019s \u2014 has successfully been privatized. (Chicago\u2019s bid to privatize Midway failed four years ago.) Thus far, St. Louis is the only mainland U.S. city that is exploring privatizing its airport, but the effort has drawn criticism.\n\nAn interesting point about infrastructure investing raised by Dan Primack of Axios:\n\nThe average level of return that infrastructure investment funds have sought was about 10.6 percent in 2016, down from 14 percent in 2004, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Global Infrastructure Investor Association. Infrastructure in general is regarded as a lower-return asset class with fairly consistent cash flows.\n\nWhile the Blackstone Group is raising $40 billion for its own infrastructure fund (half of which is coming from Saudi Arabia), it\u2019s hard to see private investors filling in the $1.3 trillion required to fulfill the Trump administration\u2019s vision.\n\nTo break it down numerically:\n\n\u2022 PwC and the G.I.A.A. note that roughly $200 billion had been raised by infrastructure investors since 2006.\n\n\u2022 Roughly $1.7 trillion was invested worldwide between January 2010 and September 2016.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nWhat investors are watching to guess the markets\u2019 direction\n\nThe recent, complacency-shaking declines in stock prices will have forced investors to take more seriously the yardsticks used to assess whether stocks are worth buying. None of the metrics on their own reliably can predict the direction of stocks, but when markets are freaking out and much is a blur, well-chosen indicators can steady the nerves and clarify the mind.\n\nThe most important indicator right now\n\nIt\u2019s the 10-year Treasury note\u2019s yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price. A higher yield reflects greater inflation fears among investors \u2014 and a higher likelihood of that interest rates are going up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStock investors fear higher interest rates for two main reasons:\n\n\u2022 Most immediately, they make stock valuations look less attractive\n\n\u2022 In the longer term, they can eventually slow economic growth.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note has retreated to 2.83 percent Monday, while United States stocks are trading higher. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are all up more than 0.5 percent.\n\nAdding to the fun\n\nThe government inflation figures come out on Wednesday.\n\nThe valuation question\n\nThe recent volatility in the stock market has stirred up the valuation debate. Put more directly, did the declines take stock prices down to level where they no longer look expensive?\n\nThere are many ways to tackle that question. But for no particular reason, let\u2019s look at the Rule of 20 today. This yardstick subtracts the inflation rate from the number 20 and compares that answer with the price-to-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500. Stocks are theoretically overvalued if the price-to-earnings ratio is higher.\n\nRight now, the S.&P. 500 price-to-earnings ratio is 21.1 times, 3.2 above the 17.9 that you get from subtracting the inflation rate from 20. That suggests stocks could have further to fall.\n\nStill, history shows why that might not be the case. In 1997, the rule of 20 gave roughly the same answer as we have now, but stocks kept zooming higher. (Of course, that bull run did not end well. By 2001, the stock market was down below 1997 levels.)\n\nIf you find the debate over valuation unsatisfactory ...\n\nThere are also technical indicators, which look at how traders react to a wide selection of market measurements. One of the most interesting right now is the 200-day moving average on the S.&P. 500.\n\nJohn Kimelman at Barron\u2019s gave a good run down on why it matters:\n\nBut at one point Friday, it looked like that was where things were heading. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 briefly broke below its 200-day moving average, or 2539, before recovering and closing the week above 2619, up 1.5% on the day. The 200-day moving average\u2014the continually updated average price of the past 200 days\u2014is considered a strong measure of investor sentiment. If the S&P 500 had continued to fall below the average, it would have conveyed real bearishness. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t closed below that moving average in 408 trading sessions, going back to around the U.S. presidential election in November 2016, according to LPL Financial.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nIcahn and Deason urge shareholders not to \u201clet Fuji steal\u201d Xerox.\n\nCarl Icahn and Darwin Deason, two of Xerox\u2019s biggest investors, sent a letter to shareholders criticizing the printer and copier maker\u2019s deal with Fujifilm Holdings of Japan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the letter:\n\nIt really is a remarkable achievement by Fuji. Without putting up any cash, they will acquire majority control and ownership of a venerable American icon. In exchange, we \u2013 the existing Xerox shareholders \u2013 will receive (1) an additional, indirect 25% interest in a Fuji subsidiary that just last year disclosed a $360 million accounting scandal caused by a \u201cculture of concealment\u201d and Fuji\u2019s failure to have adequate management systems and (2) a one-time special dividend financed with our own assets.\n\nThe backstory\n\nXerox said on Jan. 31 that it would combine operations with Fujifilm Holdings in a $6.1 billion deal.\n\nThe complicated transaction will fold Xerox into an existing 55-year-old joint venture. Xerox shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $9.80 a share and will own 49.9 percent of the combined business, which will be publicly traded. The move is expected to save at least $1.7 billion in costs, though Fujifilm will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nAt the end of last year, Mr. Icahn launched a campaign to unseat the Xerox\u2019s board, and late last month, he and Mr. Deason pressured the company to explore a deal \u2014 including revising or ending the Fujifilm joint venture.\n\nXerox\u2019s statement, via Reuters:\n\nXerox said it \u201cconsidered several other options in detail and concluded that the combination with Fuji Xerox is the \u2018best path to create value\u2019 for the company.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nBroadcom will walk if it doesn\u2019t get control of Qualcomm\u2019s board.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s chief executive, Hock Tan, appeared on CNBC to discuss his company\u2019s $121 billion bid for Qualcomm.

You think I would sign up to pay $8 billion if there\u2019s even a second thought?\u201d\n\nOn if Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders don\u2019t vote for a majority of Broadcom\u2019s slate on March 6:\n\n\u201cThis is a binary proposal. If at least a majority of our slate does not get in on March 6, then I guess we will get the message that this deal is not going to happen. We will walk.\u201d\n\nOn Qualcomm\u2019s $110 a share offer for NXP Semiconductors, which has gotten pushback from NXP investors:\n\n\u201cNXPI will not solve Qualcomm\u2019s problems.\u201d\n\nOn the possibility that Qualcomm increases its bid for NXP Semiconductors:\n\n\u201cIf Qualcomm raises the price on NXPI, we have made it very clear, it\u2019s a clear transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXPI shareholders.\u201d \u201c$110 is a full and fair price for NXPI.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWho wants to buy which Time Inc. titles from Meredith?\n\nMeredith has closed its deal to buy Time Inc.

Last September, after Facebook turned over information about Russian ad purchases to the special counsel, a specialist named Irina Kaverzina emailed a family member: \u201cWe had a slight crisis here at work: the FBI busted our activity (not a joke). So, I got preoccupied with covering tracks together with the colleagues.\u201d Ms. Kaverzina continued, \u201cI created all these pictures and posts, and the Americans believed that it was written by their people.\u201d\n\nFake news, indeed.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s defenders, desperate to exculpate him, seized on a single word \u2014 \u201cunwitting\u201d \u2014 that the indictment used to describe certain \u201cmembers, volunteers and supporters of the Trump campaign involved in local community outreach\u201d who had interacted with the Russians.\n\nIn other words, as the White House subtly put it in a statement on Friday, \u201cNO COLLUSION.\u201d The president repeated the claim himself in a tweet, grudgingly acknowledging Russia\u2019s \u201canti-US campaign,\u201d but emphasizing that it had started \u201clong before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong \u2014 no collusion!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that, as Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in an announcement, these particular indictments do not allege that any American knew about the influence campaign, nor that the campaign had changed the outcome of the election. But that\u2019s quite different from saying that there was no collusion or impact on the election. As Mr. Rosenstein also said, the special counsel\u2019s investigation is continuing, and there are many strands the public still knows little or nothing about.\n\nRemember, Mr. Mueller has already secured two guilty pleas, one from Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser and another from a former campaign adviser, for lying to federal authorities about their connections to Russian government officials. He has also charged Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his top aide, Rick Gates, with crimes including money laundering. Mr. Gates appears to be nearing a plea deal himself.\n\nThen there were Russian cyberattacks on the elections systems of at least 39 states. And the hacking of emails sent among members of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign \u2014 which Mr. Trump openly encouraged.\n\nThis is all going to happen again. Intelligence and law enforcement authorities have made that clear. The question is whether Mr. Trump will at last accept the fact of Russian interference and take aggressive measures to protect American democracy. For starters, he could impose the sanctions on Russia that Congress overwhelmingly passed, and that he signed into law, last summer. Of course, this would require him to overcome his mysterious resistance to acting against Russia and to focus on protecting his own country.", "title": "Opinion | Stop Letting the Russians Get Away With It, Mr. Trump", "authors": []}

This arrangement has been a long time coming. We expected smooth and timely implementation and hope that both countries are working hard to fulfill the agreement soon.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Mr. Darbi\u2019s plea deal, Saudi Arabia and the United States exchanged diplomatic notes agreeing to the transfer. Under those terms, the process was to begin with him submitting a request to prosecutors, which the United States would then send through diplomatic channels to the kingdom.\n\nIf Saudi Arabia concurred, the notes said, the kingdom would inform the United States \u201cand initiate procedures\u201d to carry out the transfer at Saudi expense.

It\u2019s ill advised, passionate and doomed. How could it be otherwise? The reader knows from the start that Polly has done something unforgivable: She has walked away from her husband and 3-year-old daughter at the beach, left a note in their holiday rental and hitched a ride into an unknown future, jumping out at Belleville when the driver tried to put a hand on her knee. We know her husband is a heel, we can forgive her for running away from him \u2014 but a child? Really? And if Adam is able to overlook this, how do we feel about that?\n\nPolly yearns for a quiet life (\u201cAll she has ever wanted is a home, a place with things that bring comfort. Thick towels, deep chairs, soft rugs. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean having money, but it means having more money than she\u2019s ever had. So far\u201d) but she won\u2019t find one in Belleville. All the shadows she hoped to leave behind \u2014 police corruption, arson, insurance scams, confidence tricks and, inevitably, murder \u2014 are catching up with her. If these elements of the plot drag a little, perhaps that\u2019s because Lippman wants us to examine our assumptions. Why are these crimes somehow less compelling, less appalling, than Polly\u2019s act of maternal desertion? Unpicking this, the reader is shown something unexpected. The last scenes may belong in a different, more sentimental novel, but by this point you will want difficult, damaged Polly to find her happy ending.\n\nSo \u201cSunburn,\u201d though cool and twisty, has more heart than expected. It\u2019s generous in other ways, too. The particular atmosphere of unlovely Belleville is deftly conveyed: its motel and trailer park, its emptied-out Main Street and, of course, the High-Ho, where regulars gather to watch \u201cthe inevitable Orioles game on the inevitable TV with the inevitable shimmy in its reception.\u201d Yet there is beauty here too. You see the huge red sun sinking into the cornfields; you feel the dew underfoot.\n\nNow and then a tangential character who in another novel might only merit a line or two is given a vivid chapter of his or her own. Here\u2019s a recently dumped gay P.I. who\u2019s fussy about chef\u2019s salads; a video-store clerk who prides himself on his staff picks; a housewife who has a marble-topped kitchen island and white roses in a milk-bottle vase; and her sister, who has none of those things.\n\nPeople move in and out of the narrative with their own baggage and preoccupations. What they choose to tell us is very subjective and not always directly relevant, and this clamor of voices gives the novel satisfying depth and texture. There\u2019s a sense here that we\u2019re brushing up against many lives, many versions of the truth. \u201cStories are like dough,\u201d Polly thinks, reflecting on the slippery business of family myth. \u201cPut your hands in your stories, work them, but don\u2019t overwork them.\u201d", "title": "Strangers in the Night, Exchanging Genre Conventions", "authors": []}

As such, we also need movies about love, and yes, in this category we often expect somewhat higher standards than those reflected in works like \u201cFailure to Launch\u201d or \u201cFriends With Benefits.\u201d\n\nAs Valentine\u2019s Day looms, I\u2019ve compiled my list of outstanding romantic films available on streaming video services. I begin with offerings on FilmStruck and its attendant Criterion Channel. A real find there is the \u201cHistory Is Made at Night,\u201d a still-underseen film from 1937 that\u2019s never been on a presentable DVD. It\u2019s one of the most romantic Hollywood movies ever, also one of the warmest and in some respects the funniest. Any attempts to sum up the plot of this film will sound daft. Story elements include a jealous husband, cheesy ventriloquism used for flirtation, two men who take over a restaurant for the sole purpose of attracting a single client, and an ocean liner forced to plow into an iceberg. But the chemistry between its stars, the ultra-Gallic Charles Boyer and Jean Arthur, playing up her cornfed American quality (early on Boyer\u2019s character nicknames her \u201cKansas\u201d), remains remarkable to this day. And Frank Borzage\u2019s direction of Gene Towne and C. Graham Baker\u2019s far-fetched screenplay is a model of seamless conviction.\n\nThe Michael Powell-Emeric Pressburger picture \u201cI Know Where I\u2019m Going!\u201d from 1947, is a strong contender for the most romantic British picture ever made. Wendy Hiller\u2019s lead character thinks she knows where she\u2019s going \u2014 off to the Scottish Hebrides to marry for money. A detour in the company of a near-penniless laird (Roger Livesey) changes her plans. The raw beauty of the Scottish locations sets off the tumultuous love story in inimitable cinematic style. Other greats in FilmStruck\u2019s catalog include Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s sweet and graceful \u201cStolen Kisses,\u201d a 1969 picture in which Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud, as the Truffaut alter-ego Antoine Doinel, tentatively pursues the lovely Claude Jade, but is intrigued by an older woman, Delphine Seyrig, and Howard Hawks\u2019s \u201cHis Girl Friday\u201d (1940), starring Cary Grant as a newspaper editor who pursues his ex-wife and former star reporter, Rosalind Russell, in frantic, eccentric screwball-comedy style.\n\nFilmStruck also offers two first-rate stories of gay love. \u201cWeekend,\u201d the 2011 film written and directed by Andrew Haigh, in which a late-night bar pickup turns into something deeper and more intimate. (This is not to be confused with the 1968 \u201cWeekend\u201d on the Criterion Channel, a ragefest directed by Jean-Luc Godard that begins with a mutually adulterous husband and wife contemplating homicide.) Donna Deitch\u2019s 1985 \u201cDesert Hearts,\u201d about two women falling in love in the wide open spaces of 1950s Nevada, is a groundbreaking movie that continues to play beautifully today.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd while I wouldn\u2019t call \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette\u201d (1986), directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Hanif Kureishi, a direct precursor to Mr. Haigh\u2019s \u201cWeekend,\u201d the films do have an affinity. \u201cLaundrette\u201d is a story not just of cultural difference (the main character is a second-generation immigrant of Pakistani origins, trying to make good in Thatcher\u2019s England) but of gay love and friendship in a working-class milieu.

The wealthiest 1 percent own 40 percent of the income of our entire country, and that number is growing. Most low-wage workers do not receive any benefits from their employers \u2014 no health insurance, no retirement plans, no guaranteed sick days, nothing to protect them from the unforeseen forces of fate, whether it be a bad fall or an unexpected death or illness in the family. Ignoring these facts, the Trump administration\u2019s major legislative accomplishment has been a huge tax cut for the wealthy, widening the wage gap even further.\n\nNow comes a court case that could increase our nation\u2019s income inequality even more. On Monday the Supreme Court heard Janus vs. Afscme, a historic case that challenges a four-decade-old precedent that stipulates union members must pay the union in exchange for the union fulfilling its legal responsibility to represent every member, negotiate a contract and fight for pay increases for everyone. The potential consequences of the court\u2019s decision will be real and immediate. If the court rules against Afscme \u2014 the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \u2014 then union members across the country could receive all the benefits of being in a union without having to pay for it.\n\nThis could be perceived as a win for union members, who would reap the assistance of a union without having to pay dues. But the impact of an anti-union decision would be financially disastrous for public-sector employees. It would give people an option that might seem appealing (getting something for nothing) but that would actually ensure that unions do not have the resources they need to negotiate good contracts, fight for higher wages, defend members and protect pensions.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case is Mark Janus, a child-support specialist for the state of Illinois. But the real perpetrators of the broader assault on workers are the billionaires and corporations who have spent fortunes over many years to defund unions and consequently make it harder for working people to receive fair wages.

Keane\u2019s play \u201cThe Field,\u201d said Terence Dooley, a historian of land reform who is a professor at Maynooth University. \u201cAnd rights of way on Irish land are probably the most contentious and controversial issue you can deal with.\u201d\n\nBut the timing of the Greenway development was propitious.\n\nThe local council had long been interested in using the old railway as a walking and cycling route based on similar initiatives elsewhere in Europe. And when Padraig Philbin, the senior county engineer who pioneered the Greenway, got started on the project nine years ago, the global financial crisis had left Ireland in need of ideas that would bring in revenue.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe were in a bad place back in 2009,\u201d Mr. Philbin said. \u201cThe recession had just begun, and this area was hurt worse than most. Most people knew it was for the well-being of the entire area, and there would be jobs and other benefits.\u201d\n\nThere were still many obstacles. Landowners had to be assured that they would not face lawsuits by anyone injured on the trail, and that they would retain full ownership of their land and be able to withdraw permission to cross it at any time. In some places, diversions had to be made where the old line passed too close to newly built houses, or where landowners could not be persuaded to come on board.\n\nBut the response to the Greenway\u2019s opening has been highly positive.\n\nThe local council reckons that the trail had already generated enough new tourism to make up for most of its cost of 7.5 million euros, or about $9.3 million, only a year after it officially opened in 2010. At least 200 new jobs were created in pubs, hotels, bicycle rental and other tourism-related businesses, the council said, and over a quarter-million people now use the trail each year.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Greenway concept, already proven abroad, has been emulated in other parts of Ireland, too.

They may not have been among the league leaders in sacks, but they were the key cogs in a defense that led the N.F.L. with 112 quarterback hits.\n\nThere is little relief behind the defensive line, as the Eagles have standout defenders on all three levels, especially the secondary, where Ronald Darby and Malcolm Jenkins are the stars but Jalen Mills and Rodney McLeod more than hold their own.\n\nOne of the things Philadelphia did best this season, according to statistics provided by Sportradar, was limit the effectiveness of throwing into coverage. Brady was one of the most aggressive quarterbacks in the N.F.L. this season at attempting passes to covered receivers, and that could be a serious problem against a team that allowed a 16.6 passer rating on passes in which a defender was within a yard of the receiver.\n\nBrady is Brady, so he can be relied upon to find a way to move the ball, but tight end Rob Gronkowski\u2019s health and effectiveness are in question after he sustained a concussion in the A.F.C. championship game. If Gronkowski is limited, Brady will try to move the ball downfield with Brandin Cooks, but will probably have to rely on running backs James White and Dion Lewis to provide a lot of his passing yardage on catch-and-runs.\n\nIt is unlikely that the Patriots will get much out of their running game. The Eagles had the top-ranked run defense in the N.F.L., giving up an average of 79.2 yards a game. Part of that is a function of the opposition often trying to overcome a deficit, but the Eagles were sixth in the N.F.L. in yards allowed per carry and allowed only seven rushing touchdowns. It is hard to see Mike Gillislee, Rex Burkhead and Lewis getting much traction.\n\nWhen Philadelphia Has the Ball\n\nPhoto\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s status as underdog rests almost entirely on which version of Foles shows up. If he is the tentative passer who struggled in the regular season and his team\u2019s win over the Atlanta Falcons in the divisional round, the Eagles are in trouble. If he is the confident, 2013 vintage Foles who tore apart the Minnesota Vikings in the N.F.C. championship game, the game is at worst a tossup for Philadelphia and at most a shocking upset.\n\nTo put so much pressure on Foles, who stepped into the starting role after a season-ending injury to Carson Wentz, is, of course, unfair. But there is an argument to be made that if Wentz were active, it would be Patriots fans raiding Amazon.com in hopes of finding dog masks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFoles will want to build on his recent success against a terrific Minnesota secondary. He spread the ball around and appeared to have shaken off the rust that limited him severely in the previous few games. He got receptions of 35 yards or more from four different receivers and was especially good on third down; Philadelphia converted 10 of 14 opportunities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Patriots\u2019 secondary could struggle against receiver Alshon Jeffery and tight end Zach Ertz, but will probably not have much trouble containing Torrey Smith and the erratic Nelson Agholor.\n\nWhen looking to run, the Eagles have one of the most diversified and effective attacks in the N.F.L. Losing the mobile Wentz was a serious blow, but a group of backs that includes Jay Ajayi, LeGarrette Blount and Corey Clement can run against any defense. The only thing that would slow them down is the Patriots getting off to a big early lead, which would force the Eagles to abandon the run.\n\nSumming Up\n\nIf you remove the quarterbacks from the equation, the Eagles are at least the Patriots\u2019 equal, if not their superior. They were a juggernaut under Wentz and still have a loaded roster. The Patriots, for all of their recent success, are relying far more on experience and execution than overall talent. At one point, Las Vegas had the Eagles as 6-point underdogs, but that has been lowered to 4 points, which seems closer to reality. Just don\u2019t tell Brady.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not buying any underdogs,\u201d he said of the Eagles. \u201cYou\u2019re not fooling me with that.\u201d\n\nThe Eagles will fight hard, and certainly have a chance at pulling off an upset, but Brady\u2019s experience and Foles\u2019s volatility give New England a slight advantage.

That court had interceded after finding that a map drawn by state lawmakers for the General Assembly had relied too heavily on race and had violated state laws.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s order, which was brief and gave no reasons, partly blocked that decision while the justices consider whether to hear an appeal in the case.\n\nThe justices seemed to split into three camps: Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they would have granted the entire request; Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have granted none of it; and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, Elena Kagan and Neil M. Gorsuch appeared to take the middle position.\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court blocked a decision from a different federal court in North Carolina that had ordered state lawmakers to redraw the state\u2019s congressional maps. That ruling concerned partisan gerrymandering, while the new one was based on a finding of racial gerrymandering and violations of state law.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Supreme Court has occasionally struck down voting districts as racial gerrymanders. But it has never ruled that a partisan gerrymander crossed a constitutional line.

Islamic Republic of Iran, No. 16-534, but the court did not say why.\n\nWhistle-Blowers\n\nThe court unanimously ruled that a federal law protecting whistle-blowers in securities cases must be read narrowly to bar many retaliation suits from people who say they were fired for reporting wrongdoing. The plain words of the law, part of the Dodd-Frank Act, required that conclusion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote.\n\nThe law defined \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d to mean \u201can individual who provides information relating to a violation of the securities laws\u201d to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That language excluded people who merely reported wrongdoing to their employers, Justice Ginsburg wrote.\n\nThe case, Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, No. 16-1276, started when Paul Somers, then an executive at a real estate investment trust, told his superiors \u2014 but not the S.E.C. \u2014 about what he said were securities law violations. Mr. Somers was fired, and he sued under the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nA divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, allowed the case to proceed, saying that a literal application of the law \u201cwould make little practical sense and undercut congressional intent.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed that decision. \u201cCourts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition \u2014 tell the S.E.C. \u2014 Congress imposed,\u201d Justice Ginsburg wrote.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Murphy sued the guards, winning about $307,000 and $108,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe question in the case was how to interpret a federal law that says in such cases \u201ca portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded against the defendant.\u201d\n\nA trial judge ordered Mr. Murphy to pay 10 percent of his award to his lawyers, but an appeals court ruled that the law required the full 25 percent.\n\nJustice Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said the law left no room for judicial discretion. \u201cWhen you purposefully seek or aim \u2018to satisfy\u2019 an obligation, especially a financial obligation, that usually means you intend to discharge the obligation in full,\u201d he wrote. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Thomas and Alito joined the majority opinion.\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that the law\u2019s language contemplated partial payments. She said, for instance, that a partial payment of a credit card debt would be generally understood to be \u201capplied to satisfy\u201d the debt. Justices Ginsburg, Breyer and Kagan joined the dissent in the case, Murphy v. Smith, No. 16-1067.\n\nAppeals After Guilty Pleas\n\nBy a 6-to-3 vote, the court ruled that a North Carolina man who pleaded guilty to violating a federal law that bars firearms on the grounds of the United States Capitol may nonetheless challenge the constitutionality of the law on appeal.\n\nThe defendant, Rodney Class, was charged with violating the law after guns and ammunition were found in his car in a parking lot on the Capitol grounds. On appeal, he sought to argue that the law violated the Second Amendment and the Constitution\u2019s due process clause. The appeals court refused to consider the arguments, saying that Mr. Class had waived them by pleading guilty.\n\nJustice Breyer, writing for the majority, said, \u201cClass\u2019s valid guilty plea does not, by itself, bar direct appeal of his constitutional claims in these circumstances.\u201d Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Kagan and Gorsuch joined the majority opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn dissent, Justice Alito wrote that the majority had provided no clear guidance about when appeals after guilty pleas are permitted. \u201cThere is no justification for the muddle left by today\u2019s decision,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cI fear that today\u2019s decision will bedevil the lower courts.\u201d Justices Kennedy and Thomas joined Justice Alito\u2019s dissent in the case, Class v.

He arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in an Uber at 2:19 p.m. on Wednesday and pulled out a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, according to details described by the authorities at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nMr. Cruz also shot people inside five classrooms on the first and second floors of the freshman building. He eventually discarded the rifle, a vest and ammunition in a stairwell, blended in with fleeing students and got away, the authorities said.\n\nAfter leaving the school, Mr. Cruz walked to a Walmart, and bought a drink at a Subway. He also stopped at a McDonald\u2019s. He was arrested by the police without incident as he walked down a residential street at 3:41 p.m.\n\n\u201cHe looked like a typical high school student, and for a quick moment I thought, could this be the person who I need to stop?\u201d said Officer Michael Leonard.\n\nHere are the takeaways:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Cruz faces 17 counts of premeditated murder \u2014 one for each of the people he is accused of killing on Wednesday in a shooting that was captured on cellphone video by terrified students. He is being held without bond at the main Broward County jail, where he has been placed on suicide watch, according to Gordon Weekes, the county\u2019s chief assistant public defender.\n\n\u2022 The AR-15 rifle used in the attack was purchased legally, at Sunrise Tactical Supply in Florida, according to a federal law enforcement official. The arrest report said Mr. Cruz purchased it in February 2017. \u201cNo laws were violated in the procurement of this weapon,\u201d said Peter J. Forcelli, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Miami.\n\n\u2022 The F.B.I. said on Thursday it received information last year about a comment made on a YouTube channel which has been attributed to the gunman, but was unable to identify the person.\n\n\u2022 In Florida, an AR-15 is easier to buy than a handgun. Read more on how the AR-15 became one of the weapons of choice for mass killers, and the research that tries to explain the high rate of mass shootings in the United States.\n\n\u2022 With this shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months.

Mr. Cruz has a \u201csignificant\u201d history of mental illness, according to Mr. Weekes, and is possibly autistic or has a learning disability.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Mr. Weekes was not yet ready to say whether he would pursue a mental health defense.\n\nHoward Finkelstein, the chief public defender in Broward County, said the case will present a difficult question: Should society execute mentally ill people?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question of whether he will be convicted of capital murder 17 times,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we let one of our children fall off grid, when they are screaming for help in every way, do we have the right to kill them when we could have stopped it?\u201d\n\nSince his mother\u2019s death last year, Mr. Cruz was living with another family, said their attorney.\n\nThe family that took him in, the Sneads, had seen signs of depression in Mr. Cruz, but nothing indicated that he was capable of this kind of violence, Jim Lewis, the family\u2019s attorney, said. The family had allowed Mr. Cruz to bring his gun with him to their house, insisting that he keep it in a lockbox.\n\nMr. Lewis had encouraged Mr. Cruz to attend adult education courses, work toward his G.E.D., and take a job at a local Dollar Tree store, he said in a brief interview. The Sneads\u2019 son, a junior, knew Mr. Cruz from Stoneman Douglas High.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Cruz and the Sneads\u2019 son were texting until 2:18 p.m., Mr. Lewis said \u2014 about five minutes before the first 911 calls about the shooting. \u201cBut there was nothing crazy in the texts,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. Here is our profile on Mr. Cruz.\n\nGino Santorio, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Broward Health, said the hospital where Mr. Cruz was taken, Broward Health North, enacted safety protocols when he arrived on Wednesday.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe staff treated the suspect \u201clike every patient they treat,\u201d Mr. Santorio said.\n\n\u201cWe were able to seclude the patient, treat and get them out without any issues,\u201d he added.\n\nBroward Health North received nine patients, including the suspect, according to Kelly Keys, manager of emergency preparedness for the health system.

Mr. Bennight said he then left a voice mail message at his local F.B.I. field office alerting it to the comment.\n\nMr. Bennight, 36, said that when he originally reported the comments to the F.B.I., a pair of agents interviewed him the next morning. Mr. Bennight said two F.B.I. agents visited him a few hours after the shooting on Wednesday, spending about 15 to 20 minutes with him. The agents told him they thought the person who posted on his channel might be connected to the Florida shooting because they had the same name.\n\nVideo\n\nThe F.B.I. on Thursday released a statement that said it received information about a comment made on a YouTube channel in September 2017. \u201cNo other information was included in the comment which would indicate a particular time, location, or the true identity of the person who posted the comment,\u201d the statement said. The F.B.I. said it conducted database reviews and other checks, but was unable to further identify the person who posted the comment.\n\nOn Thursday, Jordan Jereb, a leader of a white supremacist group based in North Florida, told The Associated Press that Mr. Cruz had joined the group, but later Mr. Jereb said that he did not know whether that was true. Sheriff Israel said he could not confirm any ties Mr. Cruz might have had to white nationalists.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s Instagram accounts showed guns and hinted at animal cruelty.\n\nTwo Instagram accounts that classmates said belonged to Mr. Cruz were filled with images of weaponry, as well as the hats and bandannas he liked to wear to school. Among more innocuous pictures of animals, including a dog and a gecko, was a picture of a slaughtered toad. In response to a comment on that image, Mr. Cruz wrote that toads tended to run away when they saw him, because \u201cI killed a lot of them.\u201d\n\nOther posts on the first account, like one captioned \u201carsenal,\u201d showcased collections of firearms, including what appears to be a Savage Axis bolt-action rifle, a Smith and Wesson M&P15-series rifle, and at least two shotguns.\n\nVideo\n\nIt was unclear whether the profile picture for that account, a face nearly entirely covered with a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and large bandanna, was an image of Mr. Cruz.\n\nThe profile picture for the second account also featured a face almost fully covered, this time with an Army beanie. The account included several pictures of a figure wearing several different Army hats and carrying guns and knives. It also contained a picture of a Google search for the Arabic phrase \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d \u2014 God is great.\n\nInstagram did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\n\u2018The shots were something I\u2019ll never forget\u2019\n\nMoises Lobaton, a senior, was in psychology class when gunfire boomed. The students scurried to try to hide as far away from the door as possible.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough space behind the desk, so not all of the kids could fit,\u201d he said.\n\nShots shattered a glass window on the door, injuring at least three of his classmates, including a girl who \u201cwasn\u2019t moving at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was next to a pool of blood, but I couldn\u2019t tell if it was hers or the guy next to hers,\u201d he said. The boy had been shot in the arm and was bleeding profusely. His classmates wrapped the arm in cloth. Another boy called 911.\n\n\u201cThe shots were something I\u2019ll never forget. It sounded like bombs going off, one at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was one or two feet to the right, I would have died.\u201d\n\nIn New York, two students were arrested after threatening on social media to \u2018gun down\u2019 their Brooklyn high school, police said.\n\nCole Carlberg, 16, turned himself in, and the police picked up Joshua Schechter, 16, after receiving a 911 call at about 9 a.m. on Thursday. Both were charged with making terroristic threats, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a weapon, a New York police sergeant, Brendan Ryan, said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the teenagers had posted on Snapchat that they had planned to shoot up Brooklyn Prospect Charter School on Fort Hamilton Parkway, Sergeant Ryan said, adding that the school contacted parents about the threat. One of the teenagers had an \u201cair pistol rifle\u201d that Sergeant Ryan described as a pellet or BB gun, but said it was unclear who owned it. \u201cThat\u2019s still under investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Carlberg and Mr. Schechter remained in custody on Thursday night, Sergeant Ryan said.", "title": "Suspect Confessed to Police That He Began Shooting Students \u2018in the Hallways\u2019", "authors": ["Julie Turkewitz", "Patricia Mazzei", "Audra D.

It\u2019s known in some areas as a whistle pig, for its short, sharp cries, but more commonly, as a woodchuck.\n\nThat\u2019s where the day\u2019s simplicities end.

(In fact, he\u2019s looking for a mate.) Tradition holds that if Phil sees his shadow, it means six more weeks of winter. No shadow, and an early spring is on the way.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s all in fun, of course.

This way Iran can control Damascus and use Syria as a forward base to put pressure on Israel but pay \u201cwholesale,\u201d not \u201cretail.\u201d\n\nU.S. Special Forces are arming and advising Kurdish fighters from northern Syria to carry out the ground war against ISIS. Turkey is using Sunni rebels to fight the same Kurds. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Jordan all use various Sunni rebels to fight the pro-Iranian, pro-Shiite regime forces, and Israel is using the long arm of its air force.\n\nIn 2003 I wrote a column in the run-up to the U.S. toppling of Saddam Hussein, which I supported, in which I warned: \u201cThe first rule of any Iraq invasion is the pottery store rule: You break it, you own it. We break Iraq, we own Iraq.\u201d\n\nSo in Syria today, the abiding rule is, \u201cYou own it, you fix it.\u201d And because no one wants to own responsibility for fixing Syria \u2014 a gargantuan project \u2014 they all want to just rent their influence there.\n\nThere is something very 21st century about this war.\n\nBut this is distressing. It means none of the local parties has enough power, resources \u2014 or willingness to compromise \u2014 to stabilize Syria from the bottom up, and none of the external parties is ready to invest enough power and resources to stabilize it from the top down.\n\nThe \u201cgood news,\u201d sort of, is that because everyone is so \u201closs averse\u201d in Syria, it\u2019s less likely that any party will get too reckless. The Iranians and Hezbollah will most likely continue to prod and poke Israel, but not to such a degree that the Israelis do what they are capable of doing, which is to devastate every Hezbollah neighborhood in Lebanon and hit Iran\u2019s homeland with rockets; Israel knows that its high-tech corridor along its coastal plain would be devastated by Iranian rockets coming back.\n\nThe Turks don\u2019t want a war with America. America doesn\u2019t want a war with Russia, and the Russians just want to siphon off as much oil as they can from Syria, and use it as a base and an ego booster, without clashing with anyone \u2014 because they are much weaker than they look.\n\nMaybe, eventually, the players will get tired and forge a power-sharing accord in Syria, as the Lebanese eventually did in 1989 to end their civil war.

Together, they put away the canvas and made their bodies a part of their art.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAustria was not a police state but close enough,\u201d Mr. Brus said, sitting at a long wooden table facing snow-covered hills through large bay windows. Postwar Austria was a traditional society, strongly influenced by the church and governed by strict rules. Mr. Brus recalled being fined as a young man for walking on a patch of grass.\n\n\u201cWe rebelled against this society,\u201d said his wife, Anna Brus, sitting in a wheelchair at the head of the table. \u201cIt was so unbelievably palpable, how these Nazis were everywhere, on every corner, much more than the police.\u201d\n\nAs Mr. Brus\u2019s notoriety grew, so did the anger some members of the public felt toward him. He and his wife both received death threats, and there was a petition to take away their child.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe aim was to break taboos,\u201d Mr. Brus said of his actions. \u201cMy art doesn\u2019t just stink in the physical space but smells in the souls of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Brus\u2019s work was not only taboo-breaking, it was also political. Today, many in the art world here are similarly engaged. Last year, riding the wave of a backlash against Europe\u2019s treatment of the migration crisis, the far-right Freedom Party again took up key posts in Austria\u2019s government, following a break of over a decade.\n\n\u201cI feel this political consciousness in his work,\u201d said Harald Krejci, curator of the exhibition. He said that he had selected several works for their political content. One is titled \u201cAverage Austrians and Austrians-by-Choice Demand a Ministry of Re-engagement in National Socialist Activities and Excuses,\u201d and features these words written on the Austrian flag. Mr. Brus made this work in 2000, after the Freedom Party achieved a record share of the vote in an election.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1968, as student protests swept Western Europe, the Vienna Actionists were invited to stage an action in a lecture hall at the University of Vienna. \u201cArt and Revolution\u201d involved Mr. Brus cutting himself, urinating, defecating and masturbating while singing Austria\u2019s national anthem, in an outrageous effort to show the facts of life with no filters. As a result of the performance, Mr. Brus was prosecuted for the crime of \u201cdegrading symbols of the state\u201d and fled with his family to exile in West Berlin.\n\n\u201cIn Berlin we found an open and tolerant, liberal society and my wife didn\u2019t even know what the police looked like for the first two years,\u201d Mr. Brus said.\n\nMs. Brus easily found work as a seamstress and later a fashion designer and Mr. Brus found new artistic expression in collaborations with other artists. Drawing gave him newfound liberty once he had reached his body\u2019s limits. (After the work \u201cZerreissprobe,\u201d or \u201cThe Real Test,\u201d in 1970, in which Mr. Brus slit himself with a razor and beat himself to exhaustion, ending up bloodied, panting and sweating, the artist called an end to the actions.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe exhibition in Vienna also emphasizes the partnership between Mr. and Ms. Brus. Valie Export, a feminist visual artist and contemporary of the Actionists, said Mr. Brus\u2019s treatment of women stood out from the rest of the group. She said the actions Mr. and Ms. Brus collaborated on \u201chad a poetic language.\u201d\n\nMs. Brus said she was often asked how she endured being part of her husband\u2019s actions, like \u201cTransfusion,\u201d in which Mr. Brus, naked, painted his wife\u2019s body in a space littered with nails and other sharp objects, before engaging in what appeared to be a sex act, while she sat, still and impassive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn our partnership, in our common work, this was never a question,\u201d Ms. Brus said. \u201cIn our work we were Comrades, friends, and it was a very natural relationship,\u201d Mr. Brus added immediately.\n\nEva Badura-Triska, curator of several past exhibitions on Vienna Actionists at Mumok, Vienna\u2019s museum of modern art, said that when you looked at Mr. Brus\u2019s art \u201cyou are facing the truth.\u201d She added that watching a work like \u201cZerreissprobe\u201d was \u201cnot a pleasure,\u201d in the same way it was not a pleasure to watch the bloody experience of birth, or to see somebody dying or defecating.\n\n\u201cBut when you look away,\u201d Ms. Badura-Triska said, \u201cyou are getting into moral territory that may turn out to be problematic for society.\u201d", "title": "Taking On Austria\u2019s Nazi Legacy With His Own Blood and Tears", "authors": ["Palko Karasz"]}

Since early December, the artistic life of the company has been run by a team of four young people, all under 40. Weeks or months are likely to pass before any permanent successor is appointed. Until June, the company dances repertory announced last year by Mr. Martins.\n\nNo dance company is static. Performances bring change. In the current six-week season (through March 4), some careers have made advances; others not.\n\nWhoever takes over City Ballet long-term must address not just the legacy of Mr. Martins but also the achievements of this interregnum, too. A controversial slap in Mr. Martins\u2019s \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d has been deleted; the ballerina Patricia McBride has coached a role she created. There have been impressive debuts in individual roles. Not least, there\u2019s a new name on people\u2019s lips: that of the 18-year-old Roman Mejia, who was promoted to the corps from apprentice by Mr. Martins in November.\n\nThis month, Mr. Mejia danced the faun soloist in the Fall section of Jerome Robbins\u2019s \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d and Mercutio in Mr. Martins\u2019s \u201cRomeo + Juliet.\u201d He has dash, sunniness, spontaneity, courtesy, speed, precision, sparkle, enthusiasm. He can arrive in the air before you saw the jump coming, beat his legs together or flourish his feet in rings while up there. And he turns, both fast and slow, with the same mixture of impulsiveness and security he brings to everything. There\u2019s plenty yet we don\u2019t know about Mr. Mejia \u2014 can he partner? \u2014 but the rainbow-like naturalness of his dancing makes this early stage of his career a joy for the audience.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow\u2019s the rest of the company dancing? \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d was a good place to check in. Fall, in which the faun character accompanies a lead couple, was exuberantly performed by two casts: Tiler Peck, Joaquin De Luz and Daniel Ulbricht; and Ashley Bouder, Zachary Catazaro and Mr. Mejia. I remember the illustrious first two casts of this ballet in 1979, when Patricia McBride and Mikhail Baryshnikov alternated with Suzanne Farrell and Mr. Martins, but those memories did not stop me from finding Ms. Peck and Mr. De Luz glorious.

For example, I found that saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think your half marathon is happening anytime soon if you don\u2019t quit smoking\u201d got my patient\u2019s attention much faster than making obvious and boring statements like, \u201cSmoking is bad for you.\u201d Second \u2014 and most important \u2014 knowing my patients\u2019 bucket list goals has prevented me from implementing medical interventions that subvert them.\n\nThat was the case with a patient of mine who had gallbladder cancer. As cancers go, this is a pretty nasty one. It is often silent until late in the game, when people develop itching and jaundice (yellow pigmentation of skin), as did my patient. We ran numerous tests in the next few days and determined that his cancer was inoperable, and that he might find some benefit from radiation treatments and chemotherapy.\n\nI met with him and went over what his treatments would entail: daily radiation appointments for several weeks and chemotherapy. Did he have things he wanted to accomplish in the time he had left? He was quite resigned to being tethered to the hospital for the weeks to come.\n\n\u201cAlways wanted to take my family to Maui \u2014 could never afford to go before,\u201d he said. \u201cThey already made my radiation appointments. I can go next year, right?\u201d I took one good look at him, and it was clear that he was going to be fading fast. He had no idea how little time he had left or how the radiation and chemotherapy would deplete his meager energy reserves. He would be lucky to get up from bed, let alone get on a flight bound to Hawaii following the treatments. So I told him the unvarnished truth as gently as I could.\n\nAs is often the case, he was unsurprised. \u201cWhat are my options?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYou could go to Maui, while you still can,\u201d I told him. \u201cStart the cancer treatments as soon as you return.\u201d\n\nHe returned two weeks later beaming like a jack-o\u2019-lantern and brought back the largest tin of macadamia nuts that I had ever seen. If I had not asked about his bucket list, he would have stoically undergone the radiation and chemotherapy, and the Maui trip would have remained a sunny fantasy.\n\nWhat goes on a bucket list?\n\nIn a study published today in the Journal of Palliative Medicine, we asked 3,056 people across the United States and found that nine out of 10 had a bucket list. Participants who said that faith, religion or spirituality were unimportant to them were the least likely to have a bucket list. We also discovered six common themes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe desire to travel, within the nation or internationally, was the most common bucket list item, followed by the desire to accomplish a personal goal (\u201cdrive a Porsche\u201d; \u201crun a marathon\u201d).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We need a new word for this story collection. Dark humor isn\u2019t quite it. But it\u2019s close. It\u2019s dark; it\u2019s funny; but it\u2019s kind, too.\n\nThe last book to make you cry?\n\n\u201cWhite Houses,\u201d by Amy Bloom. At the center of this great American novel is the great American love story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok. Eleanor is the name everyone knows, but after this book Lorena will be a name you will never forget. Love is always hard and always worth it.\n\nThe last book that made you furious?\n\n\u201cCutting School,\u201d by Noliwe Rooks. My hair almost caught on fire when I read the chapter about single moms tossed into prison \u2014 prison \u2014 for trying to enroll their children into schools in better-resourced neighborhoods. Imagine little kids stuck in foster care all because their mothers wanted them to have a decent education. I threw the book across the room and paced the floor. This is an important work; hopefully it will make people mad enough to act.\n\nSing the praises of an overlooked or underappreciated writer we should know about.\n\nKatherine Vaz is the sort of fiction writer who makes me wonder why the rest of us even bother. Much of her work explores the Luso-American experience in California, where she was born and raised. Her work has a delicious sadness to it that I couldn\u2019t quite define until I visited Lisbon. The Portuguese have this emotion they called \u201csaudade,\u201d a sort of beautiful longing. Imagine the blues, but a little bluer and not as funny. It brings to mind what Toni Morrison says in the dedication to \u201cSula\u201d about the \u201csheer good fortune to miss somebody long before they leave you.\u201d It\u2019s the textured sadness that comes from love. My favorite book of Vaz\u2019s is \u201dOur Lady of the Artichokes.\u201d\n\nWhich writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToni Morrison, Jim Grimsley, Sarah Schulman, Nikole Hannah-Jones , Bridgett M. Davis, Jayne Anne Phillips, Edwidge Danticat, Elmaz Abinader, John Keene, Aleshea Harris and Pearl Cleage.\n\nWhich genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\n\nI adore mysteries, but I don\u2019t care for thrillers. I like my dead body in Chapter 1, and then spending the rest of the novel figuring it out. Motives should be love, money or revenge. Spare me the sick stuff. I don\u2019t care for thrillers that spend every other chapter in the mind of a psychopath who murders prostitutes with a potato peeler.

Morning or night?\n\nThe dreamiest setup for reading is a hardcover book and a first-class seat on an overseas flight. I accepted a gig in Dubai just for 18 hours of luxurious reading time. But in real life, just give me morning light and a clean, quiet room. No screens.\n\nWhat book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nI was reared in an unreligious household, so most friends are surprised to find a Bible on my shelf. My father marvels that I can recite so many of the Psalms. I\u2019ve come to understand that, as a black Southerner, I am a Christian, whether I am observant or not. It\u2019s woven into the fabric of the culture. There are a lot of us \u2014 people who may not belong to a church, but are fluent in the language and sensibility of religion. I don\u2019t know that I could write a good book about the South without being well versed in the Good Book.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\n\nMy greatest desire is to own the entire \u201cSchomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers.\u201d Forty dainty hardcovers. I had my eye on a set online, but my dear friend (and genius playwright) Branden Jacobs-Jenkins bought it out from under me before I got my coins together. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d he said. We found another set, but the deal fell through. This year he shared his volumes with me. I am most intrigued by \u201cA Biografy of the Slav Who Whipt Her Mistres and Gand Her Fredom.\u201d\n\nWho is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?\n\nI tend to fall for the minor characters, the scene stealers. About three-fourths of the way through \u201cSong of Solomon,\u201d Magdalene, the neglected sister, rises up and gives her brother some inspired suggestions as to where he can shove his toxic masculinity. For me, she\u2019s the jewel of Morrison\u2019s whole oeuvre.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was even more of a reader than I am now. My mother, who is notoriously frugal, never put limits on books. \u201cRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cry\u201d was my favorite novel, but Judy Blume was my favorite author. So many wonderful novels! She wrote about a world starkly different from my Georgia upbringing \u2014 New Jersey seemed so exotic. (Maybe this is why I moved to Jersey City in my 30s.) In 2010, I met Ms. Blume, and like a real-life fairy godmother, she led me to a publisher for my third novel. Seriously. This really happened. She saved my career. It was like my bookish childhood rescued me.\n\nYou\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?\n\nIf I can\u2019t have Toni Morrison all to myself, I\u2019d love to add Lucille Clifton and Maurice Sendak.\n\nWho would you want to write your life story?\n\nToni Morrison.\n\nIf you could ghostwrite someone else\u2019s life story, whose would it be?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToni Morrison.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\n\u201cThe Overstory,\u201d by Richard Powers.

She asked not to be named out of fear for her career.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter Ms. Morffi was fired, the teacher said, they were called into a meeting with school officials. She said they were warned that if they wanted to continue working for the school, they could not post pictures or attend events that would be considered supportive of same-sex marriage.\n\nThe human resources representative at the meeting \u201cdidn\u2019t straight out say you\u2019ll be fired if you do, but that\u2019s what she led us to believe,\u201d the teacher said, adding that she was disappointed about how the situation was handled.\n\n\u201cWe pick and choose what is considered wrong and what we\u2019re going to enforce, and I think it\u2019s like a joke,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe teachers were also asked to read a memo written in 2015 by Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami, after Florida\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage was lifted.\n\nThe memo cited a statement from the Catholic Bishops of Florida that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, and said that if employees did not lead lives that were consistent with Catholic teachings it could lead to firing, even if the behavior in question occurs outside of work.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting between teachers and school officials, Ms. Agosta, the archdiocese spokeswoman, said in an email that the details were \u201cpersonnel-related and not for publication.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Almeida and other parents searched for the right way to explain to their children what had happened. In the end, she told hers that the school had made a mistake.\n\n\u201cMany of the parents are outraged,\u201d Ms. Almeida added. Other teachers at the school were not upholding Catholic values, she said, and yet no action was taken against them.\n\n\u201cDo they investigate teachers to see who is using birth control?\u201d she asked.\n\nMs. Morffi was an exemplary teacher, several parents said, and one friend described her as a faithful Catholic.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

She volunteered as a basketball coach. And Ms. Mills recalled that every morning, as Ms. Morffi\u2019s students filed into class, she played feel-good songs, like Bobby McFerrin\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, Be Happy.\u201d\n\nMs. Morffi has since been replaced by someone Ms. Agosta described as a permanent substitute teacher who is \u201cworking on her certification.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRicardo Oviedo, whose daughter was in Ms. Morffi\u2019s class, said he was examining whether the parents can take legal action. Other parents said they had considered starting a petition, holding a protest or contacting the State Legislature.\n\nIn Florida, the state civil rights law does not refer to sexual orientation. Certain counties in Florida, however, have established protections for gay workers, including Miami-Dade, where the school is, but that code does not apply to religious organizations.\n\nMs. Morffi declined to comment through her lawyer, Erica Ca\u00f1as.\n\n\u201cJocelyn is humbled by all the love and support she has received,\u201d Ms. Ca\u00f1as said in a written statement. \u201cShe feels that the manner of her firing was unfair, not only to her, but to her students as well. At this time, we are considering our legal options.\u201d\n\nAlthough Roman Catholic doctrine opposes same-sex marriage, many parishes have become more accepting of gay and lesbian parishioners in recent years, said the Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit priest and the author of \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d a book about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics.\n\nIn December, the Rev. Gregory Greiten, a Roman Catholic priest in Wisconsin, wrote a column in The National Catholic Reporter, declaring: \u201cI am gay.\u201d He received a standing ovation when he told his parishioners. Also last year, the leader of the Archdiocese of Newark, Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, offered a welcoming Mass for gay and lesbian Catholics and their families.\n\nStill, according to New Ways Ministry, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Catholics, at least 80 church employees have lost their paid and volunteer jobs in L.G.B.T. employment disputes since 2007.\n\nMr. Oviedo said that he and his wife \u2014 like many other parents at the Miami school \u2014 did not even know Ms. Morffi\u2019s sexual orientation until the school fired her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Mr. Oviedo said, \u201cin this day and age in 2018 you can lose your job over who you choose to love.\u201d", "title": "Teacher Marries Her Girlfriend, and Then Catholic School Fires Her", "authors": ["Christina Caron"]}

The rest of the class should listen carefully and try to name the Olympic event.\n\n_________\n\n2. Global Politics\n\nVideo\n\nIn \u201cHow South Korea Left the North Behind,\u201d The Times explores how the two countries have diverged in the last 30 years:\n\nIn 1988, the last time South Korea hosted the Olympics, North and South Korea were more alike than different, separated by an arbitrary line yet joined by history, language and the bonds of family. Both Koreas had come a long way, emerging from colonial rule and rebuilding their economies after a devastating civil war. But the Olympics in Seoul in 1988 ended up being a turning point. Over the past 30 years, the two countries have diverged sharply \u2014 economically, politically and culturally.\n\nTensions on the Korean Peninsula have sharply escalated recently, with North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan and threatening to launch missiles into waters near Guam, and President Trump mocking the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, as \u201cRocket Man,\u201d and Mr. Kim responding by calling Mr. Trump a \u201cmentally deranged U.S. dotard.\u201d\n\nBut then the Olympics approached, and suddenly the tone seems to have changed. Athletes from North and South Korea will march under one flag; the two countries will field a joint women\u2019s hockey team; and a North Korean pop orchestra will stage performances in South Korea during the Games. Do the 2018 Winter Olympics offer a real chance to ease political and nuclear tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula?\n\nHave students watch the video \u201dCan the Olympics Bring the Koreas Together?\u201d and read the related article. Then have students argue, in writing or discussion: Will the 2018 Winter Olympics be a turning point in relations between North Korea and South Korea? Are these latest overtures of cooperation and civility the beginning of a new chapter? Can sports actually promote peace? Or is something else going on?\n\n_________\n\n3. Design and Fashion\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Olympics are more than just an athletic competition; they are a fashion runway as well, especially during the opening and closing ceremonies. In her Nov. 2 On the Runway column, Vanessa Friedman wrote in anticipation of this year\u2019s Games:\n\nThe 100-day countdown to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, may have just begun, but the race to the fashion finish line among the various teams is well underway.\n\nShe continued:\n\nThus far, the leader seems to be ... sportswear! That may sound ridiculous, but fashion has become so much a part of recent Olympics (in the same way fashion has attempted to send its tentacles into pretty much every part of designed life), that the out-of-competition clothing that athletes wear, and even some of the in-competition stuff, has increasingly started to seem like basic runway merch. A list of the designer brands that have played wardrobe coach includes Stella McCartney, Giorgio Armani, Lacoste and Prada, to name a few. But this year, it\u2019s as if, in the weird circular way of fashion, sports clothing, which has been exerting its own influence in ateliers and on catwalks for the last few seasons in the form of streetwear and athleisure, has now effectively changed that game enough so that when designers move to the Olympics, their actual sportswear looks again like sportswear. Roll your eyes if you want to. It\u2019s true.\n\nHave students read the entire column \u2014 especially so they can consider how \u201cone of the biggest challenges of designing for the Olympics is balancing national pride and technical needs.\u201d Then, ask students to watch an event at the Olympics, such as the opening ceremony or men\u2019s curling (this 2010 video provides some context), from a fashion critic\u2019s point of view. They should choose one country\u2019s outfits \u2014 perhaps their favorite or the most interesting \u2014 and describe the clothing in writing.\n\nThen, assign students to propose a new clothing design for a country, perhaps for the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo or the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. They should draw a sketch and write a description.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlternatively, they can design a unified Korean team logo for the North Korean and South Korean athletes who will march together under one flag, or a logo for Russian athletes who will compete under a neutral flag as an Olympic AthleteFrom Russia, or OAR. They can submit their designs to The Times by Feb. 9, and some designs may get published.\n\n_________\n\n4. Geography\n\nPhoto\n\nOver 90 countries are taking part in the 2018 Winter Olympics, and that means students can explore geography while watching their favorite sports. Have students select a participating country, research that country\u2019s performance in previous Winter Games and keep track of the up-to-date 2018 medal count. They can also read relevant news articles by selecting their country from the pull-down menu on the Pyeongchang 2018 Game News page. For additional context, students could research their country\u2019s history, culture and geography and how they might affect its performance in the Winter Games. At the end of the Olympics, students can present an overview of their country\u2019s performance at the Games and what they learned.\n\nTo turn this research into a competition with other students around the world, the class can participate in Fan School\u2019s Olympics challenge. For this challenge, students must make predictions by the end of the opening ceremony on Feb. 9 about medal counts as well as news coverage in The Times. To help make their predictions, students can use this interactive displaying medal results at the Winter Games from 1924 to 2014.\n\n_________\n\n5. Physics\n\nPhoto\n\nHave students use the language of physics to describe what is taking place in various Olympic events. To help them deconstruct athletic feats like the quadruple jump in figure skating or the backside double-cork 1080 in snowboard slopestyle, students can use Times interactives that slow down and narrate the action in the following sports:\n\nFigure skating (augmented reality)\n\nGiant slalom\n\nHalfpipe snowboarding\n\nIce hockey (augmented reality)\n\nLuge\n\nShort-track speedskating and Short track (augmented reality)\n\nSki jumping\n\nSnowboard slopestyle and Slopestyle (augmented reality)\n\nMake sure they use relevant academic vocabulary they have studied in class, such as kinetic energy, angular momentum, friction and aerodynamics.\n\nTo continue exploring physics, visit our 2010 lesson plan \u201cGetting Physical: The Physics and Other Science Behind Winter Olympic Sports.\u201d\n\n_________\n\n6. Argument Writing and Discussion\n\nPhoto\n\nAny event that brings together delegations from over 90 countries for two weeks is bound to stir up some controversies and questions. Teachers can use these issues as prompts for argument writing and discussion before, during and after the Olympics. Each prompt includes a link to a related Times article. Note: The list below is just a starting place, since certainly more issues will arise before the Games are completed.\n\n1. Did the International Olympic Committee make the right decision in banning Russia from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics because of state-backed doping during the 2014 Sochi Games? Did it make the right decision in allowing Russian athletes who can prove they are \u201cclean\u201d to compete under a neutral flag?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n2. Did the National Hockey League make the right decision not to hold a three-week break during its season to allow players to participate in the Winter Games, as they did in 2014?\n\n3. Did North and South Korean politicians make the right decision in deciding to field a joint women\u2019s hockey team for the sake of \u201ca grand gesture of sports diplomacy\u201d? Is the decision unfair to the individual players who have worked hard to get to the Olympics, yet might lose playing time or be benched for some games?\n\n4. How anxious should the world be about holding the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, \u201cin the shadow of a nuclear standoff\u201d and just 50 miles from the world\u2019s most heavily fortified border? Should participating countries hesitate to send their delegations because of North Korea\u2019s recent nuclear and ICBM tests? Should visitors be reluctant to attend the Games this year?\n\n_________\n\n7. South Korea\n\nPhoto\n\nAsk students: How much do you know about South Korea? They can do a quick-write and pair-share.\n\nThen, have them take our Country of the Week quiz, which tests students on their map skills, along with their geography and culture knowledge.\n\nNext, invite students to plan a last-minute trip to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. They can use this Times guide to figure out logistics for a visit to the Olympics. And have them tack on extra vacation time after the Games to experience more of South Korea. They can use the Times Travel section, the internet and guidebooks to do their planning.\n\nThe final product can be a written day-by-day itinerary, including location, activities and highlights, plus a travel map. Here\u2019s an example of a possible entry:\n\nDay 10\n\nLocation: Busan, South Korea\n\nActivities: Jagalchi market, Busan Sea Life Aquarium, Dongbaekseom Park and Haeundae Beach\n\nDay\u2019s Highlight: Wander the stalls and fish tanks at the Jagalchi market to see rows and rows of seafood caught fresh that morning.

Yet there is undeniable momentum for the N.B.A. to carry this new format into next year\u2019s game. And factoring in what is sure to be a near-unanimous push to televise the roster selections for the 2019 game only increases the chances for a highly watchable event, one in which Michael Jordan\u2019s Charlotte Hornets will be serving as hosts.\n\n\u201cI thought tonight was a great first step going forward,\u201d Casey said.\n\nThe night was also a victory for a group of players who made a notable contribution of their own to the N.B.A.\u2019s midseason festival. James was the tone-setting force in the game and deservedly won his third All-Star Most Valuable Player Award with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in 31 minutes. But you also couldn\u2019t miss the sheer number of players on the floor representing countries other than the United States.\n\nThe Knicks\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis (Latvia) was forced to miss his first All-Star appearance because of his recent season-ending knee injury, but Joel Embiid (Cameroon) and Goran Dragic (Slovenia) made their All-Star debuts without him. Additionally, Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece) made his second consecutive All-Star start and was joined on Team Stephen by two representatives of the Dominican Republic: Al Horford and Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nPhoto\n\nYou can stretch this concept even further by noting that Kyrie Irving is Australian-born.\n\nThe N.B.A., mind you, has so far shown a willingness to implement a United States vs. Rest of the World template only for its Rising Stars game, which features first- and second-year players. Resistance in some corners to taking the idea any further would be understandable in a league with well over 300 players born in the United States and only 24 All-Star spots to compete for as it is.\n\nYet it is also true that, in his four-year tenure as N.B.A. commissioner, Adam Silver has been continually receptive to new ideas. It\u2019s tantalizing, then, to wonder if the notion of a U.S.A./World format for the actual All-Star Game will someday get serious consideration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Or that Marc Gasol (Spain) has already made three career All-Star appearances. Or that the Chicago rookie Lauri Markkanen (Finland) is increasingly regarded as future All-Star material, with at least two highly coveted foreign-born players \u2014 Luka Doncic (Dragic\u2019s Slovenian countryman) and DeAndre Ayton (Bahamas) \u2014 widely expected to be top-five selections in the June draft.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d said Steve Nash, who was born in South Africa, grew up in Canada and is now a part-time coaching consultant with the Golden State Warriors after retiring from the N.B.A. in 2015 with two M.V.P. trophies. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural and welcome evolution of the game.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the general manager of the men\u2019s national-team program in Canada, Nash is likewise well aware that R.J. Barrett \u2014 the son of Nash\u2019s former Canadian teammate, Rowan Barrett \u2014 is widely regarded as a top contender to be selected No. 1 over all in the 2019 draft. That would be just five years removed from June 2014, when another Canadian, Andrew Wiggins, was drafted No. 1.\n\nSpeaking specifically about the likes of Antetokounmpo, Embiid and Porzingis, Nash said: \u201cIn five years, two or three of these guys might be top-10 players in this league.\u201d\n\nBy the time Nash ascended to an All-Star level in Dallas alongside Germany\u2019s Dirk Nowitzki, there were a number of top players born outside the borders of the United States, including Nowitzki, Pau Gasol (Spain), Yao Ming (China), Tony Parker (France) and Manu Ginobili (Argentina). But Nash, who on Saturday received a Class of 2018 Basketball Hall of Fame nomination, couldn\u2019t bring himself to buy into suggestions back then that a Rest of the World contingent could credibly take on the American-born All-Stars.\n\nNow, Nash feels differently.\n\n\u201cMaybe in 2022 \u2014 30 years after the Barcelona Olympics and how the first Dream Team grew the game internationally \u2014 maybe that\u2019s the time to try it,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe might be ready for World vs. U.S.A. in 2022. And that would obviously bring some life back to the All-Star Game if we\u2019re still struggling to find some.\u201d\n\nIn large part due to how engaged James was on Sunday night and the example he set, sufficient life was restored to the All-Star Game to allow time for more contemplation and discussion. And more juice may be pumped into next year\u2019s contest if the two captains indeed end up on live TV selecting their 22 All-Star colleagues, at midcourt before tipoff, in true schoolyard style.\n\nYou know what they say, though: It\u2019s always good to have options.", "title": "Team Lebron vs. Team Steph Wasn\u2019t Bad.

Some computer science departments have folded the topic into a broader class, and others have stand-alone courses.\n\nBut until recently, ethics did not seem relevant to many students.\n\n\u201cCompared to transportation or doctors, your daily interaction with physical harm or death or pain is a lot less if you are writing software for apps,\u201d said Joi Ito, director of the M.I.T. Media Lab.\n\nOne reason that universities are pushing tech ethics now is the popularization of powerful tools like machine learning \u2014 computer algorithms that can autonomously learn tasks by analyzing large amounts of data. Because such tools could ultimately alter human society, universities are rushing to help students understand the potential consequences, said Mr. Ito, who is co-teaching the Harvard-M.I.T. ethics course.\n\n\u201cAs we start to see things, like autonomous vehicles, that clearly have the ability to save people but also cause harm, I think that people are scrambling to build a system of ethics,\u201d he said. (Mr. Ito is a director of The New York Times Company.)\n\nLast fall, Cornell University introduced a data science course where students learned to deal with ethical challenges \u2014 such as biased data sets that include too few lower-income households to be representative of the general population. Students also debated the use of algorithms to help automate life-changing decisions like hiring or college admissions.\n\n\u201cIt was really focused on trying to help them understand what in their everyday practice as a data scientist they are likely to confront, and to help them think through those challenges more systematically,\u201d said Solon Barocas, an assistant professor in information science who taught the course.", "title": "Tech\u2019s Ethical \u2018Dark Side\u2019: Harvard, Stanford and Others Want to Address It", "authors": []}

Cotton, a lawyer for Ms. Geyser, said in a phone interview on Thursday that the sentence was expected.

(The play is coming back to New York, at the Neil Simon Theater, beginning previews this month and opening in March.) In 2016, Slate published an oral history of the show, in which Mr. Kushner and more than 50 others talked about the production\u2019s long and often difficult road to success. Now the authors of that history \u2014 Isaac Butler, a theater director himself, and Dan Kois, an editor and writer for Slate \u2014 have published a new book that expands on it: \u201cThe World Only Spins Forward: The Ascent of \u2018Angels in America.\u2019\u201d The book covers the development and life of the play, as well as Mike Nichols\u2019s adaptation of it as a mini-series for HBO in 2003.

And when I spoke to their family members, they received threats and had themselves been wrapped up in this and terribly impacted. Yet they had never tried to get them to stop doing their work. In fact, Mar\u00eda Victoria, Iv\u00e1n\u2019s wife, kept some very serious threats made against her secret because she didn\u2019t want him to give up what he was doing.

I knew him as a journalist, and I knew he had exposed these scandals and efforts to smear Vel\u00e1squez. I didn\u2019t realize just how intrepid he was because he was just so humble. Years later, I found out he had actually been abducted by his sources in the intelligence service at one point. They thought he was going to betray them and they needed to know if he was being straight with them. They gave him this drug to tell the truth and he lost consciousness overnight. He just kept going with his work; met with them the next day and they apologized.\n\nIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\n\nI started out with a very important story about one man who led these investigations and was attacked and then prevailed. It turned into a much richer story when I brought in these other characters and dug into the history. Once I had a broader scope and more characters, I could trace the arc of how the paramilitaries grew and what they were, and how they were able to gain so much power and influence and develop all these connections, in a way I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do if the book had been about one set of investigations.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nPhotojournalists, in general, who have worked in some of these conflicts. One of them is Stephen Ferry, with whom I worked very closely in Colombia. He captured the humanity and all sorts of nuances of the reality of Colombia in ways that aren\u2019t usually presented in journalism and in the policy world. Seeing someone who\u2019s able to capture those deeper aspects of reality made me also want to do that.\n\nAnother piece that made an impression on me while I was writing the book was Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s movie \u201cThe Look of Silence,\u201d a sequel to \u201cThe Act of Killing.\u201d He\u2019s able to show what it means for people to live with a legacy of mass atrocity while the perpetrators are still in power, and in a way that\u2019s what was happening in Colombia while I was there.\n\nPersuade someone to read \u201cThere Are No Dead Here\u201d in 50 words or less.\n\nIt\u2019s a fast-paced true story, something of a thriller.

She told me that we shouldn\u2019t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.\n\nHarter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don\u2019t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn\u2019t make them a bad person. They don\u2019t understand that daddy\u2019s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can\u2019t say, \u201cWell, it\u2019s been a good season even though we lost this game.\u201d\n\nSometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don\u2019t see me yelling at the TV and see that it\u2019s important to me.

I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom \u2014 \u201cblazing\u201d is what they call it, that troll behavior \u2014 while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.\n\nWho is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?\n\nFor a long time, my favorite U.S. national team player was Clint Dempsey. I liked him because he was successful, but I loved how he was successful, and why. I loved that he grew up poor, and had to go outside the traditional soccer development system. He wasn\u2019t put on the conveyor belt to greatness. That\u2019s inspiring, someone who works outside the system and still gets to the top of it. He would take risks on the field. It was like he was saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to try for greatness, and I might look foolish sometimes, and it might not work out, but I\u2019m going to shoot for greatness here.\u201d That was something to love and admire about him, and something that anyone can bring into their own work.

From its beginnings, Italian fashion benefited from a very integrated system, starting with the fabrics and continuing to the designers and manufacturers.\n\nWouldn\u2019t the same have been true of, say, France?\n\nST When you think about the American or the French systems, they didn\u2019t have that organization, from designing fabrics to distribution. Often the fabrics they used were imported from Italy. A lot of French fabrics and even products were made in Italy.\n\nWhy was that?\n\nST It was the high quality of the products and at an affordable price. After the war, during the \u201950s and \u201960s, Italy was full of very low-cost workers. Many had inherited family traditions of craftsmanship. The idea we had with this show was to demonstrate both the qualities and also the shortcomings of the Italian fashion system.\n\nIf traditions of quality craft were the positive, what was the negative?\n\nST There was an overall lack of managerial experience, a lack of coordination. Some of it was the fault of the government, which didn\u2019t invest in infrastructure or education to bring Italian fashion to a level where it could compete with what was happening in other countries. But, where the government failed, Italian ingenuity stepped in. When you ask what Italian fashion was in that period, you could characterize it by saying Italy produced clothes of great quality at an affordable price. There was an incredible versatility in times of change \u2014 the fact, say, that small Italian fashion companies could shift direction every six months, alter the kinds of product they were putting out.", "title": "Telling Italy\u2019s Story Through Its Clothes", "authors": []}

The Danish author Madame Nielsen\u2019s debut in English translation, \u201cThe Endless Summer,\u201d is very much in the latter category, telling the story of a family that indulges in life\u2019s lightness, ultimately paying the price for ignoring the weight of being.\n\nNielsen is many things \u2014 a musician, actor, playwright and performance artist who has journeyed to Iran and who walked with refugees all the way from the Balkans to Denmark. But she is probably best known for declaring her birth-identity, Claus Beck-Nielsen, dead in 2001 and producing work under a series of names that culminated in \u201cMadame Nielsen\u201d in 2014. This change involved a switch from male to female dress and gender pronouns, although readers coming to \u201cThe Endless Summer\u201d expecting a dissection of transgender themes will be disappointed. This is not a criticism of the novel \u2014 clearly Nielsen has no intention of foregrounding gender in this particular work.

He hoped that the physical exam, often discounted by doctors and patients alike in these days of high-tech testing, could help him figure out what was going on. Goshua had been taught to start his exam with the hands and then to work inward to the rest of the body. He picked up the man\u2019s right hand; the arm hung limply against the bed. He held the man\u2019s middle finger and flicked the nail down. As the fingertip snapped up, the right thumb jerked toward the index finger. He did it again, and again the thumb leapt toward the index finger, as if to make, paradoxically, an A-O.K. sign. The patient had a positive Hoffman\u2019s sign.\n\nA Simple Test\n\nThis reflex test, developed by the 19th-century neurologist Johann Hoffman, indicates a problem in the nerves that emerge from the brain to make up the spinal cord in the neck. It is a test that medical students still learn but rarely use, in part because the pathology it detects is rare, and in part because the test, like so much of the physical exam, is not terribly reliable on its own. When positive, as it was here, the problem is actually present only 60 percent of the time. Still, it was a clue. Was there any other evidence that a problem in the spinal cord was causing the weakness? Goshua tapped the right knee to elicit the usual kick reflex. If the patient was just weak from illness, his kick should have been normal or even reduced. Instead it was so brisk that the left leg jerked a little, too.\n\nEmergency Surgery\n\nGoshua knew that it was essential that the patient quickly get an M.R.I. of his neck that night. The scan indicated that the same infection that had already been carried to his brain, his kidneys and his swollen right foot was also raging in the bones of his neck right where it met the shoulders and inside the spine, impinging on and compressing the spinal cord.\n\nThe man\u2019s wife was sitting at her husband\u2019s bedside after the test when her mobile phone rang. Her husband needed to go to surgery right away, she was told. If they didn\u2019t operate immediately, he would never regain his strength. Indeed, it might already be too late.\n\nIt was past 3 in the morning when the surgeon carefully cut away the infected bone and the abscess compressing the man\u2019s spine, but it would be weeks or months before they would know if they had gotten there in time.\n\nLooking for the Source\n\nAs the man recovered, he and his wife wondered where the initial infection came from. When the patient first arrived at the hospital, it was noted that he had a healing sore on his left hand next to his thumbnail. His wife remembered that it was filled with pus and looked awful. Her husband applied what he called \u201cblack salve\u201d \u2014 a pine-tar-based ointment used in medicine since the time of the ancient Greeks. It reduces inflammation and pain. But it did not treat the infection, which spread from his thumb throughout his body to his brain, his ankle and his spine.\n\nThe patient needed six weeks of antibiotics to get the bug completely out of his system. It took much longer for the rest of him to recover. When he came home after five months of intensive rehab, he still couldn\u2019t walk. But he never gave up. And slowly, slowly, he got better. Two years later he can walk without a cane. And he\u2019s back at work \u2014 with his builder, and around the house.\n\nAs for Goshua, who cared for the patient just that one time, the amazing recovery felt like proof that the physical exam, even today, remains an essential tool.", "title": "Tests Indicated His Infection Was Getting Better.

Soliloquies can create dramatic irony, because the audience is made aware of thoughts and events that the other characters in the play are not.\n\n\u201cHamlet\u201d has captured the imaginations of audiences for four centuries. It is Shakespeare\u2019s most performed play around the world \u2014 and, of course, one of the most-taught works of literature in high school and college classrooms. In fact, Hamlet\u2019s \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d speech is the best-known soliloquy in the world.\n\n\u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d is Victor Hugo\u2019s 1862 historical classic about Jean Valjean, imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread, and his life of compassion and contribution after his release. The novel has been adapted countless times for film, television, radio, musicals, plays and concerts.\n\nThe French stage musical by Claude-Michel Schonberg premiered in Paris in 1980. French lyrics for the musical were written by Alain Boublil and Jean-Marc Natel, and English lyrics were written by Herbert Kretzmer. The musical is the longest-running show in London, and the second longest-running musical in the world (after \u201cThe Fantasticks\u201d). The stage musical inspired the most recent film version \u2014 the popular 2012 film directed by Tom Hooper and starring Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman.\n\nIn the soliloquies we pair here, Hamlet and Jean Valjean are each at a crossroads in their lives, and each wrestles mightily with his conscience. Both characters seek moral clarity, both struggle with existential questions, and both argue with themselves in an effort to come to some realization. At the end of each speech, each character is closer to a path forward.\n\nTo work with the two texts, you might first discuss the conventions, requirements and standards of a soliloquy, and, using this video, compare them to a monologue and an \u201caside.\u201d Ask students, what different conditions within the play might cause a playwright to use a soliloquy, a monologue or an aside? Are they interchangeable? Why or why not?\n\nStudents might also view \u2014 or act out themselves \u2014 different interpretations of the \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d speech. They can begin with the video of Laurence Olivier embedded at the top of this lesson, then view this video of five actors giving different interpretations. (And, possibly, an additional one, here). Which is their favorite? Why? How would they compare the actors\u2019 deliveries? How can different readings change the meaning of a soliloquy? What examples can they give?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinally, as they watch and read the two speeches together, you might ask students to think about how Hamlet and Jean Valjean think about the following questions: What happens after death? What is the best way to live, or die, morally, in the eyes of God? Is it better to act or to remain inactive? Is existence worth the pain? Where does a man\u2019s responsibility to himself, and to others, begin and end?\n\n\n\nThe outcomes for Hamlet and Jean Valjean are different, but for each, his soliloquy expresses a pivotal moment in determining how to live the rest of his life.\n\n_________\n\nKey Questions\n\n\u2022 How do soliloquies work as a literary device to illuminate characters and themes?\n\n\u2022 What do these two soliloquies in particular reveal about the characters speaking them and the themes of the works they are from as a whole?\n\n_________\n\nActivity Sheets\n\nAs students read and discuss, they might take notes using one or more of the three graphic organizers (PDFs) we have created for our Text to Text feature, which matches often-taught texts with Times articles and other content.\n\n\u2022 Comparing Two or More Texts\n\n\u2022 Double-Entry Chart for Close Reading\n\n\u2022 Document Analysis Questions\n\n_________\n\nText One: HAMLET SOLILOQUY ACT 3, SCENE 1\n\nPhoto\n\nTo be, or not to be: that is the question:\n\nWhether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer\n\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\n\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\n\nAnd by opposing end them?\u2014To die,\u2014to sleep,\u2014\n\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\n\nThe heartache, and the thousand natural shocks\n\nThat flesh is heir to,\u2014\u2019tis a consummation\n\nDevoutly to be wish\u2019d.

What is the rhetorical question Hamlet addresses in his soliloquy? What is the rhetorical question Jean Valjean addresses? What are the inner arguments each character wrestles with, and why?\n\n2. How is each soliloquy both a rant and a reflection? What emotions are revealed by Hamlet? By Jean Valjean? How do they change within the soliloquy?\n\n3. How does each soliloquy move from the general to the specific, from the abstract to the concrete, and back again?\n\n4. How \u2014 and where \u2014 do the authors weave figurative language, from imagery to hyperbole, metaphor, allusions, simile, symbolism, irony and puns, into their soliloquies? How do those literary devices seem to help the character understand himself more clearly, as he speaks aloud?\n\n5. How do shifts in tone for both Hamlet and Jean Valjean help make meaning for the audience? Where do those shifts in tone occur for each soliloquy?\n\n6. How do Hamlet and Jean Valjean each reach an increased self awareness, and then a resolution of sorts, by the end of their speeches? How does each man arrive at his decision \u2014 or at his acceptance of indecision?\n\n7. To what extent is the presentation itself important when considering the effectiveness of the two soliloquies? Does a soliloquy that is sung, in the case of Jean Valjean in this adaptation of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d add or detract from that meaning, and how? Could Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy be sung, or be staged in another way? How?\n\n_________\n\nGoing Further\n\nMemorize a Monologue or Soliloquy...\n\nPhoto\n\nIn \u201cMemorize That Poem!\u201d Molly Worthen argues that, though \u201cpoetry memorization has become deeply unfashionable,\u201d memorizing and reciting can be \u201chighly expressive\u201d acts. Her piece begins:\n\nLate one night this spring, Justin Snider, an assistant dean at Columbia University, was riding the uptown No. 2 in Manhattan when the train ground to a halt. After about 15 minutes \u2014 with little information about the delay and no cell service \u2014 everyone in the car was getting restless. Suddenly, inspiration struck. \u201cI asked neighboring passengers if they wanted to hear some Shakespeare, and no one objected,\u201d Mr. Snider told me. He had memorized Hamlet\u2019s \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d speech more than 15 years earlier, to pass the time on a cross-country bike trip. \u201cI was definitely nervous because I\u2019d never performed publicly before,\u201d he said. Although his jaded audience neglected to clap when he finished \u2014 they did applaud when the train started to move again \u2014 Mr. Snider was pleased that he didn\u2019t forget a line. The soliloquy was fixed in the architecture of his brain, ready to serve in a moment of boredom or underground anxiety. It\u2019s no coincidence that Mr. Snider has asked students to memorize poetry many times in his career in education.\n\nHave students read the article and then memorize the soliloquy or monologue of their choice. Then, debrief the class on the experience: How difficult was it for them to memorize? What benefits did they find? For instance, did they feel it helped them understand the text or character better? How? What did they begin to notice about the language and ideas?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_________\n\n...and Then Perform It\n\nVideo\n\nIn 2013, The New York Times asked high school and college students to use Instagram to record short videos of lines from Shakespeare\u2019s tale of royal intrigue and revenge, and nearly 500 seized the opportunity. This piece calls out some of the most interesting results.\n\nMany teachers use performance as a way to get students to connect with and embody the text. After your students have memorized a monologue or soliloquy, invite them to get the words \u201con their feet\u201d by staging a monologue slam patterned after the one described in the short news clip above.\n\n\n\nTo learn more, have them read this article about the competition and how it got started:\n\n\n\nAspiring actors are accustomed to having doors slammed in their faces, but lately in a modest club in the East Village, a few have been doing some slamming of their own. At a frenetic monthly competition called the Manhattan Monologue Slam, performers looking for that fabled big break, or even a small break, are squaring off against one another in a flurry of three-minute monologues, with a casting director or other industry professional sitting as judge. First prize is a one-on-one meeting with that judge for career input \u2014 the kind of meeting many struggling actors can only fantasize about. The slam, patterned after a poetry slam and with the same mutually supportive, raucous atmosphere, is the creation of Robert and Philip Galinsky, brothers who know the struggling-Village-actor life from firsthand experience. \u201cWe were sitting in my living room one afternoon, thinking about how could we control our destiny and not just be another actor trying to get the head shot onto somebody\u2019s desk,\u201d Robert Galinsky, 40, said, recalling how the first slam came about in April 2003. \u201cAfter we brainstormed a little bit, we came up with, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do the structure of a poetry slam, but do it for actors with monologues.\u2019 And that was it.\u201d\n\nHow can you stage your own monologue/soliloquy slam? Can other classes in your school get involved? Could your drama department help students prepare?\n\n__________\n\n\u201dLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d Adapted\n\n\u201cRarely has any work of literature received such a pummeling at the hands of a succession of publishers, translators, filmmakers and musical impresarios,\u201d writes The Times about \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d in a review of a book about the life of this classic work. Though the review argues that \u201cperhaps the most damaging deformation belongs to the all-conquering stage musical \u2018Les Miz,\u2019\u201d it is likely that it is through that musical that students know the work best.\n\nFor an in-depth look at the novel\u2019s transformation to a Broadway musical, have students read this 1987 Times review by Frank Rich. He acknowledges that:\n\nThe evening may not appeal to those enraptured by the 1,300-page edition of Hugo. The musical thinks nothing of condensing chapters of exposition or philosophical debate into a single quatrain or unambiguous confrontation; encyclopedic digressions and whole episodes are thrown out.\n\nBut, he argues, \u201cWhile facts and psychological nuances are lost and even the plot is often relegated to a program synopsis, the thematic spirit of the original is preserved. Sequence after sequence speaks of Hugo\u2019s compassion for society\u2019s outcasts and his faith in God\u2019s offer of redemption.\u201d And he ends his review, \u201cThe stirring sentiments belong to hallowed 19th-century literature, to be sure, but the fresh charge generated by this \u2018Miserables\u2019 has everything to do with the electrifying showmanship of the 20th-century musical.\u201d\n\nWhat do your students think? If they have read the novel and seen the musical or any of the films, what do they think of the adaptations? What, in their opinion, is essential to preserve across adaptations about the original? Why?\n\nEven if your students have not read the book, they may enjoy watching some of the musical. Here is Philip Quast, playing the policeman Javert, in a video from the musical\u2019s 10th anniversary. To extend their study of the soliloquy, have them read the lyrics of his song \u201cStars,\u201d and consider as they watch and read: Does Javert\u2019s song fit the criteria of a formal soliloquy? Why or why not?\n\nWhat does Javert reveal, and what is he certain of at the end of his speech? To what extent is his inner character revealed to the audience, and to himself, by the end of the song? To what extent does Javert wrestle with the same questions of death, life, suicide, revenge and vengeance that Jean Valjean does in his soliloquy? How does each character justify or base his actions on his personal version of morality, and why?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_________\n\nWrite Your Own Soliloquies\n\nHave students try their hands at writing a soliloquy themselves, taking care to include all the formal elements.\n\nThey might choose to write one from the point of view of a character in a book or play they have read, studied and discussed. Or, students could write this speech from the point of view of someone currently in the news, whether a political figure, an actor or an athlete.\n\nYou might set requirements like these:\n\nYour soliloquies must:\n\n\u2022 be written in first person\n\n\u2022 be written in unrhymed or blank verse\n\n\u2022 begin with a rhetorical question\n\n\u2022 incorporate at least three poetic or literary devices\n\nStudents should remember they are writing something intended to be spoken, so should try to hear the words as they write.\n\nThe soliloquy can be written factually, using the explicit conditions, events, characters and plot of the book and character they have selected, or the real-life figure they have chosen. Or, the soliloquy can be inferential, even fabricated. It can address something that is not explicitly stated in a text \u2014 or, in the case of a real-life figure, something that hasn\u2019t happened in real life but that students can infer from actual events, plot, characters or tone.\n\nAfter writing, students should read their soliloquies to the class and have classmates guess who is speaking, and what play, film, novel or political figure was selected. Students can critique one another\u2019s work in small groups, and then make revisions based on classmates\u2019 suggestions.\n\n_________\n\nConsider the Monologues of Late Night Hosts as Mentor Texts\n\nAmong other Times coverage, the \u201cBest of Late Night\u201d by Giovanni Russonello reports on late night talk show hosts and their monologues. Have students compare and contrast several of the monologuists below, and decide which person \u2014 and which specific speech \u2014 is most persuasive, funny, or effective \u2014 and why.\n\nAsk students, \u201cHow does the monologuist turn the personal into the political, and what does that strategy do for the monologue?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey can start with The Times\u2019s coverage of Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s emotional monologue about his new son\u2019s heart condition, or his monologue on gun laws, which begins:\n\n\u201cThis morning, we have children without parents and fathers without sons, mothers without daughters. We lost two police officers. We lost a nurse from Tennessee. A special-ed teacher from a local school here in Manhattan Beach. It\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up. It\u2019s too much to even process \u2014 all these devastated families who now have to live with this pain forever because one person with a violent and insane voice in his head managed to stockpile a collection of high-powered rifles and use them to shoot people.\u201d \u2014 JIMMY KIMMEL\n\nAnother option is to read this 2016 Times article, with a transcript of Chris Rock\u2019s opening monologue for the Oscars, or Trevor Noah\u2019s November 2017 monologue on the Republican tax bill.\n\nStudents can also get inspired looking at highlights of the 2017 \u201cBest of Late Night\u201d wrap up.\n\nAnother excellent source for the question above is Times coverage of Stephen Colbert and his monologue on the New York City subway bomber, which begins:\n\nClearly relishing the opportunity, Mr. Colbert lit into a string of jokes about the resiliency of New York commuters \u2014 and the travails of having to travel on the subway every day. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got something to say to this guy. Seriously? You tried to terrorize New York subway commuters? Nice try. Nice try. New York commuters don\u2019t even flinch when the subway breakdancers kick two inches away from their face. They have to battle rats for the seat \u2014 which, for the record, you should only give up if the rat is pregnant. Come on. Come on. You tried to sow chaos and confusion in the Port Authority bus station? That is the normal state of affairs at the Port Authority bus station. There\u2019s a pretty good chance your little explosion may have scoured some of the grime off the wall, thanks. Now you\u2019re going to jail for a long, long, long time. And all New Yorkers want to know is, does that mean your apartment is free? And is it rent-controlled?\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\n_________\n\nHear Shakespeare\u2019s Words in New Contexts\n\nPhoto\n\nA March 2017 Times article, \u201cUsing Shakespeare to Ease the Trauma of War,\u201d speaks to the ways that Shakespeare\u2019s words can resonate outside their original context, to help veterans heal. The piece begins:\n\nStephan Wolfert was drunk when he hopped off an Amtrak train somewhere in Montana, toting a rucksack of clothes and a cooler stocked with ice, peanut butter, bread and Miller High Life \u2014 bottles, not cans. It was 1991, he was 24, and he had recently seen his best friend fatally wounded in a military training exercise. His mind in need of a salve, he went to a play: \u201cRichard III,\u201d the story of a king who was also a soldier. In Shakespeare\u2019s words, he heard an echo of his own experience, and though he had been raised to believe that being a tough guy was the only way to be a man, something cracked open inside him. \u201cI was sobbing,\u201d Mr. Wolfert, now 50 and an actor, said recently over coffee in Chelsea. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could have emotions out loud.\u201d That road-to-Damascus moment \u2014 not coming to Jesus, but coming to Shakespeare \u2014 is part of the story that Mr. Wolfert tells in his solo show, \u201cCry Havoc!,\u201d which starts performances Wednesday, March 15, at the New Ohio Theater. Taking its title from Mark Antony\u2019s speech over the slain Caesar in \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d it intercuts Mr. Wolfert\u2019s own memories with text borrowed from Shakespeare. Decoupling those lines from their plays, Mr. Wolfert uses them to explore strength and duty, bravery and trauma, examining what it is to be in the military and what it is to carry that experience back into civilian life.\n\nChallenge students to reread some of the Shakespearean soliloquies they have studied and consider what resonance they have today. Do they parallel anything happening in our world, or to a particular group of people? To whom might particular lines or speeches offer solace or instruction, the way the \u201cIf it were done when \u2019tis done\u201d soliloquy, Macbeth\u2019s debate with himself about whether to kill Duncan, the king, is meaningful to one veteran described in this piece?\n\n_________\n\nRelated Resources from The Learning Network\n\nShakespeare:\n\nCelebrate Shakespeare on His 450th Birthday: Seven Ideas for Teaching and Learning\n\nTeaching Shakespeare With The New York Times\n\nOther Authors and Works:\n\nHere is what we have so far, and the collection is always growing:\n\n\u201cThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,\u201d \u201cAll Summer in a Day,\u201d Maya Angelou, \u201cAntigone,\u201d Jane Austen, \u201cThe Book Thief,\u201d \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye,\u201d \u201cThe Crucible,\u201d \u201cDeath of a Salesman,\u201d Roald Dahl, Charles Dickens, \u201cEnrique\u2019s Journey,\u201d \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d \u201cThe Giver,\u201d \u201cThe Glass Castle,\u201d \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d \u201cThe Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks,\u201d \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d \u201cThe Kite Runner,\u201d \u201cLord of the Flies,\u201d \u201cOf Mice and Men,\u201d John Milton, \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d Orwell and \u201c1984,\u201d \u201cThe Outsiders,\u201d \u201cA Raisin in the Sun,\u201d Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain and \u201cHuckleberry Finn,\u201d \u201cThe Scarlet Letter,\u201d \u201cSpeak\u201d, \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d and \u201cWonder.\u201d", "title": "Text to Text | Soliloquies From \u2018Hamlet\u2019 and \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019", "authors": ["Caroline Crosson Gilpin"]}
{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "Like the novel\u2019s narrator Aza, Mr. Green has struggled with severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder for as long as he can remember:\n\nMr. Green was about 6 years old when he first became aware of his obsessive thought patterns. He was often afraid that his food was contaminated, and would only eat certain foods at particular times of day.\n\nAs he got older, he was able to keep his anxiety in check, with the right mix of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy. But every once in a while, uncontrollable thoughts can overwhelm him.\n\nIn a video he posted before the book\u2019s release, Mr. Green discussed how his experience living with obsessive compulsive disorder led him to write his latest novel. \u201cI wanted to try to find form and expression for this way-down non-sensorial experience of living inside of thought spirals,\u201d he said.\n\nAs students watch the video and read the article, encourage them to note ways in which Aza\u2019s experience and thoughts echo those of the author. To get started, students might focus on excerpts from the book like the following. What parallels can they find in what Mr. Green says about his own experience?\n\nOn how language fails to capture abstract feelings, like pain:\n\n[During a session with Dr. Karen Singh, Aza\u2019s therapist]\n\n\u201cYou often try to understand your experience through metaphor, Aza: It\u2019s like a demon inside of you; you\u2019ll call your consciousness a bus, or a prison cell, or a spiral, or a whirlpool, or a loop, or a \u2014 I think you once called it a scribbled circle, which I found interesting \u2026 One of the challenges with pain \u2014 physical or psychic \u2014 is that we can really only approach it through metaphor. It can\u2019t be represented the way a table or a body can. In some ways, pain is the opposite of language.\u201d\n\nOn romanticizing mental illness:\n\nYou hear a lot about the benefits of insanity or whatever \u2014 like, Dr. Karen Singh had once told me this Edgar Allan Poe quote: \u201cThe question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence.\u201d I guess she was trying to make me feel better, but I find mental disorders to be vastly overrated. Madness, in my admittedly limited experience, is accompanied by no superpowers; being mentally unwell doesn\u2019t make you loftily intelligent any more than having the flu does.\n\nOn the \u2014 often-unrealistic \u2014 expectation that illness is something you overcome:\n\nI wanted to tell her that I was getting better, because that was supposed to be the narrative of illness: It was a hurdle you jumped over, or a battle you won. Illness is a story told in the past tense.\n\nOn intrusive thoughts:\n\nI have these thoughts that Dr. Karen Singh calls \u201cintrusives,\u201d but the first time she said it, I heard \u201cinvasives,\u201d which I like better, because, like invasive weeds, these thoughts seem to arrive at my biosphere from some faraway land, and then they spread out of control. Supposedly everyone has them\u2014you look out from over a bridge or whatever and it occurs to you out of nowhere that you could just jump. And then if you\u2019re most people, you think, Well, that was a weird thought, and move on with your life. But for some people, the invasive can kind of take over, crowding out all the other thoughts until it\u2019s the only one you\u2019re able to have, the thought you\u2019re perpetually either thinking or distracting yourself from.\n\nAfter they\u2019re done, you might ask students some of these questions:\n\n\u2022 To write authentically about the experience of living with obsessive compulsive disorder, was it necessary for Mr. Green to have lived with the mental illness himself?\n\n\u2022 Is it helpful for readers to know about an author\u2019s personal connection to the content of a novel? Or is there a case to be made for separating a work from the author\u2019s experience?\n\n\u2022 Mr. Green\u2019s editor called the book an \u201cunbelievable act of translation.\u201d Do you agree that the book \u201cgives readers a glimpse of what it\u2019s like to suffer from mental illness\u201d? If so, how is this accomplished?\n\n\u2022 If you were writing a novel, would you model the main character after yourself in any way? Why or why not?\n\n__________\n\nRead, Kids, Read", "title": "Text to Text | \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 and \u2018You May Want to Marry My Husband\u2019", "authors": []}

In doing so, it has simply co-opted the left\u2019s position on FISA: Don\u2019t bother to have faith in the process, because the rule of law has no meaning even to those who are sworn to uphold it.\n\nThe assumption that everyone in government is a bad actor imperils our democracy. Following this logic, no set of rules or checks could ever produce a fair result, because no one can be trusted. That means any investigation, or its conclusions, are always illegitimate.\n\nWe are a nation founded on distrust of government power, and questioning that power is essential to promoting transparency and accountability. But those questions ought to leave room for the assumption \u2014 in the absence of specific evidence to the contrary \u2014 that most government servants are ultimately acting in good faith and within the constraints of the law.\n\nThis is particularly true in the FISA context. It was, after all, the F.B.I.\u2019s rigid adherence to FISA protocol which prevented it from sharing intelligence among its own agents, leading to the failures of the Sept. 11th attacks.\n\nAnd on that high rate of approval by the FISA court? When Timothy Edgar was a lawyer at the A.C.L.U., he was among those criticizing the FISA process as a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d But when he became a senior official in the office of the director of national intelligence and witnessed the intensive vetting process firsthand, he retracted his characterization.\n\nWe don\u2019t know whether the memo\u2019s allegations of abuse can be verified.

If you somehow neglect to report income that you should have, and it\u2019s more than 25 percent of the gross income you did report, then you should keep your records for six years from the due date. If you don\u2019t bother filing at all in certain periods, the I.R.S. expects you to keep records for those years forever.\n\nOur tax collectors also offer the following bit of unintentionally hilarious guidance on a tip sheet for people who own small businesses: \u201cKeep records indefinitely if you file a fraudulent return.\u201d In other words: Please, don\u2019t cheat on your taxes. But if you do, ignore the voice in your head telling you to shred all records of your activities from that year, lest you end up in trouble one day and are unable to reconstruct the truth.\n\nDeductible Expenses\n\nSo you have some receipts. Hundreds, perhaps, from charitable contributions and meals bought for customers in pursuit of side hustles or full-time small businesses. The I.R.S. says that if you scan things on paper and save them digitally, the auditors won\u2019t demand originals years later. Credit-card statements will suffice, too. There are a few quirks with keeping records on charitable contributions; consult I.R.S. Publication 526 for more on those.\n\nPhoto\n\nCan your bank bail you out with transaction data years later? Ask before you assume anything. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, keeps records of checks, credit and debit card transactions going back seven years. If you\u2019ve left it for another bank, it will still look up the information (because you won\u2019t have online access anymore), but there may be a fee.\n\nInvestments\n\nOne troublesome area for people with taxable brokerage accounts is that you need to keep track of what you paid for a stock or a mutual fund in order to calculate capital gains or losses later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGenerally, you can rely on your brokerage firm to do this for you, especially since new record-keeping rules went into effect for most transactions starting in 2011. Even if you switch firms, the so-called cost basis information for your investments is supposed to be transferred electronically to your new firm. Check carefully within a month or two of switching to make sure this actually happened.\n\nIt also can\u2019t hurt to keep these records yourself as a backup. For instance, you could just dump every electronic trading notification into an email file, or scan a paper statement or a year-end summary of all transactions and store it in a cloud account, or perhaps two of them just to be safe.\n\nKeep in mind that technology reaches back only so far. Fidelity has records for brokerage transactions going back to 1993, while Vanguard has records dating from 1998. Vanguard adds that it can provide duplicate tax forms for any year it generated one for a participant who invested in a 401(k) plan.\n\nFidelity warns that it may not be able to serve as your backstop when it comes to nondeductible individual retirement accounts. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t have access to the relevant I.R.S. form, 8606, that taxpayers fill out. So you\u2019ll want to hang on to that one until you\u2019ve withdrawn all your nondeductible contributions to the account.\n\nAnother crucial bit of I.R.A. record-keeping is any record of conversions from regular I.R.A.s to Roth I.R.A.s, which allow you to withdraw the money free of taxes decades later. Your accountant may have these documents, too. Mine did when I went looking for them last year, and that backstop was a good reminder of the benefit of doing business with the same people for long periods of time.\n\nEverything Else\n\nThere are dozens of other things you should hang onto as well. I\u2019d follow the I.R.S. rules up above for receipts related to a health savings account. UnitedHealthcare keeps relevant data from its explanation of benefits forms for 10 years from the claim date, and it will give you free copies even if you or your employer are no longer customers.\n\nIf you or a parent expect to qualify for Medicaid coverage for long-term care, your state will probably want to examine all of your transactions (not just health-related ones) for several years before the year you apply.\n\nKeep copies of all major insurance policies, and a home inventory of things you\u2019ll want to replace if they are damaged or stolen. And hang onto the agreements for all major loans, from student to mortgage, and any letters confirming payoff. Keep child support, alimony and other payment records forever too, along with the divorce documentation, especially if things are acrimonious.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHome improvement receipts are essential if you think the value of your home will rise hundreds of thousands of dollars over time, as I explained in a 2015 column. Birth certificates and Social Security cards still seem to come in handy, and you may need military discharge papers once in a while, too.\n\nEstate planning documents can also be a source of contention, so hold onto the originals of any will, trust and related documents, plus beneficiary designations from insurance policies or investment accounts. If you\u2019ve received an inheritance or a gift, you\u2019ll need to document the event and the value as well, perhaps through a formal appraisal. Vanguard notes the need to keep the relevant I.R.S. forms \u2014 706, 709 and 8971 \u2014 indefinitely. Yes, the I.R.S. may be able to retrieve lost tax forms for you, but that could take a while.\n\nThe Joy of Paper\n\nAs much as I know that I should digitize everything, I still haven\u2019t quite come around on going completely paperless. I like being able to write on statements easily and enjoy the well-sorted feeling of opening an orderly filing cabinet.\n\nAnd as I examined my files with a more critical eye than usual this week, I noticed something else. While I have a few memory boxes elsewhere in my apartment, there are also artifacts of my life in nearly every filing cabinet drawer. There was the flier from my first high school dance party at Cabaret Metro in Chicago in 1985, and out fell an autographed picture of Artis Gilmore, from the days when he played basketball for the Bulls and I still answered to \u201cRonnie.\u201d\n\nSeeing these artifacts makes the filing chore tolerable, even pleasurable. Just be careful if you pare back the files and put things through the shredder every so often.

To what extent will their premature sophistication cause them to question their own natural sexuality?\n\nWe already know that porn consumption can cause ennui and eventual dissatisfaction within otherwise stable long-term relationships.

Yes, it is a grueling sport \u2014 as are rowing, running, speedskating, cycling and swimming \u2014 and Anderson pays fair homage to this aspect. But fitness, strength and perseverance in the face of fatigue alone are not enough to win.\n\nTo be a good skier requires balance, rhythm and an animal-like ability to respond to constant variations in topography and snow conditions. Every meter of trail varies in slope, pitch and smoothness. Skis will slide differently over snow that has been shaded or lies on a north-facing slope versus snow in an open, sunny field. And snow changes day by day, hour by hour. Skiers must maintain balance over their skis as they glide over what may be a rough or rutted surface or when they hit a patch of snow that is softer and slower. Losing balance costs speed, and long practice is needed to attain this skill. But once it is mastered, the skier can speed across the landscape, almost floating above the snow. And on downhills, good skiers preserve their momentum and use it to glide up the next hill. And therein lie the joys of what I will argue is a most elegant and engaging sport.

There are also two practice rinks for hockey, a training center for short-track and a practice rink for figure skating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFilling the roster with South Korean drivers proved difficult.\n\nSouth Korea has only a couple of dozen rinks, organizers said, so the talent pool of top drivers is small. And no rinks have two ice-resurfacing machines. Multiple Zambonis on the ice simultaneously can be a seductive dance to watch, but terrifying to drive.\n\nThere were other limiting factors in securing local talent. Some could not get the six or eight weeks off that the job required. And without firm post-Olympic plans for several venues (the speedskating oval, for example, is likely to be converted to convention space), there was little opportunity for locals to find lasting employment by learning during the Olympics and taking over the ice-making operation afterward, as happened in places like Vancouver and Salt Lake City.\n\nMoffatt used an all-Korean crew during hockey test events here last year, with the idea he might do the same during the Olympics. He discovered that younger Korean drivers deferred to older drivers, afraid to disrespectfully show them up with their skills. But five of them had enough talent, he thought, to be invited to the Olympics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

Most of those at the hockey venues work at N.H.L. arenas in places like Edmonton, St. Paul and Denver. At the figure skating and short-track speedskating sites, most drivers work smaller arenas or oversee the ice operations at recreation centers. Those at the long-track oval have specific experience in ovals, which require a more pristine sheet of ice.\n\n\u201cIt has to be absolutely perfect,\u201d said Paul Golomski, whose job at home is facility director of Pettit National Ice Center in Milwaukee. \u201cThickness is critical. The amount of speed they\u2019re carrying, the ice has to be perfectly flat.\u201d\n\nEvery ice sport demands a different surface, with variations in thickness, temperature and hardness. At Gangneung Ice Arena, Boehler split his crew between figure skating and short-track specialists. Figure skating requires thicker, softer ice. Short-track needs colder ice, but not too brittle that it gives way on the tight corners.\n\nBeyond the complex refrigeration systems, Zambonis are the primary tool in making the ice and keeping it in good condition, a big machine that does a lot of detail work.", "title": "The 22nd-Largest Team at the Olympics: Zamboni Drivers", "authors": ["John Branch"]}

The pro-life movement grew on the right and withered on the left. Republicans introduced an anti-abortion plank into their platform in 1976. A new electoral coalition was born.\n\nThe G.O.P. became an alliance between its traditional pro-business wing and its burgeoning pro-life wing. Millions of Americans became single-issue voters. They consider the killing of the unborn the great moral issue of our time. Without pro-life voters, Ronald Reagan never would have been elected. Without single-issue voters who wanted pro-life judges, there would never have been a President Donald Trump.\n\nI understand that our donors (though not necessarily our voters) want to preserve a woman\u2019s right to choose through all nine months of her pregnancy. But do we want late-term abortion so much that we are willing to tolerate President Trump? Do we want it so much that we give up our chance at congressional majorities? Do we want it so much that we see our agendas on poverty, immigration, income equality and racial justice thwarted and defeated?\n\nLet\u2019s try to imagine what would happen if Roe v. Wade was overturned. The abortion issue would go back to the states. The Center for Reproductive Rights estimates that roughly 21 states would outlaw abortion.

But the damage to the federal tax credit program that finances nearly all affordable housing built in America is already painfully evident. Unless Congress rescues this crucial program, a quarter million fewer affordable units will be built over the next 10 years, deepening an already serious crisis.\n\nThe federal low-income housing tax credit, created in 1986, allows companies to reduce their tax liabilities by investing in housing for some of the nation\u2019s neediest families and individuals, many of them seniors, veterans and people with disabilities. The program has produced roughly three million rental units since its inception, but has fallen far short of the growing demand for affordable housing.\n\nFor example, a 2017 report from Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies shows that about 11 million families \u2014 or about a quarter of all renters in the United States \u2014 spend more than half of their incomes on housing. These families often have to choose between making rent and paying for essentials like food, child care and health care, and many are just one financial emergency away from eviction.\n\nThe pressure on low-income renters has worsened for other reasons as well. In recent years, higher-income people who once would have bought homes have turned to renting, driving up housing costs for poor and working-class families. The declining value of low-income housing tax credits will make all of this worse. It started last year, when President Trump and congressional Republicans made clear that they intended to dramatically lower the corporate tax rate, giving companies less reason to worry about tax liabilities.", "title": "Opinion | The Affordable Housing Crisis Is About to Get Worse", "authors": []}

The list of practitioners was relatively short at the time: It included black science fiction writers like Samuel Delany and Octavia Butler and the fantastical orchestra leader Sun Ra, who carried the name of the ancient Egyptian sun god and offered an allegory of salvation in which African-Americans were urged to escape tribulation by emigrating to the stars.\n\nThe ranks of the Afrofuturist creators have grown considerably over the last 25 years. They expanded in dramatic fashion with the release of the wildly successful film \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the first major superhero movie to feature a black director and writers and a majority black cast. The film\u2019s most important distinction is that it is told from an Afrocentric point of view; it breaks with the spirit of derision that has always saturated Hollywood films about Africans.\n\nThe movie takes its title from a 50-year-old Marvel comic superhero who might easily have passed out of existence had he not crossed paths with the African-American comic book writer Christopher Priest, who broke into this white industry during the 1980s and achieved influence in time to keep Marvel from hollowing out the character that has now become one of its most lucrative properties.", "title": "Opinion | The Afrofuturism Behind \u2018Black Panther\u2019", "authors": []}

Working in the music industry often takes her and Mr. Lopez away from their two daughters, so she leaves them with personalized lullabies that she has their babysitters sing.

Ms. LaFourcade said the movie, and song, gave her country a much-needed boost. \u201cEspecially being next to the States, it\u2019s very important, and a reminder of so many good things we have,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cStand Up for Something,\u201d from \u201cMarshall,\u201d a film about the first African-American Supreme Court justice, was written by Diane Warren, who\u2019s on her ninth Oscar nomination, and Common, who, along with John Legend, won the category three years ago for \u201cGlory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCommon said his first round of movie awards attention gave him access to power players he had never before known, like the Starbucks executive Howard Schultz, with whom he ended up partnering on a jobs initiative in Chicago.\n\nMs. Warren said she had always known she wanted to work with Common on the song, which he performed with the singer Andra Day, but didn\u2019t pop the question until she found herself sitting alongside him on a plane trip to Sundance. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most important song I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople are more likely to call you, any success you have,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re chosen out of hundreds of nominated songs is quite an honor. That being said, it would be nice to win.\u201d\n\nMr. Stevens remains a little baffled by his nomination, and the intensity of being part of an awards campaign. A staunchly independent and autonomous songwriter, he\u2019s had little exposure to the entertainment industry complex, and \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d which is also a best picture contender, is distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment.

He is bespectacled, painfully shy and builds computers out of spare parts that his mother, Nelly Cumbicos, buys him. Ms. Cumbicos is a movie-star-beautiful single mother from Ecuador who had sworn off men before she met Ram\u00f3n Mu\u00f1iz, a roofer and die-hard union man who lived on the first floor of the multifamily home in Meriden, Conn., where Jim and Nelly rented the third floor. He would fix Nelly\u2019s car, pick Jim up from school while she was at work and leave unsigned love letters on the windshield of her car. They married in their home on Halloween in 2015.\n\nAn American citizen, he insisted in 2015 that she let him petition for her green card, even though she was afraid it would put ICE on her trail. She was right: When ICE became aware of Ms. Cumbico\u2019s whereabouts, it located a deportation order from more than a decade before that she says she had never received because it was sent to a wrong address. ICE gave her a temporary stay on Feb. 5 only to inexplicably rescind it four days later. Like a botched execution, it left the family newly traumatized. Their legal fees have nearly bankrupted them. Her deportation is set for Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI feel like this is my fault,\u201d Mr. Mu\u00f1iz said. \u201cI put her in danger, but all I wanted was to protect her. I\u2019m lost without her.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1900s, American women who married foreigners lost their citizenship. Those laws are off the books now. But does that mean American citizens have the constitutional right to be protected from the deportation of an immediate family member? Lower courts haven\u2019t thought so. In one case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit decided the deportation of an American-born infant\u2019s parents didn\u2019t violate her right to grow up in this country because either her parents could surrender her to foster care in America before they left or she could leave with them and return to the United States as an adult. The Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit has declared that a parent\u2019s deportation has only \u201cincidental impact\u201d on a child. Studies, however, have shown that children with parents who are under threat of deportation or have been deported fall into depression and anxiety and are more likely to have behavioral problems and to experience drastically decreased academic performance. Couples who are separated by oceans are very likely to end up divorced.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically declared that it is \u201cintolerable\u201d to force a citizen to choose between two constitutional rights.

The Mollen Commission\u2019s 1994 report about police corruption, which used the term, detailed the various and devious overtime schemes that have been used.\n\nIn one, the police would involve additional officers in making an arrest, maximizing the number of people eligible for overtime. In a typical arrangement, those extra officers might claim to have discovered evidence that the defendant had tried to hide, or in some other way they would enter the case as peripheral witnesses. They would need to be on hand to handle paperwork or be available to testify \u2014 so they too would get overtime pay.\n\nIn another practice, known as \u201ctrading collars,\u201d officers sometimes directed arrests to the member of their team who stood to get the most overtime. Felony arrests are often presented to a grand jury about five days after the incident; but if an officer who took part was scheduled to work on the anticipated grand jury date, he or she might defer to a colleague who was not.\n\nThe second officer would \u201ctake the arrest,\u201d and receive the extra pay for going to court on a day off \u2014 even if that meant testifying about events the officer had never witnessed, the report maintained.\n\nOne of the city\u2019s most infamous overtime frauds occurred in the late 1980s among officers from the 73rd Precinct in Brownsville, Brooklyn, known as the Morgue Boys. At their federal corruption trial in Brooklyn, Daniel Eurell, an officer who pleaded guilty, testified that he and his colleagues often made arrests when their shifts were almost over to ensure receiving overtime. The group would then file false reports, or \u201ccover stories,\u201d to justify the arrests, Officer Eurell said.\n\nThe notion that police officers have financial incentives in making arrests also emerged at the trial last month of a Queens detective convicted of perjury. The detective, Kevin Desormeau, had arrested a man on drug charges after claiming, falsely it turned out, to have witnessed the suspect dealing drugs. In arguing the case, prosecutors noted that Detective Desormeau had filed for four hours and 24 minutes of overtime for \u201can arrest that was illegal.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIf Mr. Cordero\u2019s allegations that he was falsely arrested to boost overtime pay are upheld, it would seem to suggest that years of attention and reform have only had a marginal effect on curbing the connection between false arrests and overtime, said Harry G. Levine, a professor of sociology at Queens College who has written extensively about drugs and policing. It would also trigger the second broader trial, which lawyers and policing experts in New York said would be a rarity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe pattern of making arrests to get overtime pay is historic and longstanding,\u201d Professor Levine said.\n\nGabriel Harvis, Mr. Cordero\u2019s lawyer, has suggested that a second trial, should one indeed occur, would set the stage for the biggest challenge to unconstitutional policing practices in New York since a 2013 federal trial about the department\u2019s overreliance on stop-and-frisk tactics. \u201cPhase II is the rare opportunity for a Federal District Court to review controversial citywide practices of the N.Y.P.D.,\u201d Mr. Harvis wrote in an email.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe stop-and-frisk trial, which found the practice was unconstitutional, resulted in a huge decline in the tactic\u2019s use and the creation of a court-appointed monitor to track it. While it remains unclear what effect a finding of liability against the city in a second Cordero trial might have, the judge in the case, Jack B. Weinstein, could take similar action.\n\nThe lawsuit has accused the officers of concocting the basis of Mr. Cordero\u2019s arrest \u201cin order to obtain overtime for completing the attendant paperwork,\u201d court filings state. The officers, who are being defended by lawyers for the city, have denied the charges. The city\u2019s Law Department said that the arrest was \u201csupported by probable cause.\u201d\n\nThe case began at 1 p.m. on Oct. 24, 2014, when Officer Hugo Hugasian was sitting in an unmarked police car watching the mini-market as part of a plainclothes street narcotics team. Court papers state that Officer Hugasian saw a man \u2014 later identified as Matthew Ninos \u2014 walk up to the store with a cellphone at his ear.\n\nThen someone left the store, approached Mr. Ninos and handed him \u201ctwo little zips or bags\u201d in exchange for money, Officer Hugasian said. After a description of the buyer was sent out on a radio, Mr. Ninos was arrested on a charge of having 0.138 grams of cocaine. He later pleaded guilty to drug possession.\n\nThe seller went back into the mini-market, court papers said. Though two other officers, Peter Rubin and John Essig, went inside to find him, they were unable to identify him. So Officer Hugasian, who said that he had witnessed the deal, went into the store. Court papers state he bought a bottle of water and identified the seller as Mr. Cordero, a cashier at J & C Mini Market who is 59 years old.\n\nMr. Cordero was arrested within minutes, according to the papers, but when he was searched, the police did not find any drugs or drug paraphernalia. He did, however, have $580 in his pocket, which he said was \u201cfor emergencies.\u201d Both Mr. Cordero and the owner of the store, Fausto Tineo, told the police that he had never left the market and had been serving customers when the drug deal supposedly occurred. Mr. Cordero was held for several hours, but five months later \u2014 on March 4, 2015 \u2014 the Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office dismissed the charges against him.\n\nThe encounter led Mr. Harvis to conclude that the arrest was a sham and had been orchestrated to generate overtime. In court filings, he noted that the street narcotics unit filed for at least 22 hours of extra pay that day \u2014 most of it by Officers Hugasian and Essig.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth men, according to the lawsuit, had been scheduled to work on the day of the arrests from 7 a.m. to 3:35 p.m. Police records show that Mr. Cordero and Mr. Ninos left the precinct at 5:30 p.m. and were taken to the courthouse. While Officer Hugasian never met with an assistant district attorney, court papers said that he was interviewed by phone about Mr. Cordero\u2019s arrest. Shortly after 8 p.m., the papers said, Mr. Cordero was released from the courthouse. (Mr. Ninos had also been released.) But Officer Hugasian filed documents claiming that he worked until 12:25 a.m. the next day, and Officer Essig said that he remained on duty until 11:30 p.m.\n\nIn October, Judge Weinstein issued an order saying that if any officer was found liable, a second trial would explore Mr. Harvis\u2019s theory that \u201cthe Police Department has long been aware of a widespread practice of false arrests at the end of tours of duty.\u201d The second trial would be likely to rely on Police Department records about overtime abuse, which the city has filed under seal as part of Mr. Cordero\u2019s case but could become public.\n\n\u201cA reasonable jury may find that this practice is not isolated to a few \u2018bad\u2019 police officers,\u201d Judge Weinstein wrote, \u201cbut is endemic, that N.Y.P.D. officials are aware this pattern exists and that they have failed to intervene and properly supervise.\u201d", "title": "The Arrest Was a Bust.

Then she started worrying.\n\nOnly 26 tickets sold. The space fits 250. \u201cThat sucks,\u201d she said by phone, and not only for business reasons: a sparse crowd gets self-conscious and is hesitant to laugh. Ms. Ways, 37, has been putting together comedy shows long enough to know she would have to come up with a quick fix.\n\nPart of what makes New York the greatest city in the world to see live comedy is the large number of cheap, easily accessible and impressively curated live shows outside the clubs. These were once considered alt comedy; now some (Whiplash on Monday, Sweet on Tuesday) are institutions. Their hosts may get the applause, but the far less well-known bookers are the crucial players who establish the vision and quality control. To understand the art of her job, I followed Ms. Ways for one week, keeping in touch by email and phone to see what went into putting together a lineup.\n\nMs. Ways is one of the most important gatekeepers in Brooklyn\u2019s fertile stand-up scene, which is centered not in clubs, but in bars and performing spaces like Union Hall and Bell House. She first established her reputation in the borough in 2010, booking Hot Tub, which was created by the hosts Kristen Schaal and Kurt Braunohler on Monday nights. When that popular show moved to Los Angeles, Night Train, which she created with the host Wyatt Cenac, took over the slot. As soon as it ended in November (Mr. Cenac will have a show on HBO), she started Butterboy with three new hosts, Jo Firestone, Aparna Nancherla and Maeve Higgins. All of these became popular hits, sharing the same diverse aesthetic, progressive vibe and balance of famous names and new voices.", "title": "The Art and Anxiety of Booking a Hit Comedy Showcase", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "Some families, perhaps the top 20 percent, have some ability to absorb these risks. But for the vast majority, there are major setbacks around every corner.\n\nMr. Trump and Congress have done nothing to alleviate those anxieties and, especially in higher education, the financial industry and health care, have worsened them. By contrast, Social Security and bank deposit insurance, while very different New Deal policies, all served the goal of security. They don\u2019t interfere with the free market \u2014 they just give people a bit of confidence in navigating it. The Affordable Care Act expanded this social contract, enabling people to share risk rather than taking it all on themselves.\n\nThe policies of the Trump-Ryan coalition weaken that confidence in three ways. The carelessness about policy, exemplified by the frantic process that led to the withholding mess, is the least important of the three. Specific policies also deliberately shift risk toward individuals: Consider the rules in the new tax act that encourage pass-through businesses, which will lead employers to convert employees into independent contractors, costing them protections such as unemployment insurance and health care.\n\nA proposal for paid family leave recently floated by Ivanka Trump and Senator Marco Rubio takes the policy of \u201cgive with one hand, take away with the other\u201d to an absurd extreme: New parents could pay for leave from their future Social Security payments, trading a week of paid leave for a week of retirement benefits, as if people could make a rational, informed choice between needs that will typically fall 40 years apart in the life cycle.\n\nFinally, this administration has eagerly taken down the guardrails intended to protect individuals from the worst predators: the \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which had required investment advisers to act in the interest of their clients; the hard-fought rules that protect students from worthless for-profit colleges and student loans they can\u2019t repay; and even the recent Labor Department rule requiring that employees receive the tips that are intended for them. Virtually every enforcement action of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on hold or canceled \u2014 even the investigation of the Equifax hack that disclosed the financial records of millions of people \u2014 exposing all of us to even more scams and tricks.\n\nThese rules are particularly vulnerable because they are recent \u2014 newer regulations are easier to reverse. They\u2019re recent because it was only in the third through last years of the Obama administration, once the urgency of the economic crisis of the late 2000s had receded, that the administration seemed to see reining in the scam economy as a defining goal and the new rules of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the powers of the C.F.P.B., were finally put into place. But the problem in political terms was that these pieces were not knitted into a big theme. Each action was in its own policy universe: student loans, investor protection, worker rights.\n\nGiving people some security from the scam economy is never going to involve one big program or idea, like universal basic income or single-payer health care. It will always involve dozens of policies, even to replace the dozens that are currently being dismantled.\n\nBut together they add up to a big theme, ensuring that people who pursue education, work hard and try to save for the future have some assurance that they will be able to navigate a complex and quickly changing economic climate. Progressives should give it a name, because it connects with the experience of every American outside of the very wealthy.", "title": "Opinion | The Art of the Scam", "authors": []}

But every highly self-regarding tribe \u2014 no matter how creative or eccentric \u2014 has its own group of service providers: the people who maintain the tedious parts of life. What\u2019s remarkable about those who tend to the New York art world is not only how few of them there are but how many of them are paid: not with money, but with art.\n\nWHEN THE ART law attorney John Koegel opened his eponymous firm in SoHo, then the center of the art world, in 1982, a silver-haired Ileana Sonnabend and an elegantly dressed Leo Castelli \u2014 dealers responsible for the careers of Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg \u2014 could be seen walking to their respective galleries in the mornings. In 1997, as the area\u2019s galleries began their northern migration to Chelsea, Koegel relocated a few blocks west, to the corner of Sixth Avenue and Spring Street, where he still works.\n\nKoegel\u2019s clients have included artists like David Salle, Judy Pfaff, Barbara Kruger, Jeff Koons and William Wegman, as well as some of the city\u2019s most prominent blue-chip art galleries and the estates of Max Ernst and Larry Rivers. His clients\u2019 work hangs in his office and in his house around the corner on Sullivan Street. \u201cEverything I own is by an artist I know,\u201d he told me. After attending law school at Fordham, Koegel worked for the Justice Department, and then went in-house at the Museum of Modern Art. When he moved his private practice to SoHo, simply being in the neighborhood where artists and gallerists lived was enough to secure his status as their resident lawyer.\n\nPhoto\n\nKoegel performed his first advice-for-art trade while working for a corporate firm in the early 1970s. He took on a largely unknown artist as a pro bono client and successfully sued a gallerist on his behalf for delayed payments. In lieu of a check, Koegel received a boxlike sculpture that resembled a work by surreal assemblage artist Joseph Cornell, which he still has. \u201cI want you to have this artwork because I hope one day I can afford a real lawyer,\u201d the artist told him. \u201cWhat do you think I am?\u201d Koegel remembered thinking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTrading services for goods is an anachronism, a barter system borne out of one party\u2019s poverty and the other\u2019s munificence. And yet in the art world, it\u2019s endured, even thrived; the practice is, if nothing else, humanizing, moving art from the marbled floors of the institution to some of the places we least anticipate beauty. Nowadays, of course, the trades are made not out of necessity, but from a mutual savviness about art and its market. Collecting art can be like dealing in futures, and one could argue that the credentialed lawyer who bills hourly is acting as a kind of speculator and taking on all the risk when he trades for what is in a sense magically minted money \u2014 but on the other hand, it\u2019s the artist whose work has the potential to appreciate in market value.", "title": "The Artist Has a Cavity", "authors": ["Alice Gregory", "The Artist S Life"]}

With Bickelhaupt\u2019s wife, Alexa, running the front of the house, the two entered into a successful partnership that nonetheless buckled under the combined stresses of their personal and professional lives. \u201c42 Grams\u201d offers up the eye candy of a typical foodie doc, but it also witnesses the volatility and ego that sabotage their dreams.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Being John Malkovich\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nFeb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe screenwriter Charlie Kaufman burst onto the scene with this wholly original, playfully surreal comedy about a portal into John Malkovich\u2019s head that allows people to experience his state of being for 15 minutes at a time. Kaufman and director Spike Jonze delight in playing around in this metaphysical space, while also offering up such absurd creations as an office space on a half-floor and a 60-foot Emily Dickinson puppet. Yet \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d is sneakily moving, turning on the common and melancholy yearning of what it\u2019s like to want to escape your own skin.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Blue Crush\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nLoosely based on Susan Orlean\u2019s magazine article \u201cSurf Girls of Maui,\u201d this late-summer hit from 2002 may be primarily about beautiful beaches and bodies in motion, but it overachieves in every respect. Director John Stockwell, who made the fine teen romance \u201cCrazy/Beautiful,\u201d has a good handle on the emotional state of a gifted young surfer (Kate Bosworth) who\u2019s trying to make it back in the water after near-fatal incident. Her comeback follows the usual sports-movie formula, but for surfing footage so spectacularly rendered, that much is forgiven.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Friday Night Lights\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBefore \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d was developed into one of best dramas in recent network history, it existed onscreen as a solid adaptation of Buzz Bissinger\u2019s nonfiction book about a football-obsessed small town in Texas. Director Peter Berg doesn\u2019t have time to explore fully the characters and social complexities of Bissinger\u2019s book, but he does capture the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a place where football is religion. All that pressure is brought to bear on the coach (Billy Bob Thornton), who\u2019s expected to win every game or lose his job.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018In Good Company\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cIn Good Company\u201d has a record-scratch of a premise: A middle-aged advertising executive (Dennis Quaid) not only cedes his position to a new boss half his age (Topher Grace), he\u2019s also dealt the added humiliation having that young man date his daughter (Scarlett Johansson). Yet writer-director Paul Weitz, fresh off \u201cAbout a Boy,\u201d works the premise through an unexpectedly low-key comedy-drama, where the power dynamic between the two men shifts back and forth, revealing vulnerabilities about each.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Moon\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nFeb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nDuncan Jones\u2019s auspicious directorial debut feels composed of equal parts \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cDark Star.\u201d Like the \u201c2001,\u201d it\u2019s a metaphysical head-trip about an astronaut (Sam Rockwell) relying on a possibly diabolical sentient computer (GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey) for companionship. Like \u201cDark Star,\u201d it has an abundance of low-budget charm, with a space station set that looks like an old rental, and an openness to whimsy. Rockwell stars as a loopy energy contractor who\u2019s thrown into chaos just as his final year on a lunar outpost is about to end.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Nightcrawler\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nFeb. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWith a title that sounds like a reference to a B-movie monster, \u201cNightcrawler\u201d offers a ferocious beast in its antihero (Jake Gyllenhaal), an amateur cameraman who seeks out grisly footage to feed the \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads\u201d maxim of local broadcasts. His combination of ambition, shamelessness and moral vacuity makes him perfect for the job \u2014 and also the perfect target for the writer-director Dan Gilroy\u2019s dark, scabrously funny attack on media venality. Gyllenhaal\u2019s natural charisma makes it frighteningly easy to accept his character as a go-getter type, which allows Gilroy to escort the audience to some disturbing places.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Rolling Stones: Crossfire Hurricane\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe Rolling Stones haven\u2019t exactly been hurting for documentary immortalization, having already been the subject of films by the Maysles Brothers (\u201cGimme Shelter\u201d) and Martin Scorsese (\u201cShine a Light\u201d), just for starters. But the montage maestro Brett Morgen (\u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d \u201cJane\u201d) cuts together a fascinating, in-depth profile of the band from a combination of audio from new interviews and 50 years worth of archival film and video. If nothing else, the film is a reminder that the Stones were once revolutionaries, not just a bunch of dinosaurs playing the hits in football stadiums.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018A Most Violent Year\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 7\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cA Most Violent Year\u201d is the perfect example of the type of top-drawer production that would have thrived in theaters in the \u201960s and \u201970s \u2014 it might have shared marquee space with a film like \u201cSerpico\u201d \u2014 but doesn\u2019t fit any contemporary model for success. This superb third feature from J.C. Chandor (\u201cMargin Call,\u201d \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d) stars Oscar Isaac as a straight-arrow heating-oil magnate who has to bend the rules when payments on a new waterfront fuel yard come due and his drivers are suddenly harassed by violent carjackings. That leads some of the drivers to start carrying, themselves. We watch as a good man is led down the road to corruption.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Midnight Special\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 7\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn his first big swing for the studio fences, director Jeff Nichols (\u201cMud,\u201d \u201cTake Shelter\u201d) leaned heavily on Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d for inspiration, but he couldn\u2019t help making a Jeff Nichols film instead. Audiences didn\u2019t know what to make of this interstellar curiosity, but cult fandom surely awaits this story of a father (a typically wired Michael Shannon) who steals back his son \u2014 a boy with extraordinary and perhaps otherworldly powers \u2014 from a religious cult that has been built around him. \u201cMidnight Special\u201d has that \u201cClose Encounters\u201d mix of obsession and wonder, but it is filtered through a more peculiar sensibility.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Django Unchained\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 15\n\nFeb. 15 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s biggest hit is also among his most audacious, a historical revenge fantasy along the lines of \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d but with the action leading to a Mississippi plantation during slavery. Tarantino tramples over any sacrosanct notions of how such a racially sensitive topic might be approached \u2014 and in the same year \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d won an Oscar, no less. But there\u2019s plenty of righteous exploitation-style kick to this story of a freed-slave (Jamie Foxx) who teams up with a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) to liberate his girlfriend (Kerry Washington) from an evil slaver (Leonardo DiCaprio).\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Final Year\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 18\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nShooting over 90 days in 21 countries, the documentary director Greg Barker expected to cement the legacies of three Barack Obama foreign policy appointees: Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications; Samantha Power, the Ambassador to the United Nations; and Secretary of State John Kerry. But the election of Donald Trump turned \u201cThe Final Year\u201d into an excruciating run-down of hard-won negotiations and accomplishments that were deemed likely to undone by the coming administration. Depending on your political persuasion, it\u2019s either a bittersweet reminder of Obama-era policymaking or a cause for schadenfreude.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix Original Movies\n\n\u2018On Body and Soul\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix gambled smartly by picking up this Golden Bear-winning Hungarian drama, which just made the cut for an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film. Geza Morcsanyi and Alexandra Borbely star as workers at a slaughterhouse who happen to have the same dream every night, where they\u2019re deer that meet in the forest and fall in love. It seems only natural that the two are fated to be together, but reality and dreams turn out to be some distance apart.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Seeing Allred\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe nation\u2019s most prominent and controversial feminist lawyer, Gloria Allred was in the news recently for representing one of the women accusing Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican candidate for United States Senate, of sexual misconduct with a minor. This admiring documentary profile from Sophie Sartain and Roberta Grossman catches Allred just as she was shining a big media spotlight on a wave of Bill Cosby\u2019s accusers. But the film also takes a broader view of Allred\u2019s advocacy for women, and how it was able to develop considerable power.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix Original TV Series\n\n\u2018Altered Carbon\u2019: Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: Feb. 2\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis promising (and expensive-looking) Netflix Original series has a \u201cBlade Runner\u201d look and an intriguing premise, set in a future where human consciousness can be preserved on disks and transferred to new bodies. Joel Kinnaman plays one such body, a handsome specimen with martial-arts skills who\u2019s trying to solve a murder while experiencing echoes of previous corporeal forms. \u201cAltered Carbon\u201d has the look of modern noir \u2014 and a reputed abundance of sex and violence to match \u2014 but the premise opens up the possibility for a hard sci-fi treatment of memory and identity.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest (all categories): \u201cAbout Time\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cApollo 13\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cChef\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cThe Danish Girl\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cJohn Mellencamp: Plain Spoken\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cLimitless\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cThe Mermaid\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cOculus\u201d (Feb. 1). \u201cRay\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d (Feb. 1), \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d: Season 6 (Feb. 2), \u201cBaywatch\u201d (Feb. 9), \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman: George Clooney\u201d (Feb. 9), \u201cThe Joel McHale show With Joel McHale\u201d (Feb. 18), \u201cMama\u201d (Feb. 19) and \u201cBegin Again\u201d (Feb. 26).", "title": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix Canada in February", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"]}

(Unfortunately, streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings applies only to viewers in the United States.)\n\nMovies New to Netflix\n\n\u2018Casino\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s sumptuous three-hour epic about gangsterism in Las Vegas in the \u201970s and early \u201980s lays out the mechanics of a stem-to-stern scam while suggesting that the Disneyfied Vegas of today merely puts a better face on the city\u2019s criminal underpinnings. Sporting an astonishing wardrobe of retina-searing suits \u2014 44 in all \u2014 Robert De Niro stars as Ace Rothstein, a peerless sports handicapper who takes over the Teamsters-funded Tangiers Casino for the Chicago Outfit, but finds his efforts undermined by a vicious mob grifter (Joe Pesci), a prostitute-turned-hustler (Sharon Stone) and the local political cronies.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Fast Five\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix is adding the first five entries in the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, but those disinclined to binge-watch 10 hours\u2019 worth of middling gear head action are advised to skip ahead to the fifth one. Although newcomers to the series will miss the patched-together mythology that brings its characters together, \u201cFast Five\u201d is essentially \u201cOcean\u2019s Eleven\u201d on wheels, an ensemble heist movie that steers into the curve of its own absurdity. Here, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker gather a team in Rio de Janeiro to peel away with $100 million of a shady businessman\u2019s money.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Steve Jobs\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nYour affinity for \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d will strongly correspond to your level of toleration/appreciation for the caffeinated dialogue in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s script for this biopic, which casts the turtlenecked Apple co-founder as half visionary, half megalomanic. Sorkin\u2019s smartest contribution is to divide Walter Isaacson\u2019s sprawling biography into three distinct acts, each around a product launch: The Macintosh computer in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac computer in 1998. The actor Michael Fassbender channels Jobs\u2019s intensity and brilliance without downplaying his callousness.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Stanford Prison Experiment\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 3\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOffering the modest fee of $15 per day, Philip Zimbardo, a Stanford University psychologist, hired 15 male students to take roles as prisoners and guards in a 14-day experiment designed to help better understand prison culture and the root causes of abusive behavior. Six days later, the project was abruptly shut down. \u201cThe Stanford Prison Experiment\u201d is a scrupulous fictionalized recounting of the fiasco, which has endured as both a lesson in scientific ethics and a legitimate study in power dynamics. Michael Angarano is particularly good as an mediocre student who turns into a drawling John Wayne-style thug when cast as a guard.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Benji\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 6\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nWith a new \u201cBenji\u201d coming to Netflix on March 16, Netflix is making the \u2026 er \u2026 \u201cclassic\u201d titles available, including the 1974 original, the first of five written around the scrappy little stray. In a twist on the typical family-dog scenario, the pup begins the franchise as a homeless freelancer who works his way into the hearts of the townspeople, especially a pair of siblings who feed and play with him behind their parents\u2019 backs. When the children are kidnapped, it\u2019s up to Benji to do the sleuthing necessary to find them.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Wind River\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAfter establishing himself as a strong genre-movie screenwriter with \u201cSicario\u201d and \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d Taylor Sheridan stepped behind the camera for \u201cWind River,\u201d a hard-edge murder mystery set on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Jeremy Renner stars as a game tracker for the United States Fish and Wildlife service, who agrees to help an F.B.I. agent (Elizabeth Olsen) investigate the murder a Native American girl on the reservation. The case forces him to confront the trauma of having lost his own daughter years before.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Crazies\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nFrom the department of unlikely remakes comes this 2010 twist on a lesser-known allegorical horror film by George Romero, who is better regarded for \u201cNight of the Living Dead\u201d and its sequels. The early image of a gunman opening fire on a small-town baseball field was already tough to watch before James Hodgkinson attacked a Congressional baseball team last year. But \u201cThe Crazies\u201d soon settles into a non-zombie zombie movie about an Iowa sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) who tries to stop the spread of mass psychosis. An attack inside a carwash is particularly memorable.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nMarch 31 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThough Charlie Kaufman may be the most original screenwriter of his generation, his scripts for films like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d or \u201cAdaptation\u201d all follow a certain formula, constructing a high-concept latticework around a core emotional idea. That pattern continued with \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\u201d which spends much of its time following Jim Carrey as he dashes around his own consciousness, chasing the memories he has paid to have erased after a failed relationship. But the film arrives at a poignant observation: The sum of our romantic experiences, even the ones that end badly, is greater than the pain we might wish to blot out.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Let Me In\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nMarch 31 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis 2010 Americanization of the fantastic 2008 Swedish vampire film \u201cLet the Right One In\u201d seemed unnecessary when it arrived, especially for fans of the original. But \u201cLet Me In\u201d isn\u2019t the artless remake many feared. Two excellent young actors, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, capably assume the lead roles as a bullied kid and the ageless vampire who befriends him. Director Matt Reeves maintains the moody, hushed integrity of \u201cLet the Right One In,\u201d resisting the urge to amplify the horror, and the film\u2019s effects are an unqualified improvement.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNascar culture gets an affectionate and riotously funny sendup in \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d Adam McKay and Will Ferrell\u2019s follow-up to \u201cAnchorman,\u201d another comedy about a particular strain of macho overconfidence. Ferrell and John C. Reilly star as stock-car racers who dominate the circuit as the duo known as \u201cShake\u201d and \u201cBake,\u201d But their partnership unravels when a French Formula One racer (Sacha Baron Cohen) makes a claim for supremacy. For someone directing a comedy, McKay shoots the racetrack sequences with surprising brio, but the film belongs to Ferrell, whose All-American lunkhead calls his children \u201cWalker\u201d and \u201cTexas Ranger\u201d and thanks the Lord Baby Jesus for all the blessings at his dinner table.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018A Walk Among the Tombstones\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt\u2019s hard to keep track of all the bone-crunching Liam Neeson vehicles since \u201cTaken\u201d turned him into an action star, but \u201cA Walk Among the Tombstones\u201d stands out for its authentic grit, which puts it more in line with the noirs and Westerns of old than with contemporary action movies. Adapting the novel by Lawrence Block, the screenwriter-turned-director Scott Frank (\u201cOut of Sight\u201d) sends Neeson\u2019s alcoholic private eye in a bloody assignment to figure out who killed a drug kingpin\u2019s wife and kidnapped that man\u2019s daughter. There are no good guys in the film, including the hero, who has to sort out the bad from the irredeemably awful.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Winter\u2019s Bone\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 31\n\nMarch 31 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn retrospect, the \u201cHunger Games\u201d movies that made Jennifer Lawrence an A-list star are no more than a young adult fantasy version of her breakthrough role in \u201cWinter\u2019s Bone,\u201d which cast her as an intrepid teenager who\u2019s willing to sacrifice herself for her family. Instead of the rapacious dystopia of Panem in \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d Lawrence here has to fight through the rapacious dystopia of the Ozarks, where she searches for her father in a dangerous, meth-ravaged landscape. If she doesn\u2019t find him, her desperately poor family drops off the precipice.\n\nNew Netflix Original Films\n\n\u2018Layla M.\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 23\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nHow might radicalization actually work? The Dutch director Mijke de Jong offers a persuasive case study with this fictional account of a young Muslim woman in Amsterdam (Nora El Koussour) whose anger over Islamophobic policies leads her to get married, drop out of school and follow her husband to an austere religious community in Amman, Jordan. \u201cLayla M\u201d is about a headstrong woman whose convictions are met with different forms of oppression in Amsterdam and Jordan, tying her to a grim destiny like ropes to a railroad track.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix Original Series\n\n\u2018Collateral\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: March 9\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe veteran playwright and screenwriter David Hare, a two-time Oscar nominee for \u201cThe Hours\u201d and \u201cThe Reader,\u201d scripted this original four-episode BBC Two series about the investigation of a London murder with sensitive sociopolitical ramifications. Carey Mulligan stars as one of the officers investigating the case of a Syrian refugee who was shot and killed as he was working a food delivery job. As the case unfolds, the motives behind his assassination tip toward a disturbing commentary on England itself and its growing anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Love\u2019: Season 3\n\nStarts streaming: March 9\n\nMarch 9 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nCreated by Judd Apatow and Lesley Arfin, and written with Paul Rust, this series about love and friendship between two immensely screwed-up singles in Hollywood was always funny, but it has become more textured and real as it has progressed. Mickey (Gillian Jacobs) and Gus (Rust) could be called \u201cfriends with benefits,\u201d but the ambiguity of their status tortures them both, along with their mutual gifts for self-destruction and sabotage. This final season may finally answer the \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they\u201d question, but it would be out of character for them to settle down too easily.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cLove Beats Rhymes\u201d (March 1), \u201cThe Rundown\u201d (March 1), \u201cSleeping With Other People\u201d (March 1), \u201cStomp the Yard\u201d (March 1), \u201cBroadchurch\u201d Season 3 (March 5), \u201cThe Brothers Grimsby\u201d (March 6), \u201cJessica Jones\u201d Season 2 (March 8), \u201cSt. Vincent\u201d (March 13), \u201cRace\u201d (March 23), \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d (March 30), \u201cCatfish\u201d (March 31), \u201cThe Fifth Element\u201d (March 31), \u201cHanna\u201d (March 31).", "title": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix Canada in March", "authors": ["Scott Tobias"]}

I just felt that as a matter of my own personal conscience, I could not remain.\u201d\n\nMr. Frazier spoke to The Times for the Corner Office column, a series of interviews with business leaders that was a regular feature from 2009 until last fall. It will return next month with a fuller interview with Mr. Frazier, in which he covers a broad range of topics, including his upbringing, his early career, and Merck\u2019s efforts to fight cancer and other diseases.\n\nThe events that led to Mr. Frazier\u2019s confrontation with the president unfolded over a tense summer weekend, as white nationalists gathered in Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Bloody fighting broke out as they clashed with counterdemonstrators, one of whom was killed when a self-described neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of people.\n\n\u201cI saw what was happening on that Friday night, and then I heard the horrible news about what had happened on Saturday with the young woman being killed, and others being run down by a person who was sympathetic to people who held views that I consider personally noxious,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cAnd then I heard the president\u2019s response.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, speaking at a veterans\u2019 event at one of his golf clubs, condemned the violence but did not criticize the white nationalists chanting neo-Nazi slogans. He blamed \u201chatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks drew widespread condemnation for appearing to equate the actions of the counterprotesters with those of neo-Nazis, and many Americans, including Mr. Frazier, found them deeply inadequate.\n\n\u201cIn that moment, the president\u2019s response was one that I felt was not in concordance with my views,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t think they were in concordance with the views that we claim to hold as a country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBefore announcing his decision to resign from the president\u2019s manufacturing council, Mr. Frazier consulted with the Merck board.\n\n\u201cI wanted to say that this was a statement I was making in terms of my own values, and the company\u2019s values, and there was unanimous support for that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy board supported that 100 percent.\u201d\n\nThen, on Monday morning, Merck posted a statement from Mr. Frazier on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI am resigning from the President\u2019s American Manufacturing Council,\u201d it read in part. \u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity and the contributions made by men and women of different faiths, races, sexual orientations and political beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe president, not one to let a slight go, swiftly hit back on Twitter.\n\n\u201cNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201d the president wrote.\n\nFor most of that Monday, Mr. Frazier was the lonely voice of opposition among business leaders, with few chief executives offering their support for him. But on Monday night, the chief executives of Intel and Under Armour also stepped down from the advisory groups.\n\nBy Wednesday, dozens of the country\u2019s top chief executives had reached the same conclusion: They could no longer be part of the advisory councils. The groups were disbanded.\n\nMr. Frazier doesn\u2019t regret his initial decision to advise the president.\n\n\u201cI joined because I think Merck is an important company and has something to contribute to the discussion about how we could as a country become much more competitive in the global economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI joined because the president asked me to join, and I thought it was the right thing to do as the C.E.O. of a company like Merck.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This is a democracy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s unwillingness to condemn white nationalists as different.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we were not talking about politics,\u201d Mr. Frazier continued. \u201cWe were talking about the basic values of the country.\u201d\n\nMr. Frazier did not respond to the president\u2019s tweet, and has not spoken publicly about the episode until now.\n\nFor a man who rose to the pinnacle of corporate America, Mr. Frazier came from a humble background. His grandfather was born into slavery in South Carolina, and his father was a janitor in Philadelphia. Yet Mr. Frazier\u2019s parents pushed him to believe he could achieve great things.\n\n\u201cThey believed that despite the history of this country as it related to African-Americans, that for my siblings and I, there would be tremendous opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also instilled that it was our responsibility to take advantage of the opportunities that they did not have.\u201d\n\nMr. Frazier attended Pennsylvania State University. After earning a degree from Harvard Law School, he went to work at Drinker Biddle & Reath, a law firm in Philadelphia. While there, he began representing Merck, and took on pro bono work.\n\nHe spent several summers in South Africa teaching black law students. And he took on the case of James Willie Cochran, known as Bo, a black inmate on death row who had been convicted of killing a white store manager.\n\nAfter looking at the evidence, Mr. Frazier and his colleagues became convinced of Mr. Cochran\u2019s innocence. They eventually secured him a new trial, and he was acquitted in 1997.\n\n\u201cIt was by far the most important thing that I\u2019ve ever done in my life, full stop, professionally,\u201d Mr. Frazier said. \u201cThis is a man who was facing an execution date for a crime he did not commit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Frazier joined Merck 1992 and rose through the ranks, overseeing the company\u2019s defense against lawsuits related to the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx and, as chief executive since 2011, making the development of drugs to treat cancer a priority.\n\nIn the 1980s, Merck developed a treatment for river blindness, and opted to give it away. \u201cMany people would say that was the spark for a lot of what we call corporate social responsibility,\u201d Mr. Frazier said.\n\nEarly in his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Frazier resisted calls to cut research and development spending and focus on profitability. \u201cWe value R & D as a company,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s who we are.\u201d\n\nMr. Frazier has little interest in dwelling on his feud with Mr. Trump, and would rather stay out of politics altogether. Yet when confronted last summer with a stance he considered unconscionable, Mr. Frazier said, he could not help but speak out.\n\n\u201cWhat happened that weekend I think was not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that really went to the core of who we say we are as Americans.\u201d", "title": "The C.E.O.

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "For search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.\n\nPhoto\n\nSoon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?\n\nAs far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle executives, had they known of Adam\u2019s frustrations, probably wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. For years, Google had been trying to build a tool for comparing online prices. \u201cThe idea was you should be able to input any item, and we\u2019d show you the best place to buy it,\u201d says Brian Larson, a technical lead for what was then named Froogle and today is called Google Shopping. Larson\u2019s team was small \u2014 just himself and one other programmer at first, and roughly a dozen people at its height \u2014 and Larson would regularly test how Froogle compared with other online price-comparison services. \u201cSometimes we were neck and neck; sometimes, not so much,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe had a hundred million product listings, which was better than competitors.\u201d But they were often outperformed by sites like PriceGrabber.com, which had many more employees devoted to price comparisons.\n\nFroogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201d\n\nAdam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.\n\nThe Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.\n\nGoogle has succeeded where Genghis Khan, communism and Esperanto all failed: It dominates the globe. Though estimates vary by region, the company now accounts for an estimated 87 percent of online searches worldwide. It processes trillions of queries each year, which works out to at least 5.5 billion a day, 63,000 a second. So odds are good that sometime in the last week, or last hour, or last 10 minutes, you\u2019ve used Google to answer a nagging question or to look up a minor fact, and barely paused to consider how near-magical it is that almost any bit of knowledge can be delivered to you faster than you can type the request. If you\u2019re old enough to remember the internet before 1998, when Google was founded, you\u2019ll recall what it was like when searching online involved AltaVista or Lycos and consistently delivered a healthy dose of spam or porn. (Pity the early web enthusiasts who innocently asked Jeeves about \u201camateurs\u201d or \u201csteel.\u201d)\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s very likely you love Google, or are at least fond of Google, or hardly think about Google, the same way you hardly think about water systems or traffic lights or any of the other things you rely on every day. Therefore you might have been surprised when headlines began appearing last year suggesting that Google and its fellow tech giants were threatening everything from our economy to democracy itself. Lawmakers have accused Google of creating an automated advertising system so vast and subtle that hardly anyone noticed when Russian saboteurs co-opted it in the last election. Critics say Facebook exploits our addictive impulses and silos us in ideological echo chambers. Amazon\u2019s reach is blamed for spurring a retail meltdown; Apple\u2019s economic impact is so profound it can cause market-wide gyrations. These controversies point to the growing anxiety that a small number of technology companies are now such powerful entities that they can destroy entire industries or social norms with just a few lines of computer code. Those four companies, plus Microsoft, make up America\u2019s largest sources of aggregated news, advertising, online shopping, digital entertainment and the tools of business and communication. They\u2019re also among the world\u2019s most valuable firms, with combined annual revenues of more than half a trillion dollars.\n\nIn a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.\n\nAt the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d\n\nStandard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201d\n\nIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.\n\nFor decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.\n\nConsider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.\n\nWhat eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.\n\nOnce Foundem.com was available to everyone, the company\u2019s honeymoon lasted precisely two days. During its first 48 hours, the Raffs saw a rush of traffic from users typing product queries into Google and other search engines. But then, suddenly, the traffic stopped. Alarmed, Adam and Shivaun began running diagnostics. They quickly discovered that their site, which until then had been appearing near the top of search results, was now languishing on Google, mired 12 or 15 or 64 or 170 pages down. On other search engines, like MSN Search and Yahoo, Foundem still ranked high. But on Google, Foundem had effectively disappeared. And Google, of course, was where a vast majority of people searched online.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201d\n\nGoogle executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.\n\nOne way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201d\n\nLeft unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.\n\nShivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.\n\nAs the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.\n\nThree years passed this way. Some nights, Shivaun would sit at her computer, exhausted, Googling phrase after phrase \u2014 How do you lift a Google website penalty? Who at Google reviews mistakes? Google and deindexed and phone number and help \u2014 hoping that some magic combination of words might yield a new solution. \u201cIt just felt so unfair,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cWe had great technology. It was winning awards. But we couldn\u2019t even get an explanation from Google about why we weren\u2019t showing up.\u201d Eventually, they sought out a public relations firm, in the hope that a newspaper article might get Google\u2019s attention. The P.R. firm had an additional suggestion: Why not file an antitrust complaint? To Adam and Shivaun, that seemed like a waste of time. If Microsoft had been able to shrug off the antitrust attacks of the United States government, why would Google care about a complaint filed by some small firm?\n\nBut they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the years passed, Shivaun and Adam got into the habit of visiting message boards where people obsessively discussed Google\u2019s many peculiarities. They began to notice an interesting pattern among companies complaining about the search giant: Often, the aggrieved parties had, in some way, posed some kind of threat to Google\u2019s business. And they seemed to have suffered dire consequences.\n\nThere was, for instance, Skyhook Wireless, which had invented a new navigation system that competed with Google\u2019s location software and had signed major deals with the cellphone manufacturers Samsung and Motorola. Skyhook\u2019s accuracy \u201cis better than ours,\u201d one Google manager speculated in an internal email later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Skyhook against Google. Not long after that note was written, according to the lawsuit, a high-ranking Google official pressured Samsung and Motorola to end their relationships with Skyhook \u2014 and implied that if they didn\u2019t, Google could make it impossible for them to ship their phones on time. (Google has denied doing anything inappropriate.) Soon, Samsung and Motorola canceled their Skyhook contracts. Skyhook sued Google, and though one suit was dismissed, Google ended up paying $90 million to settle a patent-infringement claim. But by then it was too late. Skyhook\u2019s founders, bereft of other partnership options, had been forced to sell their company at a large discount.\n\nThen there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201d\n\nThe more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nTradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.\n\nEventually the Raffs reached out to the F.T.C., which, they knew, was the American equivalent of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust office, and the U.S. regulators invited them to visit. The F.T.C.\u2019s staff, it turned out, had been quietly collecting complaints about Google for years. In 2012, those officials wrote a confidential 160-page report that said Google had \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d That memo, about half of which was accidentally sent to reporters at The Wall Street Journal after they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, said that \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct has resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201d\n\nWhen the F.T.C.\u2019s politically appointed leadership considered the staff\u2019s recommendations, they declined to sue Google, surprising many inside the agency. \u201cWhile not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance, we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Jon Leibowitz, said when he announced the decision in 2013.\n\nThe F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.\n\nAdam and Shivaun didn\u2019t have to wait for the official F.T.C. announcement to know that their case was going nowhere. Meeting with officials in Washington, they could tell: These people were not going to prosecute. They had come to the United States at their own expense. They had written memo after memo arguing that Google was treating them unfairly and as a result hurting users. They had done everything they were asked. Standard Oil controlled 64 percent of the market for refined petroleum when the Supreme Court broke it into dozens of pieces. Google and Facebook today control an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market. And the F.T.C. seemed happy to let them keep doing it. To the Raffs, it felt as if history was repeating itself, as if the pointless, ineffectual Microsoft case was happening all over again. It felt as if nobody cared.\n\nIf you are younger than 29 \u2014 which just happens to be the average age of a Google employee, according to a survey done by PayScale \u2014 then odds are good you don\u2019t remember much about the Microsoft antitrust battles of the 1990s. So, a quick primer: For almost a decade, starting in 1993, federal and state prosecutors besieged Microsoft in courtrooms across the nation, arguing that the company had acted in ways that were predatory and dishonest to preserve its software monopoly. One Microsoft executive was quoted in court as threatening to \u201ccut off\u201d the \u201cair supply\u201d of a competitor. \u201cIs Bill Gates the \u201990s answer to Don Corleone?\u201d Time magazine asked. \u201cI expected to find a bloody computer monitor in my bed,\u201d a witness told investigators.\n\nAlong the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.\n\nEven when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.\n\nThis was the history the Raffs recalled when they heard the F.T.C. was abandoning its investigation. But then, they also remembered a discussion they had once had with a lawyer named Gary Reback, who told them that everything they\u2019d heard about the Microsoft trials was wrong. Reback is something of a legend in Silicon Valley, both because of his accomplishments as an antitrust provocateur and because of his anxious \u2014 some might say paranoid \u2014 worldview. Reback has been known to call other lawyers late at night and leave long, obsessively detailed voice mail messages about legal arguments and economic theories. He was featured on a 1997 cover of Wired magazine with the headline \u201cThis Lawyer Is Bill Gates\u2019s Worst Nightmare,\u201d a boast that wasn\u2019t far-off: Working on behalf of clients like Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Reback had browbeaten the Department of Justice into suing Microsoft for antitrust.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201d\n\nReback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.\n\nSurprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201d\n\nIn public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.\n\nAnd most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d\n\nMicrosoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\n\n\u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOr consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201d\n\nIt was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.\n\nWhat changed everything was a middle-aged Danish politician named Margrethe Vestager, who had recently been named the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition. Vestager was an unusual choice for the post. She wasn\u2019t a populist crusader or a pro-business acolyte; she was, instead, a moderate whose claim to fame, at that point, was having served as an inspiration for the television show \u201cBorgen,\u201d a fictional series about a Danish politician. But Vestager was awarded the commissioner\u2019s post in 2014 after arguing that European marketplaces needed to do a better job of giving everyone an equal chance to succeed. Since assuming her office, Vestager has become, unexpectedly, the most prominent antitrust official in the world, invited to speak at conferences and mobbed by autograph seekers.\n\nBy the time Vestager took office, Google had already transitioned its price-comparison service to its present incarnation, which is effectively an advertising system that prominently features links only from companies that pay for the promotion. (Users are notified by a small logo that says \u201csponsored.\u201d) After reviewing the complaints submitted by the Raffs and others, Vestager announced she intended to formally charge Google with antitrust violations. (She has also embarked on investigations into the European tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, as well as anticompetitive tactics at Qualcomm, Facebook and Gazprom.)\n\nOver the next two years, Vestager\u2019s staff reviewed data from 1.7 billion Google queries. They scrutinized how people fared when they conducted searches on topics in which Google had a vested interest, versus those where the company had nothing to gain. Then, in June of last year, the commission issued its final verdict: \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules,\u201d Vestager said in a statement released at the time. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most important, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d Google was ordered to stop giving its own comparison-shopping service an illegal advantage and was fined an eye-popping $2.7 billion, the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history and more than twice as large as any such fine ever levied by the United States.\n\nThe verdict rocked Silicon Valley. Some think Europe\u2019s assertiveness makes it more likely American regulators will act as well. And there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already starting. Donald Trump appealed to voters, in part, by attacking the tech monopolies. In a case of truly odd bedfellows, that puts him in alignment with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have long called for greater scrutiny of technology companies. Last year, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sponsored legislation to boost antitrust enforcement by forcing companies to assume the burden of showing that a merger won\u2019t hurt the public.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan assortment of state attorneys general have urged the F.T.C. to reopen its investigation of Google. Most major antitrust battles, including the federal suits against Microsoft and Standard Oil, have begun as state actions. A Missouri investigation is particularly notable because the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is running for the United States Senate, has subpoenaed information to see if Google has manipulated searches to disadvantage potential competitors. \u201cThe Obama-era F.T.C. did not take any enforcement action against Google, did not press this forward and has essentially given them a free pass,\u201d Hawley told reporters after revealing his inquiry in November. \u201cI will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.\u201d\n\nAs attacks against Google have escalated, the company has tried to limit the damage. After Yelp complained to the F.T.C. about Google\u2019s stealing its content, Google promised to make it easier for websites to opt out of automatic copying, a pledge it reaffirmed a few months ago. And earlier this month, in exchange for Getty Images\u2019 withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission, Google signed a licensing agreement with Getty promising to more clearly display images\u2019 copyright information. Other titans like Facebook are similarly trying to get ahead of criticisms, voluntarily pledging greater transparency and promising to work more cooperatively with regulators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.\n\n\u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201d\n\nIf the internet\u2019s potentates are frightened, however, they\u2019re doing a good job of hiding it. Google has appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision and has vigorously defended itself online. The company\u2019s arguments are the same ones that it was putting forth on company blogs over the course of the investigation. \u201cWe disagree with the European Commission\u2019s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition,\u201d Google\u2019s top lawyer wrote in one post. The commission \u201cdrew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon,\u201d undermining the contention that Google is dominant. \u201cGoogle delivered more than 20 billion free clicks to aggregators over the last decade,\u201d he wrote in another post. Forcing it to \u201cdirect more clicks to price-comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201d Google\u2019s data indicates that users appreciate how the search engine has shifted over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019 \u201d Google\u2019s interests, the company said. \u201cThat\u2019s giving customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201d\n\nSome legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201d\n\nThose are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.\n\nRather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.\n\nPut differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.\n\nFor the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201d\n\nOne of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201d", "title": "The Case Against Google", "authors": ["Charles Duhigg"]}

Forty-eight states disenfranchise people who are incarcerated; 34 disenfranchise people who are out of prison but are on parole or probation.\n\nThis means that in 16 states people who are on parole or probation can already vote. Those states includes places such as Indiana and Ohio. But they do not include purportedly progressive states like California, New Jersey and Washington, which have comparatively regressive disenfranchisement rules.\n\nThese states cannot be left off the hook for the hundreds of thousands of residents whom they disenfranchise. \u201cThe moment you deprive a person of his right to a voice in the government,\u201d Anthony warned in 1873, \u201cyou degrade him from the status of a citizen of the republic to that of a subject,\u201d a person \u201chelpless, powerless, bound to obey laws made by superiors.\u201d Allowing people to vote only after completing their sentences still strips many of a political voice and undermines democratic decision-making.\n\nTrue, Anthony and her fellow suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton sought support for woman\u2019s suffrage by distinguishing it from voting rights for \u201ccriminals.\u201d Yet the principle underlying their advocacy \u2014 one that affirms the franchise as an unassailable element of citizenship \u2014 demands that everyone be allowed to vote.\n\nThe importance of not depriving any citizen of a voice in government becomes especially clear in light of the origins of felon disenfranchisement laws, which spread in the decades after the Civil War and have long been a central part of the arsenal with which states have tried to exclude African-Americans from politics.\n\nBuoyed by the systematic racial biases of the criminal justice system \u2014 which mean black people are more likely to be arrested and are punished more harshly \u2014 the strategy has worked. Nationally, the disenfranchisement rate among black adults is three times that of the population as a whole.\n\nNew Jersey can lead the way in remedying this. Its disenfranchisement rate \u2014 1.4 percent \u2014 is the highest in the Northeast after Delaware.

{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "The dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Alito and Gorsuch, was signed by Justice Thomas. But in its 13 pages, which dismissed the majority opinion as \u201ca useless do-over\u201d and \u201cceremonial hand-wringing,\u201d I\u2019m sure I detected the distinctive voice of the newest justice. This sentence, \u201cThe responsibility of courts is to decide cases, both usual and unusual, by neutrally applying the law,\u201d mirrors the condescending civics lesson that Justice Gorsuch administered to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, of all people, in a dissenting opinion last June. \u201cIf a statute needs repair,\u201d he informed the seven members of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s majority in Perry v. Merit Systems Protection Board, \u201cthere\u2019s a constitutionally prescribed way to do it. It\u2019s called legislation.\u201d Only Justice Thomas joined that dissent.\n\nMy third and final data point came last week, in one of the four signed opinions the court has issued so far this term. The procedurally complexities of this case, Artis v. District of Columbia, nearly defy simplification, but that\u2019s not the point here. It was not on anyone\u2019s radar screen as a first-order case \u2014 or second- or third-order case, for that matter. Suffice it to say that it concerned the time limits for refiling a case in state court after dismissal by a federal court. A federal law governs such a situation, with ambiguous wording that posed the question of whether the state-court plaintiff had 30 days from the dismissal to refile in state court, or 30 days plus whatever the state\u2019s statute of limitations would ordinarily have been had the clock not been stopped while the federal portion of the case was pending, in this instance apparently three years.\n\nThis hardly sounds like the kind of issue to provoke a 5-to-4 split on the Supreme Court. So why on earth did it? With an opinion by Justice Ginsburg that was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the majority engaged in a thoroughly conventional exercise of statutory interpretation and came up with the more generous reading of the statute.\n\nJustice Gorsuch wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Kennedy, Alito and Thomas. It basically announced that the end of the world was at hand. The decision to stop the clock on the running of a state\u2019s statute of limitations was an insult to the states, Justice Gorsuch declared, \u201cno small departure from our traditional principles of federalism.\u201d\n\nHe ended his 18-page opinion with a history lesson. \u201cWe\u2019ve wandered so far from the idea of a federal government of limited and enumerated powers that we\u2019ve begun to lose sight of what it looked like in the first place,\u201d he informed his colleagues. \u201cIf the federal government can now, without any rational reason, force states to allow state law causes of action in state courts even though the state law limitations period expired many years ago, what exactly can\u2019t it do to override the application of state law to state claims in state court? What boundaries remain then?\u201d\n\nThe author of a dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court has two choices. One is to proclaim that all is lost. That approach serves as a declaration of war that illuminates the defeat on a giant billboard and leaves no room for compromise the next time around, and there is always a next time. The other choice is to minimize the loss by sending the message that nothing much has happened here, saving the losing side\u2019s fire for the inevitable next round \u2014 or for things that really count.\n\nI can only guess that Chief Justice Roberts, if he was tempted for a split second to view this little case as the dissent saw it, recoiled from Justice Gorsuch\u2019s superheated language. What boundaries remain, indeed? My sense is that the chief justice reads this heavily freighted political moment as a time to avoid spending the Supreme Court\u2019s limited capital needlessly, in contrast to his junior colleague\u2019s evident desire to make as much noise as he can.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong about that. But there\u2019s a clich\u00e9 in journalism that it takes three to make a trend, and I\u2019ve counted to three in just the past three weeks. If I\u2019m right, there\u2019s a realignment, however subtle, in progress at the court now that portends a future more hopeful, or at least more interesting, than appeared likely even a few months ago.", "title": "Opinion | The Chief Justice, Searching for Middle Ground", "authors": []}

Janus is largely being discussed as a case that is likely to defund and disrupt labor unions, but the case cannot simply injure unions and leave everything else intact.\n\nAt last count, federal, state and local governments employed over 21 million workers, so the courts have had to develop a framework for governments to be able to manage their work forces without constantly confronting the Constitution. Imagine if a teacher called in sick, and an administrator had to procure a warrant before searching her desk drawer for a text book, or else risk violating the Fourth Amendment. Or imagine if a police sergeant who tells an officer that he didn\u2019t have time to listen to a complaint about the break room now has to worry that he violated the First Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court has spent decades developing a framework for managing this tension and how the Constitution applies to the public-sector workplace. Starting in 1968, the court held that the \u201cgovernment has significantly greater leeway\u201d in managing citizen employees than in \u201cbringing its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court has said the First Amendment applies only when the public employee can show that she spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern. Similarly, in 1987, the court upheld a public employer\u2019s search of an employee\u2019s desk after balancing \u201cthe invasion of the employees\u2019 legitimate expectation of privacy against the government\u2019s need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace.\u201d In 2010, the court extended this approach to employer-issued electronic devices, allowing a public employer to search them without a warrant if the search is \u201cmotivated by a legitimate work-related purpose.\u201d\n\nThe 1977 Abood case recognized that the government has an interest in \u201clabor peace,\u201d in permitting its employees to have an exclusive representative that can bargain on their behalf, and that workers who benefit from the union\u2019s activities should pay to support this collective-bargaining function.

I\u2019ve never seen tens of thousands of Indian tribesmen waving tomahawks in my direction. But I have seen 50,000 Atlanta Braves fans do it \u2014 chanting with foam tomahawks \u2014 and it\u2019s scary and savage in an altogether more disturbing manner. Had any of those chanters considered who beyond the stadium world would feel that chop? It\u2019s a loaded gesture that to some of us can be received as a threat.\n\nAmerican popular culture has long been marked by an absence of empathy for American Indians. Westerns doubled as a campaign against so-called savages in a way that desensitized us to the savages we\u2019d become. You don\u2019t even need to like these movies for their power as propaganda to work on you. Hollywood\u2019s spell was one anybody could fall under, even little Spokane Indian boys, like the writer Sherman Alexie. In a 1998 Los Angeles Times column, the adult Alexie laid out his own cognitive dissonance, in explaining just how John Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Searchers\u201d had ensorcelled him.\n\n\u201cI rooted for John Wayne as he searched for his niece for years and years,\u201d Alexie wrote. \u201cI rooted for John Wayne even though I knew he was going to kill his niece because she had been \u2018soiled\u2019 by the Indians. Hell, I rooted for John Wayne because I understood why he wanted to kill his niece. I hated those savage Indians just as much as John Wayne did.\u201d If that\u2019s the effect westerns could have on an American Indian, imagine the pride a white kid might feel in seeing Wayne, in movie after movie, outrun and defeat assorted Indian tribes, who sometimes weren\u2019t even the main villains so much as existential ones, and were typically played by white actors.\n\nThat\u2019s really what\u2019s vexing. You are what white American English speakers say you are. The young black and Hispanic men who in 1989 were accused of bludgeoning and raping a white woman in Central Park were dubbed the \u201cwolf pack.\u201d The New York Daily News ran a notorious headline about the victim: \u201cWolf Pack\u2019s Prey: Female Jogger Near Death After Savage Attack by Roving Gang.\u201d There, \u201csavage\u201d appears to capture the true barbarity of the crime. But alongside the rest of that animalizing language, it winkingly indicts the accused \u2014 who were teenagers \u2014 not only for being criminals but also for being black. In the media at the time, their blackness was made to seem inextricable from their presumed criminality. (In 2002, all five of their convictions were vacated after a convicted rapist confessed to the attack.)\n\nTo the wider world, the case introduced the word \u201cwilding,\u201d an offshoot of \u201csavage\u201d and an atmospheric description that felt more damning. \u201cEpisodes of poor, minority youths roaming the streets looking for trouble\u201d is how it\u2019s put in the publisher\u2019s description of Natalie Byfield\u2019s 2014 book \u201cSavage Portrayals: Race, Media and the Central Park Jogger Story.\u201d But \u201cwilding\u201d has always struck me less as a descriptor of behavior and more as a presumptive state of mind, a fever. Whatever ugly force seized the young Salem witches in Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cThe Crucible\u201d had supposedly gripped those boys.

Immigrant families apprehended at the southwest border already endure a deeply flawed system in which they can be detained indefinitely. In this immigration system, detainees too often lack adequate access to counsel. But to unnecessarily tear apart families who cross the border to start a better life is immoral.\n\nSadly, such separations are already happening. The Florence Project in Arizona documented 155 such cases by October and other immigrant advocacy organizations report that children are being taken away from their parents. If the secretary orders this practice to be made standard procedure, thousands of families could face unnecessary separation.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s goal is to strong-arm families into accepting deportation to get their children back. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, admitted this when she told the Senate on Jan. 16 that separating families may \u201cdiscourage parents\u201d from seeking refuge in America.\n\nBut the increasing informal use of family separation has not proved to be a deterrent.

Brook Corning, a mechanical engineer, is the one with risk-taking in his genes.\n\nOnce, when Chris was about 9, his father took him backcountry snowboarding. Brook Corning said that he had to sign \u201cabout a billion waivers\u201d before they could go and that he had to strap a beacon onto Chris so the boy could be found in an avalanche. They were also given shovels and probes, in case they needed to dig out.\n\n\u201cWhen we were hiking across a knife\u2019s edge and there were cliffs on both sides, I thought, \u2018Hmm, maybe this really isn\u2019t a good idea,\u2019\u201d Brook Corning said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we had so much fun.

But on an emotional level, what the vet had said made sense. Because of her Cushing\u2019s, Akeela had been panting on and off for months. And the worsening restlessness and circling had to have been taxing for her.\n\nI took Akeela\u2019s death hard. I truly believe that relieving her suffering was the humane thing to do.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut what did Akeela\u2019s end say about my own practice of medicine?\n\nIn contrast to veterinary practice, the medical profession has long forbidden the notion of speeding death. The Hippocratic oath, which dates to Greece in the fifth century B.C., states that a physician must not \u201cadminister a poison to anybody when asked to do so nor \u2026 suggest such a course.\u201d\n\nInstances in which physicians have participated in euthanasia have generally been wholly unethical. These include a program started by Nazi physicians in the 1930s to kill mentally ill and chronically infirm persons and over 100 controversial deaths facilitated in the 1990s by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a pathologist who believed that terminal patients had a right to determine when they died.\n\nThere is one current exception to the prohibition on physicians expediting death: physician aid-in-dying. In six states and Washington, D.C., physicians may legally prescribe medications that terminally ill patients may take when they so wish. Numerous protections are written into these laws, such as making sure that the person is really dying and has full capacity to make decisions.\n\nI could think of stories similar to that of Akeela among my own patients. There was the blind woman who was bedbound, in pain and partially paralyzed from a stroke; another woman was skeletal from metastatic cancer and required constant sedation and analgesia. There have been many more. Some of these patients had explicitly expressed a wish to die, hoping that we doctors might, humanely, \u201cend it all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy experiences with Akeela led me to reflect on these cases. If suffering was so obvious and not reversible, and there was a way to provide immediate relief, was my reflexive refusal to assist in the dying process always the right thing to do? And if the patient, fully understanding all of his or her options, was asking for death, didn\u2019t this make him or her more worthy than a dog, whose suffering could only be assumed? I had little doubt that family members, seeing a loved one suddenly at peace, might have said what our vet said to us: \u201cShe was tired.\u201d\n\nBut in my own practice, I can never countenance euthanasia. Hippocrates\u2019 sentiments from over 2,000 years ago resonate for me. Doctors are in the business of healing bodies, not harming them \u2014 even if that \u201charm\u201d potentially provides relief from the same type of suffering we find unacceptable in our pets.\n\nHaving said this, I am not opposed to telling my patients about physician aid-in-dying. Indeed, were they so inclined and prepared to move to a state where it is legal, I might help them make the transition. And if aid-in-dying became legal in my own state, New York, I would consider making a referral to a physician who might prescribe the necessary drugs.\n\nOf course, for most patients, moving to another state near life\u2019s end is neither desirable nor practical. And in many cases, the process could never be implemented in time. Fortunately, though, there are now better medications to treat the symptoms of dying and a specialty, known as palliative care, that can provide expert guidance in doing so.", "title": "The Death of the Doctor\u2019s Dog", "authors": ["Barron H.

The program was introduced in 2012 by President Barack Obama as a stopgap measure that would shield from deportation people who were brought into the United States as children. The status is renewable, lasting two years at a time. The program does not provide a pathway to citizenship. Participation in the program comes with a range of benefits. Along with permission to remain in the country, recipients can also get work permits, through which many have obtained health insurance from their employers. The ability to work has also allowed them to pay for school, pursue higher education and, in some states, drive legally. The program also opened up access to in-state tuition and state-funded grants and loans in some states. And depending on where they live, recipients can also qualify for state-subsidized health care.\n\nAsk students to answer the following questions as they read:\n\n1. When was DACA introduced, and what benefits does it provide its participants?\n\n2. Who are the Dreamers? What requirements must they meet to be eligible for DACA?\n\n3. Why did President Trump announce in September he was ending DACA?\n\n4. What concessions do the White House and many Republican lawmakers want in exchange for providing a path to citizenship for DACA beneficiaries?\n\n5. Why are many progressives, immigrant advocates and DACA recipients hoping for a \u201cclean\u201d Dream Act, and what would that law offer the Dreamers?\n\n6.

American politics today has as much in common with the developing world as it does with Europe. Time and again, vote-seeking demagogues with few political credentials have swept to power in developing countries by tapping into deep-seated resentment toward a market-dominant minority. President Trump is neither the world\u2019s first \u201ctweeter-in-chief\u201d nor the first head of state to star on a reality TV show. That would be Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela, too, has a market-dominant minority: the light-skinned, insular elite that historically controlled the country\u2019s corporate sector and its staggering oil wealth. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Ch\u00e1vez swept to victory in 1998 on an anti-establishment platform, attacking the mainstream media, the \u201crotten oligarchs\u201d and a slew of \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d He won over millions of the country\u2019s have-nots with unscripted rhetoric that struck elites as vulgar, outrageous and often plainly false. But Venezuela\u2019s majority saw in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez a leader who looked and spoke like them.\n\nSeeing coastal elites as a market-dominant minority is sobering. In my research, I\u2019ve found no examples of countries successfully overcoming this problem. On the contrary, all over the world, when this dynamic takes hold of a nation\u2019s politics, a result has been an erosion of trust in institutions and in electoral outcomes. Countries lurch toward authoritarianism, hate-mongering and an elite backlash against the popular side of democracy.\n\nSigns of all these developments are present in the United States. As to the latter, right before the 2016 election, a book review in The New Yorker discussed \u201cthe case against democracy,\u201d including proposals to impose knowledge tests on voters (something Latin American elites have been writing about for a long time). The review quoted from a book by Jason Brennan, a libertarian political philosopher at Georgetown, who wrote that \u201cexcluding the bottom 80 percent of white voters from voting might be just what poor blacks need.\u201d\n\nThis is not the way forward. If any way out exists, it will have to be both economic and cultural. Restoring upward mobility should be viewed as an emergency. Upward mobility is what made America different from developing countries that have disintegrated. Research shows that zero-sum political tribalism is worst under conditions of economic insecurity and lack of opportunity.\n\nBut the emergence of coastal elites as an insular minority is also rooted squarely in the breakdown of national unity \u2014 in the fracturing of our country into two (or more) Americas in which people from one tribe see others not just as the political opposition, but as immoral, evil and un-American. America desperately needs leaders with the courage to break out of the tribalist cycle, but where are we going to find them?", "title": "Opinion | The Destructive Dynamics of Political Tribalism", "authors": []}

And here\u2019s a plea: Stop these measures from becoming law.\n\nFollowing its approval of the big budget deal on Feb. 9, Congress began writing the dozen appropriations bills that direct federal dollars to specific agencies. These bills are likely to be incorporated in one giant omnibus spending measure to be negotiated over the next few weeks by House and Senate leaders in advance of the March 23 expiration of the continuing budget resolution that has kept the government going.\n\nGiven its urgency, the bill is fertile ground for the kind of mischief the Republicans in particular have been notorious for over the years \u2014 loading up must-pass bills like this one with provisions, known as riders, that in most cases could not survive on their own and thus need protective cover. In years past, such riders were usually inserted at the last minute on the House or Senate floor. Here they are in plain sight, having been approved in earlier votes or endorsed by powerful committee chairmen or chairwomen who will do their level best to make sure they are included in the final bill. Mr. Schumer can prevent that from happening. The Democrats are effectively 49 in number, the Republicans 51. By holding his party together, he can deny the Republicans the 60 votes they need to overcome a filibuster \u2014 ensuring a clean bill, and a cleaner environment.\n\nPublic interest groups have counted nearly 90 of these riders, but here are several of the worst:\n\nClean water In 2015, the Obama administration adopted a landmark rule intended to clarify and broaden protections for smaller streams and wetlands vital to the country\u2019s drinking water and wildlife. Although the bill simply reaffirmed the reach of the original 1972 Clean Water Act, developers and big farmers complained to Scott Pruitt, the industry-friendly head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who has begun the lengthy process of replacing the rule with something more favorable to commercial interests. That\u2019s not fast enough for the leaders of three separate appropriations panels \u2014 in the House, the interior and environment subcommittee and the energy and water development subcommittee; and in the Senate, the interior and environment subcommittee \u2014 who are pushing nearly identical riders that would kill the rule right away, without consulting the public or conducting the scientific analysis required by law.", "title": "Opinion | The Dirty Little Deals That Would Foul the Environment", "authors": []}

It will not do anything to bring our country together, or to end the tensions between the sexes.\n\nMichael Ian Black: 1. Aggression can certainly be a beneficial trait. The flip side of this in your examples are the often debilitating symptoms soldiers, police officers, and firefighters exhibit as a result of their jobs. So many of these men are reluctant to seek help for the simple reason that, for so many men, needing help is the same as being weak, anathema for men.\n\n2. I agree with you that a shooter\u2019s motive cannot be reduced to something as simple as \u201cbeing a man,\u201d nor did I mean to imply so. My larger point is that we need to examine why only men commit these crimes. What is going on with our boys and young men that allows them to walk into a public space and open fire, but not girls and young women? My piece is an attempt to start talking about that question.\n\n3.

But when the unemployment rate was at its post-crisis highs, employers could have their pick of good workers at relatively low prices. Now, with the jobless rate at 4.1 percent, good workers are harder to find. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, companies have been more open to installing technology that may have a significant upfront cost and require reworking how a restaurant is organized, but allow more sales without hiring more workers.\n\n\u201cA consequence of a really tight labor market is a higher turnover rate,\u201d said Liah Luther, marketing manager at Nextep Systems, a Michigan company that sells self-ordering kiosks to restaurants, casinos and corporate facilities. \u201cOnce you eliminate the need for extensive training on a point of sale system, you can focus on soft skills like customer service, and reduce the cost of turnover.\u201d\n\nThe optimistic case for both productivity and overall economic growth goes like this: For the last several years, a lack of demand and plenty of spare capacity of both workers and equipment made businesses complacent and unwilling to invest in new equipment, software or new ways of doing things that might allow more output per hour of labor.\n\nNow, with companies having a harder time finding qualified workers and with demand for their products rising, they\u2019ll have no choice but to re-engineer how they work to try to increase productivity. Higher productivity will in turn make it easier to justify higher wages, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of higher economic growth.\n\nThere are some risks to that rosy forecast, which Ms. Remes and Mr. Manyika warn about.\n\nThey see a great deal of potential from digitization of businesses that have been slow to embrace the lessons of the cutting-edge companies in their industry. But this might be slow to generate the kinds of big productivity gains that are possible.\n\nEven as more retailers adapt to an age of digital commerce and learn from Amazon, for example, they may in the near term end up simply doubling up traditional retail and e-commerce-focused workers, making such companies less productive rather than more.\n\nAnd if automation leads to more income going to owners of capital, who already tend be wealthy, that could hollow out middle-class jobs and fuel higher inequality.", "title": "The Economy Is Getting Hotter.

But the two approaches are more closely related than today\u2019s apostles of scientism often suggest. They proceed from the same intense curiosity, the same desire for understanding through experience \u2014 and personalized experimentation can be the only way to be empirical when your subject is the strange nexus of the self.\n\nEvery human life is, in this sense, a science experiment, and how we choose to react when our assumptions are tested defines the real scope of our curiosity. If you refuse any non-F.D.A.-blessed treatment for chronic illness because there\u2019s no controlled study proving that it works, or have a religious experience and pre-emptively dismiss it as an illusion without seeing what happens if you pray, you may be many things, but you are not really much of an empiricist.\n\nWhich is why in many instances the interests that Pinker dismisses as irrational hugger-mugger, everything from astrology to spiritualism, have tended to strengthen during periods of real scientific ferment. It\u2019s why Isaac Newton loved alchemy and the Victorians loved s\u00e9ances; it\u2019s why charismatic Christianity has spread very naturally with economic development in Africa and Latin America and why the Space Age coincided with the spread of all those health food stores.\n\nIt\u2019s not that there is some quantum of unreason that needs an outlet when reason\u2019s power grows. Rather, it\u2019s that when people and societies are genuinely curious they are very reasonably curious about everything, including things happening in their bodies and their consciousness and more speculative realms.\n\nWhich is why if Pinker and others are genuinely worried about a waning appreciation of the inquiring scientific spirit, they should consider the possibility that some of their own smug secular certainties might be part of the problem \u2014 that they might, indeed, be stifling the more comprehensive kind of curiosity upon which the scientific enterprise ultimately depends.", "title": "Opinion | The Edges of Reason", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "These days at Barbetta, most guests dress casually. On a recent evening, Rick Miramontez, the press agent for \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d and \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway,\u201d sat tie-less in the lounge, something he would not have dared to do when he visited for the first time in 1979. \u201cIt was very dressy, very starched, a necktie place through the \u201980s, no question,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, from its townhouse exterior to its brocade chairs and swag curtains, Barbetta is a throwback to the days of the fancy restaurant. There are no distressed-wood tables, no mixologists or vertical gardens on the premises. How it has managed to stay in business boils down to the realities of commercial real estate, the restaurant\u2019s jewelry-box d\u00e9cor and reputation as an oasis of quiet refinement. And also the constant devotion of Laura Maioglio.\n\nIn the 1960s and \u201970s, besides the chic theatrical types who frequented Barbetta, the restaurant was also part of a high-society dining scene in Midtown that served as the backdrop for a shifting culture. In 1969, for example, Ms. Maioglio had a front row seat to what The Times described as the \u201cpants suit onslaught\u201d \u2014 some establishments had started to permit women in pants, while others did not. One evening, Laura and her mother were refused a table at La C\u00f4te Basque when a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 accused her of wearing pants, which were forbidden. \u201cThey were palazzo pajamas,\u201d she said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even tell they were split; they looked like an evening dress. \u2018Very good,\u2019 my mother said. \u2018We\u2019re going to the Four Seasons.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Maioglios were hospitable to the core. Along with an older brother, Vincenzo, Sebastiano had opened his first restaurant, Maioglio Brothers, on West 39th Street in 1906 when he was a 26-year-old immigrant from Fubine, in Northern Italy (where Ms. Maioglio still owns a small palazzo and vineyard). The original restaurant was near the old Metropolitan Opera House and luminaries who dined there included Enrico Caruso, Giacomo Puccini and Arturo Toscanini.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1925, Mr. Maioglio paid around $250,000 for four contiguous brownstones on West 46th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, built by the Astor family in the latter 1800s. He moved the restaurant to his new collection of buildings and renamed it Barbetta, Italian for \u201clittle beard,\u201d in honor of Vincenzo\u2019s facial hair. His brother died the following year. Laura was reared in an apartment upstairs, in a neighborhood that some maps refer to as Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\n\u201cIt was not Hell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d Ms. Maioglio said heatedly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very ugly term and was not used in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nBarbetta is the oldest restaurant on the block. \u201cAs every retailer and restaurateur knows these days, if you own your property instead of renting it, that\u2019s the significant factor in being able to last in New York City,\u201d said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. \u201cLaura has stuck with her business through enormous odds, the nature of the challenges on that block going from too much drug traffic in the \u201970s and \u201980s to too much car traffic in the last decade.\u201d\n\nIn 1973, when 16 establishments lined that particular strip, Mayor John Lindsay designated it Restaurant Row. Today, more than three dozen restaurants \u2014 stalwarts like Joe Allen, Orso and Becco \u2014 steal some of the spotlight from Barbetta, whose incandescent, vertical sign is made of opal glass. A forerunner of neon, it is the last of its kind in the city, according to the book, \u201cNew York Neon,\u201d by Thomas E. Rinaldi.\n\n\u201cBarbetta itself and Restaurant Row more broadly represent the contrast of tradition and turnover,\u201d Mr. Tompkins said. \u201cTo use an automobile metaphor, Barbetta is a Bentley, whereas Joe Allen is a Range Rover. When you look at the mix of other places on the street, there are five Japanese restaurants and a Bareburger that cater to a new demographic.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite her heritage, Laura Maioglio was not groomed for the restaurant industry. She attended the Brearley School on the Upper East Side and studied art history at Bryn Mawr. Her parents steered her toward cultural pursuits, taking her to Carnegie Hall, to the opera, on trips across America and to Italy.\n\n\u201cMy father was highly intellectual, interested in the arts and music, but his family couldn\u2019t afford to give him a university education,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think running a restaurant would satisfy me. Nevertheless, I was very determined and naughty.\u201d\n\nHer strong will came into full force when her father became ill. In the early 1960s, she went behind his back to beg a buyer to renege on a deal he\u2019d made to take over Barbetta. She couldn\u2019t bear to see it leave the family.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHow could you have done this?\u201d was the only criticism Laura heard from her ailing father when he learned she\u2019d scuttled the transaction.\n\n\u201cUntil the middle of the 20th century, nearly all restaurants were owned and run by individuals, or families, as opposed to companies,\u201d said William Grimes, a former New York Times reporter and the author of \u201cAppetite City: A Culinary History of New York.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only in our own time that we have seen the corporatization of the restaurant business and the rise of upscale operations like the Union Square Hospitality Group.\u201d\n\nOnce Ms. Maioglio had saved the family business, she set to work refurbishing the interior, scouring Italy for chandeliers and antiques and ordering reproductions of upholstered chairs she saw in museums. What began as a handsome, inexpensive restaurant became a haute experience emphasizing the Piedmont region and its prized Barolo and Barbaresco wines. She reimagined the backyard as an Italianate garden. A fairy-tale wisteria tree of tangled vines is nearly big enough to camouflage a cast of \u201cInto the Woods.\u201d At the center is a fountain where four peeing cherubs sit astride the rim.\n\nNow in its 112th year, Barbetta is one of the city\u2019s oldest family-owned Italian restaurants and certainly the oldest second-generation, family-owned Italian restaurant. Bamonte\u2019s, in Williamsburg, is a little older, founded in 1900, but the fourth generation is now dominant.\n\nThere is no third generation waiting to take over at Barbetta. Ms. Maioglio and her husband, G\u00fcnter Blobel, who won the 1999 Nobel Prize in Medicine, have no children.\n\nMs. Maioglio won\u2019t disclose her age. \u201cAge is a number and mine is unlisted\u201d is her line. On a night in late December, she wore a black and white patterned dress, gold Adidas sneakers and a jaunty beret over silver hair that fell past her shoulders. A walking stick was propped nearby. At intervals, she greeted passing guests \u2014 largely out-of-towners \u2014 with a nod and a genial \u201cbuona sera.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Throughout the restaurant and its four private dining rooms are original fireplaces, detailed woodwork and massive mirrors fit for the Royal House of Savoy. A computer is on the premises but so is carbon paper for making copies.\n\nFor cash transactions at the bar, Konstantinos Hristeas, known as Gus, springs open the drawer of a brass cash register built in 1912. He wears a black bow tie and white dinner jacket and said that he has been a bartender there for 38 years, or maybe 42.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t pay attention, time goes by,\u201d Mr. Hristeas, 69, said.\n\nHis manner was reserved but his eyes kindled when he recalled his teenage hunger for night life, climbing out the window of his home in Kalamata, Greece, to see his friends. He never wanted to become a baker, like his father, and he followed a sister to New York in the 1960s, when he was 18. He landed a job at El Morocco, the fabled nightclub on East 54th Street. As far as he knows, he is the only ex-staffer still on his feet.\n\n\u201cYou went there to be seen and photographed,\u201d said Mr. Grimes, the reporter. \u201cA dazzling array of film stars, entertainers, socialites, sports figures \u2014 notables of all sorts \u2014 made it their mission to sit on the zebra banquettes and strike a pose.\u201d\n\nBy comparison, Barbetta is quiet and sedate. When Mr. Hristeas sees celebrities, they pass him by on their way to the dining room.\n\nAt El Morocco, Frank Sinatra was one of his regulars. Mr. Hristeas recalled one night when Sinatra, known for his \u201c$100, $150 tips,\u201d asked a manager how much he\u2019d have to pay for a certain crystal object on display. The manager set a price, Sinatra paid, then shattered it at the table. He removed something from the center of the broken glass, Mr. Hristeas said, and set it on fire. It was an image of Ava Gardner, one of Sinatra\u2019s ex-wives.", "title": "The Elegant Relic of Restaurant Row", "authors": ["Julie Besonen"]}

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "The variety of baskets in the world \u2014 with their distinct shapes and materials and techniques and uses \u2014 is endless. In the way that history can be told in words, so too can it be read through craft \u2014 objects ingeniously fashioned out of necessity from whatever was on hand. Almost any plant whose parts are pliable, or can be made so by soaking in water \u2014 including roots, vines, pine needles, grasses, stems, even trees \u2014 can be turned into a basket. Broad materials, such as palms in the tropics, are plaited like braids; narrow materials, such as grasses on the Savannah, are coiled like ceramic pots; while stiffer materials, such as willow in the lowlands, are woven like tapestry. Trade, migration and war have meant that techniques and styles spread and have often mingled. There is a beautiful spiral weave done in Burkina Faso that somehow made its way to the Dordogne in Southern France, where it was used for garden baskets. In South Carolina, the Gullah, descendants of slaves, made sweetgrass baskets using a coiling technique brought from West Africa by their ancestors.\n\nPhoto\n\nFew places in the world, however, have as enormous a variety of basketry as England. Most are made of willow, a wonder material that is at once flexible, lightweight, strong, endlessly renewable and easy to cultivate. (Cut the tree to the ground and it will resprout; push a branch into the earth and it will take root.) In the way that Eskimos have 50 or so words for \u201csnow,\u201d the British have nearly 200 for their baskets. There were seven different types for the herring trade alone: for trapping, for sorting, for holding ice, and one, the quarter cran, made to precise government specifications as a measure for pricing. Each particular need \u2014 whether agricultural, industrial or domestic \u2014 would be resolved by a basket uniquely configured for the task. Well into the first half of the 20th century in Britain, there were wicker prams and mail carts; butcher delivery baskets (distinct from bakery baskets); carriers for messenger pigeons and ammunition drops; and containers for broadcasting seed and hauling brick.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe tend to think of basketry as a rural endeavor, which it mostly was until the 1800s, when Britain began to rapidly urbanize. Industrialization, rather than signaling basketry\u2019s demise, heralded a peak, as baskets were required to service the factories and towns. Basket-making became professionalized and specialized, with weavers \u2014 distinguished for the first time from growers, preparers, salespeople and repairmen \u2014 laboring side by side in workshops. This new breed of journeymen weaver underwent five to seven years of apprenticeship; each became proficient at many different baskets (sometimes over a thousand if you include all the variations). But during World War I, cheaper baskets imported from poorer countries, as well as wooden crates, were becoming more readily available; and by the 1960s, the English basketry industry collapsed under the weight of plastic.\n\nOf course, industry demands efficiency, but along with basketry\u2019s diminishment comes the disappearance of the enormous breadth of knowledge embodied in those weavers. Just two of the men (they were all men) who trained under that 19th-century system \u2014 Colin Manthorpe, 80, and Terry Bensley, 79 \u2014 are still alive. They are sought out by some of today\u2019s best makers, such as Adrian Charlton and Hilary Burns. The Devon-based Burns recalls that observing Manthorpe weave a herring cran was like \u201cwatching a dance; there was no wasted movement.\u201d Despite the loss of this know-how, what had already vanished long before was something more profound, namely, the connection of a maker to his landscape, and the life that entails.\n\nPhoto\n\nAFTER THE LEAVES drop from the willow, in January and February, O\u2019Sullivan and McWalter, along with a few friends who have come to love these yearly outings, head into the cold, wet field to harvest the rods with secateurs, or pruning shears. It is physically demanding work, both the cutting and the stacking, as well as the carrying of the heavy bundles, and yet \u201cit is easy to sound nostalgic,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says. \u201cThere is this gentle connection to the land \u2014 and to one another. In the midst of the drudgery, which it is, you look up at blue sky or birds or you have a cup of tea. You pass each other and have an intense conversation for 15 minutes, and then you drift apart, and after a while you lose each other completely in the tall willow, and then you find your way back to one another.\u201d\n\nBetween March and May, the willow is sorted by variety and size and left to dry. On the short path between kitchen door and studio is the open shed where these satisfyingly neat bundles of willow \u2014 yellow, lime green, mocha, black \u2014 are leaning. After soaking the reeds for a day or two, O\u2019Sullivan begins her work on the floor, using her knee or foot to hold the rods in places as she creates a base. Pushing long pieces in all around it, each of which she scores with a knife and bends upright to form the structure, she builds every basket stick by stick.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan\u2019s decision to fashion her life in this way is a choice that a country basket-maker in the past would not have had the luxury of making. Steeped as her work is in tradition, it is driven by her design sensibility (she invents her own forms), and her desire to live lightly on the land in an increasingly imperiled environment. A basket\u2019s perishability is part of its beauty \u2014 it will last a few lifetimes before disappearing back into the ground. Until then, \u201cI want these baskets to become part of people\u2019s lives, to get battered, to be polished by their hands,\u201d she says, \u201cand to have crumbs and bits of wood in the bottom of them.\u201d", "title": "The Enduring Appeal of: Baskets", "authors": ["Deborah Needleman"]}

Today, Latin America is dependent on hydropower for about half of all energy generation, and changing rainfall patterns caused by climate change are making hydroelectric power more unreliable in some countries.\n\nIn 2001, Brazil experienced a severe drought that led to a drop in water levels at hydroelectric dams, leaving millions of people and businesses without electricity for months. In 2016, Colombia imposed emergency energy-saving measures to avoid blackouts after a major drought. That same year, Venezuela experienced a drought that dried up the supply of water for the main generation basin in the Caroni River.\n\nIf current trends hold, electricity sector emissions of carbon dioxide, the largest source of greenhouse gases, will increase by 19 percent and other dangerous air pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen will grow by over 50 percent between 2016 and 2030. But if the region expands renewable energy and grid integration, electricity sector carbon emissions will drop by 15 percent and other contaminants by 10 percent.\n\nStill, energy integration in Latin America is woefully inadequate. The region needs to add about 12,000 kilometers of cross-border transmission lines with about 15,000 kilowatts of power to take full advantage of its potential. But the principal obstacle standing in the way is political.\n\nMost countries are reluctant to rely on their neighbors for energy, deeming self-sufficiency more important than cost, reliability and sustainability. Rather than pursuing this narrow view of energy security, Latin American countries should embrace the advantages of electricity diversification by interconnecting.\n\nIn addition to building the physical infrastructure, many countries need to develop the right institutions, rules and regulations to enable liquid and efficient electricity markets.\n\nCentral America, for example, would greatly benefit from expanding its regional grid, given the isthmus\u2019s high electricity prices and reliance on imported oil. To encourage investment, the regional electricity market\u2019s regulatory framework must be strengthened. This includes determining the cost of transmission rights and tolls for sending electricity across borders, setting up long-term power purchase agreements on the regional market to provide more security for multicountry investments and unifying national and regional regulations.\n\nWhile these steps are technically and economically feasible, they require governments to challenge vested interests and relinquish some control over their national power systems. This is not easy to do, but an integrated energy grid would be good for Latin America and for the planet.", "title": "Opinion | The Energy Solution Latin America Needs", "authors": []}

Perhaps corporate income tax cuts and looser regulation on business will unleash more capital investment and higher productivity, as conservatives argue. Maybe some of the millions of prime-age adults who have dropped out of the labor force in recent years will come back in, creating more economic potential.\n\n\u201cThe really big question mark we have is how much slack there really is in the economy,\u201d said Donald Marron, a scholar at the Urban Institute who was once acting director of the Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIf you look at conventional measures, unemployment looks really low, but on the other hand if you look back to what we used to think of the potential of the economy a few years ago, we may have some room to grow.\u201d\n\nThe Long Run: Higher Debt-Service Costs and Less Room to Maneuver\n\nThe public debt was already on track to rise relative to the size of the economy before the new tax and spending deals; now it will probably rise faster. The Congressional Budget Office projected last June that the nation\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio would rise to 91 percent in 2027, from 77 percent in 2017.\n\nThe C.B.O. hasn\u2019t updated those numbers to reflect the new tax and spending legislation, but the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that it will turn out to be between 99 and 109 percent, depending on whether provisions of the tax law are allowed to expire as they are scheduled to.\n\nBut those numbers are just an abstraction. The question is what effects higher debt loads might have for Americans in 2027 and beyond.\n\nHigher debt service costs are one big one. Taxpayers in 2027 were forecast to pay $818 billion a year in interest costs even before the tax cuts and spending increases, or 2.4 percent of G.D.P. That will presumably be higher, because taxpayers will be paying interest costs on more debt, and probably at higher interest rates.\n\nAnd there is probably some point at which the amount of debt the government takes on crowds out private investment; to the degree that the supply of funds to borrow is finite, every dollar the government borrows is not available to be lent to a homeowner taking out a mortgage or a business looking to expand. That said, in practice, the supply of loanable funds is not finite \u2014 households may save more with higher interest rates, for example, and foreign capital might flow in.", "title": "The Era of Fiscal Austerity Is Over.

Behind these moves runs a concerted and dangerous rewriting of history to create a narrative of heroic Polish victimhood \u2014 under the Nazis and Communists, of course, but also as a maligned defender of traditional values against a degenerate and controlling European Union.\n\nThere is more than a little irony in the way Poland has turned on the European Union. Billions in the union\u2019s funds have been used to build Poland\u2019s highways and roads, sewage systems, kindergartens and other facilities. Poland\u2019s exports, largely to other member countries, have boomed, and young Poles travel and work all across Europe. The countryside, where support for Law and Justice is particularly strong, has been among the biggest recipients of the union\u2019s largess. Biting the hand that feeds it is a gentle way of putting it.\n\nNonetheless, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the real power behind Law and Justice, has built his populist appeal on resisting what he describes as the European Union\u2019s effort to dictate cosmopolitan cultural terms (and immigrant quotas). To portray the bloc\u2019s policies as oppressive is ludicrous, but as Steven Erlanger and Marc Santora of The Times recently wrote, Law and Justice has thrived on contrasting a \u201cconservative, Catholic Poland and its family values with a godless, freethinking, gender-bending Western Europe.\u201d\n\nThere has always been a dollop of victimhood in the Polish national narrative, largely for sound reasons, given Poland\u2019s history of partitions.

These women were absolutely pro-sex, pro-pleasure and pro-freedom. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to learn to sleep with people because we want them,\u201d one woman said in a consciousness-raising session transcribed by the author of \u201cThe Dialectic of Sex,\u201d Shulamith Firestone, in 1968. \u201cNot to prove anything to them, not to make them feel better about their masculinity, not out of weakness or inability to say no, but simply because we want to.\u201d\n\nBut they also understood that if rape and harassment were political, so was bad sex. In a 1980 essay, the radical feminist Alix Kates Shulman remembered that in those early sessions, \u201csex was a central and explosive subject to which we continually returned\u201d; feminists \u201cused their sexual discontents to help them understand the power relations between men and women.\u201d\n\nI was reminded of this history when the website Babe published its Aziz Ansari article in January. The account of the so-called bad date, during which Mr. Ansari is alleged to have badgered a woman into going further than she wanted to, was an example of reckless reporting and was cited by many as #MeToo\u2019s too-far moment. But the instinct that it was an important article was correct. The issue of consensual yet joyless and unsatisfying sex was the same one my mom and her friends were grappling with 50 years ago.\n\nAt bottom, #MeToo is not about hashtags or individual firings. It\u2019s a chance to reset the table of sexual politics \u2014 not by infantilizing women or declaring a war on flirting or administering litmus tests, but by continuing a decades-long push for true equality in the bedroom, for a world in which women are not intimidated or coerced into sex but are also not stuffed into the role of gatekeepers.\n\nFor such a movement, the history of Second Wave pro-sex feminism should serve as both North Star and cautionary tale. Ultimately, the arguments of these women got swallowed up by the more coherent, consistent narrative of sexual conservatism, and later by a largely depoliticized version of pro-sex feminism that presented hot-pink dildos as the key to liberation. One reason this might have happened is that amid these conversations, men were at best ancillary and at worst demonized, an understandable impulse in the 1970s, when the most basic feminist ideas were scary and radical. \u201cA free woman needs a free man,\u201d a woman said in a rare moment of clarity during that same 1968 consciousness-raising session.\n\nBut there may be a deeper reason this history has been obscured. In a 1982 essay, my mother admits that a misstep of the early pro-sex feminists was \u201cthe failure to put forward a convincing alternative analysis of sexual violence, exploitation and alienation.\u201d\n\nThe burgeoning movement, in other words, didn\u2019t make a compelling enough argument for freeing women\u2019s sexuality rather than tamping down men\u2019s, a distinction that makes clear the connection between bad sex and rape culture, between Harvey Weinstein\u2019s monster and Aziz Ansari\u2019s Everyman. Instead, just a few years later, protection from violence became the narrow, defensive definition of feminist sexual politics, and the concept of pleasure became synonymous with narcissism and self-indulgence.\n\nThis is the time to rectify all that. Condemning a culture that excuses sexual assault and harassment isn\u2019t about weakness and victimhood. It\u2019s about what my mom, who died in 2006, scrawled on a pamphlet from the famous 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality, which she mailed to me while I was toiling on my thesis.

When that happens, the game changes.\n\nGiving people with serious deficits a way to master the crucial facets of daily existence would certainly be a medical advance.\n\nBut giving them, and others, a more vivid and deeper reach into the vast pool of what they already know \u2014 well, there are angels and demons buried there, in addition to facts and names.\n\nThat will be a real-life screenplay we should all watch carefully.", "title": "The First Step Toward a Personal Memory Maker?", "authors": ["Benedict Carey"]}

These bleats of discovery can be exciting, at least for those of us who thrill to the sense of opportunity afforded by the next new thing in food. Cooking, after all, is alchemy, the transformation of base materials into something valuable and rare. Who wouldn\u2019t want to know the latest incantations?\n\nBut it can be equally magical sometimes, particularly in restaurants, to eat in ignorance and bliss, to not be told anything at all about the food on your plate \u2014 unless of course you are a food obsessive and need to know why it tastes so good. So it was on a recent night when I ate a little packet of bluefish steamed in red chard at Houseman, the Manhattan restaurant of the chef Ned Baldwin. Let me be clear right from the start: Steamed bluefish was not a promising order. People in restaurants tend to like their fish crisp at the edges, at the very least, not steamed. They like it white-fleshed and flaky, not dark and oily, beneath a soft carapace of vegetable matter.\n\nBut Baldwin\u2019s fish was fantastic, almost exploding with flavor: briny, buttery-rich, silky-salty, with a powerful roundness barely checked by the sweetness of the chard that surrounded it. Its preparation haunted me for days, and eventually I broke down and asked Baldwin how he made it. \u201cIt\u2019s dulse butter that does it,\u201d he said, laughing: a compound of unsalted butter and the ground, dried sea lettuce that has been harvested on the coast of Ireland and the shores of the North Atlantic for centuries (the word itself is Gaelic in origin). He said he smears each fillet with the stuff before wrapping it in the chard and cooking it slowly in the oven, flipping the packets often, to keep the meat moist.\n\nPhoto\n\nI started cooking with dulse all the time. Particularly now, when the farm stands near my home are bleak and largely empty, I use dulse (and butter too) to impart big flavor to my cooking, with no one the wiser. I use it as Baldwin does, to anoint fillets of cod and tautog, porgy and weakfish. I use it as a dipping sauce, for steamed clams, and as a medium in which to warm bay scallops before serving them with toast. And I love it particularly in this chowder of root-cellar vegetables, clams and fish, one of the easiest and best things to cook for a winter weekend meal. Using a dulse butter at the base of the soup, for the fat in which I saut\u00e9 the vegetables before deglazing them, makes each individual flavor in the resulting chowder pop, distinctly and with bright effect, from carrot to leek, parsnip to potato, bacon to clam to scallop to fish.\n\nAnd I think there is no reason to explain to anyone why this is the case, how the powdered seaweed acts as a flavor enhancer, how it contains a natural version of monosodium glutamate, how it\u2019s harvested off rocks at the bottom of the tide: dulse, Palmaria palmata, bounty of the sea. In part that is because I prefer the magic of the meal to the explanation of the trick that makes it. And in part it is because like a lot of us I cook for children and sometimes people who act like children, for those who quail at the new, at the odd, at the unfamiliar, the poorly branded, the strange. Seaweed people know this well. There\u2019s no reason to court questions. They don\u2019t say they cook with dulse. They just cook.\n\nRecipe: Seafood Chowder", "title": "The Flavor Enhancer You Don\u2019t Need to Tell Anyone About", "authors": ["Sam Sifton"]}

Meanwhile, historians have described 1848 as a turning point where history somehow failed to turn: At the end of the day the old, corrupt regimes were still standing.\n\nI nevertheless find the surge of indignation now building in America hugely encouraging. And yes, I think it\u2019s all one surge. The #MeToo movement, the refusal to shrug off the Parkland massacre, the new political activism of outraged citizens (many of them women) all stem from a common perception: namely, that it\u2019s not just about ideology, but that far too much power rests in the hands of men who are simply bad people.\n\nAnd Exhibit A for that proposition is, of course, the tweeter in chief himself.\n\nAt the same time, what strikes me about the reaction to this growing backlash is not just its vileness, but its lameness.

By the 1980s, The New York Times was printing recipes for it, and the preferred first course of restaurants in southern France had made its way to New York power-lunch spots. But could Beard have ever anticipated crudit\u00e9s as sculpture or terrarium? What we once ate begrudgingly now makes us gawk, even swoon \u2014 and we pay handsomely for it. So have raw vegetables changed, or have we?\n\nPhoto\n\nTHE HUMAN BRAIN is a hungry beast. Scientists have calculated that our earliest ancestors would have had to eat raw vegetables nonstop for nine hours a day just to fuel it. For early humans with limited tools, a vegetarian diet just wasn\u2019t efficient. The tipping point in evolution came some two and a half million years ago, when our distant progenitors started consuming more meat; over time, their brains grew bigger. Perhaps we absorbed this lesson too well. Vegetables, despite their nutritional value, have long been a sideshow for much of our species. (Certainly in the West; countries in Asia and Africa have longstanding produce-eating traditions, due in part to the intersections of climate and religion.) Ancient Romans ate a kind of ur-salad, the word derived from the Latin for salt, with which lettuces were brined. But by the 16th century, the English Tudors were obliterating them in long-simmered stews.\n\nThere have always been mavericks who disapproved of eating meat, like Saint Catherine of Siena who, in the 14th century, disavowed all food but raw vegetables. The American minister Sylvester Graham, in 1830s Massachusetts, likewise denounced meat as devilish, devising a diet centered on Graham bread (his forerunner to the Graham cracker and that other form of perdition, s\u2019mores). A decade later in that state, Amos Bronson Alcott founded a vegan commune called Fruitlands with nine adults and five children, including his 10-year-old daughter, the future novelist Louisa May Alcott. They favored raw vegetables so as not to cook away the plants\u2019 \u201clife force.\u201d By winter the experiment was over: The Alcotts had to be sheltered and fed by neighbors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNonetheless, toward the end of the 19th century, vegetables started gaining space on American tables, as such then-exotics as olives and celery began to be imported from warmer climates. Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1905 expos\u00e9 of the meatpacking industry, \u201cThe Jungle,\u201d was intended to radicalize the public against free-market capitalism, but instead inspired many to shun meat. (\u201cI aimed at the public\u2019s heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach,\u201d he wrote.) Interest in vegetables waned during the two world wars, when meat was so scarce it was coveted as a luxury. (Hitler\u2019s reputation for being a vegetarian didn\u2019t do much for the cause.)\n\nBut with the rise of the counterculture in the 1960s came a rejection of factory-farming and a longing to realign our relationship with nature. The Berkeley chef Alice Waters opened Chez Panisse in 1971 as a canteen for her activist friends; now she\u2019s an \u00e9minence grise of sustainable agriculture, and her once fringe vision \u2014 in which the choice of what to eat is as much political as it is personal \u2014 is mainstream, if not yet fully realized.\n\nPhoto\n\nTODAY\u2019S RESURGENCE OF crudit\u00e9s is, then, largely an outgrowth of the farm-to-table movement and its obsession with provenance, which anointed small farms as brand names and their products as premium goods. We fetishize turnips with stems still attached, twists of carrot ending in long wispy threads, cucumbers with rutted, pitted surfaces.\n\nStill, for all the pious injunctions to \u201crespect the ingredient,\u201d the crux of crudit\u00e9s remains the dip. The Italian version is bagna cauda, literally a \u201chot bath\u201d of olive oil and anchovies, while the Swiss favor cheese fondue, turning vegetables into vessels of texture. In perhaps the greatest impudence, at the idiosyncratic San Francisco supper club Lazy Bear, diners receive a crock of bone marrow fondue, while Vicia takes a meta approach, pairing root vegetables with pesto made from their leaves.\n\nPerhaps what crudit\u00e9s offer is a corrective to the recent frenzy for meat and fat, when foie gras was piped into doughnuts and menus were stocked with slabs of pork belly. (While gardening has increased \u2014 a third of American households now grow their own vegetables \u2014 so have domestic sales of pork, up 20 percent since 2011.) Indeed, in the hunter-gatherer hierarchy, the rewards of hunting have always taken precedence over those of gathering: Meat is a main course and vegetables an addendum, even in our current phase of celebrating crudit\u00e9s. Both roles demand intimate knowledge of the land, but stalking an animal and taking its life means going out into the world, while picking berries in the woods or tending a garden is domestic (that is, women\u2019s) work, and valued less. The advent of the New Nordic food movement upended this by glamorizing foraging as a form of hunting, seeking out never-known corners of the wild.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSo it\u2019s worth noting that these haute crudit\u00e9s tend to pop up at expensive restaurants run by white male chefs. It takes a certain amount of confidence, even privilege, to ask diners to pay as much as $40 for some vegetables, whether slapped on a board or meticulously arranged with tweezers. Because no matter the display, the vegetables are meant to taste like they\u2019ve just been separated from the ground, and in that case, why do we need a chef at all? Michael Gallina, the chef of Vicia, argues that crudit\u00e9s are a form of advocacy: He wants diners to taste \u201cthe care that goes into growing\u201d the vegetables, in soil that has been taken \u201cout of production for weeks or months\u201d to return nutrients to it, at a sacrifice of \u201cgrowing crops that can earn top dollar.\u201d\n\nFramed like this, raw vegetables are no less luxury goods than dry-aged steaks. The closer they cleave to their origins, the more valuable they are. What they offer is that most elusive of qualities: honesty. Their beauty comes entirely from within; it can\u2019t be enhanced or faked. That\u2019s both a comfort and a rarity in a world dominated by the ersatz and the airbrushed, of novelty food trends like rainbow-dyed bagels and super-size soup dumplings, or sci-fi kitchen experiments involving mortadella foam and edible balloons. Gallina says that Naked Vegetables is \u201cone of the riskiest dishes we serve \u2014 and the one that makes us most proud.\u201d\n\nThe most exciting chefs don\u2019t just please us; they teach us something. They introduce new ingredients, flavors and possibilities, or reframe forgotten ones. I still remember, from more than a decade ago \u2014 long before any of these iced, overgrown bowls of radishes and asparagus appeared \u2014 a dinner at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., which began with carrots from the farm surrounding the restaurant, pierced into a row of nails on a wooden block. The spikes looked sharp and dangerous, like something out of \u201cSpartacus,\u201d and I wondered if the carrots could compete. But when I plucked one and took a bite, it tasted of half-fulfilled sweetness and turned earth, like no carrot I\u2019d ever known. At the same time, it was just a carrot, and suddenly that was enough.", "title": "The Golden Age of Crudit\u00e9s", "authors": ["Ligaya Mishan", "Food Matters"]}

It\u2019s typically less expensive , and a road trip offers more flexibility in terms of schedule. Travelers can relax, leave at the last minute, and discover historical sites, local cuisine, museums, shopping, hiking, festivals and theme parks along the way.\n\n\u200bDespite taking shorter trips, people nonetheless want to roam as far away as possible. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to spend the night any closer than eight hours from home,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. And the trip has to have multiple overnight stops\u200b with activities and attractions\u200b, \u201cnot just Grandma\u2019s house,\u201d he said. For example, Mr. Cohen said retirees typically visit family during their road trips, but most of the time they stay elsewhere.\n\nFrom the inception of the vacation, to the miles logged along the way, social media is a comparatively new aspect of the road trip. In the last four years MMGY has observed the role of social media in recording and sharing travel experiences explode, mainly among millennials. The percentage of people who say they post vacation photos on social media to make friends and family jealous has doubled over the last four years \u2014 \u201cwe believe that one\u2019s grossly understated,\u201d Mr. Cohen added \u2014 as has the number of people who use social media to record their travel experiences.\n\n\u200bInstagram and the like aside, road-tripping is among the few travel trends today not being, er, driven by millennials. Boomers are the largest group of road-trippers (followed by Generation Xers ), and for them, it seems there\u2019s some element of nostalgia. For millennials, the appeal of the road trip is often economical, though for many, and for a number of Generation Xers, life experiences like road trips matter more than shiny new things, according to MMGY. How people choose where to travel was something of a surprise to Mr. Cohen, who reasonably figured that the first thing most people do when planning a vacation is to decide where to go. Turns out, less than half the people he studied do that. Instead, he said, people tend to say \u201cHere\u2019s what I want to do, now where can I do it?\u201d For millennials it may be, \u201cI have this much money, where can I best spend it?\u201d There isn\u2019t just one type of road-tripper with a single set of goals. And road-tripping is unlikely to experience another dramatic rise.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just keep skyrocketing,\u201d Mr. Cohen said\u200b\u200b. But he expects to see modest growth\u200b this year\u200b as Americans\u200b \u2014 retirees, young families, millennials, Generation Xers without children \u2014 continue rolling on.", "title": "The Great American Road Trip: Shorter and More Popular Than Ever", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "On Monday night, Carter Page was finally ready for his Fox News close-up. It had been nearly a year since he began his one-man public-relations offensive to rebut accusations that, as a Trump campaign adviser, he colluded with Russia. He had appeared numerous times on CNN, MSNBC and the networks, typically opposite their star anchors. Unlike almost everyone else caught up in the Trump-Russia scandal, Page was not only willing to submit to public questions; he would even answer them. Though he didn\u2019t bring much clarity to his role, the appearances did make for great, albeit surreal, television. Like the time he insisted to Anderson Cooper that his conversation with the Russian ambassador during the Republican National Convention was not actually a \u201cmeeting.\u201d \u201cAnderson,\u201d Page explained, \u201ca great analogy is you and I were members of the same health club here in New York previously. And I remember walking by you, even though we didn\u2019t know each other, and I said, \u2018Hi, Anderson,\u2019 and you said hello, and we, you know, had a nice little exchange for half a second. Now, does that to you constitute a meeting?\u201d\n\nBut for all the media stardom these and other interviews brought Page, he had been essentially given a cold shoulder by Fox News; he hadn\u2019t appeared on the network since a few cameos in March and April. When I met with Page late last year for a story for the magazine, his absence from Fox\u2019s airwaves seemed to gnaw at him even more than the considerable distance that Trump\u2019s advisers had sought to put between him and the president. After all, Page understood why Trump wouldn\u2019t want to be associated with him: Page viewed himself, as he put it last year, \u201cthe biggest embarrassment surrounding the campaign.\u201d But Fox was another matter. Considering how roughly he was treated by the mainstream media, he assumed that Fox would have come to his aid. Besides, Page\u2019s father was a devoted Fox viewer, and it would have been nice if he could have watched his son on his favorite shows.\n\nSo it was understandable why Page\u2019s wide, goofy smile was even wider and goofier than usual on Monday night when he appeared on Laura Ingraham\u2019s prime-time show on Fox News. Page was there to give his first interview since House Republicans, three days earlier, released a memo, written by Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee, alleging that the F.B.I. had improperly spied on Page in an attempt to harm Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cCarter, it\u2019s good to see you tonight,\u201d Ingraham told Page, teeing up a softball. \u201cI know you have not spoken out about this House Intel memo yet or the reaction to it.

What she was trying to overcome was something ghostlier, something harder to catch and release, which is the nagging feeling that when huge numbers of people think of Lindsey Jacobellis, they see a blooper, not a champion.\n\nShe knew the questions were coming because she faced them in 2010, when she fell short again, and in 2014, when it happened a third time. Certainly, her reward for remaining atop her sport as the 2018 Winter Games approached was to be asked them all again.\n\nThe biggest difference this time, besides the experience and wisdom that come with four more years, is that Jacobellis has Shull. Their pairing was the idea of Peter Foley, the longtime United States snowboard cross head coach.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s had a bad experience with the Olympics, and in a lot of ways she dreads the Olympics now,\u201d Foley said. \u201cIt would be nice if she could feel better about it.\u201d\n\nShull\u2019s purpose is to see if a new mind-set can make the difference between gold and disappointment. And as much as it frustrates Jacobellis to be reminded of it all, internally she has embraced Shull\u2019s unusual advice: Do not try to put 2006 out of your mind, because that is impossible. Even in the starting gate, even in a gold medal race, if the thoughts creep to the memory of a long-ago fall, not the gauzy vision of the medal stand, seize them.\n\n\u201cWhat you want athletes to do is say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cBecause they all are. And if they say it, they can use it. If they try to set it aside, it\u2019s lurking around them, interrupting what they normally know how to do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get our most ambitious projects, stories and analysis delivered to your inbox every week.

To Shull, to pretend that negativity does not exist is as ridiculous as children holding hands over their ears and shouting \u201cnuh-nuh-nuh-nuh\u201d to avoid hearing what is being said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe results have been promising. Jacobellis, a 10-time gold medalist in boardercross at the X Games (which discontinued the event in 2017), won her fifth world championship last March and the first two World Cup events this season. She has reasserted herself as the favorite heading into the Olympics.\n\n\u201cHopefully these are all small positive steps, moving forward, that could potentially have things line up for me right for this one,\u201d Jacobellis said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u2018I Want You Screaming\u2019\n\nJacobellis and Shull mostly talk from distant time zones. They have met in person only a few times. They may be the odd couple of the Olympics.\n\nShull hails from the financial world, having made a living as a trader and trading desk manager. But a deep interest in psychology (her master\u2019s thesis at the University of Chicago was on the neurobiology of Freud\u2019s Repetition Compulsion Theory) had her thinking about mind games on Wall Street, where the general rule is to take emotion out of decision making.\n\nShe began coaching traders and fund managers about harnessing and using emotion, leading to the book \u201cMarket Mind Games,\u201d the founding of a consulting agency called the ReThink Group and appearances on business-related networks like CNBC.\n\nClients, she said, told her that her unusual views on confronting emotion, not ignoring it, helped with out-of-work diversions, too, like golf. A trading desk manager in Asia, Shull said, raced cars as a hobby, and one particularly fear-inducing turn on a racetrack consistently ruined his time.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018O.K., as you go into that turn, I want you screaming in that car that you are terrified,\u2019 \u201d Shull said. \u201cWhat do you think happened? Fastest time ever. Coaches might have a heart attack if they heard a racer say that \u2014 literally, \u2018I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified, I\u2019m terrified.\u2019 But the chances that they win have gone way up. That contracts the energy in a way it becomes fuel. It focuses the energy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA colleague had a connection to the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, and Shull espoused her theories to coaches at a meeting in 2016. Afterward, she was approached by Foley. I think I have a client for you, he said: Lindsey Jacobellis.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know her,\u201d Shull said. \u201cSo I Googled her.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nShe learned that Jacobellis grew up in Connecticut and, as a teenager, was an up-and-coming racer in the burgeoning sport of boardercross, where a pack of riders leaves the gate at once and navigates a high-speed roller coaster of a course, racing to the bottom amid the occasional carnage of collisions and crash landings.\n\nHer rise was timed perfectly. She was 20 when snowboard cross, as the Olympics called it, made its Olympic debut in 2006. Jacobellis was anointed, predictably, as a made-for-television sweetheart in a must-see new event, a favorite with cascading ringlets of blond hair and a smile that masked her competitive muscle.\n\nThen, in a moment, she became better known for falling than she would have for winning, the butt of jokes and even the target of animosity. She never really understood it. She tried to smile it away, but strangers seemed more bothered by the fall than she did. Wherever she went, the episode and the questions \u2014 How? Why? \u2014 followed her like a plume of snow.\n\nThe 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, were considered a chance at redemption, but Jacobellis swerved off course in a semifinal heat and missed the final. In 2014, in Sochi, Russia, she was leading a semifinal heat when she stumbled on a set of late-race rollers and missed the final again.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has to do with the Olympics,\u201d she said that day in Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s just on a fluke of when things work out for me and when they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHer longtime teammate Faye Gulini was more exacting.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand how much pressure is put on her,\u201d she said four years ago. \u201cIt breaks my heart because I think it takes the fun out of it for her.

Because once a conversation starts, people can find themselves doing strange things.\n\nTake Michelle Albitz, a Pennsylvania woman who lost more than $10,000 to an ersatz I.R.S. caller. According to the account in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a gentleman on the phone said she would be arrested if she didn\u2019t pay her back taxes. She withdrew the money from her local bank and, following the instructions from her caller, went to retail stores and bought gift cards. She then read the card information to the swindler over the phone.\n\nWho knew the I.R.S. worked this way? With gift cards?\n\nOh, that\u2019s right. It doesn\u2019t.\n\nThose I.R.S. people aren\u2019t like that. They don\u2019t call, they don\u2019t send email, they don\u2019t demand money from you in Instagram posts. And while David Kautter, the acting commissioner of the I.R.S., is surely somewhat hunky in his own nerd-eriffic way, he will not contact you on Tinder and tell you that you have beautiful eyes and that you need to pay some back taxes. Not even with gift cards.\n\nThe gift card caper that snared Ms. Albitz was unusual, but scammers trying to extract fake tax payments aren\u2019t a new thing. That\u2019s why it is refreshing, in a perverse way, to see crooks coming up with something a little more inventive lately, like this twist on another old fraud.\n\nThe perpetrators fill out fake tax returns in your name, using your actual information.

Here\u2019s a real myth: that anyone wants to call the I.R.S.\n\nNormal people dread having contact with the agency, aside from sending in their tax return, and, if they are fortunate, getting a refund.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in actual conversation with this agency, it probably means something bad has happened, such as getting a letter about a problem with your taxes, and you\u2019ve had to follow up. That situation is likely to get worse: Once you start calling the agency to clear things up, well, it can be an endless cycle of fix-it calls followed by dunning I.R.S. notices demanding that you fix the thing you just fixed, with more calls to clear things up.\n\nFrankly, dear reader, those so-called I.R.S. myths didn\u2019t sound much like myths to me. For example, the title of one listed by the agency was this: \u201cOrdering a tax transcript a \u2018secret way\u2019 to get a refund date.\u201d That does not sound like anything anyone has said to me ever, even if you interpret the sentence to mean that people use their refunds to go out on a date and the agency will help hook you up.

Try myths people might actually believe, for example, the claim that \u201cBitcoins are untraceable.\u201d (It\u2019s complicated but, in fact, they are traceable.)\n\nThen there\u2019s the old saying that nothing is certain but death and taxes. I always thought it was true, but it has clearly moved into myth territory: Death is still pretty certain, sure. But taxes? With all the revisions to the tax code, a lot of people are very uncertain. And, above a certain income level, you can bet that they won\u2019t be paying much if any tax at all.\n\nThe truly rich, of course, know they don\u2019t need to call the I.R.S.

One issue focuses almost entirely on a tough conversation between Bobby and his parents, in which he can\u2019t quite tell them he is gay; they ask him to quit flaunting his powers \u201clike you\u2019re all in a parade.\u201d It\u2019s what the legal scholar Kenji Yoshino calls a demand for covering: We\u2019ll let you be who you are, if you don\u2019t make it obvious.\n\nBobby makes his mutant powers obvious \u2014 he enjoys using them, uses them all the time \u2014 as a way to hide from the rest of himself, almost as he uses his endless supply of puns (\u201cIce to meet you\u201d). \u201cI\u2019ve brushed aside any emotion that didn\u2019t quite fit and covered it up with a joke,\u201d he says in the letter he wrote to come out to his parents, a letter that his ex-girlfriend Kitty Pryde \u2014 herself an X-Man whose power is turning intangible \u2014 has to prompt Bobby\u2019s mother and father to read. In pages that take full advantage of comics form, we read the words in the letter while the surrounding panels show Iceman defeating a huge armored bad guy called Juggernaut: \u201cToday was a really bad day,\u201d Bobby tells him, \u201cand punching you helped.\u201d He can do what he\u2019s always done \u2014 and be himself too.\n\nSina Grace, who is gay, has suggested in interviews that Bobby\u2019s coming out reflects the experience of men he has known. It also reflects \u2014 or just is \u2014 a way that superhero comics, at least the ones with mutants, have themselves come out: belatedly, by stages, awkwardly, slowly, still trying to find out what else they can do or be, without abandoning their older roles, and making good on the promises so many of us found there when we were young. It\u2019s satisfying in too many ways to count, even as it leaves some of us wondering \u2014 as Kitty, and Bobby\u2019s other friends, are wondering \u2014 how on earth it took so long.", "title": "The Iceman Cometh Out", "authors": ["Stephanie Burt"]}

Certainly, a surgical delivery can be lifesaving when, for example, the fetus or the mother is at risk of a serious or fatal complication from a vaginal delivery.\n\nBut other reasons for the rise in cesarean deliveries, including the readings from a fetal monitor, are less clear-cut. Even though many babies with borderline readings would be likely to be fine with a vaginal birth, women and their doctors are usually unwilling to take a chance when the monitor suggests that the fetus may be in trouble. And women who have one cesarean, which weakens the uterine wall, are more likely to have a second or third rather than risk a uterine rupture during subsequent labor and delivery.\n\nTo counter the effects of a surgical birth on the infant\u2019s microbiome, a growing number of women whose babies are delivered by cesarean are requesting that medical staff transfer microbes from the mother\u2019s vagina to their infants soon after birth. Some are administering the microbe exchanges themselves. However, an expert committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently warned that the practice, known as vaginal seeding, was premature and possibly hazardous.\n\n\u201cAt this time, vaginal seeding should not be performed outside the context of an institutional review board-approved research protocol until adequate data regarding the safety and benefit of the process become available,\u201d the committee concluded. The committee cited a potential risk of transferring pathogenic organisms from the woman to the neonate.\n\nIf vaginal seeding is being considered, women should be informed of the risks and tested for infectious diseases and potentially pathogenic bacteria, including group B streptococci, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia and gonorrhea, the committee stated.", "title": "The Importance of Infants\u2019 Exposure to Micro-Organisms", "authors": []}

She is diverting attention from his roles in the murders of his half brother, who was smeared with a fatal toxin while walking through an airport, and of many senior government officials, slaughtered in grotesque ways. Is it any wonder that she\u2019s making the effort? The alternative, apparently, is being drawn and quartered.\n\nSo bizarrely nonjudgmental was some of the chatter about her that BuzzFeed News published what it cheekily labeled a public service announcement. The headline, referring to a disapproving glance that she\u2019d thrown at Vice President Mike Pence, reminded Americans that she was \u201cnot your new fave shade queen,\u201d and the article bluntly asked those who seemed to be so taken with her, \u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you people?\u201d\n\nIn National Review, David French floated some answers, positing that hatred of President Trump was so blinding that his opponents regarded all international incidents as potential diminutions of his administration. To these appalled critics, Pence exists on the same level as Kim\u2019s sister \u2014 or even below it. French filed this under the rubric of overheated partisanship, which is indeed a problem but not tidily applicable here. Anti-Trump fervor has as much to do with his out-of-bounds actions and words as with any reflexive tribalism.\n\nAnd Trump himself has been guilty of galling equivalences. When he campaigned for the presidency and made goo-goo eyes at Vladimir Putin, he famously minimized Putin\u2019s reputation for having journalists and political adversaries eliminated, telling Joe Scarborough, \u201cWell, I think that our country does plenty of killing, too, Joe.\u201d\n\nBoth French\u2019s complaint and the BuzzFeed News article touch on something troubling and important: a tendency \u2014 in the media and beyond it \u2014 to treat all of public life as a pageant and a public relations contest, with winners and losers determined less by their souls than by their sizzle.

It found that people who cut back on added sugar, refined grains and highly processed foods while concentrating on eating plenty of vegetables and whole foods \u2014 without worrying about counting calories or limiting portion sizes \u2014 lost significant amounts of weight over the course of a year.\n\nThe strategy worked for people whether they followed diets that were mostly low in fat or mostly low in carbohydrates. And their success did not appear to be influenced by their genetics or their insulin-response to carbohydrates, a finding that casts doubt on the increasingly popular idea that different diets should be recommended to people based on their DNA makeup or on their tolerance for carbs or fat.\n\nThe research lends strong support to the notion that diet quality, not quantity, is what helps people lose and manage their weight most easily in the long run. It also suggests that health authorities should shift away from telling the public to obsess over calories and instead encourage Americans to avoid processed foods that are made with refined starches and added sugar, like bagels, white bread, refined flour and sugary snacks and beverages, said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University.", "title": "The Key to Weight Loss Is Diet Quality, Not Quantity, a New Study Finds", "authors": []}

A steady stream of good economic news, including announcements of bonuses and raises that some corporations are attributing to the tax cut, have amounted to a substantial if belated public relations campaign for the bill. It is also possible that voters have realized they\u2019ve gotten a tax cut.\n\nThe bill isn\u2019t exactly staggeringly popular, according to more recent polls that still show that more Americans disapprove of the bill than support it. But it\u2019s polling a lot better than it did a month ago and even fairly well by the standards of President Trump\u2019s approval rating.\n\nRegardless of how it polls over all, there can be little doubt that many Republicans, who might have been dissatisfied with the accomplishments of the Republican Congress, have now gotten one of their biggest wishes.\n\nDoes that add up to a lasting change in the national political environment? Who can say. What can be said, fairly confidently, is that two weeks of good polling for the Republicans are not enough to declare that such a shift has taken place.\n\nTake a look at two ways of calculating the generic ballot polling average. Both account for the biases of various pollsters, and give more weight to higher-quality and less frequent pollsters. In light gray is a sensitive estimate \u2014 the sort of polling average you would use heading into Election Day. It doesn\u2019t care much about polling from a few weeks ago. Wednesday\u2019s Monmouth poll, which showed Democrats ahead by just two points, is far and away the most important single data point in its estimate.\n\nIn dark purple is a less sensitive estimate. It\u2019s as sensitive as the Upshot Senate model from 2014 would have been nine months from a congressional election. It\u2019s not sensitive at this stage for a simple reason: Bumps and blips don\u2019t tell you too much this far from an election.\n\nAt the moment, the two estimates tell very different stories about the generic ballot.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "Offering a more traditional, but no less impressive, relationship between art and prose, THE WEIGHT OF WORDS (Subterranean, $40) is a stunningly produced anthology of original fiction inspired by the work of Dave McKean, a British artist perhaps best known for his album covers (Counting Crows\u2019 \u201cThis Desert Life\u201d) and frequent collaborations with Neil Gaiman (\u201cThe Sandman,\u201d \u201cCoraline,\u201d \u201cThe Wolves in the Walls\u201d and \u201cThe Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish,\u201d to name a few). Edited by McKean and William Schafer, the stories \u2014 by Gaiman, Alastair Reynolds, Maria Dahvana Headley, Catherynne M. Valente, Caitlin R. Kiernan, M. John Harrison, Joe R. Lansdale, Joe Hill and Iain Sinclair \u2014 are each bookended by McKean\u2019s instantly recognizable mixed-media surrealism. The anthology also includes a short comic and piece of prose fiction by McKean.\n\nMany anthologies are organized around a stated theme, but few are organized around a mood; what most impressed me about \u201cThe Weight of Words\u201d was its sustained core of loneliness, memory and loss across extraordinarily different styles of storytelling, from the sinuous far-future elegance of Reynolds\u2019s \u201cBelladonna Nights\u201d to the sharp, fragmented opacity of Sinclair\u2019s \u201cBroken Face.\u201d Every piece felt steeped in the sepia tones of McKean\u2019s unsettling art even if it seemed to make only the most glancing contact with the image\u2019s contents: Valente\u2019s \u201cNo One Dies in Nowhere,\u201d for instance, opens next to a pencil-sketched image of a bird-headed person in a long thick scarf and coat, but spins from it an affecting story of afterlives that\u2019s C. S. Lewis\u2019s \u201cThe Great Divorce\u201d dressed in hard-boiled noir by way of \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progress.\u201d Other stories are more visibly interpretations of and responses to the art. A violin cradling a naked woman beneath a tree growing out of its curves leads to Headley\u2019s \u201cThe Orange Tree,\u201d a story about an 11th-century female golem with a stringed instrument in her belly who resists her creator\u2019s abusive programming; Kiernan\u2019s \u201cObjects in the Mirror\u201d \u2014 a story of doubleness and doppelg\u00e4ngers partially written as a screenplay set in a therapist\u2019s office \u2014 is preceded by an image of a stylized head containing a person cringing from the eyepiece of a telescope, as if afraid to be seen.\n\nThe caliber of fiction here is genuinely remarkable. I fully expected the stories by Valente and Headley, whose writing I\u2019ve long loved, would be among my favorites, and they were, but Hill\u2019s \u201cAll I Care About Is You\u201d and McKean\u2019s \u201cThe Language of Birds\u201d \u2014 the first fiction I\u2019ve read by either \u2014 shocked and moved me in equal measure. In Hill\u2019s gut-punchingly perfect story, a girl struggling to adjust to her family\u2019s reversal of fortune finds a robotic friend who will be her devotee for a single paid hour, while McKean\u2019s experimentally displayed story \u2014 the sepia from his images bleeding into, over and through the text in places \u2014 speaks to the anguish of losing the \u201csweet wine golden flow\u201d of childhood perception, potential and possibility. The anthology is more than worth it for these four stories alone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Most of its contents are reprints, having appeared in magazines, anthologies or on Walton\u2019s website; others have been available only behind the author\u2019s walled Patreon garden.\n\n\u201cStarlings\u201d collects a range of works written between 2000 and 2017, prefaced with an introduction that lays out Walton\u2019s relationship to short fiction. \u201cFor the longest time,\u201d she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to write short stories \u2026 I went on to write, and sell, a couple \u2026 that is, specifically, two. You\u2019ll find them toward the end of this book. I continue to think of myself as a novelist and a poet and not really a short fiction writer at all.\u201d\n\nAn odd start \u2014 but what emerges from the collection is not Jo Walton, writer, but Jo Walton, conversationalist. The whole volume is an entertaining discussion with its author that equals, if not exceeds, the fiction and poetry and drama in the book.\n\nWalton follows each story with a brief afterword elaborating on some combination of its origins and publication history, often debating whether the work is, in fact, a story. I often disagreed with Walton\u2019s assessment of her own work: I wanted to argue with her that \u201cThree Twilight Tales\u201d is, in fact, good short fiction and not a poem, or that some of what she calls opening chapters to unwritten novels are very accomplished short stories as well. Eventually I found myself reading the stories less to see what happened and more to see what she had to say about them.\n\n\u201cStarlings\u201d is valuable, too, as a potted history of genre communities on the internet. Walton often refers to Livejournal \u2014 many of the poems in the book first appeared there \u2014 and small online magazines like Eric Marin\u2019s Lone Star Stories, which was deeply beloved during its five years of operation from 2004 to 2009, citing them as catalysts and curators of her work and conversations.\n\nOf the poems, the standouts for me were \u201cStarlings\u201d and \u201cSleepless in New Orleans\u201d; of the stories, \u201cThree Twilight Tales,\u201d \u201cTurnover\u201d and \u201cA Burden Shared.\u201d The play, \u201cThree Shouts on a Hill,\u201d is emblematic of the entire collection: The narrative dissolves into a conversation about narrative, with a sort of grumpy impatience that manages the surprising trick of also being generous and kind.", "title": "The Latest in Science Fiction and Fantasy", "authors": ["Amal El-Mohtar"]}

Just like our kid who\u2019s not white dresses up like Captain America. I think the beautiful thing about comics is they do transcend race in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nMary Dimacali, 29, a social media and marketing manager in Rockland County, New York, echoed that idea. She does not believe that her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 7-year-old son, Sawyer, who is white, sees the film or its characters through the lens of race. Sawyer himself, during the interview with Ms. Dimacali, said, \u201csure,\u201d when she asked if he\u2019d like to dress up as Black Panther.\n\n\u201cFor a white kid to be so open and judge based on the character\u2019s story and the personality and history, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cBut on the flip side, I think it\u2019s also great to have a black superhero you can identify and connect to.\u201d\n\nThe character\u2019s history is unique. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1966, Black Panther rules as the king of an African technological utopia known as Wakanda. Untouched by European invaders, Wakanda exists apart from the legacies of colonization and racism. Black history and black fantasy are central to the character, and the series has brought on prominent black writers including Ta-Nehisi Coates to deepen its significance over the last 50 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

He is completing \u201cRise of the Black Panther,\u201d a six-part comic series for Marvel that traces the character\u2019s early history. He has tried to explain some of that history to his 7-year-old daughter, but without delving too deeply into complex concepts like Western imperialism, which she may struggle to grasp.\n\n\u201cYou want that white kid to be able to think that he can dress up in a Black Panther costume, because, to that kid, there\u2019s no difference between Captain America and Black Panther,\u201d Mr. Narcisse, 45, said. But, he added, it also involves \u201ctrying to explain what is special about T\u2019Challa and Wakanda without racism.

She believes that parents in general, and white parents in particular, are reluctant to talk about race with young children. When they do, they often miss the chance to talk about inequality, even though research supports the idea that children develop an awareness of race and difference at a very young age.\n\nMs. Vittrup was careful to add that dressing as Black Panther isn\u2019t inherently appropriative or offensive. The character comes from an invented African country, and to wear his mask isn\u2019t quite the same as wearing blackface. However, in a moment where even more black heroes, like Luke Cage and Black Lightning, are finding their way into the limelight, Black Panther\u2019s relationship with the black community and its history creates an opportunity to teach nonblack children about the black experience.\n\n\u201cKids are not colorblind,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of structural inequality in our society, and kids are noticing that.

That proved to be all too true of the 2008-09 Great Recession: In the aftermath, nobody in the policymaking, financial or academic communities stepped forward to accept responsibility for the worst global economic setback in the past 70 years.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely anyone will take credit for the current global market free fall, which, after three days, is clearly not just a correction but an overdue unwinding of years of excess. Whether the damage remains limited to markets or spills over into the general economy remains to be seen, but we could well be on the verge of another global financial crisis.\n\nThis despite the fact that the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman, Janet Yellen, repeatedly reassured us that we would not see another global economic crisis in her lifetime, while the academic economic community again distinguished itself by its virtual silence as bubbles formed in the market over the past few years. And just last month in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump boasted again that his administration\u2019s policies were leading to the stock market shattering records on a routine basis, while the bankers kept making risky loans as the music played on.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that sooner or later, the global financial markets would unwind as violently as they now seem to be doing, considering how far they were allowed to get out of line with their underlying values.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nIn a year when an aggressive strain of influenza has gripped the nation, the sweet gum holds out its fruit-laden limbs with its own humble contribution to humanity. The infertile seeds found in each of the sweet gum\u2019s compound seed capsules are a naturally occurring source of shikimic acid, one of the main ingredients in the manufacture of Tamiflu. The internet is full of homegrown techniques to extract this valuable chemical from the tree\u2019s seeds.\n\nGenerally considered a southern tree, the sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua) reaches the northernmost limits of its natural range along the coast not far north of New York City. Humans have transplanted this species extensively, so it can now be found growing as a street tree or even in any number of botanic gardens well outside its original range. But in New York City, the sweet gum is a fairly common sight, growing best where there is rich, loamy soil with good moisture.\n\nWhere conditions suit it, the tree can grow to mighty dimensions: nearly 75 feet tall with a spreading canopy. The sweet gum resembles a maple tree, and in the summer, the star-shaped leaves and sturdy trunk are impressive, if easily overlooked. It is only in winter, after the tree\u2019s greenery has been shed, that the sweet gum\u2019s finer points can truly be appreciated.\n\nAt this time of year, sweet gums stand out. The tree\u2019s dark grayish brown twigs bear unusual, corky ridges that lend the tree a peculiar angularity. Additionally, the sweet gum\u2019s spiky \u201cgum balls\u201d hang conspicuously from the tree\u2019s smaller branches, sometimes all winter. These compound seed capsules are often confused with the seed heads of the American sycamore, or its London plane-tree hybrid, but the two are only superficially similar. The seed heads of the sycamore disintegrate as their seeds are dispersed; the sweet gum seed capsule, on the other hand, has a woody structure, and the gum balls are quite persistent. They can often be found in great numbers at the bases of the trees\u2019 trunks, as well as along walking paths where they amuse or annoy dogs and their walkers, runners, picnickers and bike riders alike.\n\nThe sweet gum grows in a long list of states, thinning to a more patchy distribution as it spreads southward into Mexico and Central America. For a New World tree, it is interesting to note its Old World connections. The first Westerners to describe the plant were Spanish conquistadors who recorded its uses by Montezuma and the formidable Aztec empire in the 16th century. Chief among them, the sweet gum\u2019s fragrant resin was used to flavor a pipe full of an unfamiliar plant called tobacco.\n\nThis resin is still in use today, occasionally flavoring tobacco, but it is also used as a mild antiseptic and as a treatment for sores. The tree itself is also an important lumber crop in the American South, but because its wood is not strong, it is generally used in combination with other woods as a veneer or in the making of plywood.\n\nOlder gum trees are not uncommon in the thick, rich-soiled woodlands of several parks in New York City. Among these, Wolfe\u2019s Pond and Blue Heron parks on Staten Island are among the best. Just watch where you walk.", "title": "The Mean Seed of the Sweet Gum", "authors": ["Dave Taft"]}

After the fact, defendants can challenge warrants by arguing that the government recklessly excluded information that would have caused the judge not to sign the warrant.\n\nCourts have repeatedly held that even when the government omitted the criminal history of the informant or the fact that the informant was paid, it didn\u2019t matter unless the omitted information would have caused the judge not to sign the warrant.\n\nThe Nunes memo claims to show that the warrant was obtained unlawfully, but there is no way of knowing that without examining the extensive evidence submitted in conjunction with the warrant, which the memo does not do. Given that Mr. Steele was a former intelligence officer, not a flipper with an extensive criminal history, it will be hard to show that a judge would have believed he was lying if the source of his funding was included in the application.\n\nGiven how little substance there is to the Nunes memo, the Republicans made a misstep by pushing through its release in a partisan manner. The specter of an unreleased memo was more menacing than the thin allegations revealed in the memo itself, which are hotly disputed by congressional Democrats.\n\nAlthough at least one Republican maintains that the memo shows that Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Comey and others committed \u201ctreason,\u201d the memo itself does not allege that the F.B.I. or Department of Justice knowingly used false information or even that the information they used was false.

This is a mechanism for getting people into treatment when they are too deep in the throes of their illness to understand that they need it. It allowed me to hospitalize a woman who tried to choke her mother because she was convinced her family had been replaced with impostors, and a man who had sent threatening letters to his boss because he believed she had implanted a microchip in his brain.\n\nBut the young man who had written about shooting his classmates was calm, cooperative and polite. The posts, he insisted, were nothing more than online braggadocio. He denied being suicidal or homicidal; he had never heard voices or gotten strange messages from the television. He admitted to having been bullied and was resentful of classmates who seemed to have more thriving social and romantic lives. But he adamantly denied he would be violent toward them.\n\nWhat options did I have? It was clear to me that he did not have a psychiatric illness that would justify an involuntary hospitalization, but I was reluctant to release this man whose story echoed that of so many mass shooters.\n\nI could fudge it a little, claiming to need more time for observation, and admit him to the hospital anyway. But within the week he would go before a hearing officer to contest being held against his will. The hearing officer would probably come to the same conclusion I had, that he was not dangerous because of a mental illness, and he would be free to go.

But in those days, the Islamic State was seen as the embodiment of all evil and accordingly anyone fighting it was one of the good guys. No one heeded Israel\u2019s warnings.\n\nFor its part, Israel has conducted more than 100 bombing and missile raids in Syria, without ever admitting it or taking responsibility, against storage sites for weapons and convoys supplying the Iranian-led forces.\n\nWith the Syrian Army itself extended to its limits combating rebels, and the Iranians and Hezbollah helping it in the heavy fighting, this tripartite alliance was forced to swallow time after time some bitter truths: They recognized that Mossad and Israeli military intelligence knew how, where and when they were operating, and they knew that they wouldn\u2019t be able to respond to the Israeli raids without suffering heavy losses.\n\nWhen Russian forces entered Syria in 2015 and it became clear that the United States would not take real measures to counter Mr. Putin\u2019s moves, Mr. Netanyahu managed to set up a secret communications channel between himself and the Russian president, according to my sources in Israeli intelligence, as well as an encrypted phone line for communication between Israel and the Russian military and intelligence in order to prevent clashes between Israeli and Russian forces in Syria.\n\nBut that limited amount of tactical coordination hasn\u2019t led Russia to understand Israel\u2019s strategic needs.

{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "For at least the past seven presidential election cycles, candidates on both sides have sought to use veterans, military leaders and the military itself to validate their credentials as potential commanders in chief. In 1992, Bill Clinton received the endorsement of retired Adm. William Crowe, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Each election cycle has escalated this use of veterans as stage props, or useful attackers, such as in 2004 with the deployment of Swift boat veterans to attack John Kerry. To some extent, this politicization of the military has carried forward into office, with presidents from each party carefully using military audiences or imagery to frame policy statements or political activities.\n\nBut there is a difference between giving a speech on Afghanistan in front of a military audience and what Mr. Trump has done during his first year in office. He has appointed more active and retired generals to serve as political appointees than any president in recent memory. In a public speech shortly after his inauguration, Mr. Trump delivered a blistering attack on the press before an audience of intelligence officers at the C.I.A. headquarters.\n\nSeven days later, Mr. Trump used the Pentagon\u2019s Hall of Heroes, with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis standing by, to sign his controversial travel ban. Last February, he politicked before a crowd of troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., the home of the military\u2019s headquarters for Middle East operations and special operations. In July of last year, during the commissioning of the aircraft carrier Gerald Ford, Mr. Trump told the assembled sailors that \u201cI don\u2019t mind getting a little hand, so call that congressman and call that senator and make sure you get it,\u201d referring to his budget, adding, \u201cAnd by the way, you can also call those senators to make sure you get health care.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence followed the president\u2019s lead last month in a speech before American troops in Jordan, on the border with Syria, attacking Democrats in the middle of a budget fight that caused a brief government shutdown.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s proposed parade fits this pattern of politicizing the military and using it to further his political interests \u2014 not those of the military or the nation.\n\nOur service members have better things to do than march in Washington, at a time when we remain committed in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and face increased tensions with Russia and North Korea.\n\nBut beyond the costs and distraction of a parade, we should be wary of its long-term corrosive effects on our military, which must continue to serve and defend our country long after the Trump presidency ends.", "title": "Opinion | The Military Is Not a Political Prop", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "In 2006, the Commission on the Future of Higher Education, convened by Margaret Spellings, the secretary of education at the time, issued a scathing critique of universities. \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces,\u201d the commission\u2019s report complained.\n\nEducators scrambled to ensure that students graduate with these skills \u2014 and to prove it with data. The obsession with testing that dominates primary education invaded universities, bringing with it a large support staff. Here is the first irony of learning assessment: Faced with outrage over the high cost of higher education, universities responded by encouraging expensive administrative bloat.\n\nMany of the professionals who work in learning assessment are former faculty members who care deeply about access to quality education. Pat Hutchings, a senior scholar at the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment (and former English professor), told me: \u201cGood assessment begins with real, genuine questions that educators have about their students, and right now for many educators those are questions about equity. We\u2019re doing pretty well with 18- to 22-year-olds from upper-middle-class families, but what about \u2014 well, fill in the blank.\u201d\n\nIt seems that the pressure to assess student learning outcomes has grown most quickly at poorly funded regional universities that have absorbed a large proportion of financially disadvantaged students, where profound deficits in preparation and resources hamper achievement. Research indicates that the more selective a university, the less likely it is to embrace assessment. Learning outcomes assessment has become one way to answer the question, \u201cIf you get unprepared students in your class and they don\u2019t do well, how does that get explained?\u201d Mr. Eubanks at Furman University told me.\n\nWhen Erik Gilbert, a professor of history at Arkansas State University, reached the end of his World Civilization course last fall, he dutifully imposed the required assessment: an extra question on the final exam that asked students to read a document about Samurai culture and answer questions using knowledge of Japanese history. Yet his course focused on \u201ccross-cultural connections, trade, travel, empire, migration and bigger-scale questions, rather than area studies,\u201d Mr. Gilbert told me. His students had not studied Japanese domestic history. \u201cWe do it this way because it satisfies what the assessment office wants, not because it addresses concerns that we as a department have.\u201d\n\nMr. Gilbert became an outspoken assessment skeptic after years of watching the process fail to capture what happens in his classes \u2014 and seeing it miss the real reasons students struggle. \u201cMaybe all your students have full-time jobs, but that\u2019s something you can\u2019t fix, even though that\u2019s really the core problem,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, you\u2019re expected to find some small problem, like students don\u2019t understand historical chronology, so you might add a reading to address that. You\u2019re supposed to make something up every semester, then write up a narrative\u201d explaining your solution to administrators.\n\nHere is the second irony: Learning assessment has not spurred discussion of the deep structural problems that send so many students to college unprepared to succeed. Instead, it lets politicians and accreditors ignore these problems as long as bureaucratic mechanisms appear to be holding someone \u2014 usually a professor \u2014 accountable for student performance.", "title": "Opinion | The Misguided Drive to Measure \u2018Learning Outcomes\u2019", "authors": []}

Because of the wind, she faced three straight days of races, hardly ideal.\n\nFor most of a week, the blowing snow created white-out conditions on the ski courses.

Mislaid gloves blew away.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut wind is a fickle foe to plenty of winter sports, and it has affected all of the outdoor events.

Working on the premise of \u201ccapture their minds and their hearts will follow,\u201d both sides supported dozens of radio stations spewing malice and disinformation 24 hours a day. Hannah\u2019s scripts were written by North Vietnam Army propaganda experts, and advised by Cubans. Her programs were soon extended to 30 minutes and broadcast three times a day.\n\nShe was a source of news, as well. Hanoi Hannah broke one of the most shocking stories of the Vietnam War \u2014 the massacre of several hundred civilians in the village of My Lai in 1968. Just weeks after the massacre, Hannah accurately named the location and estimated the civilian death toll, but she misidentified the American Army division involved, enabling the Americans to deny the report and treat it like another example of disinformation from North Vietnam.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI first heard the silken voice of Hanoi Hannah in September 1965, in a Special Forces base at An Lac, about a hundred miles west of Nha Trang. As a news correspondent, I had been on patrol with Montagnard irregulars and their American advisers. It had been raining hard for a week, keeping the supply plane that was my ticket out from coming in. At night after the perimeter was secured there wasn\u2019t much to do but play cards, read, drink Ba Moi Ba beer and listen to the radio. Up there in the Central Highlands, the Voice of Vietnam boomed in loud and clear.\n\nThat night Hannah was interspersing Western rock music with her reports. The sounds of the Animals, singing \u201cWe Gotta Get Outta This Place,\u201d was followed by Hannah: Now for the war news. American casualties in Vietnam. Army Corporal Larry J. Samples, Canada, Alabama \u2026 Staff Sergeant Charles R. Miller, Tucson, Arizona \u2026 Sergeant Frank Hererra, Coolige, Arizona.\u201d\n\nHer broadcasts were mostly exaggerated war news, encouragement to \u201cfrag\u201d \u2014 assassinate \u2014 an officer and go AWOL, or suggestions that the soldiers\u2019 wives or girlfriends were cheating on them. She was mostly greeted with loud laughter. But taped interviews with downed pilots or from American antiwar advocates like Jane Fonda were heard with anger.\n\nFor bored G.I.s, Hannah\u2019s broadcasts were often rare sources of amusement. A man\u2019s radio was, after his rifle, his most valued possession. Like the rifle butt, the radio was often wrapped in frayed black tape for protection. Troops would laugh over Hannah\u2019s attempts to scare them into defection or suggestions to frag an officer. However, they did wonder if she was as lovely as she sounded, and many considered her the most prominent enemy after Ho Chi Minh.\n\nHannah regularly addressed her comments to black American G.I.s. In one broadcast, she said, \u201cA Vietnam black G.I. who refuses to be a victim of racism is Billy Smith. It seems on the morning of March 15th a fragmentation grenade went off in an officer\u2019s barracks in Bien Hoa killing two gung-ho lieutenants. Smith was illegally searched, arrested and put in Long Binh jail and brought home for trial. The evidence that showed him guilty was this: being black, poor and against the war and refusing to be a victim of racism.\u201d\n\nWhen violence broke out in Detroit on July 23, 1967, Hannah jumped on the news. American military stations were quiet; she broadcast every detail she had available.\n\nMike Roberts, a soldier from Detroit based in Danang, remembers that week well. \u201cHannah comes on and she knows what guard unit was called in and what kind of weapons were used,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when it starts to hit home. We knew what kind of fire power and devastation that kind of weapon can do to people, and now those same weapons were turning on us, you know, our own military is killing our own people. We might as well have been Viet Cong. But Hannah picked up on it and talked about it.\u201d\n\nHanoi Hannah could always be assured of at least the American audience that would hear her broadcasts \u2014 the prisoners of war in places like the Hanoi Hilton. John McCain, a Hanoi Hilton inmate for over five years, recently remarked: \u201cI heard Hannah every day. She was a marvelous entertainer. I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t get to Hollywood.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLt. Cmdr. Ray Voden, shot down over Hanoi on April 3, 1965, listened to her for eight years. \u201cHannah often stirred up arguments among the P.O.W.s. There were nearly fist fights over the programs. Some guys wanted to hear them, while others tried to ignore them. Personally, I listened because I usually gleaned information, reading between the lines.\u201d\n\nFor almost five years after I became a correspondent for ABC News, I would tape-record her programs almost daily, in case she said something newsworthy or presented a captured American pilot on her program. To me, she was just another source of information or disinformation to be checked out and sorted in the communications pudding of the Vietnam War.\n\nIn May 1978, I returned to Vietnam and asked the Foreign Ministry to arrange an interview for me with Trinh Thi Ngo. By then Hanoi Hannah had left her beloved Hanoi and moved to Ho Chi Minh City, the renamed city of Saigon, with her husband, who was a southerner and a Vietnamese Army officer. The appointment was set up for the rooftop bar of the Rex Hotel, where I waited along with Ken Watkins, who had been a Marine corpsman and a regular listener to Hannah.\n\nWhile we waited, Ken recalled his memories of Hannah. \u201cThe signal was pretty good around Danang and we would tune in once or twice a week to hear her talk about the war,\u201d he said. \u201cHannah didn\u2019t necessarily make sense; she used American English, but really didn\u2019t speak our language in spite of hip expressions and hit tunes, even tunes banned on U.S. Army radio. The best thing going for her was that she was female and had a nice soft voice.\u201d\n\nI asked if he was still angry at her. \u201cSure,\u201d he said, \u201csome antagonism, add it to the Vietnam list. But this trip back is about coming full circle on a lot of things, and she is another voice from the past I want to confront in person.\u201d\n\nSo an ex-Marine and an old war correspondent waited that sunny morning for the real Hanoi Hannah to appear, waiting for reality to sweep away the years of bitter images in the windmills of our minds. Dragon Lady? Psy-warrior? Prophet? Or what?\n\nLike so many phantoms of the war, she was not what we imagined. She didn\u2019t look like the \u201cDragon Lady\u201d from \u201cTerry and the Pirates\u201d comics. Elegant and attractive in a striking yellow ao dai, the Vietnamese traditional dress, she appeared happy to answer our questions.\n\nAfter she sat down, I asked where she got her information.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Army Stars and Stripes,\u201d she replied, referring to the main military newspaper. \u201cWe read from it. We had it flown in every day. We also read Newsweek, Time and several other newspapers. We took remarks of American journalists and put them in our broadcasts, especially about casualties.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDid she ever feel anger toward the American troops?\n\n\u201cWhen the bombs came on Hanoi, I did feel angry,\u201d she said. \u201cTo the Vietnamese, Hanoi is a sacred ground. But even then, when I spoke to the G.I.s I tried always to be calm. I never felt aggression toward Americans as a people. I never called them the enemy, only adversaries.\u201d\n\nWe chatted for a while, about her aims, her successes, her regrets. Then I had one more question \u2014 what would she say now, if she had one final broadcast to American G.I.s?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s let bygones be bygones,\u201d she replied. \u201cLet\u2019s move on and be friends. There will be many benefits if we can be friends together. There is no reason to be enemies.\u201d\n\nMeeting and interviewing Hanoi Hannah was, for me, like being Dorothy parting the curtains hiding the Wizard of Oz. The terrible Hannah behind the facade that we constructed, turned out to be a mild-mannered announcer who spoke English and read the Stars and Stripes.\n\nTrinh Thi Ngo died on Sept. 30, 2016 at the age of 85.

According to a one-page document the company provided, the voting machines digitally sign voting results before transmitting them via modem and encrypt them in transit using SFTP \u2014 secure file transfer protocol. The election-management systems that receive results then check the signature to authenticate the data transmission. This theoretically means results couldn\u2019t be swapped out and replaced with different ones. That is, unless an attacker can obtain ES&S\u2019s signing key.\n\nThese keys, explains noted cryptographer and computer-security expert Matt Blaze, \u2018\u2018need to be stored in the machine, and if they\u2019re stored in the machine and under control of the software, any compromise of that software could be used potentially to extract\u201d them. Blaze, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, says that ES&S machines he examined for Ohio\u2019s secretary of state a decade ago had a number of security problems, including with key security.\n\nAs for using the modems to hack into machines and compromise their software, ES&S says its modems are configured to only initiate calls, not receive them, and can make calls only after an election ends, preventing anyone from dialing in or having them dial out at other times. The company also says results are not sent directly to the election-management systems but to a data communications server that operates as a DMZ, or \u2018\u2018demilitarized zone,\u2019\u2019 separated from the internet and the election-management system by firewalls. The election-management system accesses the DMZ to collect the results.\n\nES&S advises election officials to configure the external firewall that protects the DMZ to only accept connections from IP addresses assigned to the voting machines. And election officials in Rhode Island, which uses ES&S\u2019s DS200 machines with modems, told me that the modems only transmit for about a minute, which wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to hack into voting machines or results servers.\n\nBut Stauffer and others say none of this would prevent a skilled hacker from penetrating the machines via their modems. Although overwriting the machine\u2019s firmware, or voting software, would be difficult to do in just a minute, Stauffer says installing malware on the underlying operating system would not. An attacker might be able to do this directly through the modem to the voting machine, or infect the election-management system on the other end and install malware that gets passed to voting machines when officials program future elections. In either case, the malware could disable modem controls on the voting machines and make the devices secretly dial out to whatever number an attacker wants whenever he wants, while also altering system logs to erase evidence of these calls. This would let an attacker connect to the machines before or during an election to install malicious voting software that subverts results.", "title": "The Myth of the Hacker-Proof Voting Machine", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-17 00:00:00", "text": "But there will be no such drama this weekend in Los Angeles. Indeed, there will be no deals at all \u2014 blockbuster or otherwise. The N.B.A.\u2019s annual trade deadline was on Feb. 8 this year, marking the first time in at least four decades that it occurred before the All-Star Game was played.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to be more precise than that because the league\u2019s official records on the matter date only to 1987. But a research assist we received from an indispensable Twitter follow for fans of the game\u2019s rich (but often overlooked) past \u2014 @ProHoopsHistory \u2014 confirmed that the trade deadline had come after the All-Star Game going as far back as the 1978-79 season.\n\nWhat can be said without hesitation is that without any trade talk in the background, this All-Star weekend feels drastically different from any in recent memory. Just as the N.B.A. had hoped.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOur goals in moving up the trade deadline were twofold \u2014 to avoid it being a distraction over All-Star weekend and to allow traded players to use the All-Star break to get acclimated to their new teams and cities,\u201d Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said earlier in the week. \u201cEarly returns have been positive.\u201d\n\nThe reviews have been closer to glowing. The Cleveland Cavaliers, in fact, were prepared to submit their enthusiastic support as soon as the calendar change was announced last summer.\n\n\u201cWe were thrilled,\u201d the Cavaliers\u2019 general manager, Koby Altman, said.\n\nAltman certainly never envisioned in July that he would end up making three massive trades right at the Feb. 8 deadline to essentially reconfigure half his roster.\n\nYet as Altman noted in an interview on Friday afternoon, shortly after he landed in Los Angeles for the All-Star festivities, Cleveland has \u201chistorically always made some sort of move\u201d around the trade deadline. So the Cavaliers were always on board with moving up the deadline, which, in turn, would speed the transition process for any on-the-fly additions to the roster.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdditions that the Cavaliers ended up making in dramatic fashion to essentially remake half the team around LeBron James.\n\nAltman chuckled when he was asked to imagine what it would have felt like on Sunday, for both him and his star player, if the trade deadline had not yet passed and James would be on the court with the other All-Stars while the Cavaliers were still trying to complete all of their trade business.\n\nThe Cavaliers still have two open roster spots to fill despite the moves they made. Still, Altman is now comfortable enough with the state of his team\u2019s makeover that he felt free to join three other Cavaliers staff members on Thursday night on a scouting trip to Tempe to watch Arizona beat Arizona State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly relieved,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich, in turn, makes for a more enjoyable All-Star weekend. When I spoke on Friday with Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 owner, he joked that he was still recovering from his All-Star experience in New Orleans a decade ago. During that weekend, in February 2008, Dallas and the Nets strained to agree on terms that the league would accept so that a blockbuster deal headlined by Jason Kidd could go through.\n\nDespite two motivated teams, the proposed trade hit roadblock after roadblock and collapsed multiple times.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Marc Stein He has covered Jordan.

Far less stress than before.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see, of course, whether the removal of all that trade angst helps Sunday\u2019s show. There\u2019s no question that fan interest a year ago was fixated far more on the prospect of Cousins being moved than on the game itself, especially after the Kings had publicly and privately insisted Cousins was going nowhere.\n\nPerhaps the absence of smothering trade speculation, along with the well-chronicled format change that established James and Stephen Curry as team captains instead of employing the traditional East vs. West format, will provide the game with the jolt it needs and the N.B.A. has been trying to manufacture.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstinct tells you, at the very least, that it won\u2019t be hard for the TV cameras to find Magic Johnson during Sunday\u2019s broadcast. Johnson will undoubtedly be visible in his new role as president of the Los Angeles Lakers after the Lakers happily played their part in the Cavaliers\u2019 trade spree 10 days ago.\n\nA year ago, of course, no cameras could have zeroed in on Demps. The only way to know where he was at the time would have been to find out from his wife.\n\nDennis Lindsey, the Utah Jazz executive who had worked alongside Demps years earlier in San Antonio, did cross paths with Anita Demps as the All-Star Game was being played and asked if her husband was around.\n\nWhich is how Lindsey ended up in Demps\u2019s office. The old friends visited for a bit, but Demps never let on that he was only a Sacramento signoff away from sealing a deal to acquire Cousins.\n\nWhen news of the trade began to spread later that evening, Demps promptly received a text from Lindsey that read: \u201cMan \u2026 I\u2019m never playing poker with you.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s really nothing in sports these days quite like trade poker in the N.B.A. But the final buzzer on that activity, like it or not, has sounded until June, when the draft comes into focus and all the wheeling, dealing and, yes, bluffing starts anew.", "title": "The N.B.A. All-Star Game Has Shed a Major Distraction", "authors": ["Marc Stein", "On Pro Basketball"]}
{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cIn the dunk contest, if you are having LeBron and Paul George, it would be very popular,\u201d said Clyde Drexler, who, when he was an active player, took part in both the dunk and the 3-point contest. \u201cA lot of guys are afraid to get in the dunk contest because they may not win and it\u2019ll hurt their brand.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe N.B.A. has taken steps to try to revamp the dunk contest. It has, at different times, changed the number of competitors, allowed first-round byes and then taken them away, changed the scoring system, added and then taken away a wheel that selects what dunk a player should perform and incorporated fan voting. In contrast, the rules for the 3-point competition, which began in 1986, have stayed largely the same.\n\nNevertheless, notes Michael Bass, the chief spokesman for the N.B.A., the dunk contest remains the highest-rated event on the Saturday night of All-Star weekend, even if the 3-point contest is drawing bigger-name players. \u201cMaybe we will see that change over time,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cThe interest in the 3-point-shooting contest has certainly taken off.\u2019\u2019\n\nEven with that surge in interest, there is talk of altering the 3-point format. Knicks Coach Jeff Hornacek, a former 3-point contest participant, has suggested holding separate contests for big men and guards. Fraser has wondered about the possibility of adding a deeper, half-court shot that would be worth more points. Miller excitedly detailed why the league should have a former 3-point contest winner team with a current N.B.A. shooter in an old-school/new-school competition.\n\n\u201cThis is the one way you would get me out of retirement to participate: have a legend \u2014 Ray Allen, Dell Curry, Dale Ellis \u2014 team up with the current guys,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI would go first, he would go second. People want to see Ray Allen. People would want to see Larry Bird. I think that would be hot.\u201d\n\nFor now, at least, the total prize money for the dunk and 3-point contests remains the same. It\u2019s $200,000 for each, although the winner of the four-player dunk contest will get $105,000 and the first-place finisher in the eight-player 3-point competition will take home $60,000.\n\nBut the biggest payoff is the attention garnered by finishing first. And being the 3-point champion is perhaps starting to mean more than being the best dunker.", "title": "The N.B.A. Dunk Contest Has the History. The 3-Point Contest Has the Stars.", "authors": []}

Her son, Matthew, 14, had been the last one to slip inside the class, just ahead of Mr. Beigel.

This is not a universal law, as the economics writer Noah Smith has pointed out; there are counter-examples and ways to resist the trend. However, it is a finding that strongly comports with the real-world experience of Europe and America, where as cultural diversity has increased so has social distrust, elite-populist conflict, and the racial, religious and generational polarization of political parties.\n\nMoreover, the trust problem is not a simple matter of racist natives mistrusting foreigners, since social trust is often weakest among minorities \u2014 which is one reason why the most diverse generation in American history, the millennials, is also the least trusting. So you can see the political effects of distrust even if you ignore the Trump Republicans entirely: It\u2019s one reason why campus politics are so toxic, why Democrats struggle to keep their diverse coalition politically engaged, and why the Bernie-Hillary contest produced so many cries of racism and sexism.\n\nThen linked to these ethno-cultural tensions are the tensions of class, where mass immigration favors stratification and elite self-segregation. In the United States, as in France and England, regions and cities with the largest immigrant populations are often the wealthiest and most dynamic. But this doesn\u2019t mean that poorer regions are dying from their own xenophobia, as is sometimes suggested. The hinterlands are also filled with people who might want to move to wealthier regions (or who used to live there) but can\u2019t because an immigrants-and-professionals ecosystem effectively prices out the middle class.\n\nIt is a testament to immigrants\u2019 grit and determination that they can thrive working long hours for low wages while living in crowded housing with long commutes. But the social order of, say, the Bay Area or greater Paris is not one that can serve for an entire country \u2014 and it ill-serves not only lower-middle-class natives but also the descendants of the immigrants themselves, whose ability to advance beyond their parents is limited by a continued arrival of new workers who compete with them for jobs and wages and housing.\n\nThus our rich and diverse states also often feature high poverty rates when their cost of living is considered, while second and third-generation immigrants often drift into the same stagnation as the white working class \u2026", "title": "Opinion | The Necessary Immigration Debate", "authors": []}

For one, there is an institutional urgency to speak to a more diverse audience with painting that depicts the black community, the Asian-American experience, the Latino face, to attract the various people who had been excluded from the museum by remaking the history of figurative painting, this time with color. Not that the trend toward realist portraits is exclusive to artists of color. It is evident in the rococo renderings of Sam McKinniss, who paints pop culture figures \u2014 Prince, Lorde, Flipper \u2014 like hallowed aristocrats. It was clear in a series of self-portraits by Justin Vivian Bond \u2014 who is best known for experimental cabaret performances \u2014 that were displayed at the New Museum last fall, and seemed to casually but definitively announce Bond\u2019s identity as a trans artist.\n\nAnd there is another reason for figurative paintings\u2019 resurgence as well: We live in a time in which reality is almost daily warped in ways that were unimaginable even 18 months ago. We have swiftly entered an era where the very notion of truth, or facts, is considered fungible. As we reassess the various power structures that landed us here, it is stabilizing and reassuring to look at the work of an artist who is clearly in control of her craft, who is able to depict a reality that is material and grounded in recognition \u2014 of seeing, in the Facebook age, a painting that looks like who it is meant to.\n\nTHE CURRENT GENERATION of figurative paintings owes a debt to Kerry James Marshall, whose 2016 multicity retrospective cemented the artist\u2019s often-stated goal, one that is as straightforward as it is enormous: to put blackness into art history. The painter\u2019s brilliantly simple gambit, one that has allowed for decades of elaboration, was to literalize that blackness. Starting in 1980 with a mischievous little egg-tempera \u2014 \u201cA Portrait of the Artist as a Shadow of His Former Self,\u201d which features a grin missing a crucial tooth \u2014 Marshall has painted his African-American subjects mostly in unmixed black paint. Ever since, these figures have been seen \u2014 boldly and yet barely \u2014 in a variety of settings: the artist\u2019s studio, the hairdresser\u2019s, parks, bedrooms, outer space. Their blackness makes each inclusion subtly register as an exclusion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis idea is expanded upon in the work of Amy Sherald, who was Michelle Obama\u2019s choice to paint her official portrait. Sherald uses grisaille \u2014 a method of painting in gray monochrome \u2014 for her subjects\u2019 skin. Because her gradations slyly allude to the mixed and often unacknowledged backgrounds of African-Americans, Sherald\u2019s paintings make an important statement about our racial history. One 2016 image, \u201cListen, You a Wonder. You a City of a Woman. You Got a Geography of Your Own,\u201d features a woman wearing a skirt dotted with black flowers. As if to underline the point, she is suspending a black purse in front of her belly.\n\nPhoto\n\nArtists like Marshall and Sherald suggest that in its exclusion of people of color, the issue of representation in painting is really a matter of misrepresentation. The best portrait painters working today introduce something new into art not through stylistic innovations, but by whom they choose as subjects. Aliza Nisenbaum, who was among the most prominent artists in last year\u2019s Whitney Biennial, looks at undocumented immigrants from Latin America in her work. The artist, who hails from Mexico City, shifted her painting practice from abstract to portraiture around 2010, while working with Cuban artist Tania Bruguera\u2019s Immigrant Movement International, an art project in Queens which provides social services to the neighborhood\u2019s large immigrant community. Nisenbaum realized that the portrait process \u2014 long, slow, intimate \u2014 gave her a way to get to know this community. Additionally, she recognized that painting these people\u2019s pictures would be one way to address their erasure in other areas of life. Nisenbaum has since expanded the project to include portrait-making workshops for the immigrants themselves. As if to complete the circle, the 2017 work \u201cWise Elders Portraiture Class at Centro Tyrone Guzman. En Familia hay Fuerza with mural on the history of immigrant farm labor to the United States,\u201d shows the students holding the portraits they themselves learned to draw.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat\u2019s most surprising about the recent return of classical portraiture is realizing how utterly absent it was from the art world for so many years, to such an extent that Andy Warhol \u2014 one of the people ostensibly responsible for killing the form \u2014 helped found the New York Academy of Art in 1982 in order to salvage the kind of technical fine arts training (most notably figure drawing) that seemed at the time in danger of becoming extinct. The Neo-Expressionism of the 1980s \u2014 led by painters like Julian Schnabel and David Salle \u2014 helped popularize abstraction by making it into a desirable commodity, but it also rendered the realism of a painter like Alice Neel pass\u00e9. But painting, perhaps because it is so old, seems unusually inclined to rebirth, to responding to its time in surprising ways. As the commercialism of the art world expanded in the 2010s, painting became a subset of interior decorating, something that was easy to mass produce and inoffensive to live with: paintings marked by bold colors and forms, sometimes literally depicting flowers (the work of Nate Lowman) or sunsets (Alex Israel). In 2014, at the peak of this stylistic moment, New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art hung its first survey composed exclusively of contemporary painting since 1958, \u201cThe Forever Now,\u201d a show that responded to the current age of distraction, in which contemporaneity was constantly being replaced by something newer. Only the works of Amy Sillman and Nicole Eisenman, who both have portrait-painting practices, hinted at the fact that in our next, emphatically historical moment, something old would be doing the replacing.\n\nBut an ever-widening chasm exists between 2014 and today. If the news of the world feels every day more like a pulpy political thriller with an unhinged plotline, painters have responded by grounding their work in observable, human reality. Most of this work isn\u2019t overtly political on its surface \u2014 there is Henry Taylor\u2019s monumental 2012 portrait of a woman grilling chicken on a barbecue, or Celeste Dupuy-Spencer\u2019s 2016 painting of a man making a playlist on his laptop, a cigarette-filled ashtray in front of him. But they also suggest that, in a time of chaos, there could be nothing more necessary \u2014 more defiant \u2014 than simply showing life as it\u2019s being lived.", "title": "The New Face of Portrait Painting", "authors": ["Dushko Petrovich"]}

Whether the memo is revealing a significant error or none at all depends on the big picture that the memo keeps secret. But we have no way to evaluate that, and critics are claiming it\u2019s wrong.\n\nSecond, the memo offers scant detail on what the government told the court about Mr. Steele. We get only glimpses. The court knew Mr. Steele had been hired to do his research by a \u201cnamed U.S. person,\u201d the memo reports. On the other hand, judges were not specifically told about the role of the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign in ultimately funding the investigation.\n\nWithout more details, however, it\u2019s hard to know what to make of this.

Judges routinely uphold warrants in criminal cases that fail to disclose bias in informants far worse than Mr. Steele\u2019s. An informant might be the target\u2019s wife, who the government fails to point out is engaged in a bitter divorce battle with him. An informant might be a known criminal facing fresh charges, who the affidavit fails to disclose was promised a break if he shares information about others.\n\nJudges expect this.

Stewart\n\n932 pp. Oxford University Press. $39.95.\n\nAlain LeRoy Locke\u2019s drive to revolutionize black culture was fueled in no small part by his sense of self-importance. \u201cWhen a man has something to be conceited over,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI call it self-respect.\u201d Unlike many of his colleagues and rivals in the black freedom struggle of the early 20th century, Locke, a trailblazer of the Harlem Renaissance, believed that art and the Great Migration, not political protest, were the keys to black progress. Black Americans would only forge a new and authentic sense of themselves, he argued, by pursuing artistic excellence and insisting on physical mobility. Psychological devotion to self-determination would transcend white racism and render stereotypes of black people obsolete. As Locke wrote in a draft of \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d his seminal 1925 essay, \u201cThe question is no longer what whites think of the Negro but of what the Negro wants to do and what price he is willing to pay to do it.\u201d\n\nJeffrey C. Stewart\u2019s majestic biography, also titled \u201cThe New Negro,\u201d gives Locke the attention his life deserves, but the book is more than a catalog of this now largely overlooked philosopher and critic\u2019s achievements. Stewart, a historian and professor of black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, also renders the tangled knot of art, sexuality and yearning for liberation that propelled Locke\u2019s work. Locke never completely untied that knot for himself, but he grappled with it until his death.\n\nLocke was born in Philadelphia in 1885. His father, Pliny, was a law school graduate and frustrated radical who died when Locke was 6. Locke\u2019s mother, Mary, provided a tenuously middle-class life for Alain with her salary as a teacher, and raised her son to play the aristocrat from the time he was young. Locke dressed immaculately and was taught not to kiss or touch strangers, for fear of germs. He and his mother disdained contamination in all forms, and made every effort to distance themselves from poor black people, to avoid being stained by association. Locke grew up determined to demonstrate his worth not by uplifting those less fortunate, but by cultivating a reverence for the arts. He was educated among wealthy white students at one of the city\u2019s finest public high schools, and enrolled at Harvard at 19.\n\nEven before college, Locke knew he was gay and that he would live his life as a gay man. These contradictory commitments \u2014 to respectable, elitist and homophobic black Victorianism on the one hand, and to his gay lifestyle on the other \u2014 produced a friction that sparked Locke\u2019s intellectual fire. He was discreet about his queerness, but it was a public secret among those who knew him. After a stint at Oxford as the first African-American Rhodes scholar, Locke returned to Harvard and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy. Upon attaining his degree, he stepped confidently into the black intellectual vanguard, although he never gained the celebrity of the hetero-patriarchal \u201crace men\u201d of his time, like W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey.\n\nIn Locke\u2019s view, publicly lauded black leadership was inhibited by its obsession with politics, protest and propaganda. In Stewart\u2019s words, Locke believed that \u201cthe function of literature, art, the theater and so on was to complete the process of self-integration\u201d and \u201cproduce a black subjectivity that could become the agent of a cultural and social revolution in America.\u201d Locke turned his beliefs into action during the Harlem Renaissance, when he developed his theory of the \u201cNew Negro,\u201d which became popular among black thought leaders. Locke\u2019s version was distinguished by his ideas about migration, modernity and the city. He preferred Greenwich Village, where he eventually bought an apartment, but Harlem was a symbol: a caldron of black diversity and cultural production. The urban black citizen of Harlem would be a new man, an artist with a novel voice and purpose, unburdened by antiquated folk traditions and tired racial stigma.\n\nPhoto\n\nStewart suggests that Locke\u2019s forays into poetry and fiction were stunted by his inability to speak openly about his sexuality. But he was a prolific essayist and critic, reviewing the work of black writers like Jean Toomer, Countee Cullen and Ren\u00e9 Maran. He edited a series of influential \u201cBronze Booklets,\u201d including Ralph Bunche\u2019s treatise \u201cA World View of Race,\u201d and managed fraught relationships with paternalistic white patrons to protect the artists he cared for and strengthen his own position in the art world. By the time Locke curated the American Negro Exposition in Chicago in 1940, his status as one of the most prominent figures in black art was beyond question.\n\nUnder Locke\u2019s stewardship, the black arts revolution of the 1920s was undeniably, if obliquely, queer. As a mentor of black artists, he was sexist and often exploitative. He ignored women almost completely and was prone to infatuation with younger, intellectually stimulating men. In some cases, his objects of affection fell in the gray area between adolescence and adulthood, though Stewart is uncertain whether Locke had partners under the age of 19. Many of these men welcomed Locke\u2019s advances as they searched for artistic direction and comfort with their own sexuality. Locke was a guide, teaching his students about fine art and gay manhood, a dance between raindrops in a storm of homophobia and racism.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nLocke\u2019s romantic partners were also muses. He indulged in their bodies and ideas, benefiting intellectually from the exchange even when his sexual desires went unconsummated. Perhaps the best example of this pattern is Locke\u2019s courtship of Langston Hughes, the poet laureate of the Harlem Renaissance, with whom Locke fell in love. Hughes never quite reciprocated Locke\u2019s adoration, but his virtuosity was magnetic. He propelled Locke toward a new appreciation of the crises and triumphs of ordinary black people. Locke\u2019s conception of black brilliance evolved through his exposure to young and attractive thinkers.\n\nThe breadth of Locke\u2019s work is stunning, and Stewart refuses to emphasize Locke\u2019s activities during the Harlem Renaissance at the expense of other contributions. Locke was never truly revered as a philosopher, but he produced original research in the field of value theory, including, for example, on the role emotions play in the formation of values and opinions. He was the first among his peers to take the anthropologist Franz Boas\u2019s work to its logical end and declare racial science illegitimate, pointing out that races were national and social groups rather than biological categories. Locke also advocated a return to African aesthetic principles, not as a counternarrative to Western racism but as a means of exalting African forms and techniques. He made a home at Howard University, where he worked for four decades despite uneasy relationships with administrators, who did not care for his lifestyle or his intellectual interests. Frail and prone to a variety of ailments, Locke died from cardiac illness in 1954.\n\nStewart treats seemingly every sentence Locke wrote with great care, reconstructing his wanderings through Europe and Africa, black theater, communism and other geographic and intellectual terrain. The cost of this choice is the length and pace of the book, which is sharply written but unlikely to get readers\u2019 adrenaline pumping. The benefits of his thoroughness, however, are manifold. Chief among them is the book\u2019s example as a master class in how to trace the lineage of a biographical subject\u2019s ideas and predilections. The attachment and longing Locke experienced in relationships with his mother, friends and lovers exerted as much influence on his work as the texts he read and lectures he attended. One finishes Stewart\u2019s book haunted by the realization that this must be true for us all.", "title": "The Philosopher Who Believed That Art Was Key to Black Liberation", "authors": ["Michael P.

Knopf. $27.95.\n\nIn the countdown to World War II, no event more aptly symbolized false hopes and Nazi duplicity than the Munich accord. In September 1938, Adolf Hitler threatened to send Wehrmacht troops into Czechoslovakia to seize the ethnic-German border regions known as the Sudetenland. Britain\u2019s prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, flew to the birthplace of the Third Reich to meet Hitler and try to stave off a conflict. Twenty-four hours later, Chamberlain returned to London, where he brandished an agreement permitting Nazi Germany to occupy the territory and pronounced four words that would forever be linked with na\u00efvet\u00e9 and appeasement: \u201cPeace for our time.\u201d\n\nRobert Harris\u2019s meticulously researched and expertly paced thriller, \u201cMunich,\u201d recounts the days leading up to the ill-fated agreement. As in most of his historical novels, Harris relegates major figures to the background, focusing on two marginal characters with intimate views of the event. Hugh Legat, a junior Foreign Service officer with an Oxford degree and fluency in German, wins Chamberlain\u2019s confidence and secures a place among the inner circle at 10 Downing Street. His fellow Oxford alumnus Paul von Hartmann, a well-bred third secretary at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, despises Hitler and plots with a handful of diplomats and officers to kill the Nazi leader. Hartmann and his co-conspirators hope to scuttle the looming Munich accord, force France and Britain to declare war on the still-unprepared Third Reich, and persuade the Wehrmacht generals to rally to their side.\n\nWhen Hartmann obtains a secret memorandum outlining Hitler\u2019s plans to seize all of Czechoslovakia and much of Europe, he alerts his fellow Oxonian through an intermediary. British intelligence enlists Legat to travel to Munich with Chamberlain to meet Hartmann, get the secret document and expose Hitler\u2019s duplicity. This sets off a dangerous game played by both Legat and Hartmann as they head to their rendezvous in Munich \u2014 where they risk exposure and, in the case of Hartmann, arrest and execution.\n\nImage\n\nHarris steeps his tale in vivid descriptions of Europe on the brink of conflict. Londoners dig slit trenches in Green Park, fit their children with gas masks and raise barrage balloons to protect against aerial attack \u2014 \u201ctiny silver torpedoes, some already thousands of feet high.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s residence at 10 Downing Street reflects the fustiness of a weakened empire: dowdy furnishings, corridors lined in linoleum, a cramped attic for advisers stranded overnight. It was, Harris writes, like \u201csome gentlemen\u2019s club that was no longer fashionable.\u201d Berlin, in contrast, brims with sinister glitz: \u201cThe dome of the Haus Vaterland, with its UFA-cinema and its giant cafe, was lit by traceries of 4,000 electric bulbs,\u201d he writes of Potsdamer Platz, the main square in the Nazi capital. \u201cOpposite it, an illuminated billboard showed a movie star with glistening jet-black hair, his face at least 10 meters high, smoking a Makedon cigarette \u2014 \u2018Perfekt!\u2019\u201d", "title": "The Plot to Kill Hitler", "authors": []}

Bloated art prices happen to be one of the many indicators of a yawning gap between rich and poor. In 1914, just before the Russian Revolution, Czar Nicholas II bought Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cBenois Madonna\u201d for $1.5 million, or about $37 million at today\u2019s prices, in a private transaction. The price at the time was more than double the previous high for any artwork.\n\nPhoto\n\nJust over a century later, in November 2017, another Leonardo da Vinci sold to another royal family for another epoch-defining price. For those with a distaste for capitalist excess, the $450.3 million bidding war won by a Saudi Arabian prince for the much-restored \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d could hardly have been a more emblematic example of \u201cgreed, and the quest for glory.\u201d\n\nBut what makes the book such a sobering read is the way the author regards Western democracy\u2019s \u201cprogressive\u201d ideologies as a contributor to the systemic failure.\n\nMr. Deneen is a trenchant critic of what he calls a \u201cliberal anticulture.\u201d He characterizes the current orthodoxy of humanities teaching as a \u201cpastless present in which the future is a foreign land,\u201d where the \u201chermeneutics of suspicion\u201d expose the culture of the past as a \u201crepository of repression.\u201d Professors, \u201cadopting a jargon comprehensible only to \u2018experts,\u2019 \u201d show their worth by \u201cdestroying the thing they studied\u201d to redress past injustices to specific groups.\n\nThe broad-brush approach of \u201cWhy Liberalism Failed\u201d is short on specifics. But the author might have chosen, for instance, out of countless examples, David Porter\u2019s essay, \u201cA Wanton Chase in a Foreign Place: Hogarth and the Gendering of Exoticism in the Eighteenth Century Interior,\u201d a recommended text for art history courses at British colleges, such as the Open University. Mr. Porter focuses on the second engraving in the series \u201cMarriage A-la-Mode,\u201d by the 18th-century British painter and printmaker, William Hogarth. It shows an unhappy husband and wife in a fashionable interior. Hogarth satirizes the wife for her penchant for Oriental porcelain, because, according to Mr. Porter, to grant the validity of Chinese taste would \u201clegitimate a regime not only of female aesthetic self-determination, but also of the autonomy of female desire more generally conceived.\u201d\n\nAnd so Hogarth joins the ever-lengthening list of misogynistic dead male artists. This doesn\u2019t exactly encourage the study of his art \u2014 or having his prints on your wall. The last set of Hogarth\u2019s six \u201cMarriage A-la-Mode\u201d engravings to appear at auction failed to sell last May at Weschler\u2019s of Washington D.C. against a low estimate of $1,500, according to Artnet.\n\nWhat Mr. Deneen identifies as liberal societies\u2019 \u201cpervasive amnesia about the past\u201d has further undermined the traditional culture of collecting. \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d might have achieved a one-off, landmark price (in an auction of contemporary art), but generally old masters are now far less fashionable with the superrich than they were in the days of the Czar of Russia. On Feb. 1, Sotheby\u2019s annual evening sale of master paintings in New York raised $48.4 million, a seemingly substantial total, until one recalls that the company\u2019s biannual evening auction of contemporary art in November raised $310.2 million.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nTHREE YEARS AGO in China, in an inexplicable trend that swept the country, tiny bean sprouts started rising from people\u2019s heads, their delicate, unsteady stems like green antennae, seemingly borne not from the dirt but from the mind. Little tulips, poppies and chrysanthemums soon followed. For a moment, it looked as if humans had suddenly been given the power to erupt into bloom. But the plants had no roots; they were made of plastic and affixed to hairpins. The fad quickly passed.\n\nThere was something rebellious about that flora popping up en masse in China\u2019s hyper-cities, wobbling over the heads of crowds like a garden taking to the streets \u2014 a protest, however unconscious, against the receding natural world. Some 5,000 miles away, in the wilderness of Ethiopia\u2019s Omo Valley, nomadic tribes still string veils of blushing pink buds, twist grass into shaggy wigs and wear single, giant leaves as skullcaps, as they have always done. According to the photographer Hans Silvester, who documented the tribes in his 2008 book, \u201cNatural Fashion,\u201d the decorations are swiftly made and are as much practical as pretty, shielding their wearers against the relentless sun.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nIndeed, long before makeup or millinery or jewelry, our first adornments were plants and flowers, and our love for them was \u2014 and is \u2014 universal. Perhaps we have never known better. But how and why we wear them has shifted over the years, from the laurel wreaths of the ancient world, bestowed on victors (and deemed so necessary to the functioning of a martial culture that Darius III of Persia, in the fourth century B.C., kept 46 men employed just to weave them), to the floral crowns donned by animists in medieval Europe to dance around maypoles and welcome spring.\n\nDuring the eighth-century Tang dynasty, the emperor would ask his concubines to tuck flowers in their hair, then release a butterfly into the crowd; the woman it landed on would share the emperor\u2019s bed that night. No wonder Christians in early modern Europe and colonial America were so suspicious of blossoms\u2019 associations with pagan symbols of fertility. Nevertheless, they soon co-opted them to represent chastity: Only a virgin could wear a bridal wreath, which might be burned on her wedding night, a lurid metaphor for loss of innocence. In 18th-century Mexico, an entire genre of portraiture was devoted to monjas coronadas, or crowned nuns, young novices pictured taking their vows of celibacy in teetering headdresses made of roses. Meanwhile, across the ocean in France, Marie Antoinette\u2019s hairdresser, L\u00e9onard Auti\u00e9, was busy creating voluminous coiffures punctured by fresh flowers meant to conjure a shimmering Eden. Ladies of the court hid vials of water in their hair to keep blooms alive, and were no doubt relieved when fashion moved on to silk buds.\n\nVideo\n\nIn the past century, there was Frida Kahlo, her plaits threaded with blood-red dahlias; Billie Holiday, rarely onstage without gardenias sweeping down over her left ear, the blossoms nearly as large as gramophone horns; loose-limbed Joni Mitchell, in a daisy-chain crown, asking for peace, love and understanding; and the modern-day women that emulate her, in festivals from Glastonbury to Coachella.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTODAY, ON THE far side of the Industrial Revolution, the diminishment of nature brings a new urgency to these old, evanescent embellishments. \u201cI don\u2019t really make things to last,\u201d says Joshua Werber, a Brooklyn-based florist and botanic milliner. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m done wiring the last flower, the first flower has wilted.\u201d His dramatic floral headpieces have included a turban of hellebores, a lone angel\u2019s trumpet pleated like an Issey Miyake dress and gladioli entwined to evoke a slanted white straw hat once paired with Christian Dior\u2019s 1947 Bar suit. The Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, embracing transience and natural imperfections, informs both his work and that of the Australian Roz Borg, who, under the name Arozona, makes jewelry out of small succulents: sheaths for fingernails and rings that nearly engulf the hand. As art, they exist only for a moment, continuing to live and grow as people wear them; but afterward, they can be replanted, and therefore returned to the earth.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThen there\u2019s Lauren Liana Shearer, who lives on the island of Maui, and who approaches the Hawaiian art of lei-making as a way of recording a threatened landscape. Traditionally, the gift of a lei marks the most powerful moments in life, when a threshold is crossed: birth, graduation, marriage, even death, with the vivid strands laid over the funeral casket. Ali\u2018i (chiefs) declared an end to war by twining maile vines together as a peace accord. But a lei can also be simply a tribute to the islands\u2019 beauty, improvised from flowers foraged while wandering back roads. Shearer subscribes to this spirit of chance and quest, which comes with both risk (fending off fire ants, evading toxic sap) and the reward of the unexpected. Like the early Hawaiians, who called upon the full breadth of their surroundings to weave lei \u2014 even braiding together human hair and sperm-whale teeth \u2014 she is drawn to plants and flowers less commonly found at airport lei stands, such as pale tendrils of the flower spike of the foxtail agave, wrinkled banana flowers, austere Norfolk Island pine and lichen. She might render a familiar flower unrecognizable by favoring its calyx over its petals, or juxtapose the same flower at different stages of development, from tight whorled bud to gaping blossom. Her use of lustrous seeds, waxy leaves and the high gloss of anthurium plays tricks on the eye, the flora resembling bits of Bakelite, turquoise or coral \u2014 giving her lei an unusual and distinctly modern feel. She\u2019s equally attentive to the environment, recycling wedding flowers and picking invasive species that have preyed upon Hawaii\u2019s ecosystem. More than 40 percent of America\u2019s endangered or threatened plant species are found in Hawaii, including the lonely kopiko, a tree whose branches offer up small white blooms shaped like lips about to whistle, and of which only about 30 remain in the wild.\n\nIndeed, what makes our love of flowers even more poignant is that they are ephemeral not just as individuals but as a concept: The days of flowers may be numbered. Some scientists estimate that one flowering plant species dies out every day. By century\u2019s end, half the world\u2019s flowers could be gone, and with them, a large part of the world\u2019s splendor. It\u2019s a shocking reminder of how tenuous our hold is on earth. Against the age of the universe, our lives are not much longer than a blossom\u2019s. So we seize what we can from our pillaged landscape and, like our ancestors before us, take beauty, however fleeting, where we find it. Decorating ourselves with flowers may be one of the few things that still unites us as humans, as one tribe across the world \u2014 our capacity to transform ourselves with nothing more than a handful of fallen petals; to find, in a bloom slipped behind an ear, glory.", "title": "The Power of Wearing Flowers", "authors": ["Ligaya Mishan"]}

{"date": "2018-02-11 00:00:00", "text": "States that set out a decade ago to trim prison costs have learned that success lies in a few areas \u2014 rolling back draconian sentencing that drove up prison populations in the first place, and remaking parole and probation systems, which have, in numerous cases, sent as many or even more people to jail for rule violations as the courts do for new crimes.\n\nSignificant progress has been made on both fronts. Yet New York, a national leader in reducing its prison population, could do much more to reform its parole and probation systems.\n\nThese systems were established across in the United States in the 19th century. The premise was that steering people who commit minor offenses to probation, rather than prison, and shortening prison sentences with parole in exchange for good conduct further the goal of rehabilitation. But that notion fell out of favor after the country embraced mass incarceration in the late 20th century, driving up the prison population from about 200,000 at the start of the 1970s to a peak of 1.6 million at the end of the 2000s.\n\nThe woefully underfunded parole system fell in line with the jail-first agenda. Parole officers, who were buried under massive caseloads, sent parolees back inside for technical violations, like failing drug tests, missing curfew or socializing with friends they had been forbidden to see. With nearly five million people in the nation under supervision \u2014 more than twice the number housed in prisons and jails \u2014 the parole and probation systems have become what corrections researchers now describe as a significant driver of recidivism.", "title": "Opinion | The Problem With Parole", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-20 00:00:00", "text": "Psychologists have now turned their attention to self-compassion in adolescents. Their initial findings reveal an unusually powerful intervention for stressed out young adults, a potential crown jewel of resilience interventions.\n\nLate last year, Imogen Marsh, Stella Chan and Angus Macbeth at the University of Edinburgh published a meta-analysis of research on self-compassion in young people in the journal Mindfulness. They synthesized studies on more than 7,000 adolescents from six countries, ranging in age from 10 to 19. They found that teens with high levels of the trait were most likely to report lower levels of distress caused by anxiety and depression \u2014 especially when facing chronic academic stress.\n\nAdolescence is a developmental moment of peak stress, and a teen\u2019s heightened self-consciousness (\u201cDo I look weird? Did I just sound stupid in class?\u201d) cranks up the volume of the inner critic. Self-compassion encourages mindfulness, or noticing your feelings without judgment; self-kindness, or talking to yourself in a soothing way; and common humanity, or thinking about how others might be suffering similarly.\n\nThis last step is particularly salubrious for adolescents: Many believe that \u201cI\u2019m the only one going through this,\u201d which exacerbates feelings of isolation and shame.\n\nThe teens I work with are prone to catastrophizing when facing a problem (\u201cI\u2019ll never get into college,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never get a good job\u201d). For them, the mindfulness step of self-compassion \u2014 which asks them to zero in on a feeling instead of an imagined, exaggerated outcome \u2014 is especially grounding. My students find self-kindness most challenging, so I ask them to imagine how they would comfort a close friend struggling with the same challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s almost no one whom we treat as badly as ourselves,\u201d Dr. Neff told me.\n\nSkeptics like the Princeton athlete in my workshop worry that self-compassion is indolence in disguise: an excuse to lower your standards or give up instead of \u201csucking it up\u201d and dealing. As an educator from a mostly immigrant, bootstrapping family, I once might have agreed with her. Self-compassion is precisely the kind of New-Agey trend some of my crustier relatives might have called piffle, a way to brush off mistakes instead of owning them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Instead, it lets you own up to a tough moment without paying for it with your self-worth. This new logic teaches students that they don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy.\n\nI have been stunned by the reaction of students of all ages to the practice. In a public high school auditorium in Hopewell Valley, N.J., in November, I led more than 600 juniors and seniors through a self-compassion meditation. I asked them to place their hands on their hearts, and to feel the pressure and warmth of a kind hand. Their silence was respectful and profound. Many students were crying. They had never thought to approach their own setbacks with gentleness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt a local elementary school in Northampton, Mass., I volunteer teaching self-compassion to children as young as 5. Kindergartners share embarrassing moments (\u201cI fell off the monkey bars in front of my friends\u201d) and practice hugging themselves as a form of self-soothing. First graders sit in a circle holding hands, reminding each other they are not alone.\n\nBut self-compassion may be most critical in adolescence, when researchers say it is at its lowest levels. This is especially true for teen girls, who show the lowest levels of self-compassion of any group of youth, and who experience a sudden drop in the trait between middle and high school.\n\nLate last year the first self-compassion curriculum for teens, \u201cMaking Friends With Yourself: A Mindful Self-Compassion Program for Teens and Young Adults,\u201d was developed by Karen Bluth, assistant professor at the University of North Carolina\u2019s School of Medicine, and Lorraine Hobbs, director of the youth and family programs at the University of California San Diego Center for Mindfulness.\n\nInspired by a similar curriculum for adults created by Dr. Neff and the psychologist Christopher Germer, the program\u2019s evaluations revealed lowered stress in middle and high school participants, compared with those in a control group. Participants also had lower anxiety and depression, and elevated resilience and healthy risk taking.\n\nTo teach their children how to show themselves grace in the face of a challenge, I coach parents to model self-compassion in the face of everyday setbacks. Instead of cursing at yourself when you lose your keys, verbalize mindfulness: \u201cI am feeling so frustrated right now.\u201d When describing a disappointment at work, demonstrate what self-kindness sounds like: \u201cI did my best, and I\u2019ll make sure not to make that mistake next time.\u201d When you burn dinner, recognize common humanity: \u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not the only bummed out parent feeding their kids pizza tonight.\u201d\n\nAmong college students, the need for such thinking is high. A 2016 report from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health, using data from 139 college and university counseling centers, found a surge in demand for mental health services, with anxiety and depression the most common concerns. As schools scramble to handle it, they might consider training peer educators and professional staff members in self-compassion.\n\nIf more students use self-compassion to reframe their failures, they may discover more nourishing sources of motivation and healthier strategies to pursue their goals.", "title": "The Promise of Self-Compassion for Stressed-Out Teens", "authors": ["Rachel Simmons"]}
{"date": "2018-02-14 00:00:00", "text": "This pull exerted itself weakly but meaningfully on the tax bill, which was dominated by a corporate tax cut but also reshaped around the edges to cut more taxes for the middle class and families. It exerted itself a little more on Trump\u2019s decision to replace Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chairman with Jerome Powell, which amounted to a vote for a looser monetary policy rather than the hard-money approach that Republicans had consistently favored under Obama. And then on the budget that just passed Congress, Trumpism was more like a Death Star tractor beam, dragging the G.O.P. well away from all its professed Obama-era priorities: Gone was the sequester, gone was all the talk of cutting and capping and balancing, and instead we got a guns-and-butter budget that would have done Lyndon Johnson or George W. Bush proud.\n\nCombine this flood of spending with the Trump White House\u2019s attempt to get a skills-based and restrictionist immigration reform through Congress, throw in some smaller ideas under consideration, like the Marco Rubio-Ivanka Trump paid parental leave plan, and you have a Year 2 of the Trump era in which Trumpism actually seems meaningful again. Not as a completely coherent agenda, obviously, but as a tendency, a force pulling conservatism toward a nationalism-infused deficit-financed populism even when Ryan and Mick Mulvaney are theoretically setting the agenda.\n\nThis populist pull makes hypocrites of many Republican legislators, as liberals are eager to point out, since it induces them to vote for budgets that they would have denounced as socialism under Barack Obama. But there is pathos to the hypocrisy as well as cynicism. Republicans denounce big spending while in opposition because opposition offers the luxury of principle, and then they accept spending once in power because the nature of governance make them feel like prisoners of the public\u2019s will \u2026 and then they look forward to defeat, at some level, because it liberates them to return the true faith, free of the corrupting responsibility to please a public bigger than their base.\n\nBut if the pathos is real, it is also ultimately somewhat stupid. A political party is not a church with standards too holy for this world, stooping to govern and then reclaiming its sanctity once it returns to opposition. Conservatism should be a governing philosophy, not an endless cycle of corruption followed by exile and repentance. And the fact that \u201cpopulism\u201d or \u201cTrumpism\u201d \u2014 like \u201ccompassionate\u201d or \u201cbig government\u201d conservatism before it \u2014 exerts an inevitable pull on Republican administrations and majorities is a sign that a Trumpian or George W. Bushian mix of cultural conservatism and economic populism is in fact the natural basis for an American center-right majority, resisted only by a Republican ideological apparatus that persists in believing in a limited-government ideal so fine no actual government can implement it.\n\nThis reality was apparent to Trump, in his crude and demagogic way, as it was apparent to Bush before him. But it is not apparent to enough Republicans at the moment for the party to act on it effectively. So instead of a clear focus on the kind of populism that might advance conservative priorities \u2014 direct spending to support work and family and marriage, above all \u2014 we get doomed cavalry charges against popular programs followed by a shrugging acceptance of more funding for the welfare-state status quo.\n\nTrump is not the right man to break this cycle. But the recent drift back toward campaign-season Trumpism in defiance of the White House\u2019s official blueprints is a sign for those with eyes to see. The populist center-right is the only place where Republicans can stand and plausibly hope to govern. It would be nice if someday they tried to do so, not haphazardly and hypocritically and often stupidly, but intelligently and consistently and well.", "title": "Opinion | The Pull of Populism", "authors": []}

What I wanted to capture was the texture, and it eluded me over five days and many batches.\n\nI knew what gave the Fossier cookies their snap. It was printed on the package: ammonium carbonate, also known as smelling salts. A small amount produces an airy, brittle crumb that\u2019s hard to duplicate otherwise. Relied on as a leavener, it also acts as a preservative, because it has a dehydrating effect. I found some (French recipes often tell you to ask a pharmacist for it; mine came from a specialty shop), but I couldn\u2019t bear the smell \u2014 even though it dissipates in baking, just opening the box was more than I could manage. And so I threw it away and decided instead to depend on technique and the recipe\u2019s simple ingredients: eggs, sugar, flour, cornstarch, leavening, vanilla and powdered sugar for the top.

He grew up in a stable, middle-class family, the only child of a paper salesman and a schoolteacher. As a child, he took advantage of government-run after-school programs and was placed in \u201cgifted\u201d classes. At 14, he searched online for the \u201cbest high school in America,\u201d turning up Phillips Academy, a prestigious private school in Andover, Mass.; Mr. Hughes applied and talked his way into a scholarship. All these factors, he argues, factored into his success even before he landed in a dorm room with Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn \u201cFair Shot,\u201d he offers a solution to balance the scale: a guaranteed income of $500 a month for adults earning less than $50,000, including nontraditional workers like parents and students. His proposal is that such a program be paid for through a tax on the country\u2019s highest earners, those whose annual income is $250,000 or more. His plan would reach 60 million adults and lift 20 million out of poverty overnight, he writes, while providing those in the middle class with more financial stability.\n\n\u201cThe guaranteed income as an idea is so simple that oftentimes people just sort of skip over the power of cash itself,\u201d Mr. Hughes said. \u201cWe think, Oh my God, income inequality \u2014 it\u2019s so incredible, all the stats are so insane, but what can we do about it? It\u2019s got to be education or it\u2019s got to be more job training. It\u2019s got to be a higher minimum wage. I say, \u2018Yes, yes and yes.\u2019\u201d But we need to do more, he insists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Economic Security Project\u2019s office is part university library, part tech start-up, with dark leather and wood furniture alongside a white meeting pod near the entrance. It seems to reflect Mr. Hughes\u2019s sensibilities \u2014 his admiration for old, established institutions and his embrace of digital technology. When I arrive for our interview, Mr. Hughes greets me warmly, and we sit in what appears to be the office\u2019s only conference room, enclosed by a glass wall. His Southern accent is barely detectable, and in conversation, he is measured and cautious, laying out his argument with his hands, becoming riled only when I bring up the tax bill (\u201cthe most perplexing and infuriating move\u201d) and the fact that some might view their success as completely self-generated (\u201cthat\u2019s just flat wrong\u201d).\n\nBefore he started the Economic Security Project, Mr. Hughes had been working on the issue of the guaranteed income internationally through GiveDirectly, a nonprofit that, as the name suggests, operates a cash transfer program that puts money into the hands of those who need it. Mr. Hughes was inspired by the organization\u2019s ideals, and he started to wonder whether a similar model could work domestically.\n\n\u201cThere was no real organization in the United States focused on exploring how a guaranteed income might work,\u201d he said.\n\nBut rather than go in \u201cguns blazing,\u201d he explained, \u201cwe said: \u2018This is a promising idea. Let\u2019s bring together a network of people to think about this collaboratively and see where it goes.\u2019\u201d The Economic Security Project was originally conceived as a temporary, two-year initiative, but has since been extended to 2020.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Hughes\u2019s cautiousness is a direct result of his experience at The New Republic. Despite his intention to \u201cmake it a publication that millions of people would adore and really value,\u201d the result was not so idyllic. He invested $25 million, moved the magazine to a slick new office and hired top talent from other publications. By late 2014, his investment was not paying off, and he brought in Guy Vidra, a former Yahoo executive, to be the C.E.O., hoping he might be able to make The New Republic a digital media company. Mr. Vidra and Mr. Hughes decided to replace Franklin Foer, the editor at the time, but the news reached Mr. Foer first, and he resigned, prompting mass resignations across the publication. What followed was a media maelstrom, and a little over a year later, unable to turn the publication\u2019s profits around, Mr. Hughes sold the magazine.\n\n\u201cChris was pretty anxious about where things were headed,\u201d Mr. Foer said on a recent call, adding: \u201cThere were lots of larger forces remaking journalism, and because of Chris\u2019s biography and because of some of the ham-fisted ways in which he handled things, he kind of fell into a morality play. It was pretty easy to cast the story as a parable about journalism, and I think that helps explain the heat of the coverage that fell on him.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Mr. Hughes said he regretted his approach at The New Republic. \u201cI went in with very big-picture kinds of goals and went too far too fast,\u201d he said, before I could ask. \u201cNow, I work on this big-picture, similarly idealistic kind of idea of a world where everyone has some basic financial security through cash, but I don\u2019t think we necessarily need to start off by giving $1,000 to everybody.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Branko Milanovic, a leading scholar on income inequality, and Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, both believe the plan is unrealistic given the partisan divisions of the current political climate. Mr. Baker also noted that policy changes to restructure the economy, such as weaker patent and copyright laws and public funding for generic medication, were a more urgent need. The Stanford professor and economist Nicholas Bloom brought up the potential for fraud, adding that government enforcement would be difficult.\n\nMr. Hughes is aware that his proposal is far-reaching. \u201cThis is a big idea and it\u2019s an expensive idea, but I do think that it is in line with the scale of the problem, which is also immense,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hughes said his own windfall gave him the mental space to think about and pursue his goals, and now, he feels a responsibility to pay it forward. When I ask him where this impulse comes from, his face softens. \u201cFrom my parents.\u201d His father wanted him to be successful, he explained, but \u201cthere was also a sense that you don\u2019t do better at the expense of others.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGiving people cash, in Mr. Hughes\u2019s view, is not only the most effective way to tackle inequality today, it is also the most humane: \u201cIt\u2019s truly a belief that people can be trusted and deserve the opportunity to design their lives, to chase their own dreams.\u201d", "title": "The Redemption of Chris Hughes", "authors": ["Concepci\u00f3n De Le\u00f3n"]}

Ryan of Wisconsin, now the House speaker, said in a floor debate in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out and borrow four times as much money this year than we ever have in the history of this country in a single year. This is not just a road to stagnation, it is a road to stagflation.\u201d\n\nFiscal hawks say that assessment is more applicable to the economy today.\n\n\u201cWe have a growing economy, the labor market\u2019s tight, we don\u2019t have a lot of idle resources,\u201d said Matthew Mitchell, the director of the Project for the Study of American Capitalism at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \u201cBasically, the very best argument for Keynesian economics doesn\u2019t apply now. So it really is the time to be austere.\u201d\n\nWhile divided government in the last six years of Mr. Obama\u2019s term produced constraints on spending, Mr. Mitchell noted, Republican control under Mr. Trump appears to be ripping them up. Democrats are helping to do that on the spending side. The spending agreements pending in Congress appear to be so large, in part, because Democrats have demanded domestic discretionary spending increases alongside large increases in military spending pushed by Republican defense hawks.\n\nDemocrats largely denounce Republicans for playing down deficit concerns now, after years of warning that government borrowing was holding the economy back. \u201cThere was a far greater need for economic stimulus in 2011 than today,\u201d said Neera Tanden, a former Obama adviser who is the president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress think tank.\n\nBut some liberals welcome the extra fiscal juice and its potential to help workers who struggled in the slow-growth years after the recession.\n\nJared Bernstein, a liberal economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who was one of the Obama administration\u2019s stimulus architects in 2009, opposed the Trump tax bill but supports efforts to stimulate the economy when unemployment is low, in hopes of boosting wage growth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of recklessness of Team Trump that could kind of rebound to the benefit of people,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said in an interview, before alluding to the possibility that there are still workers outside the labor force who could be drawn back to work by a hotter economy.\n\n\u201cAs long as there is still slack in corners of the labor market,\u201d he said, \u201cthen this kind of fiscal stimulus of the economy near full employment is a kind of test I support.\u201d", "title": "The Republican Fiscal Stimulus Could Be Bigger Than Obama\u2019s", "authors": []}

To pull it off, they are undermining the credibility of the law enforcement community that Republicans once defended so ardently, on the noble-sounding claim that the American public must know the truth.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for it.\n\nReports suggest that the three-and-a-half-page document \u2014 produced by the staff of Representative Devin Nunes (R-White House), who somehow still leads the House Intelligence Committee despite his own record of shilling for President Trump, and who is supposed to be recused from these matters \u2014 has nothing to do with truth or accountability. Rather, it appears to be misleading propaganda from people who are terrified by the Russia investigation and determined to derail it by any means necessary.\n\nMr. Nunes\u2019s cut-and-paste job ostensibly shows that anti-Trump F.B.I. investigators conspired to trick a federal intelligence court into granting them a warrant to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, because of his Russian connections \u2014 in that way corrupting the entire Russia investigation from the start. How did the investigators manage this feat? By relying on a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, but hiding from the court that Mr. Steele\u2019s work was being funded by Democrats, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and thus was hopelessly biased.\n\nThere\u2019s so much deception and obfuscation going on here that it\u2019s hard to know where to start.\n\nFirst, Mr. Nunes and his fellow Republicans have treated the dossier like the holy grail for the Russia investigation, but it didn\u2019t reach the F.B.I. until the inquiry was already underway \u2014 prompted in mid-2016 by suspicious contacts between Russians and George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.

Voters of all ages with four-year and postgraduate degrees favored Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by a nine-point margin. For college graduates under 30 \u2014 the most itinerant group \u2014 the difference was a fat 15 percentage points.\n\nSo red states with high rates of domestic in-migration such as Arizona, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and Florida are very likely adding Democrats faster than Republicans \u2014 even when taking into account flows of retirees seeking warm Southern weather.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t constitute an urgent problem for Republicans if Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive ethno-nationalist identity politics wasn\u2019t already intensifying nonwhite voters\u2019 disdain for the party. Exit polls in November\u2019s Virginia governor\u2019s race vividly illustrate the party\u2019s perilous electoral position. Ed Gillespie, an establishment Republican, won 57 percent of the white vote with a race-baiting Trumpist campaign, but an abysmal 19 percent of the nonwhite vote.\n\nTexas is already a majority-minority state, and its voting-age population will follow suit next year. Arizona is set to flip to majority-minority status in 2023, and Georgia and Florida are set to follow in 2025 and 2028. A more inclusive Republican Party could hold these states indefinitely, but the Trump party\u2019s pivot to white identity populism has used up its slack.\n\nIn that context, the effects of the tax changes on relocation choices could make a difference sooner rather than later. Make no mistake, state fiscal and regulatory policy really does matter.\n\nResidents in the states with the highest net in-migration rates bear a relatively low tax burden. Economists have only begun to study the effects of tax rates on particular subgroups of movers, but recent results are suggestive. In a 2017 paper published in the American Economic Review, the economists Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and Daniel J. Wilson of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco looked at addresses on patent filings to track the movements of top scientists and found that \u201cstate taxes have significant effect on the geographical location of star scientists and possibly other highly skilled workers.\u201d\n\nThe effects of housing costs are clearer and larger. Andrii Parkhomenko, an economist at the University of Southern California, has estimated that the populations of high-productivity, high-wage Los Angeles, and New York might have been, respectively, 40 percent and 60 percent larger than they are today had their land-use policies allowed supply to better keep pace with demand, thus curbing housing costs.", "title": "Opinion | The Republican Tax Act Could Turn Texas Blue", "authors": []}

Nondefense spending relative to the economy is the lowest it has been since 1961 \u2014 3.1 percent of gross domestic product, far below the long-term average of 3.8 percent, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nDilapidated roads, bridges, railways and water systems need to be upgraded and repaired. Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida still need help recovering from last year\u2019s hurricanes and making themselves more resilient to future storms. Lawmakers also must spend more to end the opioid epidemic and increase access to substance abuse treatment. The budget bill only partly addresses many of these and other needs.\n\nBut the deal Mr. Trump approved on Friday also includes a $165 billion increase in military spending over two years, more than the Trump administration had even requested. Military spending will jump to $716 billion in 2019, from $634 billion in 2017. In inflation-adjusted terms, that would put the Pentagon\u2019s budget well above the Reagan buildup of the 1980s and nearly as high as in 2010 \u2014 the peak of military spending since World War II \u2014 when more than 200,000 troops were deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Even before this latest increase, the Pentagon\u2019s budget exceeded the combined military spending of the next eight biggest defense spenders globally \u2014 a list that includes Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India.\n\nSome of the defense increases are understandable. The cost per active service member grew by 61 percent from 2001 to 2012, after adjusting for inflation, because of new and expanded benefits such as incentive bonuses, raises and increased health care expenses. But other increases arose from a dysfunctional budget process manipulated by a defense industry that woos Congress with unneeded or extravagant weapons. These include the F-35 fighter jet, missile defense programs that are plagued with problems, and a plan to modernize the nuclear arsenal over a period of 30 years at a cost of more than $1 trillion.", "title": "Opinion | The Republicans Have Become the Party of Debt", "authors": []}

What connects certain television shows, movies and stage productions to ancient folkways is a particular blend of novelty and familiarity. You see the same faces again and again in new disguises. The afternoon\u2019s clown is the evening\u2019s tragic hero; yesterday\u2019s princess is tomorrow\u2019s wicked stepmother.\n\nTo be more specific: The young actor Evan Peters, who creeped you out as a sweet-faced, homicidal teenager in the first season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d on FX, returns in subsequent seasons as a falsely accused murderer, a reanimated fraternity brother, Charles Manson, Andy Warhol and Jesus. This is not an exhaustive list. In the same series \u2014 the flagship production of what we might call the Ryan Murphy Troupe \u2014 Jessica Lange has been a sinister nun, a witch and a maniacal, musical mistress of ceremonies.\n\nTo take another example: Ben Stiller, a fixture of several distinct, overlapping quasi-troupes (including his own), shows up in \u201cGreenberg,\u201d Noah Baumbach\u2019s 2010 romantic comedy, as the misanthropic, underachieving brother of a successful Los Angeles hotelier. He cycles back into the Baumbach universe in 2015\u2019s \u201cWhile We\u2019re Young,\u201d playing the somewhat less misanthropic, not as spectacularly underachieving son-in-law of a prominent documentary filmmaker. And then, a couple of years later in \u201cThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),\u201d he\u2019s the successful sibling, a financial adviser based in L.A., struggling to keep his misanthropy in check and dealing with the narcissism of his father, played by Dustin Hoffman. (Hoffman was accused late last year by several women of sexual misconduct or assault. He has apologized to one of the women and has denied other allegations through his lawyer.)\n\nIf you are a habitual visitor to Baumbach\u2019s galaxy, you are accustomed to seeing some of the same faces in altered guises. Florence Marr, played by Greta Gerwig in \u201cGreenberg,\u201d is not the same person as Frances Hamilton, Gerwig\u2019s character in \u201cFrances Ha\u201d (2013) or Brooke in \u201cMistress America\u201d (2015).

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "It has fallen upon Trump, as president of the United States, to respond to this momentous historic shift, and he has done so with his characteristic mix of threats, boasts and volte-faces. But to grasp China\u2019s economic achievement, and its ramifications, it is imperative to ask: Why has a market economy directed by a Communist state become the world\u2019s second-largest? Or, to rephrase the question: Why shouldn\u2019t it have? Why shouldn\u2019t China\u2019s rise have happened the way it did, with state-led economic planning, industrial subsidies and little or no regard for the rules of \u201cfree trade\u201d?\n\nThe economic success of East Asian countries like Japan in the 20th century had already invalidated the article of faith invoked by Trump in Davos: that nations can advance only by eliminating barriers to the free movement of goods and capital and by minimizing the role of government in the economy. But these historical lessons have long been obscured by economic orthodoxy, one that Trump\u2019s \u2014 and China\u2019s \u2014 unexpected ascents have now exposed to critical scrutiny.\n\nIn his most recent book, \u201cStraight Talk on Trade,\u201d the Harvard professor Dani Rodrik castigates fellow economists for holding fast to a simple-minded view of free trade and globalization, one that he believes has caused economic chaos and political backlash across the West. \u201cAre economists,\u201d he asks, \u201cresponsible for Donald Trump\u2019s shocking victory in the U.S. presidential election?\u201d This might be overstating the case. But it is true that the argument that free markets equal progress was most eloquently and influentially advocated by the American economist Milton Friedman.\n\nThe paradoxes of China\u2019s rise today are best illuminated by Friedman\u2019s querulous visit to the country in 1980, when China was desperately poor. The Nobel laureate from Chicago was then cementing his reputation as an apostle of free markets. He had just published \u201cFree to Choose,\u201d a book that was written with his wife, Rose, and later turned into a television series featuring, among others, Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Donald Rumsfeld. Friedman\u2019s argument, that \u201cthe world runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests,\u201d would shape American economic policy for decades to come. He helped disparage the idea, exemplified most vividly by Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, that government had a legitimate, and often indispensable, role to play in advancing economic development and protecting the vulnerable. As his keen disciple Reagan famously put it, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d\n\nFriedman\u2019s fervent advocacy of free trade and the efficiency of unregulated markets gave intellectual ballast to the so-called Washington Consensus. Free markets, the thinking went, not only generated wealth for all nations but also maximized consumer choice, reduced prices and optimized the use of scarce resources. Friedman\u2019s faith in the efficiency of markets came to constitute what John Stuart Mill referred to as \u201cthe deep slumber of a decided opinion.\u201d\n\nFriedman was the most influential proponent of free trade since Adam Smith declared it, in 1776, the basis of the wealth of nations. But in 1980, few people in China, including the academics who invited Friedman to a lecture tour, knew that their American guest was an impatient, even volatile, ideologue.\n\nA series of (often comical) misunderstandings ensued. Friedman complained about the Chinese man with a \u201cterrible body odor\u201d who received him at the Beijing airport; the man turned out to be one of his academic hosts. Friedman\u2019s lectures in praise of free markets were met with bewilderment. His assertion that capitalism was superior to socialism disturbed the Chinese greatly. Some of the more agitated Chinese economists went in a delegation to Friedman\u2019s hotel to lecture him about the achievements of their regime.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFriedman, who (erroneously) saw Japan and South Korea as brilliant examples of open, competitive markets, was understandably impatient in China; the country embodied everything that was wrong with government planning. Indeed, China in 1980 was just lurching out of Mao Zedong\u2019s calamitous experiments. Deng Xiaoping\u2019s government was trying to improvise new solutions to the country\u2019s economic backwardness, which officials thought had exposed China to humiliation in the 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cDevelopment,\u201d Deng said, \u201cis the only truth. If we don\u2019t develop, we will be bullied.\u201d And national development, in Deng\u2019s view, could be achieved by a variety of means. His flexible attitude was summed up by a much-popularized Chinese maxim: \u201cCross the river by feeling for the stones.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese couldn\u2019t help bristling at Friedman\u2019s blunt dismissals of their government. Despite horrific disasters, the Chinese state had drastically raised literacy and life-expectancy levels. Also, the Chinese were then seeking a third way: They looked to Japan and Singapore rather than the United States for economic models that would accelerate growth without endangering the authority of the Communist Party. The Chinese saw little of value in an American proponent of laissez faire. Friedman left China, angrily claiming that his hosts were \u201cunbelievably ignorant about how a market or capitalist system works.\u201d\n\nFriedman died in 2006, shortly before the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. The extensive political aftershocks of that crisis arguably include the election of a protectionist to the highest office in the United States, who has threatened to cancel decades of commitments to free trade at the risk of alienating his country\u2019s closest allies.\n\nAs bewildered (and appalled) as Friedman would most likely have been by Trump\u2019s demonization of free trade, he would have found it still harder to explain why China, run by a Communist Party, has emerged as central to the global capitalist economy. For the Chinese regime achieved this not by liberating its 1.4 billion citizens to maximize their private interests in unfettered markets but by controlling its currency, owning large businesses and intervening heavily in investment decisions by private companies.\n\nIndeed, economic history reveals that great economic powers have always become great because of activist states. Regardless of the mystical properties claimed for it, the invisible hand of self-interest depends on the visible and often heavy hand of government. To take only one instance, British gunboats helped impose free trade on 19th-century China \u2014 a lesson not lost on the Chinese. Britain was protectionist before it was a free-trading nation. The United States itself was, while industrializing, the \u201cmother country,\u201d as the economic historian Paul Bairoch wrote, \u201cand bastion of modern protectionism.\u201d Its average tariffs in the late 19th century were nearly as high \u2014 45 percent \u2014 as the steepest ones Trump has slapped on imports of washing machines. The philosophical father of economic protectionism is, in fact, Alexander Hamilton, the founder of the American financial system, whose pupils included the Germans, the Japanese and, indirectly, the Chinese.\n\nNo story is as instructive as that of the Japanese, arguably the most diligent of Hamilton\u2019s disciples. Post-1945 Japan preceded China as the hub of regional and intercontinental trade networks. Soon after its disastrous part in World War II, Japan helped revitalize Asia and by the mid \u201990s was the biggest investor and exporter in most East Asian countries; it gave more foreign aid and sent more tourists to them and was the biggest buyer of their raw commodities. What\u2019s more, it offered a model for development that combined a market economy with state intervention \u2014 one that China was even then beginning to learn from.\n\nHow did Japan, a country devastated by a world war that had few natural resources of its own, achieve economic primacy in Asia? Friedman\u2019s explanation in \u201cFree to Choose\u201d was that \u201cfree trade set off a process that revolutionized Japan and the lives of its people.\u201d Francis Fukuyama, who proclaimed the end of history in 1989, credited Japan\u2019s success to \u201ceconomic liberalism\u201d of the kind espoused by Adam Smith. But the Japanese followed a very different model, one adopted from Hamilton.\n\nJapan learned early the political risks of economic stagnation. At the height of 19th-century imperialism, it signed a humiliating treaty that subjected its trade policy to the control of five Western powers, deprived it of the right to impose tariffs, set radically low import duties and gave foreign residents in trading ports extraterritorial status. Smarting from such insults, the conservative Meiji rulers of Japan became obsessed with regaining their sovereignty and protecting themselves from foreign tormentors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this endeavor, they looked to Germany. Unified in 1871, Germany was scrambling to catch up with industrialized Britain. To do so, it borrowed from recipes of national development proposed by Hamilton soon after the Americans broke free of their British overlords. In his \u201cReport on the Subject of Manufactures,\u201d submitted to Congress in 1791, Hamilton used the potent term \u201cinfant\u201d industries to argue for economic protectionism. Hamilton\u2019s father was Scottish. Born in the West Indies, then a British colony, Hamilton was keenly aware of how the British practiced protectionism: preventing colonies from competing while selling their own goods around the world. In his view, infant nations needed room to maneuver before they could compete with established industrial powers. The United States embraced many of Hamilton\u2019s recommendations; the beneficiaries were, first, the textile and iron industries and then steel.\n\nIt was Hamilton\u2019s formula, rather than free trade, that made the United States the world\u2019s fastest-growing economy in the 19th century and into the 1920s. And that formula was embraced by other nations coming late to international economic competition. Hamilton\u2019s most influential student was a German economist named Friedrich List, who lived in the United States from 1825 until the 1830s and wrote a book titled \u201cOutlines of American Political Economy.\u201d On his return to Germany, List attacked the free-market gospel preached by Britain as sheer opportunism. In his view, the British could afford to kick away the ladder of protectionism they had climbed to the summit of global industry and manufacture. He was all for free trade, but only after young industries had been nurtured in a protective environment. Applying List\u2019s lessons, Germany moved with spectacular speed from an agrarian to an industrial economy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Economic liberalism was not a feasible option. The visible hand \u2014 the state rather than the market \u2014 was needed to guide development. Closely following Germany\u2019s example, Japan heavily subsidized its first factories, copied British design and imported foreign machinery and engineers. It not only protected many of its businesses from excessive competition but also guaranteed them a minimum profit.\n\nWhen World War I disrupted Europe\u2019s monopolies in its Asian colonies, Japanese companies moved in with their textiles, bicycles and canned foods. Following Europe\u2019s free-trading imperialists, Japan had invaded and occupied Taiwan and then Korea, turning them into protected markets for its small industries. In a further refinement, the Japanese state bribed and coerced manufacturing companies. It gave them subsidies to export more, which in turn helped the companies fund innovations and become internationally competitive.\n\nWorld War II proved only a brief interruption in Japan\u2019s policy of protection. Utterly devastated, Japan still managed to rid Asia of its European competitors. It was during the American occupation, as the historian John Dower notes, that Japan instituted what an economist described as the most \u201crestrictive foreign-trade and foreign-exchange control system ever devised by a major free nation.\u201d\n\nGiven unlimited powers by their American occupiers to get the country going again, the bureaucrats of Japan\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry laid the foundations of a world-class manufacturing economy. Nationalism was a great stimulus. As Dower put it, \u201cNational pride \u2014 acute, wounded, wedded to a profound sense of vulnerability \u2014 lay behind the single-minded pursuit of economic growth that created a momentary superpower a mere quarter-century after humiliating defeat.\u201d But Japan would have struggled had war not erupted on the Korean Peninsula in 1950 and made Japan the main source of American procurements. The path of Japan\u2019s protectionist state was now set \u2014 the country\u2019s prime minister, Shigeru Yoshida, would call the destructive Korean War a \u201cgift of the gods.\u201d\n\nIn the 1950s, Korea and Taiwan, both former Japanese colonies, inherited Japan\u2019s institutions and protectionist practices. This was most striking in Korea, which was intensely poor in the early 1950s; its few industries were built by Japan during the 1930s. South Korea, too, found solutions for its problems in Friedrich List rather than Adam Smith. The country\u2019s leader, Park Chung-hee, the military general who came to power in 1961, had worked for the Japanese colonialist regime. A fervent autodidact, Park was also deeply familiar with German theories of protectionism. (The economist Robert Wade reported coming across whole shelves of books by List in Seoul bookstores in the 1970s.) During his long years in power, Park nurtured South Korea\u2019s chaebol business groups \u2014 Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung \u2014 and boldly ventured into steel-making.\n\nBecause the United States saw Korea, Taiwan and Japan as a buffer against Communism, it helped promote such neomercantilist strategies \u2014 a mix of import substitution and export-oriented industrialization. American cold warriors also gave their strategic allies unhindered access to U.S. markets while tolerating the closure of their own to American investment. By the time the United States realized that its biggest Asian ward had grown too big, it was too late. Japan had taken many products invented in the United States (automobiles, consumer electronics) and manufactured them more cheaply and with superior quality. By the 1980s, Japan had supplanted the United States in aid and investments in East Asia. When the United States sought to limit Japanese exports, the Japanese responded by deepening their investment in Asia, moving factories and improving industrial skills and technology wherever they went.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1994, when I first left India to travel to Southeast Asia, I found Japan everywhere, as both promise and rebuke. The renovation of Thailand, South Korea and Taiwan under Japanese auspices was then an established fact \u2014 and a standing reproach for us in India, which had failed to match East Asia\u2019s success in manufacturing and trade. Like most countries in the world after 1945, France as much as Japan, India embraced a model of state-led development. Its aim, as in many nations liberated from colonial rule, was not so much the growth of private wealth as the strengthening of national power. Friedman described Indians in \u201cFree to Choose\u201d as deluded followers of Mahatma Gandhi, idly spinning cotton in cottage industries subsidized by the state. India, he said, was blind to industrialization and, furthermore, believed in central planning. This was a caricature: India had an ambitious industrialization program, and its economy mixed private markets with state-owned enterprises, even if its historical experience of British rule predisposed it to suspect that free trade benefited only developed industrial economies. Nevertheless, Friedman was broadly right in his view of India as a social and economic laggard.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIndia, following a model of import-substitution growth, barely participated in world trade. Its factories produced shoddy goods that you bought only because there were no alternatives. And so I was dazzled by what was on offer in Southeast Asia. The emblems of pop American culture \u2014 Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald\u2019s, Madonna \u2014 were everywhere. But the most seductive consumer goods were almost invariably Japanese: Sony, Sanyo, National, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji.\n\nFeeling inadequate before East Asia\u2019s progress, many middle-class Indians longed for what Chalmers Johnson, in a book about Japan\u2019s unique growth, called the \u201ccapitalist developmental state.\u201d In such states, skilled bureaucracies led by authoritarian leaders promoted a project of national development (while either paying lip service to, or ignoring, democratic norms). Private entrepreneurs made socially beneficial investments; government policies helped build their comparative advantage while also facilitating social stability with land reforms, education and other efforts to address income equality.\n\nThe \u201cdevelopmental state\u201d assumed that market failures were to be expected and that the state played a necessary role in designing industrial and financial policy. These included not only trade protection and government subsidies but also, as the political economists Robert and Jean M. Gilpin wrote in \u201cGlobal Political Economy\u201d in 2003, \u201cselective credit allocation and deliberate distortion of interest rates in order to channel cheap credit to favored economic sectors.\u201d Governments were, in fact, very much part of the solution, as even the World Bank, beholden to the Washington Consensus, grudgingly acknowledged in its well-known 1993 report, \u201cEast Asian Miracle.\u201d The high-performing Asian economies, it noted, \u201chave achieved unusually low and declining levels of inequality, contrary to historical experience and contemporary evidence in other regions.\u201d\n\nThe hero of many middle-class Indians was the authoritarian leader of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, whose success in turning Singapore from an economic backwater into one of the world\u2019s major commercial cities was much admired by Deng Xiaoping. We might have also revered, had we known more about him, South Korea\u2019s technocratic despot Park Chung-hee, who accomplished economic goals with the help of highly trained managers, and who also appeared to reduce inequality and build what we in India sorely lacked: social cohesion.\n\nBut little did I know that Hamilton (and List) would achieve their greatest influence in post-Mao China. \u201cThe rise of China resembles that of the United States a century ago,\u201d the Chinese scholar Hu Angang writes. He is not exaggerating. Friedman may have been right that the Chinese Communists were hopelessly ignorant of how free markets work, but ending state intervention in the economy was never on the agenda. After Mao, Chinese leaders looked to Japanese and other East Asian developers, just as the East Asians had once looked to Germany.\n\nThe first investments in China in the 1980s came from Japan as well as from transnational Chinese business networks based in East Asia. China benefited from the market networks, management and technical know-how that accompanied these investments. Encouraged by the Clinton administration, it entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and quickly seized the opportunity \u2014 limitless export markets \u2014 opened by American insistence on free trade.\n\nOnce Japan became the leading investor in Asia, regional production chains began to link those countries with one another. As Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan moved up the technology and value chains, they invested in developing countries, like Vietnam and Indonesia. This process of regionalizing investment and production, which largely dispenses with Europe and America, has now been accelerated by China\u2019s rise as a manufacturing power. The biggest investor in Vietnam today, for instance, is South Korea, whose biggest trading partner is China.\n\nThe success of China\u2019s state-led economy presents, in many ways, the same economic (and ideological) quandary that Japan unexpectedly threw up before the United States when, in the 1980s, it became the world\u2019s leading creditor. A regional trading system dominated by China will make Asian countries less likely to enlist in American geopolitical objectives. Locked into boundary disputes with its neighbors, China has accelerated the militarization of the South China Sea, acquiring more than 3,200 acres of land on reefs and outcrops and installing runways, ports and hangars. But it has also abandoned its abrasive attitude, making determined efforts to pivot Asia away from Trump\u2019s America. And it seems to be succeeding.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith China offering generous infrastructure deals to the former American territory of the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte announced that \u201cit is time to say goodbye\u201d to the United States \u2014 previously he threatened to ride a jet ski to a Chinese man-made island in the South China Sea and plant his country\u2019s flag there. Other rival claimants to parts of the South China Sea \u2014 Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei \u2014 have also moved closer to Beijing since Trump\u2019s election. Smaller countries like Cambodia and Laos now resemble Chinese client-states. China is also trying to repair long-strained relations with Japan by inviting investments by Japanese multinationals.\n\nThese attempts to win over major American allies in Asia complement Xi\u2019s ambitious One Belt, One Road initiative, which aims to put China at the center of global affairs through a network of trade links and infrastructure projects stretching from Asia to the Middle East to Africa and Europe. Investing more than $1 trillion in more than 60 countries \u2014 ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, high-speed railways in East Africa, gas pipelines in Central Asia \u2014 the initiative can claim to be the largest overseas investment drive ever undertaken by a single country. The 11 European Union members and five non-E.U. Central and Eastern European countries that have joined the China-led political and commercial group called 16+1 have all signed major infrastructure deals with China, enhancing Beijing\u2019s influence in the E.U. The remaining 11 members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership have gone ahead without the United States; they are expected to sign a final agreement in March.\n\nBy pulling out of the TPP and threatening trade sanctions, Trump encouraged Japan to seek a deal with Europe that shuts out the United States. Britain, another stalwart American ally, is considering joining the TPP. China, meanwhile, is hectically negotiating more than a dozen trade agreements in Asia while proposing its own alternative to the TPP, a trade agreement called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. China has also intensified efforts to build alternatives to such Western international institutions as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 2014, China inaugurated, against staunch American opposition, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, whose members now include all Asian states except Japan.\n\nThere is little doubt that Beijing is presenting itself as a benign alternative to the United States. In a speech just before his second term as the party\u2019s general secretary, Xi claimed that there were more takers internationally for Chinese \u201cvalues.\u201d China, he said, offers \u201ca new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence.\u201d\n\nIt was always wildly optimistic to suppose that China would eventually be integrated into an American-dominated order and persuaded, if not forced, to adopt its norms. A postcolonial Indian like myself, who traveled to China and read in its modern history and literature over the last decade and half, could only be skeptical of such claims. It was never less than clear to me, whether in the suburbs of Lhasa, Tibet (demographically altered by Han immigration), or in the bookstores of Shanghai (stacked with best sellers with titles like \u201cChina Can Say No\u201d), that the quest for national sovereignty and regained strength defines China\u2019s party state and its economic policies.\n\nBelying predictions of doom, China has again demonstrated the power of what Dower, speaking of Japan, called \u201cnational pride \u2014 acute, wounded, wedded to a profound sense of vulnerability.\u201d The United States never knew this single-minded ambition of the historical loser to avenge his losses; American leaders now reckon with it at home, in the wake of a nationalistic backlash against free trade and globalization. Some confused policies and mixed signals have accordingly defined the American position on China. During the American presidential campaign in 2016, all the main candidates, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as well as Trump, opposed the TPP, which was intended to contain China in its own region. Then, in Trump\u2019s chaotic first year, the United States seemed to be forced back by Hamilton\u2019s shrewd East Asian disciples into its historical role as the mother country of protectionism. Trump now says that America first does not mean America alone, and he is open to rejoining the TPP. There may be more such reversals ahead. For Trump is only just beginning to acknowledge, after a year of bluster, the formidable challenge of China and the arduous effort needed for the United States to match its most determined and resourceful rival yet.", "title": "The Rise of China and the Fall of the \u2018Free Trade\u2019 Myth", "authors": ["Pankaj Mishra"]}

Although Mr. Bhutto said that his immediate family has never pushed him to enter politics, he is considered by many Pakistanis to be the successor to the family\u2019s turbulent dynasty. \u201cBhutto Jr steps into art world, raises hopes,\u201d a headline in Dawn, one of Pakistan\u2019s leading English-language newspapers, said. In a Facebook comment, one user pleaded to Bhutto, \u201cYou are doing nice job but please take lead party of your grand papa we all missing you.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEqually impassioned but hostile reactions from overseas South Asians to the video centered on Mr. Bhutto\u2019s sexuality, especially on the 10-second-long scene capturing his joyful drag performance. In Pakistan, same-sex sexual acts are prohibited by law, and there are no anti-discrimination laws to protect L.G.B.T.Q. citizens, although the Senate recently approved amendments to a bill that allows trans people to choose their gender without needing to appear before a medical board.\n\nNews reports of ostracism, legal threats and attacks against gay Pakistanis, or against those perceived to be gay, are not uncommon; in one highly publicized case, a transgender activist died from gunshot wounds after delays in her medical care. Homophobic comments on Mr. Bhutto\u2019s video, both from media sources and social media users, employed derogatory terms and curses to condemn him and his art. \u201cThere was so much negativity when it came out, and the focus was on the drag part of it,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said.\n\nDrag is not openly accepted in Pakistan. The closest thing may be the performances by hijras \u2014 transgender or intersex people who were categorized as males at birth but who do not conform to traditional ideas of masculinity. While they do not fit the Western definition of drag queens, they dance and sing at public ceremonies while wearing women\u2019s clothing. At first, Mr. Bhutto was reluctant to discuss his own use of cross-dressing. \u201cBut now the cat\u2019s out of the bag,\u201d he said. \u201cDrag is an integral part of my practice; what point is there being shy and tiptoeing around it anymore?\u201d\n\nMr. Bhutto, 27, began using visual and performance works to explore Islamic identity after coming to the United States, in 2014, to pursue his M.F.A. at the San Francisco Art Institute. Newly arrived in the city, he was shocked by a notorious series of anti-Muslim ads on city buses, paid for by Pamela Geller and the American Freedom Defense Initiative. \u201cIt made me want to hide who I was,\u201d he said; at the same time, he added, the explicit Islamophobia \u201cenergized me in a way I wasn\u2019t in Pakistan.\u201d Alongside the Iranian artist Minoosh Zomorodinia, he began exploring acts that emphasized and embraced his status as a Muslim in America: together, the two developed \u201cprayformances,\u201d in which they completed the Muslim ritual of praying in public spaces.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was another act of hatred that spurred Mr. Bhutto to also weave his identity as a gay person into his art. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen, an American Muslim man, killed 49 people at a popular Orlando gay club. The tragedy, and unsubstantiated rumors that Mr. Mateen may have been a closeted gay man, opened up a rare mainstream discourse, both in United States and in the Muslim world, on queerness in Islam. It became clear to Mr. Bhutto that \u201cpeople think you\u2019re either queer or you\u2019re Muslim, and that somehow those two things are in opposition to one another.\u201d\n\nDuring that period, Mr. Bhutto attended his first drag show. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t used to it, it\u2019s very impactful: the makeup, the costume, the performance, the songs,\u201d he said. He first tried his hand at drag a few months later, at a local bar. Over time, he began building his performances around music and spoken-word sections that address his religion and cultural background \u2014 \u201cwhich can be surprisingly jarring and political to the audience,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same vein, his mixed-media series \u201cMussalmaan Musclemen\u201d aims for \u201cinteresting confusion for the viewer,\u201d this time through the layering of cheap fabrics from Pakistan over beefcake photos from an Urdu translation of an exercise manual supposedly originally written by Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n\u201cThere are some misguided ideas about what Islam represents and the threat that Muslim men pose,\u201d Mr. Bhutto explained. By combining homoerotic images of musclebound men with embroidered sections of flowery cloth, and by emphasizing the calligraphic Arabic script, he seeks to challenge assumptions about Muslim masculinity.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast fall, \u201cMussalmaan Musclemen\u201d was included in the Karachi Biennale. Though it was the first time that Mr. Bhutto had been home since the \u201cTurmeric Project\u201d video caused an uproar, he said that he wasn\u2019t nervous \u2014 he has always made sure to maintain a low profile when he travels to Pakistan. But it would be more difficult to stay incognito if he were openly practicing his art there, which, he said, is why he\u2019s not interested in moving back to the country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI respect what my father did,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said. \u201cHe dedicated his entire life to a cause, he made himself physically vulnerable for a cause, I respect that \u2014 but, honestly, it\u2019s not for me.\u201d\n\nIn San Francisco, Mr. Bhutto is busy with his show at SOMArts, \u201cThe Third Muslim: Queer and Trans Muslim Narratives of Resistance and Resilience,\u201d which he organized with the artist Yas Ahmed. With hundreds of people in attendance at the opening ceremony, the show has been well-received in the art world \u2014 and no backlash in Pakistan. It also features work by 15 queer, trans and gender nonconforming Muslim artists from around the world, including Syria, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\nThe exhibition \u201ctackles the representation of Islam and Muslims all over the world but through a queer lens,\u201d Mr. Bhutto said. At least in America, he noted, \u201cthese days, identifying as Muslim is more tricky than identifying as queer, funnily enough.\u201d", "title": "The Scion of a Pakistani Political Dynasty Comes Out", "authors": ["Saira Khan"]}

Adam hangs face down in the chair with the cushion supporting him on the hips. For this exercise, Adam uses a 25-pound medicine ball, but you can use a lighter weight, even a five-pound ball or no ball at all. It is best to have someone with you, but you can modify the exercise so you can do it alone.\n\nStart in the bent-over position on the chair with the ball on the floor a little to the left. Put both hands on the ball. Lift and rotate your body so you can throw the ball to your right. Basically, Adam reaches for the ball on his left and twists to whip the ball to the right. For Adam, this is functional because he\u2019s jumping and rotating on the ice. This should burn, but if it\u2019s really hurting, then stop. Start off slow without a weighted ball and just go through the twist and the motion. Then add the weighted ball. If you don\u2019t have a partner, just lift the ball up and twist but don\u2019t throw. Make sure you only do one side 10 times and then do the other side. If you go back and forth you can wrench your back. (Four sets of 20; 10 on the right, 10 on the left.)\n\nElevated Running Man: Adam hangs from straps in a metal cage, and wears a resistance band around each ankle that is also connected to the nearest cage post. He drives his left knee up toward his right elbow, crossing his body to create resistance. It makes the abs really strong, and it\u2019s connecting the lower part of the body up through the abs to the upper body. It mimics the movement they do on the ice when you see them jump and cross their legs. If we end the workout with this, we\u2019ll do sets of 20. But if it\u2019s early in the abs workout, we\u2019ll do 40. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nPhoto\n\nTwisting Pike: Adam hangs from the straps again and he holds a smaller, 35-millimeter Swiss therapy ball between his ankles. Next he lifts his legs to a pike position, so his legs are parallel to the floor. He twists to the right as far as he can, and then to the left. He twists right, left, right, left \u2014 it\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s mimicking what the ab does internally when he\u2019s jumping and rotating. It isolates the abdominal area, but we want to balance between the abdominal area and the rest of the body, so that\u2019s why he does these more connecting movements. You don\u2019t want to overdevelop one part. Everything is symmetrical and balanced. (Four sets of 20; alternating right and left side.)\n\nRecovery Meal: After the workout, I require Adam to eat within 30 minutes. He eats protein \u2014 chicken, fish or beef and maybe a salad. You need your carbs, but nobody needs bread, pasta or rice. He gets his carbs from fruits and vegetables, like yams.\n\nChange It Up: Every workout, we change the order and maybe add something different. The body gets bored, so we like to mix up the order every time.\n\nSave Abs for the End: Because the abdominal muscles work together with the muscles in the back to protect the spine, you don\u2019t want to tire them out at the beginning of a workout. We always save the ab work for the end of the training day. We\u2019ll spend 25 minutes on abs, but it\u2019s always the last thing, our big finale.", "title": "The Secret Behind Adam Rippon\u2019s Olympic Abs", "authors": ["Tara Parker-Pope"]}

A romantic dinner reservation can be part of it, but proposers should consider how the establishment relates to their courtship. Picking an upscale restaurant because it offers a Valentine\u2019s Day prix fixe special does not send the same message as returning to an influential getaway destination, stopping by a favorite local eatery or dining in a corner of your home.\n\nAshley Durham, a wedding photographer and co-owner of Randy and Ashley Studios in Peyton, Colo., said that some of her favorite proposals even happened in bed. As for putting the ring in the dessert on a plate that reads, \u201cMarry Me?\u201d Likely, you\u2019ll want to skip it.\n\nProposers often mistakenly believe that the key to achieving a great proposal takes large amounts of money. Rooftop dinners, helicopters, fireworks, flowers and fine wines are expensive elements that may not be received as sentimentally as the proposer hopes. \u201cShutterfly books are what every guy considers \u2018meaningful,\u2019 with rose petals and Champagne,\u201d Ms. Cantrell said, noting that a heartfelt proposal simply takes effort. \u201cIf her favorite flower is actually a daisy and her drink is a Moscow Mule, then rose petals and Champagne aren\u2019t going to speak to her like daisies and copper mugs.\u201d\n\nLess pricey concepts can also be rife with misconception. Ms. Durham pointed out the popularity of the hiking proposal in Colorado. In an attempt to snap a photograph of the moment with a sweeping landscape as the backdrop, the proposer will stop along on a trail at a vantage point, set up for a posed picture, and quickly pull out a ring. This feels natural if the couple treks on a regular basis but borders on contrived to less outdoorsy people.\n\nStacy Stahl, the founder and director of the proposal website HowHeAsked.com by the Knot, recommends that proposers pick a specific facet of their partnership as the basis of the plan.

{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "The authors of \u201cVibrator Nation\u201d and \u201cBuzz\u201d each put in time observing how sex toys are sold, so have firsthand insight into the industry. Whose take will hold more appeal depends on the reader\u2019s interests: In \u201cBuzz,\u201d Hallie Lieberman offers a broader view, taking us back some 30,000 years, when our ancestors carved penises out of siltstone; moving on to the ancient Greeks\u2019 creative use of olive oil; the buzzy medical devices of the 19th century (disappointingly, doctors\u2019 notorious in-office use of vibrators as treatment for female \u201chysteria\u201d is urban legend); and the impact of early-20th-century obscenity laws \u2014 incredibly, sex toys remain illegal in Alabama \u2014 before digging deeply into more contemporary influences. In addition to feminist retailers, Lieberman braids in stories of men like Ted Marche, whose family business \u2014 employing his wife and teenage children \u2014 began by making prosthetic strap-ons for impotent men; Gosnell Duncan, who made sex aids for the disabled and was the first to expand dildo production beyond the Caucasian pink once called \u201cflesh colored\u201d; the Malorrus brothers, who were gag gift manufacturers (think penis pencil toppers); and the hard-core porn distribution mogul Reuben Sturman, who repeatedly, and eventually disastrously, ran afoul of the law. Although their X-rated wares would supposedly give women orgasms, unlike the feminist-championed toys they were sold primarily as devices that would benefit men. Much like the era\u2019s sexual revolution, in other words, they maintained and even perpetuated a sexist status quo.\n\n\u201cVibrator Nation\u201d focuses more narrowly on women-owned vendors, wrestling with how their activist mission bumped up against the demands and constraints of the marketplace. Those early entrepreneurs, Comella writes, believed nothing less than that \u201cwomen who had orgasms could change the world.\u201d As with other utopian feminist visions, however, this one quickly splintered. Controversy broke out over what constituted \u201csex positivity,\u201d what constituted \u201cwoman-friendly,\u201d what constituted \u201cwoman.\u201d Was it politically correct to stock, or even produce, feminist porn? Were BDSM lesbians invited to the party? Would the stores serve transwomen? Did the \u201crespectable\u201d aesthetic of the white, middle-class founders translate across lines of class and race? If the goal was self-exploration through a kind of cliteracy, what about customers (of any gender or sexual orientation) who wanted toys for partnered play or who enjoyed penetrative sex? Could a sex store that sold nine-inch, veined dildos retain its feminist bona fides? Dell Williams solved that particular problem by commissioning nonrepresentational silicone devices with names like \u201cVenus Rising\u201d from Gosnell Duncan, the man who made prosthetics for the disabled. Others followed suit.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nEven so, Comella writes, the retailers struggled to stay afloat: Feminist stores refused, as a matter of principle, to trade on customers\u2019 anxiety \u2014 there were none of the \u201ctightening creams,\u201d \u201cnumbing creams,\u201d penis enlargers or anal bleaches that boosted profits at typical sex stores. Employees were considered \u201ceducators,\u201d and sales were secondary to providing information and support. What\u2019s more, Good Vibrations in particular was noncompetitive; Blank freely shared her business model with any woman interested in spreading the love.\n\nConsumer culture and feminism have always been strange bedfellows, with the former tending to overpower the latter. Just as Virginia Slims co-opted the message of \u201970s liberation, as the Spice Girls cannibalized \u201990s grrrl power, so feminist sex stores exerted their influence on the mainstream, yet were ultimately absorbed and diluted by it. In 2007, Good Vibrations was sold to GVA-TWN, the very type of sleazy mega-sex-store company it was founded to disrupt. Though no physical changes have been made in the store, Good Vibrations is no longer woman-owned. Although the aesthetics haven\u2019t changed, Lieberman writes, the idea of feminist sex toys as a source of women\u2019s liberation has faded, all but disappeared. An infamous episode of \u201cSex and the City\u201d that made the Rabbit the hottest vibrator in the nation also portrayed female masturbation as addictive and isolating, potentially leading to permanent loneliness. The sex toys in \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d were wielded solely in service of traditional sex and gender roles: A man is in charge of Anastasia Steele\u2019s sexual awakening, and climax is properly experienced through partnered intercourse. Meanwhile, the orgasm gap between genders has proved more stubborn than the pay gap. Women still experience one orgasm for every three experienced by men in partnered sex. And fewer than half of teenage girls between 14 and 17 have ever masturbated.\n\nAt the end of \u201cBuzz,\u201d Lieberman makes a provocative point: Viagra is covered by insurance but vibrators aren\u2019t, presumably because while erections are seen as medically necessary for sexual functioning the same is not true of female orgasm. Like our feminist foremothers, she envisions a new utopia, one in which the F.D.A. regulates sex toys to ensure their safety, in which they are covered by insurance, where children are taught about them in sex education courses and they are seen and even subsidized worldwide as a way to promote women\u2019s sexual health.\n\nIn other words: We\u2019ve come a long way, baby, but as \u201cVibrator Nation\u201d and \u201cBuzz\u201d make clear, we still may not be coming enough.", "title": "The Sex Toy Shops That Switched On a Feminist Revolution", "authors": ["Peggy Orenstein"]}

But now \u201cI can\u2019t avoid the whole story of what happened to me in Palm Beach,\u201d Ms. de Lesseps said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to keep it light while also taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a hard fall for Ms. de Lesseps, a nurse turned model from Berlin, Conn., who obtained her royal designation from her first husband, a French count named Alexandre de Lesseps. (Mr. de Lesseps is a descendant of Ferdinand de Lesseps, who oversaw the building of the Suez and Panama canals.) The title became central to Ms. de Lesseps\u2019s branding, particularly after the publication of her etiquette book, \u201cClass With the Countess: How to Live With Elegance and Flair,\u201d in 2009, the same year that she and the count divorced.\n\nFor Ms. de Lesseps\u2019s most recent \u201cHousewives\u201d tag line, presented in each episode\u2019s opening credits, she declared that \u201cthe only title I\u2019d trade Countess for is Wife.\u201d And she did, but then quickly traded back after she and her second husband, Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr., a businessman, divorced last year.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI remain Luann de Lesseps \u2014 and for most people, The Countess,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. de Lesseps has long dreamed of performing in her own cabaret show. She has been known to break out in song at dinner parties and has released three dance singles.\n\nShe first met Mr. Stritch, her musical director, several year ago when she sang at \u201cJim Caruso\u2019s Cast Party,\u201d an open mic-style show at Birdland, the Manhattan jazz club. Ben Rimalower, the show\u2019s director, met Ms. de Lesseps through his friend\u2019s father, who saw Mr. Rimalower\u2019s Off Broadway play, \u201cPatti Issues,\u201d centered on Patti LuPone. (\u201cMy other favorite diva,\u201d Mr. Rimalower said.)\n\nAfter watching the show, the mutual friend told Mr. Rimalower that he should really meet a woman he knows in New York who likes to sing. When he mentioned that her name was Luann, \u201cI was like, \u2018Excuse me! The Countess?\u2019\u201d Mr. Rimalower said.\n\nHe and Ms. de Lesseps emailed for about two years, \u201cand then last year she woke up one day and was like, \u2018It\u2019s happening!\u2019 and luckily the best in the biz was available,\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Stritch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTickets to the first performance of #CountessandFriends went on sale on Dec. 10, and quickly sold out, inspiring Ms. de Lesseps to add a second date, which sold out within 24 hours. And that was all before she even left for Palm Beach.\n\nAfter her arrest, she checked herself into a rehab facility for a month, cutting into an already tight rehearsal schedule. But Ms. de Lesseps, a woman for whom art and life have always been deeply intertwined, felt that the show must go on.\n\n\u201cTo know that the show was totally sold out and people are still trying to get tickets is a really great feeling,\u201d said Ms. de Lesseps, adding that her mother and two children, Victoria and Noel, are expected to be in the audience to support her. \u201cThat I get to come back and have something creative to sink my teeth into has been really helpful for me, because it\u2019s been a rocky road, the past two years.\u201d\n\nMs. de Lesseps said the dissolution of her marriage was a tough blow that, in retrospect, caused her to self-medicate with alcohol. \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding and being here brought up buried emotions,\u201d she wrote on Twitter after she was released from county jail on Dec. 24, adding that she is \u201ccommitted to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

A few months ago, she moved to the Upper West Side, where she enjoys walking her dog, a Westie named Aston, in Riverside Park.\n\nBut she also has a lot of travel coming up, and Mr. Stritch has been making recordings of his musical arrangements for her to take on the road so she can practice. One is a beat-box track for a \u201cHousewives\u201d castmate, Sonja Morgan, who will accompany Ms. de Lesseps on a \u201cHamilton\u201d-inspired version of her 2010 dance hit \u201cMoney Can\u2019t Buy You Class.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 10, Ms. de Lesseps was leaving for a holiday with Ms. Morgan, and promised Mr. Rimalower that she would \u201cwrangle her,\u201d and make her practice the beat-boxing element. She refused to say where they were going or whether cameras would be rolling for Season 10 of \u201cHousewives.\u201d\n\nAmanda Long, a Bravo representative stationed in Ms. de Lesseps\u2019s kitchen, wouldn\u2019t confirm that Ms. de Lesseps was part of the cast. Any time the show came up in conversation, she piped in: \u201cWe can\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGuess what?\u201d Ms. de Lesseps said, throwing up her hands. \u201cI might not have a job!\u201d\n\nHearing this, her dog Aston jumped up and started shaking. \u201cHe\u2019s so nervous!\u201d Ms. de Lesseps said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him this way.\u201d\n\nBut it seems safe to assume that The Countess, an enduring fan favorite who has been part of the show for all of its past nine seasons, will make the cut. (Bravo will be filming at Ms. de Lesseps\u2019s cabaret, Ms. Long said later, with the caveat that \u201cnothing is confirmed to make it into the final episodes.\u201d)\n\nOne of the highlights of last season featured Ms. de Lesseps on a tequila-fueled trip to Mexico, gracefully dancing off a ledge and falling into a bush. It was a moment that became an enduring internet meme, resurfacing recently when Ms. de Lesseps was Photoshopped into the verdant background of Kehinde Wiley\u2019s portrait of President Barack Obama. (\u201cDying over this reinterpretation of Obama\u2019s official portrait, featuring Lu!\u201d Andy Cohen, an executive producer of \u201cHousewives,\u201d wrote in a caption of the photo on Instagram.)\n\nAfter the cabaret, Ms. de Lesseps plans to finish a new single called \u201cMake It Part of the Dance,\u201d inspired partly by the falling incident in Mexico, but also celebrating her philosophy of life.\n\n\u201cThe important thing is to not take yourself so damn seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cI always think, \u2018I can survive this if I keep on moving.\u2019\u201d", "title": "The Show Goes On for Arrested \u2018Housewife\u2019 Luann de Lesseps", "authors": ["Rachel Dodes"]}
{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "American readers who are rightly worried about similarly distressing developments in the United States will feel fortified by the publication of \u201cTo Fight Against This Age: On Fascism and Humanism,\u201d which brings these two pieces together in a single slim volume and establishes Riemen as an erudite, well-meaning and inspiring ally in the struggle to combat anti-liberal political trends. Whether he is an especially wise guide to that struggle is another matter.\n\nThe message of the book is simple, insistent and powerful: The West is not confronting a threat of \u201cpopulism,\u201d as so many contemporary analysts claim. It\u2019s facing a threat of fascism \u2014 the form of modern mass politics that actively cultivates \u201cour worst irrational sentiments: resentment, hatred, xenophobia, lust for power and fear!\u201d Above all, fascism mobilizes ignorance and prejudice by nurturing and flattering them, by persuading democratic citizens to cut themselves off from the wisdom contained in \u201cpoetry and literature, philosophy and theology, the arts and history\u201d \u2014 in short, from \u201cthe domain of culture\u201d that puts us in touch with \u201cwhat unites us and makes the unity of mankind possible.\u201d\n\nThe proper response to the fascist threat, according to Riemen, is therefore education \u2014 the cultivation of individuals who are as \u201cfree and responsible\u201d as \u201cSocrates and Spinoza,\u201d and also capable of resisting our \u201cnihilist kitsch society\u201d in which \u201cnationalism, resentment and hatred\u201d blossom and thrive. Education can accomplish this task by teaching the \u201ccare for the soul\u201d that, at its peak, European culture exemplifies.\n\nPhoto\n\nRiemen maintains that such an education in \u201cculture, philosophy and art\u201d can bring forth a \u201chumanist society\u201d that is \u201cmorally mature\u201d and thus capable of standing against \u201cthe rebirth of nationalism, the triviality of technology, the vulgarity of commerce and the cultivated stupidity of the media and the universities.\u201d Only when such an education has spread the love of \u201ctruth, goodness, beauty, friendship, justice, compassion and wisdom\u201d will the West have succeeded in immunizing itself against \u201cthe deadly bacillus called fascism.\u201d\n\nNo one who\u2019s tasted the glories of European high culture or who\u2019s appalled by the latter-day descent of our politics into the gutter can fail to be moved by Riemen\u2019s rousing rhetoric. But that doesn\u2019t mean his diagnosis of what ails us is correct, or his cure for it sensible.\n\nTake his insistence, now widely shared by commentators on both sides of the Atlantic, that \u201cfascism\u201d is on the rise across the West. Yes, the centrist consensus of the postwar era, and especially the neoliberal one that has dominated since the end of the Cold War, is being challenged today by many on the right and some on the left. But is this challenge really best understood as a revival of the kind of politics that was practiced in Hitler\u2019s Germany, Mussolini\u2019s Italy and Franco\u2019s Spain?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But one necessary component is missing: a uniform, galvanizing ideology that could plausibly animate a centralized totalitarian state to co-opt civil society, driving out dissent by employing a combination of surveillance, repression and propaganda. The threat facing liberal politics today is quite different and in some ways the opposite: a rising tide of polarization and chaos in civil society driven by numerous forces, some structural (social media) but others political (right-wing disinformation, Russian meddling), that threatens to empower a form of postmodern, kleptocratic authoritarianism. That\u2019s certainly bad, and potentially antidemocratic. But it\u2019s not fascism.\n\nThe error is important not only because inaccurately tossing around the f-word contributes to the hyperbole that is turning civil society into a circus of inflammatory charges and countercharges, but also because it reveals a serious failure of understanding \u2014 one that\u2019s troublingly pervasive in Europe and even common among a distressingly large number of American liberals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe misunderstanding concerns nothing less than the nature of politics itself. For many liberals, politics involves bureaucratic administration, the management of government benefits and the jostling of interest groups. One party or coalition tweaks the numbers in one direction, another nudges them a different way. Such fiddling with policy is a good part of modern politics. But it\u2019s not the whole of politics. At a more elemental level, the one to which Aristotle directed much of his attention, politics is about more existential issues: this bounded community in this place with this history and heritage, determining its own character for itself, deciding who is and who is not a citizen, who will rule and in the name of which vision of the good life.\n\nAfter the cataclysm of World War II, European leaders concluded that the disaster was a product of an excess of politics in this elemental sense. Emphasizing certain transcendent themes in Western humanism, they advocated the universalism of human rights and denigrated any and all attachment to particular nations or cultures. The Common Market and then the European Union itself were experiments in devising a postpolitical politics that treated particular attachments as morally unacceptable and therefore politically out of bounds. Favoring anything less than open borders became invariably xenophobic, caring about the ethnic and cultural character of one\u2019s own nation became invariably racist and fearing outsiders who wish to do it harm became invariably fascist.\n\nFor a while it looked as if Europe\u2019s experiment in forging an antipolitical politics might succeed. Not so much anymore.\n\nRiemen\u2019s book is admirable in many ways, but it is an unusually hermetic example of the thinking that led so many Europeans to believe in the first place that it was possible, necessary and desirable to produce a civilization in which citizens are expected to look down on the love that has always defined citizenship \u2014 the love of one\u2019s own. We have ample reason to doubt that liberal politics can be saved by more of the same.", "title": "The Sickness of Our Time: Is It Populism or Fascism?", "authors": ["Damon Linker", "Rob Riemen"]}

Shouldn\u2019t the weight of available evidence, to say nothing of the presumption of innocence, extend to the court of public opinion, too?\n\nThat is a thought lost in some of the commentary about the case. Dylan Farrow is a persuasive interviewee who seems absolutely sincere in her belief that she was molested by Allen as a child. Allen, by contrast, comes across as a grouchy neurotic who, in his late 50s, had a distasteful affair with Mia Farrow\u2019s adopted, barely adult daughter, Soon-Yi Previn. In the contest of sympathies, it\u2019s not hard to guess who wins.\n\nBut it\u2019s precisely because Dylan\u2019s account plays to our existing biases that we need to treat it with added skepticism. Most parents know that young children are imaginative and suggestible and innocently prone to making things up. The misuse of children\u2019s memories by ambitious prosecutors against day-care center operators in the 1980s led to some of the worst miscarriages of justice in recent U.S. history. You don\u2019t have to doubt Farrow\u2019s honesty to doubt her version of events.\n\nNor have we learned anything else about Allen in the intervening years that might add to suspicions of guilt. He married Soon-Yi and has been with her ever since. Nobody else has come forward in 25 years with a fresh accusation of assault against him.\n\nIf Allen is in fact a pedophile, he appears to have acted on his evil fantasies exactly once. Compare that to Larry Nassar\u2019s 265 identified victims.\n\nIt goes without saying that child molestation is a uniquely evil crime that merits the stiffest penalties. But accusing someone of being a molester without abundant evidence is also odious, particularly in an era in which social-media whispers can become the ruin of careers and even of lives.\n\nThat\u2019s something for all of us to think about, even when it comes to wealthy, peculiar old men for whom we feel no love.

The film recently broke the advance ticket sales record for any movie released in the first quarter, according to the online vendor Fandango, surpassing \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and the 2017 live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201d\n\nThe morning after a red-carpet premiere in Hollywood last month that left Twitter swooning, the stars, director and producer of the film gathered for a spirited conversation about their role in challenging standard depictions of the African diaspora on screen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTaking part in the discussion were Mr. Coogler; Chadwick Boseman, who plays T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda; Lupita Nyong\u2019o (Nakia, a Wakandan spy and T\u2019Challa\u2019s love interest); Michael B. Jordan (Erik Killmonger, an African-American adversary of Black Panther\u2019s); Danai Gurira (Okoye, Wakanda\u2019s greatest warrior); and Kevin Feige, a producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and president of Marvel Studios. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nI read a funny tweet the other day that said this movie is basically reparations.\n\n[Rolling laughter]\n\nCHADWICK BOSEMAN I still want my reparations! I still want my reparations!\n\nRYAN COOGLER [laughing] I think only reparations can be reparations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s silly, but is there a kernel of truth there for any of you? The idea that Disney and Marvel investing so much in a movie with a black cast and crew can count as something like restitution?\n\nDANAI GURIRA What it does in such a beautiful way, to me, is it sets a precedent. We\u2019ve read a lot of subtitles for German and Russian \u2014 we can read subtitles for African languages now. People can\u2019t go back and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s going to be too hard, it\u2019s Africa.\u201d They can\u2019t do that. And that is so thrilling to me.\n\nMICHAEL B. JORDAN It couldn\u2019t have been done on a bigger level. If Marvel is behind it, then it\u2019s gotta be O.K. Moving forward, everybody\u2019s going to start to have the courage to tell bold stories that people didn\u2019t think were lucrative, didn\u2019t think that anybody wanted to see. All of that, I feel, is getting ready to dissolve.\n\nBOSEMAN It has to.\n\nGURIRA No, it will.\n\nCOOGLER What I\u2019ll say is, this is my second time working in the studio system, and they say it\u2019s the studio system, but it\u2019s really the people system. It\u2019s who\u2019s running the studio? How are they running it? When you look at Disney with [Tendo Nagenda, executive vice president for production at Walt Disney Studios, and Nate Moore, a producer at Marvel Studios and an executive producer of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d], it\u2019s a place that\u2019s interested in representation, not just for the sake of representation, but representation because that\u2019s what works, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make quality stuff that the world is going to embrace, that\u2019s what leads to success.\n\nPhoto\n\nKevin, there\u2019s long been this idea in Hollywood that movies with black casts don\u2019t perform well internationally. Does that end with \u201cBlack Panther\u201d?\n\nKEVIN FEIGE I certainly hope so. One thing I would always remind Ryan of when we would talk about humor and entertainment value in the film was that the biggest statement this movie can make is to be a success around the globe. And I think he\u2019s delivered a movie that\u2019s going to do that, and that disproves [beliefs] that had maybe never been true but had never been tested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the actors, what did joining this film mean to you and how did it feel different from other movies you\u2019ve done?\n\nBOSEMAN I\u2019ve done other films that have had historic significance because of what has happened in the past, but this not only refers to the past, it sets the stage for where we\u2019re going.\n\nGURIRA I\u2019ve had a passion for telling African stories for a really long time, being American-born and Zimbabwe-raised. That biculturalism is something that I try to address in my work as a playwright [her 2016 drama \u201cEclipsed\u201d was nominated for a Tony for best play], but nothing can address it like a Marvel movie. I had a childlike glee after my meeting with Ryan \u2014 I kind of floated around, found my car somehow. You think you\u2019re alone in the struggle until you meet someone and then you think, \u201cOh wow, we\u2019re all in it together? And y\u2019all are doing this already? And I just have to be in it?\u201d It was just so beautiful.\n\nLUPITA NYONG\u2019O Seeing it yesterday, I\u2019m even more excited about the celebration of pan-Africanism, because this movie is really about a contemporary Africa relating very intimately with a contemporary America via the characters of Black Panther and Killmonger. We\u2019re talking about some really deep issues that we don\u2019t often voice but we all feel. [Ms. Nyong\u2019o was born in Mexico to Kenyan parents and raised in Kenya.]\n\nPhoto\n\nBOSEMAN A lot of times, being [a black man] in Hollywood, when you get material you\u2019ll read it and you\u2019ll be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d When I got the initial call from Kevin Feige, my hope was that they would have the courage to give Black Panther its true essence and put somebody behind it that would have my same passion for what it could be. And they did that.\n\nOn set, did you have that feeling of \u201cThis is important\u201d or did you just try to do good work like normal?\n\nCOOGLER I learned a skill from playing football. I was a wide receiver \u2014 they throw you the ball, you can\u2019t drop it. So I learned that you gotta tune everything else out.\n\nIf I get to set and there\u2019s a hundred black people on the side of a waterfall and Lupita is dressed in this adornment and Danai is dressed in this adornment and they\u2019re like, \u201cHey Ryan, do I stand here or here?\u201d I can\u2019t think, \u201cAh, this is amazing, I\u2019m making \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and there\u2019s all these black folks on screen!\u201d I really gotta tell Danai that she needs to move over here, and I gotta tell her five reasons why she\u2019s gotta move over here, because she\u2019s gonna wanna know \u2019em! [Laughter]\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut seriously, I grew up reading these comic books and watching all these movies. If I really thought about the fact that I\u2019m making one of these things right now, with people I know and love, I would break down emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t be no good to anybody.\n\nNYONG\u2019O A moment when I really felt a vibration was when we were shooting [the waterfall scene]. There were hundreds of extras and we were all in these traditional clothes and there were all the tribal colors and drumming, and between takes, the drummers started riffing to [Snoop Dogg\u2019s] \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d The whole crowd started to go [sings the melody] and we were all dancing as Ryan figured things out below.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn that moment, I was like, \u201cThis is big.\u201d I had never been on a set with so many black people before and we were all so focused and I could feel a vibration in the air. We all felt so privileged to have an opportunity to be a part of this moment in history.\n\nMichael, one of the interesting complexities of the film comes from Killmonger\u2019s identity as an African-American, which contrasts against T\u2019Challa\u2019s African-ness. What did you want to bring to the character?\n\nJORDAN Ryan [and I] started getting into the back story of where he came from and how his upbringing really affected his personality, his outlook, his rage, his agenda. We felt like we could show where Erik is coming from and make people feel why he is so angry, why he is so lost. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but he knows the answers are out there.\n\nBOSEMAN For me, [Killmonger and T\u2019Challa] are two sides of the same coin \u2014 African and African-American. As an African-American, if you\u2019re disconnected from your ancestry and your past, you have this conflict that comes from that and so there is a healing experience that is possible because of that.\n\nCOOGLER The fracture that Killmonger has, that\u2019s the fracture I lived with my whole life. I\u2019m from a place that I\u2019d never been to and that nobody who I loved had been to because they couldn\u2019t afford to go [to Africa. Mr. Coogler grew up in Richmond in Northern California]. So I would hear stories from them about this place that they didn\u2019t even know anything about, and those stories were a counterbalance to the awful things that we did hear about them.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the movie, Wakanda disguises vast technological resources from the world, and white people who aren\u2019t in the know refer to it dismissively as a primitive backwater. That\u2019s a very real view that a lot of people hold about Africa, as recent comments attributed to the president made clear. What do you hope will be the effect of introducing audiences to this counternarrative about the continent?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCOOGLER The narrative about the continent that we know is actually a fairly recent narrative, if you think about human history. It\u2019s a narrative that was born out of what happened when the countries of Africa were conquered.\n\nBut the truth is that some of those places that people might refer to as backwaters \u2014 and these recent comments definitely aren\u2019t the first time somebody has said something like that \u2014 were the cradle of civilization. They were the first places to do anything that we would consider to be civilized.\n\nAll the structures that we built in Wakanda, they\u2019re taller structures of what you\u2019ll find in Africa. Some of them we switched up \u2014 instead of mud we used [the fictional supermetal] vibranium \u2014 but those are buildings that you\u2019ll really find in Mali, in Ethiopia, in Nigeria.\n\nI spent about three weeks in Africa [doing research for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and I truly felt that seeing it for myself was necessary for my growth as a human being.

{"date": "2018-02-09 00:00:00", "text": "Recall that in June 2016, after British voters said they wanted to leave the European Union, the stock markets fell into what seemed, at the time, to be a major panic. Less than a week after that vote, though, markets resumed their rise. Since then, the American market, measured by the S.&P. 500, was in positive territory every single day \u2014 until the cumulative declines of 2018 pulled the index into the red on Feb. 5 and into a correction on Feb. 8. On Friday, the S.&P. 500 closed at 2619.55.\n\nEven if the current downturn doesn\u2019t deepen, some sectors are already feeling severe pain. Traders who had bet that calm conditions would continue have lost fortunes. In just two days, the assets in two funds that trade in instruments linked to the VIX \u2014 officially, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 shrank from a combined total of $3 billion to about $150 million. There are few indications so far that trading losses in those instruments \u2014 or in the battered cryptocurrency markets \u2014 have damaged the overall financial system, but that is a worry in a serious downturn.\n\nThere have been major losses in the broader market, however. Through Thursday, the stocks in the S.&P. 500 had lost $5.2 trillion from the index\u2019s peak on Jan. 26, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. That is a staggering amount, but even with those losses, the S.&P. 500 through Thursday had swollen by $3.55 trillion since the 2016 election.\n\nHow far will the current market decline go? I wish I knew. One troubling factor is the change in the leadership of the Federal Reserve, with Jerome H. Powell taking over as chairman on Feb. 3, succeeding Janet L. Yellen. In his confirmation hearings, Mr. Powell signaled a continuation of Fed policy, but the markets are testing him and it is not clear how he will respond.\n\nThe timing is awkward. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy while the federal government is loosening fiscal policy by cutting taxes, and then adding hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending in a last-minute budget deal on Friday. Furthermore, the Trump administration has been pushing for lighter regulation of financial markets. These shifts during a period of stress raise short-term risks for investors in stocks and bonds.\n\nBear markets in stocks \u2014 defined as downturns, from peak to trough, of at least 20 percent \u2014 rarely occur without a recession, and, at the moment, none is visible. That\u2019s one reason for Mr. Detrick\u2019s belief that the market is \u201cprobably getting fairly close to its bottom now.\u201d\n\nWhile that history is comforting, the 20 percent threshold for a bear market is arbitrary, and the link between recessions and the stock market is not ironclad. The bear market of 1987 occurred without a recession, for example. And who would really be surprised if the unusual political conditions in the United States today fostered unexpected patterns in the economy and stock market?\n\nWhat is safe to say is that the market has entered a new, troubling phase. The current turmoil may turn out to be blissfully brief, but it makes sense to be ready for the worst.", "title": "The Stock Market Has Turned Nasty. It Was Long Overdue.", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "The fear generated by Wall Street\u2019s sharp fall in recent days had been greatly magnified by the calm that preceded it. Before the 8 percent decline in United States stocks over the past week \u2014 which was followed by a bounce back of nearly 2 percent on Tuesday \u2014 the S. & P. 500 had gone two years without suffering a drop that large. Spoiled by this unnaturally placid stretch, many Americans had forgotten what a routine market setback even looks like.\n\nThey better get used to this. In a typical year, according to data going back three decades, the market experiences a correction of about 10 percent. What Americans are witnessing now is thus a return to normal market behavior, which has never followed a straight line.\n\nThis year could be pivotal, because the conditions that underpinned the steady upward march of stock prices are now likely to deteriorate. In the United States and around the world, stocks have been buoyed by the trifecta of accelerating global growth, low inflation and loose central bank policies, all of which are now poised to turn against the bubbly market.\n\nOptimists believe that the global economy this year can still grow 4 percent, the pace it maintained during the post-World War II miracle. But the miracle was driven mainly by the postwar baby boom, which ended years ago. Many investors have yet to internalize the fact that 4 percent growth is unrealistic. Fewer workers means slower economic growth and will make it difficult for the world economy to sustain even its 2017 pace of just over 3 percent growth.", "title": "Opinion | The Stock Market Is Volatile Again.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Even milder versions of high inflation, such as the inflation that topped out at more than 14 percent in the United States in 1980, is damaging. At that level, those who have accumulated savings or fixed pensions see their purchasing power vanish over time, and borrowing costs skyrocket (ask anyone who took out a home loan in the early 1980s what their mortgage rate was). That dynamic can impede growth and create broad unhappiness. The economist Arthur Okun even invented the \u201cmisery index\u201d in the 1960s, calculated by adding up the unemployment rate and inflation rate.\n\nBut when inflation turns negative \u2014 that would be deflation, meaning the purchasing power of a currency rises over time \u2014 it can also be disastrous. Debts become more onerous over time, and consumers and businesses have incentive to hoard cash rather than spend or invest it.\n\nThat\u2019s what the United States and other countries experienced during the Great Depression, and it has been experienced in milder forms by Japan over much of the last 20 years and Europe since 2010.\n\nSo how much inflation do we want?\n\nIt might seem inherently bad to have the purchasing power of a falling dollar. But having a bit of inflation seems to grease the wheels of the economy while not distorting economic decisions too much. It helps cushion against deflation, and gives the Fed room to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy during a downturn, helping keep the economy on an even footing.\n\nOver the last couple of decades, central bankers around the world have mostly settled on 2 percent per year as the optimal level of inflation that they aim for. It\u2019s a level low enough that the purchasing power of their currencies is fairly stable and people don\u2019t have to worry about inflation all that much in doing business with one another, while also keeping a buffer to prevent deflationary effects from taking hold.\n\nThat said, 2 percent is a fairly arbitrary number, and some economists argue that steady inflation at a somewhat higher level would help prevent recessions.\n\nThe important thing is arguably less the exact level of inflation and more that it is fairly stable over time. It is big swings that tend to be most disruptive, favoring either debtors (inflation) or creditors (deflation), and generally contributing to lack of faith in a country\u2019s financial system.", "title": "The Stock Market Is Worried About Inflation.

But during extended declines, overnight sell orders may cause prices to plummet when the market opens.\n\nIf there were no trading costs \u2014 possible in a thought experiment but not in the real world \u2014 an excellent strategy over the last few decades would have been buying shares at the last possible moment during regular trading hours and selling them methodically at the opening bell every day, Professor Gulen of Purdue said.\n\nWhile transaction costs make that strategy uneconomical, he said, the concept may still have a certain value. \u201cIf you do know that you are going to make a trade on a given day, and you have the ability to choose when you do it, you might be able to take advantage of this pattern \u2014 buying late in the day and selling early.\u201d Of course, the pattern doesn\u2019t hold every single day, and you could easily be disappointed.\n\nPart of the gap in returns can probably be explained by the human tendency to panic at bad news, Professor Kelly said. \u201cThat panic seems to happen during the day,\u201d he said. \u201cOne advantage of not trading during the day is that you aren\u2019t as likely to participate in panicky selling.\u201d", "title": "The Stock Market Works by Day, but It Loves the Night", "authors": []}

Yes, because nothing says family values like a thrice-married man who allegedly cheats on his latest wife just after she gives birth to their son.

So it can hardly be ignored that the play\u2019s 50th-anniversary revival, opening this spring on Broadway, is addressing a radically different culture, one that \u2014 on the surface, at least \u2014 seems to have sacrificed this undeniably queen-y play on its march toward equality.\n\nAs the actor Zachary Quinto told The New York Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green in an interview for his essay, he originally had \u201ca dismissive take\u201d on \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d having never seen it. But after reading the script and speaking with the producers, he eventually agreed to the part of Harold, the sharp-tongued gay man whose birthday provides the play with its setting. \u201cThe criticism was that it offered a stereotypical quality to who these characters are,\u201d Quinto said. \u201cBut what gets lost is that characters like these had never been seen on the American stage before.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nT\u2019s editor in chief, Hanya Yanagihara, saw an early reading of the play last summer and \u201cwas struck by how crackling and relevant this 50-year-old play still was: its humor, but also how vividly it telegraphed the characters\u2019 shame and despair,\u201d she says. \u201cBut what made it poignant was seeing, before me, nine openly gay actors who had made successful careers for themselves as themselves. I knew by the end of the reading that this would be an important cultural moment, and that I wanted the cast for the cover of T.\u201d\n\nMagazines being what they are, Yanagihara adds, it took about six months of planning before the cast gathered for T\u2019s Dec. 17 shoot in New York, photographed by Inez and Vinoodh. Quinto and the rest of the revival\u2019s leads \u2014 including Jim Parsons, Andrew Rannells and Matt Bomer \u2014 were joined by co-producer Ryan Murphy and director Joe Mantello, and, in a nice departure from the usual turmoil of group photo shoots (which are usually complicated by scheduling conflicts and clashing egos), there was very little drama. \u201cEveryone was on time and played nice with each other on set: no jockeying for specific positioning,\u201d says T\u2019s creative director, Patrick Li. \u201cThe fact that the shoot proceeded without incident was the only thing that was unexpected.\u201d These men, who represent the first generation of out-and-proud gay stars, frequently work together \u2014 often in Murphy\u2019s television projects \u2014 and their genuine affection for one another gave the shoot \u2014 and the play \u2014 its sense of intimacy and warmth.", "title": "The Story Behind T\u2019s \u2018The Boys in the Band\u2019 Cover", "authors": ["Kurt Soller"]}

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "So, too, with the specific cases that the Atlantic essay focuses on: Trump\u2019s insouciance about Russian interference in the last presidential election, and his continuing attacks on law enforcement professionals over the probe into his campaign\u2019s possible involvement with that interference. Just consider the following caveat that Wittes and Rauch append to their brief:\n\nWe don\u2019t mean to deny credit where it is due. \u2026 Last year, pressure from individual Republicans seemed to discourage Trump from firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and probably prevented action against Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Moreover, Republicans as a group have constrained Trump on occasion. Congress imposed tough sanctions on Russia over the president\u2019s objections. The Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a serious Russia investigation under the leadership of Richard Burr. But the broader response to Trump\u2019s behavior has been tolerant and, often, enabling.\n\nSo according to authors who are trying to convince Trump-skeptical Republicans to vote against every single G.O.P. politician on principle, many Trump-era Republicans have 1) defended and protected a sweeping probe into their president\u2019s campaign and possibly his family\u2019s finances; 2) passed legislation punishing Russia for its interference; and 3) conducted a \u201cserious Russia investigation\u201d from within the United States Senate. All of which seems like \u2026 quite a bit? Perhaps even a sign that many prominent Republicans are not really just \u201cenabling\u201d Trump at all?\n\nNow it\u2019s quite true that other Republicans, especially in the House, have run interference for Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller\u2019s probe, and encouraged rank-and-file conservatives and frequent \u201cHannity\u201d viewers to believe the worst about the F.B.I. and other \u201cdeep state\u201d organs. But partisan attacks on a special counsel\u2019s probe are not the same thing as a sustained presidential assault on democratic institutions. Nor are angry presidential tweets that lack any sustained follow-through: If the president yells about his persecutors and little or nothing happens \u2014 the Mueller probe continues, Rod Rosenstein keeps his job, etc. \u2014 what\u2019s undermined is presidential authority, not the rule of law.\n\nAnd if many House Republicans are working to enable Trump\u2019s authoritarian instincts while various Senate Republicans work to constrain them, surely that\u2019s cause for precisely the kind of discriminating thinking that Wittes and Rauch want their Republican readers to rule out \u2014 for praising Richard Burr and criticizing Devin Nunes, let\u2019s say, or for hoping Republicans keep the Senate while not minding if they lose the House, or otherwise judging conservative leaders case by case rather than insisting that they\u2019re all rubber-stamping an incipient dictatorship.\n\nAll judgments about a year-old presidency are provisional. It is very easy to imagine a scenario in which the Wittes and Rauch argument would become persuasive. For instance, if Trump were to actually fire Rosenstein and Mueller and close down the Russia investigation and Senate Republicans did nothing. Or, to be a little more imaginative, if Trump started overruling his own foreign policy team and making various unwarranted, Manchurian-candidate-style concessions to the Russians, and the Senate simply went along.\n\nOr if he invaded a country and toppled its government without Senate approval, or if he began prosecuting journalists on dubious grounds, or if tried to unilaterally rewrite immigration laws, or if he ordered the C.I.A. to torture prisoners at black sites \u2026\n\n\u2026 aah, sorry, I became carried away with memories of the last two administrations, neither of which corroded democratic norms through Twitter outbursts and personal sleaziness, to their credit, but both of which made big norm-eroding moves on other fronts that Trump has not yet come close to matching.\n\nWhich is why, for now, the constant claims that Republicans are enabling an \u201cAmerican Pinochet\u201d (as New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait suggested this week) and that honorable conservatives are therefore duty-bound to hand every elected office over to a Democratic Party that, as Wittes and Rauch themselves concede, has become more ideologically extreme \u2014 well, at best they are premature, based on things that haven\u2019t happened yet but might; at worst they are a species of hysteria.\n\nI wish that Donald Trump were not the president; I blame Republicans for enabling his rise. But once his election was accomplished, their promise of containment became a reasonable approach. And so long as he remains weak and trammeled and conventional in policy, the case that conservatives have a moral obligation to vote like liberals won\u2019t convince.", "title": "Opinion | The Taming of a Demagogue", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "A high-grade, 10-year municipal bond issue currently has an average yield of roughly 2.5 percent. That compares with a 3.3 percent taxable yield for someone in the 24 percent federal tax bracket, and 4 percent for a taxpayer paying the top federal rate of 37 percent. The taxable equivalent yield is even higher if the income is also exempt from a state tax.\n\nBy comparison, the yield on a 10-year Treasury bond is below 3 percent and the yield on the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund, which invests in taxable government and corporate bonds, was recently only 2.5 percent.\n\nDespite the appeal of munis, though, you need to be careful: The muni market can be tricky.\n\nFor one thing, amid fiscal belt tightening since the financial crisis, the pace of new municipal bonds hitting the market has declined. The tax law revision also eliminated advance refunding issues, a type of municipal bond financing that accounts for around 15 percent of the market, intensifying supply constraints.\n\nAt the same time, individual investors own about 70 percent of the municipal bonds, and demand from them seems likely to remain strong. Morningstar Direct reported $34 billion in net inflows to municipal bond funds and exchange-traded funds in 2017 \u2014 even before investors in high-tax states had the chance to huddle with their advisers to assess the impact of the new tax law.\n\nWith hungry investors chasing a smaller pool of municipal issues, the prices of bonds are likely to be bid higher. (In the world of bonds, yields move in the opposite direction from prices; so higher bond prices mean lower yields.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThat pressure has already caused the yield difference between municipal bonds and comparable Treasuries to widen \u2014 reducing the muni advantage. For much of the last decade, the tax-free yield on a 10-year high-grade municipal bond was at least 90 percent of the taxable yield on a 10-year Treasury. That ratio is now down to the low 80s. Hugh McGuirk, head of the municipal bond team at T. Rowe Price, expects that this ratio will \u201cbe even under more pressure\u201d as a result of these supply and demand issues.\n\nMunicipal bonds issued within your home state can be enticing because of the extra tax features. Around one-quarter of the nearly $700 billion in muni bond funds and E.T.F.s is invested in single-state portfolios, according to Morningstar Direct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Adam Stern, co-head of research at the fixed-income specialist Breckinridge Capital Advisors, cautioned that sticking with in-state issuers could be difficult. \u201cIn California, where there are hundreds of different issuers, you can create a pretty-well-diversified portfolio. But a state like New Jersey is a little tougher. With fewer issuers, it\u2019s harder to figure out a diversified portfolio.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. McGuirk said the national funds run by T. Rowe Price usually own issues backed by 250 to 300 guarantors, compared with just 60 to 80 for single-state funds. Owning out-of-state bonds in a national fund can provide diversification, though you will pocket only the federal interest-income tax break, and have a liability for state and local taxes. Bonds from five states account for about half the assets in the Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income fund, which has a recent yield of 2.6 percent.\n\nHigh-yield municipal bonds carry more risk, but John Miller, co-head of fixed income at Nuveen Asset Management, expects them to have a solid 2018, mainly because he does not see a recession on the near-term horizon. With low unemployment and rising home values, the vast majority of municipalities are seeing tax revenue increase.\n\n\u201cNinety-nine percent of last year\u2019s default were in Puerto Rican issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAll other defaults were less than $1 billion.\u201d That\u2019s a rounding error in a $3.8 trillion market.\n\nActively managed high-yield muni funds actually invest mainly in high-grade issues, with a heavy seasoning of high-yield. The average high-yield municipal fund currently has about 60 percent of its assets parked in investment-grade bonds, according to Morningstar Direct. T. Rowe Price Tax-Free High Yield fund, which earns a top Morningstar analyst rating, currently has about 62 percent invested in high-grade issues. Vanguard High-Yield Tax Exempt fund has more than 80 percent invested in high-grade bonds. Still, both portfolios have current yields above 3.7 percent.\n\nTroubles loom on the horizon, though.\n\nUnderfunded state and local pensions are a festering issue for muni bonds. Chicago\u2019s woes are well known, but even New York City is under some financial pressure. The fiscal health of issuers determines their credit rating; if that rating falls, so will the price of its bonds.\n\nMoreover, the $10,000 federal cap on state and local tax deductions may make it harder for local officials to sell tax increases. If residents balk at higher taxes, future revenue increases will increasingly be generated through less-predictable fees and fines. Over time, that sort of shift could impair a city\u2019s or state\u2019s financial health. \u201cIt may be a subtle year-over-year change where the cumulative impact over a decade could be meaningful,\u201d said Mr. Stern of Breckinridge.\n\nThat would hurt general obligation municipal bonds, which are backed by the taxing power of a municipality. Mr. McGuirk of T. Rowe Price said that while these bonds account for about one-third of new muni issues annually, his firm\u2019s municipal bond funds usually have 15 percent or less invested in them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our long-term concern, baked in for the challenges of state and local issuers to finance obligations,\u201d he said. It is a concern that seems to be shared by many managers; according to Morningstar Direct, the average muni fund allocates 15 percent to those bonds.\n\nAnother type of muni, a general revenue issue, is an alternative. Such bonds rely on the income generated by a specific project, like a water and electricity project. That income source could be quite reliable, because households and businesses are likely to keep paying their utility bills. For households now facing higher personal income tax bills because of the reduction in the state and local income tax break, these bonds might rate as essential tools to generate tax-free income.", "title": "The Tax Law Gives Municipal Bonds a New Allure", "authors": ["Carla Fried"]}

The rate at which Americans were dying in combat remained at least 50 percent above the 1967 average through the rest of March and April.\n\nFor the American forces in South Vietnam as a whole there was not even a brief respite in the three months after the offensive began, even as the Communists were gathering forces for another surge in early May.\n\nAmericans have often played down that May offensive; they call it \u201cMini-Tet.\u201d It did not have even the degree of partial surprise that the original Tet offensive had had, so it did not come as close to achieving important successes. But there was nothing miniature about it. May 1968 was the bloodiest month of the war for American forces, with 2,169 killed, and even in the first half of June the death tolls remained well above pre-Tet levels.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Many analysts have subsequently criticized the Americans for not launching a counteroffensive in the aftermath of Tet; they say that the Communists were so weakened that they couldn\u2019t continue heavy combat, but that the United States had been so shocked by Tet that it lost the will to continue pushing for victory. General Westmoreland wrote that President Lyndon Johnson \u201cignored the maxim that when the enemy is hurting, you don\u2019t diminish the pressure, you increase it.\u201d Many more recent authors have also said that Johnson de-escalated the war in response to Tet.\n\nJohnson himself had laid the groundwork for this notion in his television address of March 31, 1968, in which he announced that he was not running for re-election. The president said that in an effort to get peace talks started, he was \u201creducing \u2014 substantially reducing \u2014 the present level of hostilities.\u201d\n\nBut this was not true. He was still committed to American victory. He was interested only in a peace settlement in which the Communists abandoned their effort to win control of South Vietnam. And in order to make them accept such a settlement, he was increasing, not decreasing, the military pressure he put on them.\n\nJohnson did not send to Vietnam the major reinforcements, more than 200,000 men, that his generals had recommended. But he did send reinforcements. There had been 498,000 American military personnel in Vietnam when the Tet offensive began, at the end of January. There were 515,000 by the time Johnson gave his speech, two months later. There would be 536,000 two months after that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey were fighting hard, and Johnson was urging them on. Even in the autumn, after Gen. Creighton Abrams had replaced Westmoreland as commander in Vietnam, Johnson\u2019s orders to Abrams were: \u201cFollow the enemy in relentless pursuit. Don\u2019t give them a minute\u2019s rest. Keep pouring it on. Let the enemy feel the weight of everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nHe also was escalating his use of air power. The heaviest bomb tonnage the United States had ever dropped on Indochina in a single month before the Tet offensive was 83,000 tons. For March 1968, the month leading up to Johnson\u2019s speech, the figure was 97,000 tons. It was over 110,000 tons in each of the next five months, from April through August.\n\nBut Johnson was facing criticism, much of it from within his own party, that his policy in Vietnam was one of mindless violence. So he did not say he was intensifying his bombing of enemy forces. Instead he said that he was narrowing the area in which American bombs would fall. He used misleading language that suggested he was narrowing that area more than he actually was.\n\nGround combat did not remain continually intense after the middle of 1968, as it had from late January through late June. But the Americans were continuing to push, and the Communists pushed back enough of the time to create significant periods of intense combat.\n\nOf the 12 bloodiest months of the Vietnam War, the ones in which the largest numbers of Americans were killed in action, eight came after Johnson\u2019s speech. Four of those eight were in 1969, after Richard Nixon became president.\n\nNixon in his first months had continued Johnson\u2019s policies of heavy bombing and heavy ground combat. It was not until well into 1969 that the bomb tonnages being expended in Indochina, the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam, and the willingness of American commanders to sustain heavy casualties in aggressive ground operations, finally began to decline.", "title": "The Tet Offensive Was Just the Beginning", "authors": ["Edwin Moise"]}

She worked as a teacher\u2019s aide in the local schools that most of her own (eventual) 13 children attended. She babysat, ran an after-school program and served free lunches out of the field house by her high-rise. She moved her aging mother in with them, and Ricks\u2019s grown children found jobs in construction, home health care, retail and at a new residential complex built atop the old Madison Street \u201cskid row,\u201d an area refashioned into the \u201cWest Loop.\u201d Ricks didn\u2019t leave Cabrini after one of her nephews was hit with several bullets through her apartment window \u2014 his heart stopped twice before he survived. She stuck it out as the city demolished every other public-housing high-rise in Chicago not reserved for the elderly, including all the towers at Cabrini-Green save hers. After the start of this civic remodeling, in 1999, Mayor Richard M. Daley said that breaking up the severe concentrations of poverty of high-rise public housing would finally imbue long-neglected neighborhoods with vitality; the mostly black residents who lived there in social and economic isolation would be able to reap the rewards of the resurgent city. \u201cI want to rebuild their souls,\u201d Daley declared. But Ricks believed her soul was doing all right on its own. She refused to go, in 2010, even as every neighbor remaining in her building took whatever replacement housing was offered them. She outlasted them all. \u201cI\u2019m the last woman standing,\u201d Ricks liked to declare.\n\nPhoto\n\nRicks held firm to a belief that if she followed the rules, if she kept up her part in an agreement, then she was entitled to all that was promised her. Her three youngest children \u2014 Reggie, Rose and Raqkown \u2014 were still on her lease, along with two of her nearly 40 grandchildren. She wasn\u2019t in her apartment illegally, she contended. She paid her rent on time. No one caught her with drugs or guns. So how could the C.H.A. just assign her a new unit? But the city took her to court, and a federal judge gave her 10 days to vacate the building. That was that. \u201cI had to go,\u201d she conceded. \u201cEither that or be homeless again.\u201d\n\nAs it had the day she arrived at Cabrini-Green, snow covered the ground on the December morning in 2010 that she left. A crowd of reporters jostled the last high-rise tenants of what had been the city\u2019s and the country\u2019s most well-known public-housing project. \u201cAn inglorious end to an infamous era,\u201d as one news outlet put it. Another described Cabrini-Green as \u201cthe housing development that came to symbolize the squandered hope of them all.\u201d Deonta Ricks lugged a cardboard box filled with his mother\u2019s most prized possessions: the trophies he and his siblings had won for basketball tournaments and perfect attendance and the one he was awarded for being valedictorian of the school that was still there, an empty field away. The Cabrini-Green neighborhood, only a few blocks west of the ritzy Gold Coast, had a new library and police station, new shopping and upscale housing. The school, too, had been renamed and given a makeover, and it now served only those students who tested in, ranking it among the best elementaries in Illinois. Rose, then 17, rolled a suitcase with a \u201cRoute 66\u201d sticker on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been here basically my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cLike it\u2019s hard leaving when you\u2019ve got so much memories of it. You knew everyone. You felt safe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the trophies were stowed and the furniture loaded onto a truck, Annie Ricks ducked into a sedan the same off-white color as her high-rise. The car spun its wheels on the snow and gained traction, and she was gone.\n\nThe fate of public housing in America \u2014 its rise, much of it in the form of towers like Cabrini-Green, and its fall as those towers came down \u2014 is the story of urban poverty as an unsteady political priority. In his first year as president, in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt created the federal Housing Division, as part of the Public Works Administration. The P.W.A. built the country\u2019s first 51 public-housing developments, including three in Chicago. By then the shortcomings of the for-profit real estate market were evident in eviction riots, in sprawling homeless encampments and in cities overflowing with mile after mile of cheap, decrepit frame dwellings. In segregated black neighborhoods, where families were excluded from competing for housing on the open market, the conditions were more dire. Without government intervention in some form, private developers and landlords were never going to build or maintain anywhere near enough homes for the urban poor. Like other New Deal assistance programs \u2014 relief for farmers, aid to senior citizens through Social Security, food stamps \u2014 public housing treated poverty as a widespread social and economic injustice that the country was obligated to right. The subsidy was also intended to help jump-start the economy by rebuilding moribund cities and creating jobs. In 1937, Congress passed more extensive legislation, establishing a federal housing agency; Chicago and other cities formed their own housing authorities to operate the program locally. \u201cI see one-third of a nation ill housed, ill clad, ill nourished,\u201d Roosevelt announced that year. \u201cThe test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.\u201d\n\nThen, as now, the idea of government-run housing was maligned as anticapitalist and socialist; it clashed with a national ethos wrapped up in visions of the frontiersman and the self-made entrepreneur. When the Housing Act of 1937 was being debated, it was opposed by real estate trade groups and property owners\u2019 associations, by builders, suppliers, the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the departments of the Interior and the Treasury. Although the subsidy was reserved for only stable families with modest incomes \u2014 the \u201cdeserving poor\u201d \u2014 the ceiling on what qualifying residents could earn was said to discourage hard work, acting as a sap on initiative and pluck. Ayn Rand\u2019s \u201cThe Fountainhead\u201d dramatized the backlash against Roosevelt\u2019s call for a deeper social contract of shared responsibility: The hero of the 1943 novel is an architect of a public-housing complex who becomes enraged when he returns from a trip to discover that his bare-bones high-rise has been compromised to include \u201cthe expense of incomprehensible features\u201d like balconies, a gymnasium, extra doorways and decorative brickwork. In an act portrayed as a valiant defense of his convictions, he dynamites the entire building. Maybe most telling, the same Depression-era legislation that funded the first public-housing complexes also created the federally insured private home loan. With this revolution in home financing, buyers were able to put down as little as 10 percent of a house\u2019s cost and pay off their mortgages in small increments over an unprecedented 30 years. Even today, the federal government devotes three times as much each year to mortgage-interest deductions and other subsidies to the speculative real estate market \u2014 essentially public housing for homeowners \u2014 than to the entire annual budget of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe first public-housing developments were often simple and unadorned brick rowhouses or duplexes. They were required to be built to minimum standards, so as not to compete with the private rental market, and the overall populations were diverse, in part because federal rules dictated that public housing couldn\u2019t change the existing racial makeup of a neighborhood. In the 1950s, cities began to build massive complexes of clustered towers encircled by plots of land closed off to through streets. It was a purity of modernist city planning, influenced by the avant-garde \u201ctowers in the park\u201d urban reimagining of the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The density and nearly identical stripped-down designs of the high-rises were also believed to cut down on costs while meeting greater demand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like I died and went to heaven,\u201d one of the first tenants of a development in Chicago recalled years later. J.S. Fuerst, the former head of research and statistics at the C.H.A., collected this testimonial and dozens of others like it from early occupants of the agency\u2019s properties for a 2003 book titled \u201cWhen Public Housing Was Paradise.\u201d Even though these were low-income communities of thousands of people crammed together on isolated plazas, many families still found a modest home to be somehow divine after the damnation of the cold-water flats they left behind. There, they had been afraid of fires and sickness and eviction. Public housing, by contrast, was new and orderly. All the families went through a screening process. The buildings had teams of janitors on call around the clock. Groundskeepers maintained the gardens and lawns. There was a city agency responsible for answering calls. The C.H.A.\u2019s first executive director, Elizabeth Wood, worried not that the new developments might be too large and come to define an area as low-rent, but rather that they wouldn\u2019t be large enough to counteract the damaging effects of poverty and disrepair around them. \u201cIf it is not bold,\u201d she said in 1945, \u201cthe result will be a series of small projects, islands in a wilderness of slums beaten down by smoke, noise and fumes.\u201d\n\nAcross the entire country, a majority of public housing remained in low-rises; there were eventually more than 3,000 local authorities, most with fewer than 500 units. But large housing \u201cprojects\u201d came to dominate urban landscapes and symbolize for many the unruliness and otherness of the \u201cinner city\u201d in decline. The towers-in-the-park design was only ever partly to blame. In Chicago, as elsewhere, high-rise developments were built intentionally in neighborhoods that were already segregated racially; rather than apportioning the working poor across a number of areas and helping to diversify cities, public housing had the effect of solidifying racial and economic boundaries in superblocks detached from the street grid, in towers of concrete and steel. Yet they were also perennially underfunded and perilously mismanaged. The developments were allowed to deteriorate as maintenance and repairs lagged. And as the broader fortunes of cities declined \u2014 diminishing populations and disappearing jobs, spiking poverty and crime and drug use \u2014 public housing bore the worst of those effects.\n\nSoon, those same broad trends were used to justify abandoning the basic democratic idea of providing shelter for all. In 1972, when the 33 Pruitt-Igoe towers in St. Louis began to be imploded a mere 18 years after the complex fully opened, the televised image, with its mushrooming cloud of dust and debris, defined the popular notion of the public-housing experiment: It needed to be destroyed.\n\nFor other cities, demolition still remained a political and practical impossibility. In previous decades when slums were cleared, those displaced were sent into public housing. Now where could tens of thousands of people from the projects be sent? But the aversion to social safety-net programs only came to root more deeply in the American mainstream. After retaking Congress in 1994, Republicans said they planned to scrap the federal housing agency entirely. President Clinton, promoting his cuts to the welfare system and proclaiming \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d pre-emptively reorganized HUD. The agency promised to \u201cinfuse market discipline\u201d into public housing. The anti-urban impulse that had sent middle-class families to the suburbs had reversed itself, and young professionals were flocking to city centers near their jobs and one another.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1990, Chicago\u2019s population started to tick up for the first time in 40 years; the area surrounding Cabrini-Green added 4,000 white residents during the previous decade, and vacant lots that had sold for $30,000 a few years earlier were being snapped up for five times that amount. As the fortunes of cities changed once again, public housing experienced a new pressure. HUD began to award municipalities tens of millions of dollars in grants to tear down their public-housing high-rises and replace them with much smaller developments that mixed public-housing families with higher-income renters and market-rate owners. Proposals to preserve some of the towers, filling in the cleared land around them with a variety of housing types, were rejected. Many low-rise developments in rejuvenating areas were targeted as well. A majority of the relocated public-housing residents were given Section 8 vouchers to rent from landlords in the private market. Nationwide, 250,000 public-housing units have been demolished since the 1990s. Atlanta, Baltimore, Columbus, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Tucson \u2014 just about every American city got in on the action. But no city knocked down as many as Chicago.\n\nThe C.H.A. moved Annie Ricks six miles away, to Chicago\u2019s South Side, into Wentworth Gardens, a low-rise public-housing development built just after World War II. Since then, Wentworth had become sandwiched between the 14 lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway and the parking lots for the White Sox baseball stadium. The only place nearby to buy groceries was a gas station and liquor store on the far end of the complex. But the units were modernized, and Ricks\u2019s four-bedroom had a new kitchen and bathroom. Her apartment was on the second floor of a three-story walk-up, part of attached buildings that formed a horseshoe around a shared courtyard. In her living room, she hung photos of her family, three pictures of President Obama and a couple of prayers and rules: \u201cMen don\u2019t wear hats in the house.\u201d\n\nRicks wanted to remain upbeat about the move. But when violence broke out at her new home, the longtime Wentworth residents said it was the fault of the newcomers, the outsiders from Cabrini-Green, a number of whom had been moved there. An elderly woman announced for Rose to hear that she didn\u2019t like the Cabrini people and wanted them gone. When Reggie and Raqkown tried to play basketball at the courts beside their apartment, the guys there threw elbows and fists, trying to turn the game into a brawl. A group of boys jumped Reggie in the courtyard. Other former Cabrini residents who ended up there had guns pulled on them. \u201cPeople at Wentworth think you\u2019re stepping on their turf,\u201d Ricks said. \u201cThis is not your turf. This is C.H.A.\u2019s turf. You can\u2019t run me from my home. Because I do pay rent.\u201d\n\nShe often made the trip to visit her friends at the remaining strip of rowhouses at Cabrini-Green. She went to the jazz concerts held in the nearby park. Like many relocated families, she felt safer in the vestiges of the old neighborhood. When Raqkown, Ricks\u2019s youngest, left his high school most days, he traveled to the field house at Cabrini. The principal at the neighborhood elementary school said two-thirds of his students were former Cabrini families who took the bus and train long distances to get there. Several Cabrini-Green Facebook pages formed, people reporting job opportunities and business ventures, sharing words of inspiration and announcements of deaths in the Cabrini family. Oftentimes a post showed a photo of one of the disappeared high-rises \u2014 \u201cWho can say what building this is?\u201d \u2014 leading to long threads of competing memories.\n\nOn an airless Saturday night in the summer of 2012, Ricks stepped outside into the Wentworth courtyard. She\u2019d been confined to her apartment all day taking care of grandchildren and wanted to relax. She set up a small table, placing atop it a transistor radio and a can of bug spray. She popped open a bottle of iced tea she bought at the gas station and tuned the radio to a gospel station. Then she was startled by screaming in the distance. She recognized the voice before she saw him: Reggie. He came racing toward her out of the darkness with Raqkown sprinting beside him. A mob of men were at their heels. Her sons dashed past her and up the stairs to their apartment, their pursuers rushing past as well. Rose, who was inside, opened the door for her brothers, and the Wentworth guys charged in behind them, colliding into her. Ricks ran up the stairs after them. \u201cHome invasion!\u201d she cried.\n\nIn the cramped apartment, one invader knocked a television off the wall and stomped his foot through it. They pushed over a chest of drawers and threw chairs. Reggie, who was bleeding from his head, lifted a cooking pot off the stove and swung it to fend off blows. Rose armed herself with a mop. Their mother usually carried a fist of keys with her, and she now punched with it. She held the aerosol can of bug repellent as well, and she sprayed it into any face close by. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it like this,\u201d Ricks said later that night, \u201cwe did whatever we had to do to get their asses out of our house.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the next two weeks, Ricks stayed with a son in the Cabrini rowhouses. One of her older daughters put up Reggie and Raqkown. Rose moved in temporarily with another sibling in the western suburbs. A social-service provider asked Ricks if she wanted to go to a shelter. She didn\u2019t. A shelter wasn\u2019t any place to live. \u201cThat\u2019s like giving up,\u201d Ricks said. With the home invasion, her old stubbornness returned. No way was she going to be cheated out of a four-bedroom again. Not this time. She was going to keep her family together.\n\nShe put in for a transfer to a different C.H.A. development along the lakefront, and she documented every time she phoned the agency to get an update. She checked in with a pro bono lawyer who agreed to take her case, asking when she should expect to move.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJust trying to get them to confirm that you\u2019re eligible to be on the wait list for a four-bedroom,\u201d he told her.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I think this is going to be taken care of. It\u2019s not going to be done quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be quickly, because you\u2019re my lawyer,\u201d Ricks said.\n\n\u201cI may be a lawyer; however, I\u2019m not a magician.\u201d\n\nShe ended up cutting ties with him. He\u2019d been emailing the C.H.A. since July, but three months later, her situation remained the same. \u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I\u2019d have been white, he\u2019d have moved me the very same day. He doesn\u2019t have to live in Wentworth Gardens, in the ghetto, as they say.\u201d\n\nAcross the highway from Wentworth Gardens, the 28 towers of the Robert Taylor Homes had stretched in a narrow band for two miles, looming in groups of three like sentinels for almost 50 years. But the entire housing project was torn down by 2007. The cleared land remained vacant. Unlike the Cabrini-Green site, the area couldn\u2019t attract the higher rents or the sale of market-rate apartments to support a new mixed-income development. Mixed-income replacement buildings did offer public-housing families a better place to live. But the restrictions on entry excluded many, and interactions within the buildings were often tense. Most of all, the blended populations and low densities (as well as the crash of the housing market, which put a halt to most construction) meant they met just a small percentage of the need. In Chicago today, fewer than 3,000 public-housing families live in one of the mixed-income complexes.\n\nMany more families were like the Rickses, people who went from run-down public housing to rehabbed public housing, albeit still in areas of concentrated poverty. The same proved true for those who moved with a voucher. The C.H.A. currently oversees 16,000 units of occupied public housing, more than a third of which are designated for the elderly, and 47,000 vouchers in the private market. The combination of the two exceeds what the agency\u2019s total supply of housing was in the \u201990s. Nationally, the number of families using a Section 8 rent subsidy has doubled over the last 25 years, to 2.3 million. In theory, a voucher gives a family the choice to live anywhere. But the rents the federal government pays to Section 8 landlords are generally not enough for a home in a diverse neighborhood with strong schools and low crime; most landlords taking vouchers aren\u2019t in \u201copportunity\u201d areas but in poor and racially isolated ones not so different from the razed government-run high-rises. In 2003, an independent monitor of the C.H.A.\u2019s first years of relocations offered a bleak assessment: \u201cThe result has been that the vertical ghettos from which the families are being moved are being replaced with horizontal ghettos, located in well defined, highly segregated neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe families that were dispersed from Chicago\u2019s demolished public housing have been blamed for the city\u2019s recent surge in gun violence, as well as for crime in the suburbs, the greater Midwest and even parts of the South. Several studies have shown that C.H.A. residents did not spread disorder wherever they settled, as if they carried an infectious disease. But these families were moved primarily to areas of Chicago that were already hollowed out of population, schools, occupied homes, jobs and resources. In South Shore, which took on more Section 8 renters than any other neighborhood in the city, 3,700 apartments were caught up in foreclosures, one out of every five rental units. The problems of concentrated poverty and isolation, which the demolitions were supposed to solve, persisted \u2014 and relocated families now found themselves in strange territory without their former support networks. People in public housing had, by necessity, bartered services, shopped together, shared food, stepped up when a neighbor lost a loved one. Annie Ricks\u2019s oldest daughter, Kenosha, left Cabrini-Green when she was in her 20s and moved with her family to a block on the West Side. \u201cI\u2019ve been out here almost a decade, and I know three or four of my neighbors,\u201d she told me recently. \u201c \u2018They from the projects,\u2019 people say. But they don\u2019t know me. They weren\u2019t raised how we were raised. We were raised to stick together. If you\u2019re a neighbor, you let the next neighbor know what\u2019s going on. They don\u2019t do that out here.\u201d\n\nDevelopments like Cabrini-Green did in fact need to be made safer and more livable, and maybe even torn down. But the public had an obligation as well to ensure that those who lived there didn\u2019t lose out when the high-rises were replaced. Virtually no new public housing has been built in the country in decades. There\u2019s still a stock of over a million units nationwide, down from a peak of 1.4 million. Much of it is at risk. A HUD-commissioned study in 2010 found a $26 billion backlog in repair and maintenance needs, a figure estimated to have ballooned since then to more than $50 billion. Each year, some 10,000 to 15,000 units are lost solely because of neglect. The New York City Housing Authority had long avoided the failings that troubled authorities in other big cities. Towers in New York are the norm; maintenance and management remained strong, and high demand for housing allowed for renters with a greater range of incomes. But the city\u2019s 2,500 buildings, home to 400,000 New Yorkers, now need $17 billion in unmet repairs. The problem is often worse in small cities and less-urban areas, because there is no other supply of low-income rentals once dilapidated public housing is shuttered. HUD, rather than trying to replenish its dangerously insufficient capital fund, submitted a 2018 budget that would slash it by another two-thirds.\n\nAll of this comes amid an affordable-housing crisis that is as urgent as it is unheeded. Today, only one of every five families poor enough to qualify for a housing subsidy actually receives one. A quarter of all renters nationwide pay more than half their income in rent. Families are forced to make harmful choices between rent and food, doctor\u2019s visits and education costs. In their search for what public-housing agencies had promised as the minimal requirement of a \u201cdecent, safe and sanitary home,\u201d the poor have been pushed farther from the economic activity and opportunities of city centers. The current head of the Chicago Housing Authority, Eugene Jones Jr., has envisioned a remedy, albeit an unlikely one, coming in the form of an infrastructure bill that would fully fund housing assistance, coupling the subsidy with the wraparound services \u2014 health care, day care, job training and transportation \u2014 that residents need to thrive. \u201cI\u2019m not a Republican, but we\u2019re trying to transform our residents out of public and assisted housing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe end game is that you\u2019re moving off subsistence.\u201d It\u2019s a noble goal. But there simply is no adequate supply of housing at that next step up. In 2014, when the C.H.A. opened a lottery just to make it onto the waiting list for either a voucher or public-housing unit, 280,000 families entered their names, a quarter of all the households in Chicago.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround the old Cabrini-Green and other expensive urban real estate markets, close-cropped towers are again being built. These are high-end private developments, although they occasionally set aside a number of subsidized apartments for an allotted period of time in exchange for tax breaks and building rights. The common sentiment is that the people who can afford the luxury high-rises have created their own good fortune; the generous government benefits they receive are rightfully earned. For those in Wentworth Gardens or Chicago\u2019s distant South Side or any impoverished neighborhood in the country, no political will exists anymore for the government to step in and transform the blocks that have been left to decline. Affordable-housing advocates are by no means pushing for a return to large public-housing high-rise developments, but some have noted that a few towers mixed in here and there with the luxury condos wouldn\u2019t stand out.\n\nThere are calls to again mobilize the country\u2019s resources. The Bipartisan Policy Center has endorsed a universal voucher program that would guarantee rental assistance to the country\u2019s 11.4 million extremely low income households. Several studies by the Urban Institute and other research organizations show that such an endeavor would recoup much of its cost in reduced homelessness and also ease health problems and other consequences of instability that are ultimately paid for by governments. Several organizations in recent years have proposed tax credits for cost-burdened low-income households. And a bill introduced numerous times by the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison sets out to cut the mortgage-interest deduction for wealthier homeowners and use the $200 billion in savings over 10 years to close the affordable-housing deficit. Congress did, in fact, cut the mortgage-interest deduction as part of last December\u2019s tax bill, though by much less than low-income housing proponents had wanted. The savings went not to creating affordable housing but to offsetting the tax benefits that Republicans doled out to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Seventy years into our test as a country to provide housing for those who have too little, we are hardly any closer to passing.\n\nAnnie Ricks was out walking one night, venturing from Wentworth Gardens, when a burning pain shot through her left foot. She soon developed calluses on her heel. Then she couldn\u2019t put any weight on the foot. An emergency-room doctor said she had diabetes and needed surgery. The recovery was supposed to take less than a week, but Ricks got an infection at the hospital. She had trouble eating and lost weight, the sharp bones of her cheeks never more pronounced. \u201cI need to laugh sometimes instead of cry,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to cry, it won\u2019t get me out of Wentworth Gardens.\u201d But then she came down with pneumonia. She was relocated to another hospital and intubated. She couldn\u2019t talk or smile. Her daughters complained that the staff ignored their mother because she lacked insurance and relied on state medical assistance. They said the nurses failed to turn her properly, pointing to the holes forming in their mother\u2019s back. The family contacted a malpractice lawyer they heard about on television, who asked them repeatedly if there had been a bed fall, because that would be a \u201cslam dunk.\u201d No, they told him, there hadn\u2019t been a fall, and he stopped returning their calls. Then on Nov. 16, 2014, with her family gathered around, Annie Ricks died. She was 58. \u201cYou walk in with a sore foot, and you never leave,\u201d a daughter said bitterly.\n\nRose and her toddler daughter remained in the apartment at Wentworth Gardens. Her brothers slept there less and less frequently. With their mother gone, their lives became more itinerant. They stayed with girlfriends or with other siblings scattered around the city and the surrounding suburbs. Wentworth hadn\u2019t become any safer for them. Reggie, in his early 20s, was arrested there after another fight. A group of guys at the development pounced on Raqkown and broke a bone in his neck. But it wasn\u2019t clear where they would be better off. Raequonn Ricks Williams, a 19-year-old relative, was shot on the West Side, one of the 762 people murdered in Chicago in 2016. Reggie and his mother had squabbled before her death. He\u2019d been turned down at more than a dozen job interviews, and Annie Ricks berated him for giving up. He racked up arrests. \u201cWhen Reggie left Cabrini, he felt his whole family was gone,\u201d Kenosha said of her younger brother. \u201cHis immediate family plus everybody he was in, like, preschool with.\u201d\n\nRose left finally for an apartment building 25 blocks farther south. She had got her daughter into a school near there, and she had also come to feel haunted at Wentworth, always expecting to see her mother emerge from one of the bedrooms. Back in 2014, at her mother\u2019s funeral, Rose had been unable to speak through her tears. A hundred former Cabrini-Green residents showed up at the West Side church to pay their respects. Rose\u2019s siblings talked about their mother\u2019s stubbornness, her determination to provide for them: \u201cWhat she didn\u2019t have, she made sure we had it,\u201d one said. Reggie said he didn\u2019t care that he had a terrible singing voice, and he started in on an R. Kelly song: \u201cDear Mama, you wouldn\u2019t believe what I\u2019m goin\u2019 through/But still I got my head up just like I promised you.\u201d Kenton, Ricks\u2019s fourth of nine sons, said they all learned from her example. \u201cBe strong, take care of the kids, take care of family,\u201d he repeated. She made them all better people. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just love.\u201d", "title": "The Towers Came Down, and With Them the Promise of Public Housing", "authors": ["Ben Austen"]}

It started a comedy podcast, \u201cMartinis & Murder,\u201d in which the two hosts get tipsy on homicide-themed cocktails, audibly squirm over the gory details, make catty judgments about the suspects\u2019 life choices and use particulars of the crimes as setups for sarcastic jokes.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of dialogue from a recent episode, in which the hosts Daryn Carp (the assistant to Bravo\u2019s Andy Cohen) and John Thrasher (a producer at Oxygen) discuss the Zodiac killer:\n\nMR.

{"date": "2018-02-24 00:00:00", "text": "The N.R.A.\u2019s impact comes, in large part, from the simplicity of the incentives it presents to political candidates: letter grades, based on their record on the Second Amendment, that guide the N.R.A.\u2019s involvement in elections. Lawmakers who earn an \u201cA\u201d rating can count on the group not to oppose them when they run for re-election or higher office.\n\nFor candidates who earn lower grades, the group deploys a range of blunt-force methods against them. The N.R.A. mails the voter guides to its five million members, displaying images of favored candidates on the front, and some state chapters bombard supporters with emails about coming elections.\n\nThe organization\u2019s calculation is that its money is better spent on maintaining a motivated base of gun rights supporters than on bankrolling candidates directly.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants a simplistic answer, which is they buy votes,\u201d said Harry L. Wilson, a political scientist at Roanoke College and the author of \u201cGuns, Gun Control, and Elections.\u201d \u201cBut it is largely incorrect. The N.R.A.\u2019s power is more complex than people think.\u201d\n\nCompared with the towering sums of money donated to House and Senate candidates in the last cycle \u2014 $1.7 billion \u2014 the N.R.A.\u2019s direct contributions were almost a rounding error.\n\nThe N.R.A. directly donated a total of just $1.1 million to candidates for federal office in 2016, with 99 percent of that money going to Republicans, while giving a total of only $309,000 in direct contributions to state legislative candidates in 2016 and 2017, according to tallies by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks state-level donations.\n\nPhoto\n\nThose amounts are dwarfed by the largess of other major contributors. Comcast, through its political action committee and its employees, directly donated $12.7 million in the 2016 campaign cycle to federal candidates or political parties, and the committee for Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, and its employees directly donated nearly $3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics tallies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose numbers are tied to campaign finance reports filed by individual lawmakers. The N.R.A.\u2019s spending on messages like its voter guides does not need to be disclosed, because it falls into the category of a membership-based group communicating with its members.\n\nWhen candidates waver in their support for sweeping gun rights, the group does not hesitate to turn on them. After Ted Strickland, a Democrat who earned the N.R.A.\u2019s endorsement as a candidate for governor of Ohio, backed a ban on assault weapons, the organization spent more than $1.5 million in so-called independent expenditures, like TV ads, to defeat him in a 2016 bid for the Senate.\n\nMs. Mitchell, a Republican election lawyer who sat on the group\u2019s board for nearly a decade, said its record of loyalty to those who stand by it was a cornerstone of its influence. \u201cThey know that it\u2019s not easy, sometimes, to stick with the N.R.A.,\u201d she said of the group\u2019s leadership. \u201cAt times like this, it\u2019s very easy to get stampeded by the media and the left.\u201d\n\nWhile the N.R.A. cuts relatively few checks to individual lawmakers \u2014 a fact that has been noted by The Tampa Bay Times, among others \u2014 it does devote tens of millions of dollars to ads backing its preferred candidates or criticizing its opponents, often with vividly alarmist messages about crime and self-defense.\n\nThe N.R.A., through its various legal entities, raises money for its political and lobbying efforts and other activities from two primary sources: member dues and contributions from outside supporters, including gun makers like Smith & Wesson and political groups like Freedom Partners, the Koch family-backed organization.\n\nThe group has fought to keep the identity of many of its biggest contributors secret, although an audit document filed with the State of North Carolina showed that its total budget was about $420 million in 2016.\n\nThe N.R.A. spent $20 million in that year\u2019s election cycle on ads and other campaign tactics intended to persuade voters to reject Hillary Clinton and an additional $11 million to support Donald J. Trump \u2014 money that is not marked down as a direct contribution to Mr. Trump, because the N.R.A. spent the cash on its own.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The N.R.A.\u2019s presence can draw in an increasingly well-funded collection of groups that support gun control, and can sometimes unnerve moderate voters.\n\nPhoto\n\nLast fall in Virginia, where the N.R.A. is headquartered and once held commanding clout over the state government, Democrats swept all of the state\u2019s major offices after campaigning loudly against the organization. The state\u2019s attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat whom the N.R.A. had targeted for defeat, said the group had insisted on defending a platform that was \u201cbecoming more and more untenable\u201d with voters in the political middle.\n\n\u201cThere were parts of the state where they wouldn\u2019t run their ads because they knew it would drive voters to supporting me,\u201d Mr. Herring said, adding of the N.R.A.\u2019s campaign spending: \u201cIt did elevate the conversation, the issue, but it was also one that I wanted to talk about.\u201d\n\nStill, in more rural areas where voters fiercely support gun rights, Democrats have routinely paid a price in recent years for crossing the N.R.A.\n\nIn Colorado, where a Democratic-held state government passed new gun regulations after the 2012 massacre at a movie theater in Aurora, the N.R.A. helped bankroll successful recall campaigns against two Democratic lawmakers, including the powerful president of the State Senate.\n\nThe former Senate leader, John P. Morse, who lost his seat in 2013 by a margin of 319 votes, said the N.R.A. had played a decisive role in motivating Second Amendment voters in a low-turnout race. After that, Mr. Morse said, Democrats have \u201crun like scalded rats from the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey turn out people that already agree with them,\u201d Mr. Morse said of the N.R.A. \u201cThe reason why gun policy is where it is in this country, at this point, is that the rest of us are too lackadaisical.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe organization has focused heavily in recent years on high-profile Senate elections in conservative-leaning states that are key to the balance of power in Congress, amassing an imposing record of victories, including that of Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\nBut it has had major losses, too, including in the Senate special election in Alabama late last year, in which it spent money to try to defeat Doug Jones, a Democrat who challenged Roy S. Moore.\n\nOver all, the success rate of the N.R.A. ebbs and flows with political trends. With Mr. Trump on the ballot, candidates it supported directly at the federal level in 2016 won 73 percent of the time, while its preferred candidates won only 44 percent of the time in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president.\n\nIn almost all forms of spending \u2014 direct campaign contributions, independent expenditures and lobbying \u2014 gun rights groups have far outspent gun control groups in recent decades, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. However, spending that advocates gun control has picked up in recent years, fueled by groups backed by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, an Arizona Democrat who was wounded in a 2011 shooting, and by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York.\n\nThere have been hints in recent days, with the protests after the Parkland shooting and a string of businesses cutting ties with the N.R.A. \u2014 as well as a fiery and defensive speech delivered by its leader at a conservative conference \u2014 that the group is losing ground. Even some of its key political supporters, like Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, and top lawmakers in the state, have proposed measures like raising the age limit for gun purchases to 21.\n\nJohn Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by Mr. Bloomberg, said he saw signs that the N.R.A.\u2019s influence was in decline, despite a surge in 2017 in federal lobbying spending by the organization. He pointed to its inability last year to get legislation through the Republican Congress that would give legal gun owners the right to carry concealed weapons outside their home states.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing right now is a reversal of fortune,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said. \u201cThe truth is, they are making bad bets.

It doesn\u2019t seem quite true, as some news organizations reported, that Cohen precisely denied that he had been reimbursed. Cohen\u2019s statement was artful. He denied that he had been reimbursed by either the Trump Organization or the Trump presidential campaign, but not that he had been reimbursed by someone else \u2014 say, by Trump himself. (The White House did not respond to my inquiry about whether Trump had personally paid the $130,000.)\n\nSometimes politicians, liberals and conservatives alike, are unprincipled in pursuit of principles they are passionate about. But Trump aides don\u2019t seem to believe in any cause larger than themselves or their leader.\n\nThat\u2019s alarming because of the risks that even worse might lie ahead. When self-absorbed people are caught in a growing scandal, they overreach. In this case, that might mean the firing of Robert Mueller or Rod Rosenstein, or some military clash that changes the subject. To be clear, I don\u2019t think officials would deliberately turn to war as a solution to political problems, but we all have a remarkable ability to persuade ourselves that what is good for us is also good for the country.\n\nEvery administration suffers embarrassments. But when there is a basic lack of integrity at the top, these do not easily self-correct; rather, they build upon themselves because of an impulse to cover up and layer new deceptions on top of old deceit.

Congress finally appears to have found one, largely without Mr. Trump\u2019s help. Here\u2019s a look at how lawmakers got there.\n\nMarch 16\n\nBarely two months into his term, Mr. Trump proposed an initial budget outline \u2014 known as a \u201cskinny budget\u201d \u2014 that called for big military spending increases and deep cuts to a broad part of the federal bureaucracy, making good on his campaign promise to reorder the priorities in the nation\u2019s capital and dismantle what his administration calls \u201cthe administrative state.\u201d It was largely dismissed by members of both parties.\n\nMay 23\n\nWhen the president\u2019s full budget was released in May, it largely followed his earlier outline: a 10 percent increase in spending for the military but deep cuts in programs for the poor, health care and government agencies.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "You might date the beginning of this period to the advent of the Sony Walkman in 1979. With the Walkman we can see a subtle but fundamental shift in the ideology of convenience. If the first convenience revolution promised to make life and work easier for you, the second promised to make it easier to be you. The new technologies were catalysts of selfhood. They conferred efficiency on self-expression.\n\nConsider the man of the early 1980s, strolling down the street with his Walkman and earphones. He is enclosed in an acoustic environment of his choosing. He is enjoying, out in public, the kind of self-expression he once could experience only in his private den. A new technology is making it easier for him to show who he is, if only to himself. He struts around the world, the star of his own movie.\n\nSo alluring is this vision that it has come to dominate our existence. Most of the powerful and important technologies created over the past few decades deliver convenience in the service of personalization and individuality. Think of the VCR, the playlist, the Facebook page, the Instagram account. This kind of convenience is no longer about saving physical labor \u2014 many of us don\u2019t do much of that anyway. It is about minimizing the mental resources, the mental exertion, required to choose among the options that express ourselves. Convenience is one-click, one-stop shopping, the seamless experience of \u201cplug and play.\u201d The ideal is personal preference with no effort.\n\nWe are willing to pay a premium for convenience, of course \u2014 more than we often realize we are willing to pay. During the late 1990s, for example, technologies of music distribution like Napster made it possible to get music online at no cost, and lots of people availed themselves of the option. But though it remains easy to get music free, no one really does it anymore. Why? Because the introduction of the iTunes store in 2003 made buying music even more convenient than illegally downloading it. Convenient beat out free.\n\nAs task after task becomes easier, the growing expectation of convenience exerts a pressure on everything else to be easy or get left behind. We are spoiled by immediacy and become annoyed by tasks that remain at the old level of effort and time. When you can skip the line and buy concert tickets on your phone, waiting in line to vote in an election is irritating. This is especially true for those who have never had to wait in lines (which may help explain the low rate at which young people vote).\n\nThe paradoxical truth I\u2019m driving at is that today\u2019s technologies of individualization are technologies of mass individualization. Customization can be surprisingly homogenizing. Everyone, or nearly everyone, is on Facebook: It is the most convenient way to keep track of your friends and family, who in theory should represent what is unique about you and your life. Yet Facebook seems to make us all the same. Its format and conventions strip us of all but the most superficial expressions of individuality, such as which particular photo of a beach or mountain range we select as our background image.\n\nI do not want to deny that making things easier can serve us in important ways, giving us many choices (of restaurants, taxi services, open-source encyclopedias) where we used to have only a few or none. But being a person is only partly about having and exercising choices. It is also about how we face up to situations that are thrust upon us, about overcoming worthy challenges and finishing difficult tasks \u2014 the struggles that help make us who we are. What happens to human experience when so many obstacles and impediments and requirements and preparations have been removed?", "title": "Opinion | The Tyranny of Convenience", "authors": []}

He calls himself an Enlightenment man, but he\u2019s really a scientific rationalist. He puts tremendous emphasis on the value of individual reason. The key to progress is information \u2014 making ourselves better informed. The key sin in the world is a result either of entropy, the randomness that is built into any system, or faith \u2014 dogma clouding reason.\n\nThe big problem with his rationalistic worldview is that while he charts the way individuals have benefited over the centuries, he spends barely any time on the quality of the relationships between individuals.\n\nThat is to say, Pinker doesn\u2019t spend much time on the decline of social trust, the breakdown of family life, the polarization of national life, the spread of tribal mentalities, the rise of narcissism, the decline of social capital, the rising alienation from institutions or the decline of citizenship and neighborliness. It\u2019s simply impossible to tell any good-news story when looking at the data from these moral, social and emotional spheres.\n\nPinker is a paragon of exactly the kind of intellectual honesty and courage we need to restore conversation and community, and the students are right to revere him.\n\nBut today\u2019s situation reminds us of the weakness of the sort of Cartesian rationalism Pinker champions and represents. Conscious reason can get you only so far when tribal emotions have been aroused, when existential fears rain down, when narcissistic impulses have been given free rein, when spiritual longings have nowhere healthy to go, when social trust has been devastated, when all the unconscious networks that make up 99 percent of our thinking are aflame and disordered.\n\nOur problems are relational.

But our nation is emotionally sick.\n\nPinker\u2019s rationalism is not the total cure. But I have to confess, I really like him. A few years ago the magazine Moment gave genetic tests to a bunch of writers with Jewish heritage. The tests reveal that Pinker and I are third cousins.

Pintxos are Basque tapas, and the custom is to order a couple of small plates and a glass of wine or beer from one bar and then mosey on to the next. Try as we might, we couldn\u2019t escape a single bar without ordering 10-plus plates and a bottle of wine.\n\nThis, I thought, is what it means to feel American. Pintxo barhopping requires a degree of self-restraint antithetical to Yankees, even for us, a downsized ex-pat family. Though my husband and I share a cellphone and a used minivan that fits all of our belongings, we still carry a supersized hunger for more with us wherever we go. At its worst, this translates into consumerism and fills oceans with plastic detritus. At its best, it\u2019s a noble ambition that lands astronauts on the moon. So, while I want my daughter to buy fresh only what will fit in a basket at the farmers\u2019 market, I also want her to dream big like the pioneers and luminaries our country holds dear.\n\nTo add some valuable United States currency to the multicultural memory account, I\u2019ve taken to curating memories for my daughter on our annual visits home. Last Fourth of July, we watched a spectacular display of pyrotechnics above Lake Washington. A few weeks later we saw the Blue Angels tear up the sky with precision and grace. Two years ago, we celebrated Christmas with a seven-foot blinking pine tree and a cascade of presents spilling across my sister\u2019s living room floor like a Macy\u2019s-wrapped snowdrift. This year, heaven help me, I\u2019m planning a three-day trip to Disneyland with a rotating entourage of family members.\n\nTo quote Jacques Derrida, \u201cwe are all mediators, translators,\u201d constantly interpreting the implicit. So, what message might my daughter tease out of these encoded thumbprints? Will stunts performed by the Blue Angels impart our military\u2019s commitment to excellence or a might-makes-right ethos? Will Christmas in the States inspire a generosity of spirit or just a frenzied \u2014 and sometimes fatal \u2014 consumerism? And will Disneyland foment wonder and imagination or just exorbitant spending on a hot summer\u2019s day? Most likely, all of the above.

I could be raising an American replicant, like the android \u201cRachael\u201d manufactured by the Tyrell Corporation in the 1982 movie \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d While Rachael can produce photos and recall memories of her childhood, she is largely impervious to the nostalgia they\u2019re supposed to evoke. Tyrell had implanted the memories, which originally belonged to his niece, in Rachael\u2019s mind to convince Rachael of her humanity. At first the implants succeeded, but in the end their falsehood fails her, and she is challenged to find her own identity and meaning in life, knowing she\u2019s a replicant.\n\nAs a mother, I worry about this outcome. Will my daughter reflect back on her all but implanted American memories with the same cool detachment? Sometimes I imagine her as an adult looking at a picture of herself at age 5, flanked by Mickey Mouse and her cousins, trying in vain to emotionally connect to a family heritage that dates back to the Mayflower but doesn\u2019t feel like her own. Our sense of belonging \u2014 whether to a family or a country \u2014 is greatly based in shared memories of collective experience; hence our commitment to extended visits in the United States and weekly Skype calls with relatives. But what if our efforts aren\u2019t enough?\n\nWill my daughter grow to feel like an alien in a family full of foreigners, adrift in the world with no place like home? Or will her unconventional position outside the wider context of culture, this alterity, connect her to an even broader community?\n\nIn a 2013 TED Talk, \u201cWhere Is Home?,\u201d the writer Pico Iyer, a British national of Indian heritage who hangs his hat in the United States, refers to the 220 million people like himself (and my family) living \u201coutside the old nation-state categories\u201d as \u201ca great floating tribe\u201d representing \u201cthe fifth-largest nation on earth.\u201d \u201cSoon,\u201d he says, \u201cthere will be more of us than there are Americans.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI prefer to picture my daughter as a member of this growing mosaic, defining her unique self between the interstices of culture while finding our shared humanity in the overlap.\n\nSo, for now, with my basket in one hand and my daughter\u2019s little palm in the other, we\u2019ll continue to walk the world in search of people, spaces and moments that move our soul and gather them into a living piece of art, a bricolage of memories called home.\n\nThis, I think, is what it feels like to be a citizen of the world.", "title": "The Wager of Raising a Child Abroad", "authors": ["Stevie Trujillo"]}

And we followed several different families in different stages of homelessness because focusing on one family could have lead to a yearslong project. The average stay for families is 414 days, and we met people who had been in shelter for as many as four continuous years and off-and-on for eight years.\n\nFor this story, it was not just about asking questions: It was about observing people as they waded through bureaucracy and they lost their autonomy living in shelter.\n\nPeople applying for shelter, for instance, must have identification and birth certificates for every person in their family and proof of their housing history, like leases and utility bills, for the past two years.

WeWork has rapidly expanded to 20 countries, assembled a formidable executive team and attracted some 200,000 members. Big companies like JPMorgan Chase and Siemens are signing on as tenants, and revenues are growing fast, expected to top $2.3 billion this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWeWork last year bought the iconic Lord & Taylor building on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which is being transformed into the company\u2019s new headquarters. That deal was made possible in part by a recent $4.4 billion investment from SoftBank, the Japanese technology group led by the enigmatic billionaire Masayoshi Son.\n\nAlready the company has started WeLive, its residential offering, and Rise, its gym. It acquired Meetup, the social network that facilitates in-person gatherings, and the Flatiron School, a coding academy. Still to come: WeGrow, the company\u2019s for-profit elementary school, set to open in September. WeWork has even invested in plans to create giant wave pools for inland surfing.\n\nA company ostensibly about co-working now employs yoga instructors, architects, teachers, environmental scientists, software engineers, molecular biologists and social psychologists.\n\nIs it all a bit much for a young company still trying to build out its core business? \u201cI\u2019ve made that argument,\u201d said Bruce Dunlevie, a WeWork board member and partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark. But, he said, \u201cgreat entrepreneurs like Adam don\u2019t listen to guys like me.\u201d\n\nAs WeWork expands in all directions, it faces persistent questions about its rich valuation and the durability of its business model. Critics argue that the company does little more than corporate real estate arbitrage \u2014 leasing a space, spiffing it up, then subleasing it out to other tenants. The company owns hardly any properties, giving it precious few hard assets. Its growth projections strike many as unattainable, and it has missed expectations before. A number of upstarts loom as potential competitors, seeking to replicate WeWork\u2019s success. And many WeWork tenants are unproven start-ups that could quickly fold.\n\nIWG, a publicly traded co-working company that has more members and more real estate than WeWork, is valued at just $2 billion. Yet Mr. Neumann has convinced investors that WeWork is worth 10 times that figure.\n\n\u201cAdam\u2019s explanation for the valuation of WeWork speaks for itself,\u201d said Chris Kelly, co-founder and president of Convene, a company that offers flexible event spaces and is backed by major real estate firms. \u201cThis is not an Excel spreadsheet calculation. He believes there\u2019s an energy behind the brand, and he\u2019s gotten people to invest at that valuation. He has not tried to explain it in traditional financial terms.\u201d\n\nIndeed, to assess WeWork by conventional metrics is to miss the point, according to Mr. Neumann. WeWork isn\u2019t really a real estate company. It\u2019s a state of consciousness, he argues, a generation of interconnected emotionally intelligent entrepreneurs. And Mr. Neumann, with his combination of inspiration and chutzpah, wants to transform not just the way we work and live, but the very world we live in.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s an audacious, perhaps delusional plan for a company that made its mark by building communal desks and providing refreshments. And so far, it seems to be working.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Son, WeWork\u2019s largest investor, is betting that the company will grow exponentially in the years to come, making his multibillion-dollar investment a veritable bargain.\n\n\u201cMake it 10 times bigger than your original plan,\u201d Mr. Son told Forbes late last year. \u201cIf you think in that manner, the valuation is cheap.

From the countinghouses of industrial England to the skyscrapers of 1980s Manhattan, offices were mostly uninspiring places designed to maximize space, often with row upon row of unglamorous desks.\n\n\u201cThe only kind of model that anyone had for laying out a large workplace was a factory,\u201d said Nikil Saval, author of \u201cCubed: A Secret History of the Workplace.\u201d \u201cSo the office was made to resemble an assembly line.\u201d\n\nThis dreary state of affairs began to change in earnest, at least for some, during the dot-com bubble. Tech companies built playful offices with beanbags and Ping-Pong tables, making work spaces less formal. Free food became commonplace.\n\nRaised expectations for amenities and interior design gradually seeped into the mainstream, and today, more and more employees \u2014 especially millennials \u2014 expect enlightened, unconventional offices.\n\nEnter WeWork. With people bouncing between employers, jobs concentrated in cities and technology making it easier to work remotely, the demand for co-working was suddenly real, and ready to be monetized. Mr. Neumann, who grew up on a kibbutz in Israel, had an epiphany: Bring the communal vibe to the office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSoon he and a friend \u2014 Mr. McKelvey, an equally tall Oregonian who grew up on a collective and was working as an architect \u2014 founded an eco-friendly co-working space in Brooklyn. They sold it, but they quickly turned around and started WeWork in 2010.\n\n\u201cMe and Miguel have this common ground,\u201d Mr. Neumann said. \u201cWe both grew up in very close communities.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWeWork didn\u2019t invent co-working spaces, of course. IWG, better known as Regus, has been around for decades. But Mr. Neumann and Mr. McKelvey quickly hit upon a recipe that drew throngs of start-ups: an industrial chic aesthetic, some big common areas with comfy couches, free beer and piped-in pop music.\n\nIndividuals pay as little as $45 a month for occasional access to a desk in a common area. Start-ups can pay a few thousand dollars for a private room on a month-to-month basis, and some big companies pay millions of dollars a year for spaces that hold thousands of employees over multiple locations.\n\nIt\u2019s a formula that has caught on from New York to Tel Aviv to Shanghai. In New York alone, WeWork has 49 spaces, most of them nearly full. At the WeWork in Harlem, dance companies share space with hair care start-ups in a common area adorned with murals of jazz musicians. At a WeWork in TriBeCa, fashion designers and alcohol distributors work shoulder to shoulder in a spartan space decorated with neon lighting.\n\nFor WeWork to really succeed in changing the way we all work, it is going to have to win over big corporations seeking space for thousands of employees. The strategy is an odd reversal for WeWork, which made its name catering to freelancers and start-ups.\n\nThe Weather Channel recently moved its ad sales team into an enormous WeWork in Midtown Manhattan. Barbara Bekkedahl, who runs the group, said the transition was easy and the space comfortable and stylish.\n\nBut Ms. Bekkedahl had a complaint, too, one that highlights one of the downsides of communal work space. She suggested that the hygienic and sartorial habits of some of her new office mates were lacking.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs a TV sales team, we groom and dress for outside sales,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the techie and start-up types housed at WeWork aren\u2019t facing customers all day, so don\u2019t always have the same standards.\u201d\n\nGripes about grooming are unlikely to slow down WeWork\u2019s business with corporate clients, especially if Mr. Neumann makes good on his promise to save them money. Because WeWork is building out so much space and buying so much furniture, Mr. Neumann says, he can renovate and operate an office for a fraction of the cost that companies would normally spend.\n\n\u201cWe have economies of scale,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll cut your operational costs between 20 to 50 percent.\u201d\n\nIt might seem like another instance of Mr. Neumann\u2019s talking a big game but for the fact that more and more companies \u2014 GE, HSBC, Salesforce and Microsoft among them \u2014 are signing on.\n\nFor years now, big companies have outsourced payroll processing, janitorial services and security. It\u2019s not a stretch to imagine more of them outsourcing the design and maintenance of their offices to a company like WeWork.\n\n\u201cWe only have 200,000 members,\u201d Mr. McKelvey, 43, said. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. We need to have two million and then 20 million.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "Critics say the conflicting accounts stem from the top, from a president who has made so many false statements or given so many contradictory versions of the truth in so many instances that even his own advisers cannot trust him. He originally said that he pushed out Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence. But after Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I., the president said that the deception with investigators also prompted the dismissal.\n\nMr. Trump likewise justified his firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, on the handling of the Hillary Clinton email case at first, only to then tell NBC News that he was really thinking about the investigation into his campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia. During the campaign, he acknowledged that the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that recorded him making crude remarks about women was authentic but last year told associates that he thinks it was fake.\n\nThe Porter case is not the only example in recent days of Mr. Trump\u2019s team struggling to fully clarify controversial actions. The president\u2019s associates have been slow to offer an explanation of a $130,000 payment made shortly before the 2016 election to a pornographic movie star who once claimed to have had a fling with Mr. Trump.\n\nIt took a full month after The Wall Street Journal reported that a private lawyer for Mr. Trump arranged the payment for the lawyer to tell The New York Times that the money came from his own pocket, not the president\u2019s. Even then, he did not explain whether the president knew about the payment.\n\nThis is not the first White House where that has happened, of course, but lessons from past experience suggest why it can be corrosive. Frustrated that he was not being fully informed during the early days of the scandal resulting from President Bill Clinton\u2019s sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, Michael McCurry, then the White House press secretary, famously referred to his strategy as \u201ctelling the truth slowly.\u201d\n\nIndeed, much like Mr. McCurry, current White House officials are frustrated that they have not gotten a full accounting of the episode involving Mr. Porter either, with many of them angry at John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel. In individual conversations with reporters, some White House officials warn that the information they have just provided may not be true and that they themselves do not know.\n\nStill, some Republicans said the shifting stories were not the main reason it has been hard for the White House to move on. Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said a bigger factor was that the president\u2019s team accepted Mr. Porter\u2019s denials until photographs were published showing one of his ex-wives with a black eye.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd then, Mr. Fleischer noted, the president\u2019s only public comments at first seemed sympathetic to Mr. Porter and included no concern for the accusers or an acknowledgment of the seriousness of domestic abuse. Only on Wednesday, a week after the story broke, did Mr. Trump personally condemn violence against women, and then sounded aggrieved that anyone would make an issue of the fact that he had not said anything about it until then.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

If they had done everything else perfectly since then, it still would have been a similar controversy.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, has pressed for months for a look at the process for White House security clearances. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the committee chairman, said on Wednesday that the panel would investigate the White House handling of Mr. Porter\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThis is an administration that has consistently not been truthful with the American people and so when you start going down that road where your leader goes, that is President Trump, then you are constantly trying to get your story straight,\u201d said Mr. Cummings. \u201cEvery time they go down one road, either a story comes out in the newspapers or something happens that causes them to say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got to change course.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe White House has suggested that it did not know much about the allegations against Mr. Porter, which came up during an F.B.I. investigation for a security clearance, and that the investigation had not been completed. But Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has made clear that the bureau had given information to the White House about Mr. Porter three times in 2017 and had finished its work.\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to Mr. Wray, Mr. Gowdy noted that the F.B.I. director\u2019s account of the security clearance investigation into Mr. Porter \u201cmay contradict a statement\u201d by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.\n\nMs. Sanders was left this week to offer the equivocal statements from the White House lectern about giving the best information she had even if she was not 100 percent certain it was correct.\n\n\u201cLook, as I said, we do the very best job we can every single day,\u201d she said at one point on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re giving you the best information that we\u2019re going to have. Obviously, the press team is not going to be as read-in, maybe, as some other elements at a given moment on a variety of topics.\n\n\u201cBut we relay the best and most accurate information that we have,\u201d she said, which comes \u201cfrom those individuals.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs the questions persisted, Ms. Sanders\u2019s daily briefing on Wednesday was postponed and then postponed again, before finally being canceled, citing the horrific school shooting in Florida. No briefing was held Thursday either, nor as of Thursday night had one been scheduled for Friday.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly impossible to figure out what on earth is going on inside of this White House right now,\u201d said Jen Psaki, who was White House communications director under President Barack Obama. Normally, she said, White House officials would gather in the same room to put together a definitive timetable of what happened \u201cto avoid the conflicting drip, drip, drip that the Trump team has found themselves in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t that happened?\u201d Ms. Psaki asked. \u201cIt is hard to know.

Once that process is complete and has resulted in higher productivity, there\u2019s no reason to think that capital investment would keep rising as a share of the economy.\n\nIn other words, the benefits in terms of productivity growth and economic growth should fade over time, which the administration acknowledges.\n\n\u201cThe new tax law would be a one-time shift, spread out over several years, after which there would be a new steady state growth path for labor productivity,\u201d DJ Nordquist, chief of staff at the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an email. \u201cNevertheless, in that new steady state, faster growth than we have seen in recent years can still be expected because of the elimination of excessive regulations, to which this administration is committed and because of our infrastructure plan. This deregulation will have enduring benefits to the rate of growth.\u201d\n\nSome private economists are not persuaded these effects are powerful enough to account for continued strong growth a decade from now. \u201cI try to fit these numbers into a mainstream paradigm and I can\u2019t make them fit,\u201d Mr. Prakken said.\n\nWhat about other sources of growth?\n\nBut even if higher capital investment can\u2019t do all the lifting of generating 3 percent growth, there remain those other two possibilities, of hours worked or total factor productivity, that could help achieve the 3 percent growth forecast even after the lift from tax cuts and capital investment fades.\n\nBut demographic trends are putting a lid on potential growth from more hours of work. The retirement of the baby boomers and stabilization of the proportion of women in the work force mean that potential hours worked will rise only 0.4 percent a year in the coming decade, according to the C.B.O.\u2019s forecast (compared with 1.3 percent a year from 1950 to 2016).\n\nMoreover, the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, if anything, would tilt that number in a negative direction, as deportations, tighter border security and more restrictive issuance of work visas reduces the potential supply of labor.", "title": "The White House Is Very Optimistic on Growth.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "If narratives about white supremacy have been shaped by the overwhelmingly masculine lens through which we examine practically all political movements, there are also aspects of white supremacy that make it different. One critical factor here is the central role ascribed to white male sexual and status anxiety and lust for dominance in fomenting organized white-supremacist activities. As part of arguments against desegregation, many who belonged to these movements embraced a narrative that saw white women and girls as vulnerable (to black men), and white men as protectors \u2014 a story line that simultaneously elevated white men and rendered women helpmates and beneficiaries, not activists.\n\nBut this broader narrative obscures and even gives cover to the ways white women sometimes used white supremacy for their own gain. The suffragist Carrie Chapman Catt in the early 20th century argued for women\u2019s voting rights in Southern states on the basis that \u201cwhite supremacy will be strengthened, not weakened, by white women\u2019s suffrage.\u201d In the 1920s, the journalist Nell Battle Lewis of North Carolina never questioned the absolute need for racial segregation even as she criticized the violence committed in the name of Jim Crow. Staying in the racial fold, she was afforded the opportunity to blast her state\u2019s regressive labor and gender politics. Being a white supremacist, even a liberal one, meant that she remained part of the conversation.\n\nThe point, here, is neither to catalog nor to celebrate white women\u2019s contributions to white supremacist politics. Instead, their work should change how we understand history. It is easy to denounce the racist pronouncements and white-supremacist politics of a George Wallace or a Roy Moore. But what white women teach us is that white-supremacist politics is sustained at a much more grass-roots level by our neighbors, school boards and even friends. White women have made white supremacy a much more formidable and long-lasting force in American society, sustaining it at both the local and national levels.\n\nToday, it seems, the story America prefers to tell itself about white supremacy has changed little since the middle of the century: Instead of Klan lynchings, we focus on the rally in Charlottesville; instead of George Wallace, we focus on Jeff Sessions or, for that matter, Donald Trump. Outrage over the violence and rhetoric of these men buries an equally important and certainly more intransigent story of longstanding grass-roots and national campaigns populated partly by white women who aim to maintain racial and economic inequities on the American landscape. If we begin to consider their staying power with seriousness rather than surprise \u2014 a surprise not shared by black women \u2014 perhaps we can more effectively prepare to counter this strand of American politics.", "title": "Opinion | The Women Behind White Power", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "In interviews with more than 60 women in male-dominated trades like construction, Amy Denissen, an associate professor of sociology at California State University at Northridge and Abigail Saguy, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles, found countless similar examples. While lesbians are also harassed, \u201cin some ways women who are lesbian are seen as less threatening,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cThey\u2019re seen as not fully women.\u201d\n\nWomen who try to go along with the sexual banter, or who act feminine, are seen as either coming on to men or less competent in a workplace culture where proficiency is defined in masculine terms. \u201cSexual harassment is often a way in which the men reaffirm women\u2019s femininity, say this is who you are, back in your place,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cAt the same time, women will play up their femininity and flirt a little bit, and play along with some of the stereotypes of femininity to be accepted.\u201d\n\nWomen as well as men can wield the weapon of sexuality in the workplace \u2014 as I saw in months of interviews about sexual harassment at two Ford plants in Chicago. In that case, in addition to persistent abuse by men, several women were also accused of trading sex for better, less physically demanding jobs. Whether women were coerced into sex or gaming a system, one constant has been that in most cases, men are supervisors and have the power to dispense threats or favors.\n\nPower has been entwined with the evolution of male manufacturing jobs since the industrial revolution, said Alice Kessler-Harris, a professor emerita of history at Columbia University. Although many of the earliest factory jobs in places like textile mills were held by women who could be spared from the farm, men reserved many of the highest-status, highest-paying jobs. \u201cIt isn\u2019t new,\u201d Professor Kessler-Harris said of sexual harassment and male resentment. \u201cIt\u2019s as old as male culture. The men assumed the best jobs, the skilled jobs, were theirs.

Nurses, often men in the early days of the profession, were redefined as nurturers when women swelled their ranks; secretaries, once exclusively men, yielded to the dexterous fingers of women who typed and were recast as \u201cthe sunshine of the office,\u201d Professor Kessler-Harris said.\n\nThese jobs often paid less, while the ones requiring physical strength paid more. When women were needed during World War II, cutting sheet metal was likened to cutting a pattern through cloth, and welding to opening an orange juice can, she said. Then after the war, men reclaimed these jobs and most women were exiled back to the kitchen.\n\nAfter 1964, as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was gradually used to pry open industries once largely closed to women like construction, mining and shipbuilding, some men\u2019s rage swelled, Professor Kessler-Harris said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can understand this notion of sexual harassment and men\u2019s anger with women, their willingness to take out on them all this sexual hostility, unless you imagine that sense of entitlement in the job,\u201d she said.\n\nProfessor Saguy said that employers played on this sense that manliness was intertwined with such jobs. \u201cEven if they have to tolerate bad working conditions, the compensation is they were real men,\u201d she said. \u201cThen women were moving into these occupations, so what does that mean? If women can do the job, maybe it\u2019s not so masculine after all.\u201d\n\nAlready, some fear a backlash to the intense focus on sexual harassment. And there are worries that many of the prescribed remedies, from training to promoting women to stiffening penalties, could fall short, generate more resentment or perpetuate stereotypes that women are always victims. Lawsuits abound but seldom force upheavals in entire systems, Professor Williams said.\n\nMany scholars I interviewed argued that fundamental changes are necessary, such as restructuring organizations to be less hierarchical and re-examining pay scales for men\u2019s and women\u2019s work. \u201cI would like to think there will be permanent changes that come out of this,\u201d Professor Saguy said. \u201cI don\u2019t see them yet.\u201d\n\nBut some who have observed or trained once-recalcitrant men cite small successes in changing perceptions about the nature of \u201cmale\u201d jobs. Ellen Bravo, a director of Family Values at Work, found that male firefighters in Kansas City, Mo., had adapted to changes they once dismissed as unmanly, such as wearing masks to protect against lung cancer or talking about grief after witnessing death and suffering.\n\nJessica Smith, an associate professor at the Colorado School of Mines, studied the successful experience of women in a Wyoming mine in the 2000s during a time of hiring expansion, when women were not perceived as taking jobs from men. \u201cThey redefined what it was to be a good miner away from this very hyperbolic masculine image,\u201d she said. \u201cA good miner was someone who cared for their co-workers. They were responsible. These were issues that women could also embody.\u201d\n\nNow that leaders of some organizations are toppling, Professor Kessler-Harris surveyed this moment with a historian\u2019s eye. \u201cAfter 50 years when women swallowed hard and put up with it, or quit, finally women are saying this is not acceptable anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is an attack on male power and the possibility at least of change.\u201d", "title": "The \u2018Manly\u2019 Jobs Problem", "authors": ["Susan Chira"]}
{"date": "2018-02-22 00:00:00", "text": "The style that Manager Pep Guardiola has instilled in City, the movement he has drummed into his players, the quality at his disposal, is too sophisticated, too complex, too high for Wicky\u2019s squad to mimic.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere are, as Wicky described it, \u201ctwo worlds.\u201d Manchester City in one, distant and untouchable, and Basel firmly in the other. The chasm between them is too large to bridge, even briefly, even in training, even in tribute.\n\nThe first installment of this season\u2019s Champions League knockout rounds bore out Wicky\u2019s assessment in stark fashion. Manchester City swatted Basel aside, beating the perennial Swiss champion, 4-0, and rendering the return leg, in Manchester in March, a formality.\n\nThat was not the biggest win of this set of fixtures, though. Liverpool beat F.C. Porto, 5-0, in Porto, and Bayern Munich recorded the same score line against visiting Besiktas, the Turkish champion.\n\nThere will, of course, be plenty of drama when the second legs are played next month: Barcelona\u2019s home meeting with Chelsea, Juventus\u2019s visit to Tottenham, even Real Madrid\u2019s trip to Paris Saint-Germain all remain mouthwatering prospects. In Liverpool, Manchester and Istanbul, though, there is next to nothing at stake. S\u00e9rgio Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, Porto\u2019s coach, has already conceded that all his team can do at Anfield is defend its \u201chonor.\u201d\n\nTaken in isolation, the fact that three of eight ties were so lopsided is not especially remarkable. Even in what is theoretically the most exclusive environment soccer has to offer, not every meeting can be finely balanced: Porto was missing its most potent forward, Vincent Aboubakar; Basel is sputtering domestically; Besiktas played for 75 minutes down a man.\n\nBesides, the history of the Champions League \u2014 in its modern incarnation, ever since the European Cup was reimagined in 1992 \u2014 is one of imbalance. A rarefied elite has always held sway over the competition, even if its identity has shifted over the years, mapping the ebb and flow of primacy among Europe\u2019s great domestic leagues.\n\nPhoto\n\nItalian sides dominated in the 1990s, Spanish teams around the turn of the century, the English Premier League\u2019s Big Four from 2005, and then \u2014 starting with Barcelona\u2019s victory in 2009 \u2014 the age of the transcontinental superclubs began, with Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid streaking away from all challengers. The tournament is the most ruthless sort of meritocracy. It does not indulge those who cannot keep pace.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRead as part of a pattern, though, the fates of Porto, Besiktas and Basel point to something more significant. This season, 306 goals were scored in the competition\u2019s group stages, beating the previous record of 292, set way back in 2001. That in itself could be a quirk of circumstance: Though there have been more goals scored in the group stage in recent years, the level has remained relatively consistent, flitting between 277 and 284.\n\nBut the goals are ever more unevenly distributed. This season, for example, P.S.G. scored 25, thanks largely to beating Celtic by 7-1 and 5-0, and Anderlecht by 5-0 and 4-0. Liverpool scored 23, a tally that included back-to-back 7-0 wins against Maribor, of Slovenia, and Spartak Moscow, the Russian champion.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The previous best \u2014 in 2010 and 2013 \u2014 was 25.\n\nThe Champions League has always been a competition that brought two worlds together. In recent years, those worlds have grown further apart. What happened to Porto, Basel and Besiktas is a continuation of that trend: It is no longer just the group stages that can seem a procession. The last 16, to some extent, is also afflicted now. Little wonder that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the Manchester United manager, suggested this week that the competition itself only really catches fire in the quarterfinals. Everything before that is simply a tuneup.\n\nThe question that should prompt \u2014 for UEFA, the competition\u2019s organizer, and for the clubs that comprise it \u2014 is whether that is a good thing or not.\n\nAt first glance, there is little reason to worry. The Champions League is still soccer\u2019s gold standard. Viewer interest remains high. Prize money \u2014 directly related to the amount of income UEFA can derive from sponsorship and television rights \u2014 keeps growing. The Champions League has boomed as its pool of potential winners has grown smaller; its strength is in the heights it can reach, not the breadth of its base.\n\nBefore 1992, there was always a chance that a team from Romania or Yugoslavia might win the European Cup. Those leagues have long since been disenfranchised, condemned to the sidelines as western Europe\u2019s great powers fight it out among themselves, and the event has not suffered \u2014 quite the opposite, in fact.\n\nThe European Club Association, a body that represents the continent\u2019s most powerful teams, is convinced that fans want more meetings between the game\u2019s great clubs, not fewer. They have already suggested in negotiations with UEFA various measures to that end, ranging from wild cards for big clubs struggling to qualify on merit to reducing the competition to 24 teams, from 32.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUEFA dismissed that out of hand, but it has ceded ground, suggesting it understands which leagues are the engines of its banner competition. Beginning next year, England, Spain, Germany and Italy will each be guaranteed four entrants to the group stage.\n\nOne world is gradually squeezing the other out entirely, and nobody seems to mind.\n\nThe worry, though hypothetical, is one that should not be dismissed out of hand. Nobody \u2014 not the broadcasters, not the E.C.A., not UEFA \u2014 knows precisely where the tipping point is, when things become too stale. Nobody knows what happens when only a dozen or so teams from five leagues dominate a competition that is meant to represent the ultimate ambition for 53 nations and thousands of clubs.\n\nPerhaps there will be no cliff to fall off. Perhaps the Champions League will be at its best when all of its drama is packed into those last few games, when its first eight months are just a warm-up for the real business at the end. Or, perhaps, when one world is left behind entirely, unable to compete \u2014 even briefly, even in training, even in tribute \u2014 fans will start to switch off.\n\nThere are two worlds. Perhaps the task is to find ways to bring them closer together, not simply allow them to drift apart.", "title": "The \u2018Two Worlds\u2019 of the Champions League Keep Drifting Apart", "authors": ["Rory Smith", "On Soccer"]}

It was way past midnight but he texted back, saying he would be right over.\n\nShe waited on the steps outside her house. \u201cI had this image that he would ride up on his motorcycle and kiss me,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead he rode up on a rickety little bike he had borrowed. (He didn\u2019t want to wake anyone by riding his motorcycle.) \u201cThe trip over there was something special,\u201d he said. \u201cI was riding a small push bike on the streets of Granada at about 2 a.m. to talk to the girl I can\u2019t stop thinking about.

Mr. Kelland followed her and secretly moved into her dorm room. He prepared dinner every night, often a pot of curry and a box of wine. \u201cIt was a small space, but we were happy,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe eventually returned home, working as a chemical engineer, this time at CSL Limited, a biotechnology company in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cThe lack of his presence was a physical sensation,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. \u201cI literally felt like someone was sitting on my chest.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo stay more closely connected, they instituted rituals such as drinking a bottle of champagne together \u2014 via Skype \u2014 on the 23rd of every month, to celebrate the fact that they officially started dating on Oct. 23, 2014. Because of the time difference, Mr. Kelland often imbibed before dawn. \u201cThere were plenty of 23rds where Tom Skyped me from bed with a bottle of champagne and got dutifully drunk with me first thing in the morning in the name of love,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nIn July 2016, a month after earning a master\u2019s degree in elementary education, she moved to Melbourne and is now an elementary schoolteacher there.

Studying improv at U.C.B. and acting at the Atlantic Acting School, he was struck by the overlap. \u201cIt\u2019s all about reacting honestly in the moment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe didn\u2019t know if the first \u201cGravid Water\u201d would work, but he put together an evening featuring the writings of Woody Allen, Thornton Wilder and Theresa Rebeck, hoping \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be quite the train wreck you\u2019d think it would be,\u201d he said.\n\nThirteen years in, the January show was a flighty grab bag, with one scene that thrilled, a couple that tickled, two others that floundered. But as Mr. Ruddy said, because neither the actor nor the comedian knows how the scene will go, \u201cThe tension isn\u2019t just dramatic. It\u2019s real.\u201d\n\nIn the first \u2014 and best scene \u2014 Ms. Milioti played a character from Stephen Dietz\u2019s 1995 \u201cTrust,\u201d a bride being measured for a wedding dress. Tami Sagher (\u201cDon\u2019t Think Twice\u201d) improvised the seamstress, giving her a thick Slavic accent.\n\nLike Ms. Sagher, I hadn\u2019t met Mr. Dietz\u2019s play before, but when it premiered Ben Brantley called it \u201c \u2018Melrose Place\u2019 with a thesaurus and a reflective streak of self-consciousness,\u201d frowning on the heavy-handed dialogue.\n\nWell, that dialogue became a lot lighter with Ms. Sagher around. At one point she went into an aptly vulgar riff on Kobe Bryant, and I think I heard a shout out to Cynthia Plaster Caster, too.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome of the lines were wittier and more character-focused than that, as when Ms. Miloti\u2019s character asked, \u201cAre you married?\u201d and Ms. Sagher replied, \u201cNo. But I have been. Many times. A good dressmaker learns from her mistakes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat was most remarkable was the way the two women listened to each other, the way Ms. Milioti stayed quiet until Ms. Sagher gave her an opening to sensibly segue to her next line, the way Ms. Sagher used each dribble of information to both set up jokes and create real conflict.\n\nMs. Milioti, who will appear again in the Feb. 26 show, said that she loves the uncertainty of the scenes, the intense focus they require, the need to be \u201c1,000 percent present,\u201d and the surprise when \u201csomething molecular happens\u201d and she and the improviser find a groove. \u201cIt is incredibly exhilarating,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She declared it right back. Instead of a prelude to suicide, \u201cIt became a touching, sincere scene about two people realizing they are in love,\u201d Mr. Ruddy said.\n\nI wasn\u2019t crazy about every scene in the January show. Honestly, I wasn\u2019t crazy about most of them. Some went on too long, another never got started. But as someone who sees a lot of plays and a lot of the same plays, I\u2019m a fan of the cheerful sedition at its heart.\n\nEven the spluttering scenes suggest that we don\u2019t always have to play by the published script or accept the roles we\u2019re handed.

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "That does not mean it\u2019s entirely a marketing gimmick. The United States Department of Agriculture began regulating organic foods in 2002. Organic crops are supposed to be grown without genetic modifications or synthetic pesticides and other synthetic additives, though there are exceptions. Organic livestock is raised without antibiotics.\n\nWhile regulators give out a \u201cU.S.D.A. Organic\u201d label, Goldfish don\u2019t qualify. Still, you are allowed to say a product features an organic ingredient as long as it \u201ccontains at least 70 percent organically produced ingredients (excluding salt and water).\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Campbell Soup Company, which owns the Goldfish brand, started selling three kinds of Goldfish with organic ingredients in 2016. Chris Foley, chief marketing officer at Pepperidge Farm, a division of Campbell\u2019s, said organic was a natural fit for the brand.\n\n\u201cI think Goldfish start from a very healthy place,\u201d he said. (We\u2019ll set aside that this is a brand that offers flavors like S\u2019mores and Cookies & Cream.) \u201cWe have no artificial flavors and preservatives. It\u2019s 100 percent real cheese. We source our colors from real plants.\u201d\n\nThe move into organic was driven by market research.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always listening to our moms \u2014 that\u2019s our primary buyer,\u201d Mr. Foley said. \u201cCertainly there are more moms looking for more organic options.\u201d\n\nMoms aside, there\u2019s an elephant in the room we have not addressed.\n\nOr, to be more accurate, a bunny.\n\nThe advent of 70 percent organic Goldfish almost certainly has something to do with the rise of Cheddar Bunnies, made by Annie\u2019s Homegrown, which General Mills acquired in 2014. One blog for moms declared Cheddar Bunnies \u201cthe Goldfish of this generation\u201d in 2015, the kind of sentiment that probably didn\u2019t sit well at Campbell.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOrganic Goldfish appear to emulate Cheddar Bunnies, which debuted in 2003. Both are made with organic wheat and are 70 percent organic. Annie\u2019s did also start selling a fully organic, U.S.D.A.-certified variety of Cheddar Bunnies in 2008, though the lesser organic variety remains the flagship.\n\nGoing 70 percent organic limits additives like autolyzed yeast extract, \u201cwhich provides savory background flavor notes\u201d to Cheddar Goldfish but is left out of organic wheat Goldfish, Campbell said. Going fully organic would require further paring of the industrial pantry, and might be a distinction lost on many consumers anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn response to questions about its view of Goldfish, Annie\u2019s took the high road. In a statement, the company said, \u201cWe believe that organic food is good for people and the planet we all share, so we\u2019re always excited to see increased access to organic options for consumers.\u201d\n\nI went back to Campbell and asked if Annie\u2019s had anything to do with organic Goldfish. Mr. Foley held to his position. In an email, he said the decision \u201cwas about listening to our customers: moms going up and down supermarket aisles searching for \u2018better for you\u2019 options.\u201d\n\nNow that we\u2019ve caught up on Big Food\u2019s chess match over salty animal crackers, does any of this matter? Is organic healthier?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Still, the Environmental Protection Agency has found that the pesticide residues found on almost all crops are within acceptable tolerances. But debate on the topic continues.\n\n\u201cExisting data shows that when we eat organically, we reduce our pesticide exposure,\u201d said Cynthia Curl, an assistant professor at Boise State University who has studied the topic extensively. \u201cObservational studies, while not conclusive, are consistent with the idea that there may be health benefits from reducing pesticide exposure, particularly during pregnancy. But the science simply isn\u2019t there to say for sure.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll keep chomping my way through my own research. When I\u2019m stuffing my face with organic wheat Goldfish, or regular Cheddar Bunnies, I now know to feel 70 percent better about myself than if I were eating regular Goldfish, but 30 percent worse than if I were gobbling up the U.S.D.A.-certified organic Cheddar Bunnies. And I haven\u2019t tried the Flavor Blasted\u00ae Kick It Up a Nacho Goldfish, but I think there\u2019d be some guilt involved.\n\nFor the big food manufacturers, organic simply fills another market niche. I asked Mr. Foley if Goldfish with organic wheat was any healthier than the regular kind, a tricky question for an executive at a large food company to answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an alternative,\u201d he said.", "title": "These Goldfish Are 70 Percent Organic", "authors": ["Danny Hakim"]}
{"date": "2018-02-08 00:00:00", "text": "About 375 million years ago, a pioneering fish crawled out of a prehistoric ocean and kick-started the evolution of salamanders, lizards, you, me and all other land vertebrates that have ever existed.\n\nThe circuits of neurons that govern walking, many have long thought, emerged sometime after that, as creatures transitioned from swimming to limb-based locomotion.\n\nBut a new report, published in the journal Cell on Thursday, overturns that notion, suggesting the template for walking originated in ancient fish millions of years before the first vertebrate ever ambled on dry land. The little skate, a fish closely related to sharks and rays, not only displays walking behavior on the seafloor, but uses neurons and genes that are nearly identical to the ones vertebrates use to walk on land, said Jeremy Dasen, an associate professor at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine\u2019s Neuroscience Institute and senior author of the paper.\n\nYou can trace the heritage of little skates and land vertebrates back to a common ancestor that lived about 420 million years ago. This primitive fish gave rise to the vast majority of vertebrate species, including all fish with paired fins. Typically, these pectoral and pelvic fins \u2014 which correspond to forelimbs and hindlimbs in land vertebrates \u2014 are small and largely used for balance and steering.

Mr. Stone, Mr. Skarlatos and Mr. Sadler suggested in jest that they should be played by Chris Hemsworth, Zac Efron and Michael B. Jordan. \u201cI got a crazy idea maybe these guys should play themselves,\u201d Mr. Eastwood said. \u201cThey\u2019re genuinely charismatic. I figured I\u2019d roll the dice, what the hell? What can they do to me at this stage?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThree weeks before shooting started, Mr. Eastwood asked the three to come in for a meeting, ostensibly to assess the screenplay\u2019s accuracy, which they had discussed before. Only this time, he had a camera, and he asked them to re-enact the events. Then he offered them the chance to play themselves. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t even joked about that \u2014 it wasn\u2019t on our radar as a possibility,\u201d said Mr. Skarlatos, who, like his two friends, hadn\u2019t ever acted in so much as a school play. \u201cWhen he asked us, we immediately said yes, because, I mean, you can\u2019t tell Clint Eastwood no.\u201d\n\nMr. Stone doubted that decision on his first day of filming last summer. \u201cI looked over and there was Clint Eastwood, and I felt like I was in \u2018The Twilight Zone,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI bombed my first few takes, but then I got myself together and said, \u2018Come on, you said yes to this, just suck it up and do it,\u2019 and from there, it got easier and easier.\u201d\n\nThe low-key atmosphere Mr. Eastwood\u2019s sets are known for helped soothe the fledgling stars\u2019 nerves. \u201cI\u2019ve become an anti-anxiety specialist,\u201d the director said. \u201cIn the old days, when I started doing small parts in the \u201950s, assistant directors would ring bells and yell, \u2018Quiet!\u2019 even if it was quiet already.

(Mr. Stone and Mr. Skarlatos have since left the military.) \u201cFor sure, if I can make it a career, then why the heck not?\u201d Mr. Stone said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone full Hollywood. I got a big agency, U.T.A., and hopefully things will take off.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe novices even got some career advice from their director. \u201cI told them after they were done shooting this movie, they could take acting lessons,\u201d Mr. Eastwood said. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably screw them up for a while, but they\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\nAs for his own future, Mr. Eastwood is keeping his options open. He first stepped behind the camera when he briefly filled in for the flu-stricken director Don Siegel on the set of \u201cDirty Harry\u201d in 1971. \u201cI thought, well, I\u2019ll try this for a while, and at a certain time in life, I\u2019ll probably look up at the screen and say, \u2018Nuh-uh,\u2019\u201d Mr. Eastwood said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s happened yet. But I\u2019ve never gotten bored.\u201d\n\nAt 87, he\u2019s also not ruling out a return to acting, if the right part comes along. Although he chose not to appear in \u201cThe 15:17 to Paris,\u201d a poster for another film Mr. Eastwood directed, \u201cLetters From Iwo Jima,\u201d can be seen in Mr. Stone\u2019s childhood bedroom. \u201cThat\u2019s better than having me do a cameo, like Alfred Hitchcock did,\u201d Mr. Eastwood said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be distracting.\u201d\n\nIn the end, as Dirty Harry said in \u201cMagnum Force,\u201d \u201cA man\u2019s got to know his limitations.\u201d If only Mr. Eastwood had figured that out before his \u201cMister Ed\u201d turn. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an example of great acting, I don\u2019t think,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen it in many years.\u201d", "title": "They Foiled a Terror Attack.

{"date": "2018-02-28 00:00:00", "text": "Ms. Swan, the executive assistant from New York who traveled with Ms. Pearson, said that the trip to Gander was therapeutic. \u201cI\u2019ve been in New York City for 13\u00bd years, so it\u2019s easy to get bogged down in the pressures,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing there and seeing what a positive mind-set these people have, I catch myself more when I\u2019m stressing.\u201d\n\nThe people of Gander may be welcoming tourists with open arms, but they are also taking full advantage of their moment in the sun. The town now has official van tours, welcome centers and signs for \u201cCome From Away\u201d fans. Gander\u2019s website warns those planning to visit during peak season (summer) to book accommodations and car rentals well in advance. Mr. Elliott, however, doesn\u2019t think this is an issue. \u201cIf there is no more room just give someone a call, and you can stay in their home,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way we are.\u201d\n\nMr. and Ms. Emerson are heading back sometime in 2018 to see sites like Gros Morne National Park. Ms. Pearson and Ms. Swan are also taking another trip in June to take in the icebergs, the whales and some little towns they missed on their first trip.\n\nThe exchange goes both ways. The \u201cIslanders,\u201d as they call themselves in the musical, are visiting New York, too.\n\n\u201cIt was an eerie feeling being at ground zero,\u201d Mr. Elliott said. \u201cIt was like I was walking on sacred ground. You look around and close your eyes and you can envision what these people were going through that day and what terror must have been going through everybody over here.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Davis, the retired teacher, the Broadway premiere provided an opportunity for her to visit New York for the first time. She found that when she opened up to New Yorkers about her story, they were as hospitable to her as she had been to them. While in line at the 9/11 Tribute Museum, one man insisted on paying her admission fee. Outside the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, she asked a local couple to take her picture. They ended up inviting her to their home for dinner. \u201cSaying no was one of my biggest regrets of my time in New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was being on the receiving end of people giving. Going to places and having someone pay your meal or offer to take you somewhere,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s an overwhelming experience.\u201d", "title": "They Just Want to Meet the Nice People", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Classen does style many of his clients for formal appearances, but he has made a specialty of casual off-carpet looks. When he struck out on his own as a stylist in 2015, labels tightly guarded their stores, lending clothes only for specific red carpet occasions. \u201cNow, if it\u2019s for a street style or an airport, they\u2019re going to give it to me right away,\u201d Mr. Classen said.\n\nPhoto\n\nNot that the red carpet has disappeared. It remains, ready when needed, for the Oscars, the Emmys, the Grammys, the premieres. And so remain, at the ready, the legion of red carpet stylists. But joining them are a new wave of \u201cday stylists\u201d whose forte is the casual, tossed-off, this-old-thing look of street style: what the stars would throw together on their own (but often don\u2019t have to).\n\nEven the most casual of looks \u2014 the jeans, beanie and pap-proof goggle shades the star may wear to scurry to the gate of her departing flight \u2014 may well take a village. (The highest-profile stars may have separate stylists to work on their biggest red carpet events. Ms. Gomez, for example, also works with the stylist Kate Young.)\n\n\u201cA lot of people probably think that they choose on a daily basis from their own closets,\u201d said Mimi Cuttrell, 26, a stylist who works with Gigi Hadid, Ms. Gerber and Ms. Hadid\u2019s mother, Yolanda Hadid. \u201cSometimes there are outfits that are completely planned out from head to toe. I\u2019m really particular with tailoring, too. There\u2019s a lot of pieces and back work that goes into getting one street style look ready.\u201d\n\nBig brands aren\u2019t immune to the charms of the street-style moment, and regularly send out news releases with watermarked photos from outlets like Splash News (familiar to readers of Us Weekly and In Touch) touting their designer wares in the wild: at Narita International Airport in Tokyo, at LAX, \u201cout and about in Los Angeles.\u201d (Spot the hotel doorman in the background, or the bodyguard at the ready.)\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd not by accident, important labels and noisemakers have co-opted the street as their own: Balenciaga\u2019s new ad campaign features models hiding from paparazzi photographers as they make their security-escorted way; Kanye West showed his latest Yeezy collection with a series of famous friends in faux paparazzi shots, disseminated on social media.\n\nBut the moment has been especially fruitful for up-and-coming labels, some of which have enjoyed the boost of such patronage before they were fully up and running. Alexia Elkaim, the founder and creative director of Miaou, whose high-waisted, belted-and-grommeted jeans have become a uniform for digital-age starlets, had barely gotten out of the gate when a pair of her pants found their way to Bella Hadid in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt was almost like that verified my brand as a real brand, you know?\u201d Ms. Elkaim said. \u201cI probably had 45, 50 pairs of jeans at the time.\u201d Gigi Hadid, Ms. Gerber and others followed, reaching out either directly or via their stylists; and in the new gravity they have helped to shift, an order from Bergdorf Goodman followed them.\n\nThe rush that comes after a good placement \u2014 a selfie, say \u2014 was immediate. \u201cI had never seen that before,\u201d Ms. Elkaim said. \u201cAt the beginning, it was kind of like you\u2019re chasing a high.\u201d\n\nJason Stalvey\u2019s line of exotic-skin handbags and accessories, Stalvey (his gateway item is an alligator baseball cap, $5,000), was in its infancy when the Hadids got wind of him.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cGigi was basically the first person to start the madness,\u201d he said. She has been carrying a small top-handle bag ($11,500), so small as to be more or less impractical. In one photo, Mr. Stalvey spotted a phone cord dangling out of it: \u201cShe was literally using it as a phone charger.\u201d\n\nWhen Ms. Hadid began carrying the bag, it was not yet available for sale. Even so, Mr. Stalvey said, retailers began increasing their orders. Traffic on his website went \u201cup and up,\u201d he said, eventually cresting at eight times its usual amount.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a person can run to Barneys or the Webster or wherever and at least see it in pink and come to the website and order it in green,\u201d Mr. Stalvey said. \u201cThey were truly buying the product sight unseen. These girls really drove the wave.\u201d\n\n(In fact, they drove the wave among one another. Bella Hadid\u2019s stylist reached out to see if her client could borrow the same bag as Gigi, her older sister, was carrying. \u201cThat consumed my entire afternoon,\u201d Mr. Stalvey said \u201cAt the end of the day, I said: \u2018I can\u2019t pull it from Gigi. Why doesn\u2019t Bella go and ask her sister?\u2019 The very next day, Bella was carrying the bag.\u201d)\n\nThe point of such styling is to look effortless, natural and, in one of fashion\u2019s favorite terms, \u201cauthentic\u201d \u2014 even when that authenticity is mediated by an on-hand stylist to offer up the glossiest version of your authentic self. So much so that many of the millions of fans watching along on social media may not realize they\u2019re looking at a tailor-made ensemble.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a version of giving your friend advice on what to wear, but then there\u2019s actual results from it,\u201d said Emma Jade Morrison, 27, who in the fall left a job at Vogue magazine to begin styling Ms. Ratajkowski professionally. \u201cI find now that a really strong street style outfit can resonate more than a red carpet outfit. There\u2019s such a fashion-conscious public now. They know that the red carpet gowns are custom-made, that the jewelry is borrowed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith street styling, she added, her goal as a stylist is to gussy up her clients without a trace, an invisible hand of the market. \u201cYou want to believe \u2014 at least I want to believe \u2014 that they own this,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what matters. Maybe it\u2019s not, and maybe we\u2019re all aware of that, but it should look like it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

She described working on Ms. Ratajkowski\u2019s street styling as: \u201cI make the buffet, and she makes her plate from it.\u201d (For red carpet and much photographed events like fashion weeks or the Cannes Film Festival, Ms. Morrison guides with a firmer hand.)\n\nFor the pieces soon to come down the pike at New York Fashion Week, and fashion weeks in London, Milan and Paris after that, their star turns may well be on the street. Mr. Classen noted that many more collections are now showing sneakers rather than heels, the choice of the street versus that of the red carpet. And without a doubt, many of these women will be on hand to see these shows, casually yet fabulously assembled (with just a little help).\n\nEven those who still may benefit from red carpet placement are in no rush to restore its former domination.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe street wear moment, I personally like it more than the red carpet,\u201d Mr. Stalvey said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, red carpet is amazing. But to see a girl using a bag because she wants to use it, she gravitates to it for her personal wear, to me just means so much more. In the wave of social media, my guess is, the customers themselves, the girls watching these girls, they respond to that, because they see it as being truer to their personal taste or more authentic than seeing something on a red carpet.\u201d\n\nThat said, some of the moment\u2019s beneficiaries sounded the occasional note of regret for the fashion\u2019s former elevated glamour, even as the new world order has democratized the system.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I had another idea of what fashion was,\u201d Ms. Elkaim said. \u201cToday it\u2019s at the mercy of paparazzi photos. It\u2019s just different.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s easier and it\u2019s more accessible, and it\u2019s incredible from a business point of view.\u201d", "title": "They Only Look Casual", "authors": ["Matthew Schneier"]}

Everyone was interested in it.\u201d He was joined in the conversation by Rabbi Schwartz, Mr. Azoulay and two other Ka\u2019et dancers, Eyal Ogen and Yair Barbash, all in their 30s.\n\nThe embrace of the group, by both audiences and critics, speaks to Ka\u2019et\u2019s ability to challenge the stereotypes of both art and faith. \u201cIt shakes you a bit out of your orientation, your categorizing of people,\u201d said Ruby Edelman, the chief executive and an artistic director of the Machol Shalem Dance House in Jerusalem. \u201cThey can reach people; they can open the discussion.\u201d\n\nDance and devotion have a long, rich relationship in Judaism. And dance continues to be used by some groups, including the Hasidim, as a form of ecstatic spiritual expression. For the members of Ka\u2019et, all of whom identify as dati leumi, or religious Zionists (akin to modern Orthodox in America), dance also offered a way into prayer. As Rabbi Schwartz said, \u201cI can\u2019t fully express myself spiritually without connecting to my body.\u201d But putting that body on a theatrical stage, in front of an audience, was a bold and unusual move.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ensemble\u2019s path began in 2000, when Mr. Izhaki, who is secular and lives in Tel Aviv, the center of Israel\u2019s dance scene, was asked to teach an experimental dance workshop for Orthodox men in Acre as a way to integrate physicality into prayer. There, he was inspired watching the men pray during breaks. \u201cIt was the most delicate movement I\u2019ve seen in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nThe workshop was brief, but its influence lingered. A few years later, Mr. Ogen, one of the students, asked Mr. Izhaki for private lessons. \u201cWhen I started I was hiding it from my father and family,\u201d he said. \u201cI was ashamed of what I was doing.\u201d Some in Orthodox Judaism consider anything aside from textual study to be a distraction; others look at the public performance of dance suspiciously because of its inherent sensuality, which they feel contradicts the closely held tenet of modesty.\n\nBut Mr. Ogen continued and more students soon joined, including Rabbi Schwartz, who said he was \u201cthirsty to learn the wisdom of the body\u201d \u2014 wisdom he now imparts to his students at the yeshiva where he teaches both Torah studies and movement classes. By 2007, they had a small school. Eventually they developed what the company members call \u201ca new Jewish contemporary dance.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That fall, Megan Whitman, director of the Lambert Center for Art + Ideas at the Manhattan JCC, saw an excerpt from the work in Israel. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that it was novel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was that it was profound, how these disconnected elements of society could be brought together in such a beautiful way.\u201d\n\nShe also saw parallels back home. Referring to how local audiences from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side might identify with Ka\u2019et, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see reflections of that same divide.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Ka\u2019et, \u201cHeroes\u201d represents an artistic evolution. Compared with earlier works, Mr. Edelman said, \u201cthe layers of this piece are much more sophisticated.\u201d Its sources include the pioneering Jewish dancer Baruch Agadati, the influential German choreographer Pina Bausch and the biblical story of Jacob and Esau. The work is \u201crelevant to what\u2019s happening in contemporary dance culture,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not isolated, it\u2019s not their own island.\u201d\n\nThat evolution also reflects a new willingness among the dancers to probe their faith\u2019s traditions and assumptions. \u201cAt the beginning, we had to do something religious,\u201d Rabbi Schwartz said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the courage to play with it. We have the courage now and the freedom to search new things.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade after beginning secret lessons with Mr. Izhaki, Mr. Ogen now manages the Ka\u2019et school where 45 students train three days a week in ballet, modern dance and Gaga, a popular movement language developed by the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin. (All students and teachers are male.)\n\nEnthusiasm for contemporary dance has been growing among religious Jews, Mr. Edelman said, including women. \u201cThe body is part of the soul,\u201d he explained, \u201cand it\u2019s supporting their belief.\u201d When people realize they can combine the two, \u201cThey\u2019re hungry for this.\u201d Machol Shalem is currently hosting a three-month program for religious dance teachers.\n\nDespite the meaningful support and growing acceptance, Mr. Ogen said, \u201cthere are places I go where I think twice about whether I say I\u2019m a dancer.\u201d And other Ka\u2019et members said they still faced skepticism from many in their community. But increasingly, they are met with curiosity and even a bit of envy. When Rabbi Schwartz recently attended a yeshiva reunion, he mentioned that he was a dancer. The guy next to him said, \u201cMy life isn\u2019t as interesting.\u201d", "title": "Thirsty for Wisdom of the Body, Finding It in Dance", "authors": ["Brian Schaefer"]}

Around 1911, her artist friend Howard Gardiner Cushing painted her wearing an androgynous ballet costume, with pink pants and a sharply flared jacket. He hung the canvas at her studio in Old Westbury, N.Y., as part of a stairwell mural that measures 125 feet long and also depicts hallucinogenic plants, Persian harems and Mughal palace rooms.\n\nIn the last year, Mr. Cushing\u2019s descendants have spent a few million dollars acquiring the flamboyant artwork and having it removed and restored for public display. Scholars had known little about the mural, which includes images of Whitney, the founder of the museum that bears her name; Mr. Cushing\u2019s wife, Ethel; and assorted courtesans, musicians and slaves. Mr. Cushing based the clothing and scenery on Ballets Russes costumes, Japanese prints and Whistler\u2019s paintings, among other sources, and the background vegetation includes poppies, oleander and nightshade.\n\nAlexandra Cushing Howard, an architectural historian who is a granddaughter of Mr. Cushing, spearheaded the mural removal project and is now contacting museums about possible exhibitions. The canvas series, which is currently in storage, has been turned into 18 framed panels. The imagery, she said, \u201cis so sophisticated and subversive but it\u2019s so joyful as well.\u201d\n\nThe studio in Old Westbury was left empty and neglected for decades after Whitney\u2019s death in 1942. A year ago, staff members from the Julius Lowy Frame and Restoring Company in New York began painstakingly lifting the Cushing paintings off the walls and rolling them for transport. Lauren Rich, Lowy\u2019s senior paintings conservator, said that given the flaking paint in some areas, \u201cwhat we were dealing with was hanging by a thread.\u201d", "title": "This Century-Old Mural Was Rescued From a Whitney\u2019s Stairwell", "authors": []}

And from what I\u2019ve seen, love doesn\u2019t often work that way. Having too many choices is in itself inefficient and fantasy inducing.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn my view, love is best found not in a haystack but in a pea pod. Here are your five peas. Or maybe nine peas. The anthropologist Helen Fisher claims that a human brain can reasonably consider only nine or 10 choices; beyond that, they turn to noise. So if you were to limit yourself to nine people and get to know them, give each a chance, you\u2019d probably fall in love with one.\n\nEven so, I\u2019m not one of those people who moan about how dating apps make things worse. It\u2019s just different, much the way online shopping differs from brick-and-mortar.\n\nWhen shopping online, you buy more stuff because it\u2019s so easy. Then you probably fantasize a little more about your new shoes or flying drone as you await their arrival, which means you\u2019re going to be disappointed more often because the shoes don\u2019t fit or the drone is poorly made. So you return them and start over \u2014 same as with the average online date. In the store, meanwhile, all of that trying on and rejecting would have happened in real time, much like getting to know and rejecting people at the bar or a party happens in real time, leaving you little time to fantasize.\n\nWhat\u2019s particularly misleading about online dating is how everyone on the site is trying to seduce you. They\u2019re trying to seduce everyone. They\u2019re all saying, \u201cDate me!\u201d\n\nWhen you walk into a bar, does everyone rush up to you with a big smile and a glowing r\u00e9sum\u00e9? No. Everyone ignores you. But online, a little piece of you believes. Because you\u2019re being pitched, you allow yourself to believe in these people\u2019s vulnerability and desire.

Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters last week that the remaining Islamic State leadership, even while on the run, still had \u201cfairly robust\u201d communications with its shadowy network of fighters now on the lam.\n\nWhile President Trump highlighted the liberation of almost all of the Islamic State\u2019s territory in Iraq and Syria in his State of the Union address last week, American military and intelligence officials say the group is still able to inspire and enable followers to carry out attacks. Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledged this in his speech, noting, \u201cThere is much more work to be done.\u201d\n\nAnalysts say they are also seeing signs that Islamic State fighters are adopting guerrilla tactics to terrorize civilians.\n\n\u201cThe group is transitioning into an underground organization that places more weight on asymmetric tactics, like suicide bombings against soft targets in government-secured areas like Baghdad,\u201d said Otso Iho, a senior analyst at Jane\u2019s Terrorism and Insurgency Center at IHS Markit in London.\n\nMr. Iho cited an attack by two suicide bombers in Baghdad last month that killed three dozen people and injured 90 more. The attack took place in a busy Baghdad square where day laborers gather to look for work.\n\nEstimates of how many fighters may have escaped into the deserts of Syria or Iraq and beyond are difficult to pin down, but American and other Western intelligence and counterterrorism analysts with access to classified assessments put the number in the low thousands. Many are traveling with spouses and children who are likely to have been radicalized during more than three years of Islamic State control of the region and could pose security risks as well, analysts say.\n\nIn December, Col. Ryan Dillon, the chief spokesman for the American-led military campaign in Iraq and Syria, said in a briefing with Pentagon reporters: \u201cSyrian regime commanders in eastern Syria suggest that ISIS fighters\u201d from the Middle Euphrates River Valley \u201cmay have slipped through porous Syrian and Russian defenses to arrive in areas near Damascus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsked late last month by The New York Times about indications that as many as 1,000 fighters and family members had fled the Euphrates River area just in recent days, Colonel Dillon\u2019s command replied in a statement: \u201cWe know that the Syrian regime has given ISIS the leeway to travel through their area of operations, but we cannot confirm any alleged incidents or operations that are taking place outside our area of operations.\u201d\n\nThe United States military is concerned that a Turkish offensive against the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces in Afrin, in northern Syria, has worsened the problem. The S.D.F. has been working with the Americans in former Islamic State-held areas to interdict fleeing jihadists, but those efforts have been greatly reduced as the Kurds have shifted resources to reinforce Afrin.\n\nMustafa Balli, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces headquarters, blamed the Turkish assault on Afrin for what he said was the Islamic State\u2019s resurgence.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSince this invasion of Afrin by Turkey, ISIS is getting stronger in the south,\u201d he said. \u201cThe battle against ISIS in the south, and the Turks in Afrin, is the same battle. The Turks want to give another chance to ISIS to grow again. Before the Turkish invasion, we were very close to finishing ISIS.\u201d\n\nSome 40,000 fighters from more than 120 countries poured into the battles in Syria and Iraq over the past four years, American and other Western officials say. While thousands died on the battlefield, officials say many thousands more probably survived to slip away to conflicts in Libya, Yemen or the Philippines, or have gone into hiding in countries like Turkey. About 295 Americans are believed to have traveled to Iraq or Syria, or tried to, American officials said.\n\nOf more than 5,000 Europeans who joined those ranks, as many as 1,500 have returned home, including many women and children, and most of the rest are dead or still fighting, according to Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union\u2019s top counterterrorism official.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That is in part because the Trump administration intensified its focus on preventing fighters from seeping out of Raqqa and Mosul, their former stronghold in Iraq, and more militants fought to the death than expected. Hundreds also surrendered in Raqqa.\n\nHundreds of others have been captured and are being held by American-backed Kurdish militias in northern Syria, raising fears among United States military officials of potentially creating a breeding ground for extremists \u2014 repeating a key security mistake of the Iraq war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the new assessments, bolstered by reports from analysts and smugglers in the region, suggest that Islamic State fighters are fleeing to more hospitable parts of Syria and Iraq, or to third countries where they can lie low.\n\nBeyond the recent suicide bombings in Baghdad, a major American airstrike last month demonstrates the Islamic State\u2019s continued resiliency and threat, military officials said.\n\nArmed Reaper drones and Navy F/A-18 fighters from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt carried out a strike on Jan. 20 in Al Shafah, Syria, in the Euphrates River Valley, that killed about 150 fighters, the American military said. The strike, one of the largest single aerial assaults against the Islamic State in three years, was based on intelligence collected over about a week. The strike hit two large buildings that were used as a command headquarters and a media distribution center, military officials said.\n\nThe size and concentration of fighters took American officials by surprise. \u201cThe ISIS headquarters contained a heavy concentration of ISIS fighters who appear to have been massing for movement,\u201d Maj. Gen. James B. Jarrard, commanding general for Special Operations forces in Iraq and Syria, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cISIS continues to demonstrate the ability to mass large numbers in its attempt to retain a stronghold in Syria,\u201d the American-led command in Iraq said in the same statement.\n\nAhmad Ramadan, the head of the Euphrates Center Against Violence and Terrorism in Istanbul, said that the Islamic State was still present in many villages east of the Euphrates River \u2014 the informal demarcation line between Russian-backed Syrian troops to the west and American-backed Syrian militias to the east. \u201cISIS nowadays are spreading all over Syria,\u201d he said via Facebook chat.\n\nGovernment and independent analysts in Syria and in Washington, including the Institute for the Study of War, said there was a thriving trade in smuggling Islamic State fighters across the border into Turkey, where intelligence officials believe they are linking with clandestine cells.\n\nAccording to the independent British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, senior Islamic State operatives from Raqqa and Deir al-Zour, in the Euphrates River Valley, have paid bribes of $20,000 to $30,000 for safe passage into Turkey.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI smuggled about 50 ISIS fighters into Turkey,\u201d said Abu Omar, a smuggler between Syria and Turkey, adding that they were a mix of Syrian and foreign fighters, often disguised in women\u2019s clothes to help elude Turkish border patrols.\n\nAbu Omar added that the number of fleeing Islamic State fighters and senior leaders, including many foreigners, increased over the summer when the American-backed offensive against Raqqa began.\n\n\u201cI was really shocked when I saw them,\u201d he said in a WhatsApp message. \u201cThey were wearing cool clothes, classic jeans with many necklaces, trying to disguise as much as they can.

Both his memories and his moment-by-moment experience of British immigration officials\u2019 tedious, unjust bureaucracy are refracted through what Amar himself calls \u201cthe incessant kaleidoscope within.\u201d He recalls first seeing the woman who would become his girlfriend and thinking she was \u201cbeautiful in the way some girls are beautiful despite having bypassed pretty entirely,\u201d and instead of finding London \u201cfabulous and enviable,\u201d Amar feels there \u201cthe way you do when you take one step too many at the bottom of a flight of stairs: brought up short by the unexpected plateau and its dull, unyielding thud.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTrapped at the airport, Amar lets his consciousness wander. He tries to reconstruct periods of his life of which he has no memory \u2014 \u201cContemplating the blackouts in their aggregate makes my breath come short\u201d \u2014 and pursues epistemological puzzles with the casual and discursive intelligence of the truly bored. Even a novelist, he thinks, \u201cis forever bound by the ultimate constraint: She can hold her mirror up to whatever subject she chooses, at whatever angle she likes \u2014 she can even hold it such that she herself remains outside its frame, the better to de-narcissize the view \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that she is always the one holding the mirror. And just because you can\u2019t see yourself in a reflection doesn\u2019t mean no one can.\u201d\n\nThroughout Amar\u2019s account, tiny details from Alice\u2019s story echo dimly though, enough to seem like coincidence: offhand descriptions of purple clothing, the music of Janacek, the vague phonetic qualities of Amar\u2019s own name. Only in the short third section \u2014 not even 30 pages \u2014 do we begin to understand how their stories fit together.\n\nThe book ends with the transcription of \u201cDesert Island Discs,\u201d a BBC radio program in which cultural figures select their favorite pieces of music, which are played on air between interview segments.

He tells charming boyhood anecdotes, flirts with the host, and at the end of a convoluted answer to a question about depression exposes the secret logic of \u201cAsymmetry.\u201d The reveal is both astonishing and retrospectively inevitable.\n\nHalliday has written, somehow all at once, a transgressive roman \u00e0 clef, a novel of ideas and a politically engaged work of metafiction. \u201cAsymmetry\u201d is extraordinary, and the timing of its publication seems almost like a feat of civics. The effect on the reader feels identical to the way Ezra describes a piano suite by Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, which he selects near the program\u2019s end. \u201cEach of the pieces builds on the last,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re discrete and yet all the richer for being heard together, and you just ache with the mounting intensity of it.\u201d", "title": "Three Lives, and the Tenuous Ties That Bind Them", "authors": ["Alice Gregory", "Lisa Halliday"]}

No one claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they were similar to scores of others in and around the city in the past few months.\n\nThe attackers were all female, according to The Associated Press, and the victims were mostly women and children, local news outlets reported. Boko Haram has been known to deploy young women and children as suicide bombers, in addition to sending men to attack mosques, markets and other places where crowds gather.\n\nThe police commissioner of Borno State, Damian Chukwu, said at least 18 people died and 22 others were wounded in the attack on Friday, according to Reuters. Hospital officials said two patients later died of their injuries.\n\nThe war with Boko Haram, which has displaced millions, is entering its ninth year. Militants raging against decades of economic inequality and government corruption in the region want to create a state that adheres to a harsh version of Islam. In their quest, they have burned villages, slaughtered men and boys who refuse to join their ranks, raped and enslaved women and girls, and strapped suicide bombs to terrified hostages.\n\nThe Nigerian military has made progress in the past weeks in chasing fighters from their forest hide-outs, and this month the military secured the release of high-profile hostages \u2014 a group of female police officers and several university professors who had been held by the fighters.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-02-23 00:00:00", "text": "Many people in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area have similar complications. Sidney Kess, a C.P.A. and lawyer in New York who is a special consultant to the accounting firm Citrin Cooperman, recently conducted a workshop on the impact of the new tax act for the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants. He and other tax professionals had these tips:\n\nDon\u2019t Delay This Filing Season\n\nPhoto\n\nGet your tax information organized, both your own records for itemized deductions like state and local taxes, mortgage interest paid, unreimbursed medical expenses and charitable donations, and documents like a W-2 from your employer and Forms 1099 or K-1 from banks, brokerage houses, partnerships or trusts.\n\nPeople who worked as independent contractors should also receive Forms 1099 from those who paid them.\n\nThe sooner you have all that together, the sooner you or a professional can prepare your 2017 return and project the impact for the 2018 return you will have to file next year. Greg Rosica, a Tampa-based tax partner in EY, formerly Ernst & Young, and a member of the editorial board for the EY Tax Guide 2018, which is published by John Wiley & Sons, said it was always a good idea to project your tax outlook for the next year, but said it was \u201cmore critical than ever this year.\u201d\n\nAdjust Estimated Tax Payments And Payroll Withholding\n\nPhoto\n\nIf you receive a paycheck, check to see how much tax is being withheld. New withholding guidelines take effect this month, giving taxpayers an increase in their take-home pay. For most people, 2018 taxes are expected be less than those for 2017.\n\nThat is because marginal rates have been trimmed, and many people will no longer need to itemize deductions. The standard deduction, $6,350 for a single taxpayer in 2017 and $12,700 for a married couple filing jointly, will rise in 2018 to $12,000 for singles and $24,000 for couples filing jointly.\n\nBut plenty of people will owe higher taxes for 2018.\n\nTriggers for higher taxes include:\n\n\u25a0 Itemized deductions for high state and local taxes, which will be limited to $10,000 in 2018;\n\n\u25a0 Complex financial situations like owning a business,\n\n\u25a0 A large number of personal exemptions.\n\nFor people with adjusted gross income of $156,900 or less in 2017, each personal exemption reduces taxable income by $4,050 \u2014 that\u2019s $20,250 for a family of five. But personal exemptions will be eliminated for 2018 returns.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new rules open up an opportunity for an older child who lives at home and works part time, perhaps to help pay college costs. The student can file her own return and owe no taxes on up to $12,000 in earnings by claiming the standard deduction. The parents would no longer lose a dependency exemption because those exemptions would no longer exist.\n\nJulian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., said that if you realize that you face higher taxes for 2018, fill out a new Form W-4 with your employer to increase withholding. You may also need to pay estimated taxes for 2018. The first quarterly payment is due on April 17, as are 2017 tax returns. The goal is to avoid a penalty for underpayment of estimated taxes. \u201cIf enough is withheld in 2018 to equal your 2017 liability, you can sleep at night,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou want to wind up owing a small balance,\u201d he added. One reason is to avoid being a victim of identity thieves who file fraudulent returns and claim big refunds, which they pocket. If that happened and you really were owed a refund, it could take quite a while to get it.\n\nWatch Out for Tighter Rules\n\nPhoto\n\nBarbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Vero Beach, Fla., said that under the new rules for 2018, employees can no longer deduct unreimbursed business expenses like business use of a car or a home office. She said it would be helpful if employees could get their employers to reimburse these costs through an accountable plan, which makes reimbursements tax free.\n\nDeductions for unreimbursed casualty and theft losses, now eligible when they are at least 10 percent of adjusted gross income plus $100 for each occurrence, are being eliminated beginning in 2018, with an exception: when disasters occur during officially \u2014 and presidentially \u2014 declared natural disasters like hurricanes or floods. She said people should be sure they have adequate insurance in case of events like home fires or thefts of valuables like jewelry.\n\nIf an employer transfers an employee and reimburses moving expenses, that reimbursement will now be taxable income, she said. Ms. Weltman is the author of two J. K. Lasser books, \u201c1001 Deductions & Tax Breaks 2018\u201d and \u201cSmall Business Taxes 2018,\u201d published by Wiley.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And some of these delayed changes are complex.\n\nFor example, people who pay alimony are allowed to deduct what they pay, and recipients must report it as income, but those rules are to change in 2019. At that point, for those with divorce decrees and separation agreements entered into \u2014 or substantially changed \u2014 after 2018, the payments would no longer be deductible and the money received would not be taxable. That could mean problems for people with prenuptial agreements who divorce in 2019. She advised them to consult a tax lawyer.\n\nMr. Block pointed out another tightening and a tip for coping with it. Tax preparation fees or the cost of tax books or software can no longer be taken as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A for the 2018 tax year, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, if part of the fee is for preparing Schedule C for self-employment income, Schedule E for rents and royalties or Schedule F for farm income, ask your preparer to break out that part of the fee, he said. It will still be deductible.\n\nEnforcement May Be Tougher\n\nMr. Kess cited two ways the I.R.S. can be tougher than it has in the past to collect what it is owed. Passports can be revoked, he said, for taxpayers who are \u201cseriously delinquent,\u201d that is, who owe more than $50,000 in taxes, penalties and interest. In addition, the I.R.S. can now hire private contractors to collect what is owed.\n\nCharities Are Under Pressure\n\nPhoto\n\nMany charities say donors are cutting back on contributions. Some taxpayers think that if they will now be taking a standard deduction, albeit a larger one, there is no tax incentive to give. Others are hesitant to make long-term commitments because they are unsure of what Washington will do next.\n\nIn speaking with donors, nonprofits need to emphasize the importance of the gift to a cause in which the donor believes, rather than the tax consequences, said James J. Vincequerra, a partner in the New York office of Alston & Bird, an international law firm that advises the New York City Opera and other nonprofits.\n\nAmend Your Return if Needed\n\nIf you make a mistake or do not have a necessary document, do not hesitate to file an amended return, a Form 1040X, Mr. Rosica said. It is a fairly simple process and does not invite trouble as some taxpayers may fear.\n\nIf you are trying to get a late document \u2014 Forms K-1, used by partnerships, are often very late \u2014 file Form 4868, which is only one-third of a page, for an automatic six-month extension to file your return until Oct. 15, 2018, he said.\n\nBut be warned, an extension to file is not an extension to pay. Estimate your 2017 taxes, and if you owe money, pay it. If you are short, you will have to pay the difference plus interest.", "title": "Tips for Coping With the Changes in the Tax Code", "authors": ["Jan M. Rosen"]}

But even then, the specialist, in consultation with her supervisor, decided that there was not enough evidence to pursue it and that it did not appear to be an imminent threat.\n\nThe acting F.B.I. deputy director, David L.

She said that Mr. Cruz had \u201cthe mental capacity of a 12 to a 14 year old.\u201d The tipster provided four Instagram accounts for Mr. Cruz, which she said showed photos of sliced up animals and the firearms he had amassed.

When it was signed eight years ago, President Barack Obama expressed hope that it would be a small first step toward deeper reductions, and ultimately a world without nuclear weapons.\n\nNow, that optimism has been reversed. A new nuclear policy issued by the Trump administration on Friday, which vows to counter a rush by the Russians to modernize their forces even while staying within the treaty limits, is touching off a new kind of nuclear arms race. This one is based less on numbers of weapons and more on novel tactics and technologies, meant to outwit and outmaneuver the other side.\n\nThe Pentagon envisions a new age in which nuclear weapons are back in a big way \u2014 its strategy bristles with plans for new low-yield nuclear weapons that advocates say are needed to match Russian advances and critics warn will be too tempting for a president to use.

Continental projects that 48-volt mild hybrid systems will account for 14 percent of global new vehicle sales in 2025, as sales of vehicles powered exclusively by gasoline or diesel engines drop to 65 percent.\n\nVolvo grabbed headlines in July when it announced that it would electrify its entire model range, offering \u2014 at minimum \u2014 an electric motor to assist its piston engine in every new Volvo released from 2019. Volvo will use the 48-volt standard for its mild hybrid vehicles: those that allow the internal combustion engine to shut off while coasting or still, then kick back on when accelerating.\n\nAudi, which is bringing 48-volt systems to the 2019 A7 and A8, replaces its conventional alternator with a larger, water-cooled alternator-starter. Rather than merely charging the battery and powering accessories, it restarts the warmed-up V6 engine after it shuts down at a stoplight and recaptures energy when slowing down to charge a lithium-ion battery in the trunk.\n\nThis design has another trick up its sleeve: It will also start the engine after the car goes into an engine-off coasting mode at speeds between 34 and 99 miles an hour, for up to 40 seconds, all in the cause of saving fuel.\n\nPower gains are possible, too. In the SQ7, a diesel S.U.V. that Audi does not currently sell in the United States, an electric motor drives a vane-type supercharger. Similar in operation to a turbocharger, this device delivers its power boost at low engine speeds without the lag of an exhaust-driven turbo. And Mercedes-Benz is equipping the new in-line six-cylinder engine of the 2019 CLS 450 with its EQ integrated starter-generator system. In this design, the electricity is produced in the space between the engine and transmission. In motor mode, it adds 21 horse power and 184 pound-feet of torque for quick getaways, and it can take over for the gas engine at a steady-state cruise.\n\nAnd 48-volt mild hybrid systems can work in heavy-duty applications: Fiat Chrysler will follow the belt-alternator approach with its eTorque system in Ram pickups and the Jeep Wrangler.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy 48 volts? Settling on this level holds the electrical system under the 60-volt safety threshold of what is considered high voltage, where power cables must be orange and special connectors, costing 10 times as much, are required, said Mary Gustanski, chief technical officer of Delphi Technologies.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor now, the more powerful systems run alongside the traditional 12-volt electronics rather than replacing them altogether. This dual-voltage strategy avoids the need to redesign simple, reliable components like the motors that open windows and adjust seats.\n\n\u201cA full switch-over makes no sense,\u201d Oliver Maiwald, a senior vice president for powertrain technology at Continental, a major industry supplier, said. \u201cI don\u2019t foresee a need to redesign these low-tech, low-cost parts.\u201d\n\nThe advantages of the new 48-volt systems are considerable. They offer fuel economy improvements of up to 15 percent, Ms. Gustanski said, and would cost an automaker between $650 and $1,000 to add to the vehicle \u2014 well under the approximately $3,000 it costs to install a full hybrid system. Powering a supercharger electrically can bring a 30 percent gain in torque at low engine speeds, at an added cost of about $250.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Battery electrics, shrinking in cost and growing in range, will be part of the solution. So will plug-in hybrids, which pack enough battery reserve for the needs of most daily commuters.\n\nBut skeptics may wonder why engineers are devoting so much effort to developing the mild hybrid systems that could be seen as stopgap measures on the path to a fully electric vehicle fleet.\n\nIt is the reality of how long it takes for the automotive fleet to turn over that really clarifies the picture. A forecast by IHS Markit, an industry analyst firm, said 10 percent of vehicles built around the world seven years from now would have 48-volt systems.\n\n\u201cIn 2025, more than 95 percent of vehicles sold globally will still have internal combustion engines,\u201d Ms. Gustanski said. \u201cSo even in 2030, 48 volts will be part of the mix.\u201d", "title": "To Power the Future, Carmakers Flip on 48-Volt Systems", "authors": ["Norman Mayersohn"]}

Representative Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, introduced a \u201cred flag\u201d bill last May that would make it easier for family members to keep firearms out of the hands of potentially dangerous relatives. The bill has 50 Democratic co-sponsors but not one Republican. Maybe the Parkland massacre will shame the majority into embracing the legislation.\n\nBut such laws can achieve only so much. Keeping track of dangerously unstable people who shouldn\u2019t own guns but do is hard: Devin Kelley, the Texas church shooter, had once escaped from a mental health hospital and was legally barred from buying the weapon he used to murder 26 people in November. Nor can the federal government be in the business of getting unwell people to take their meds. That way lies the path to a Clockwork Orange.\n\nBeyond that, the conservative answer is: more guns.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a gun in the right hands at the right time and place can save lives, as the former National Rifle Association instructor Stephen Willeford proved when he shot Kelley as the latter emerged from the church. No sensible society should want to keep arms out of hands like his.\n\nBut that\u2019s an argument for greater discrimination in terms of who should get to own a gun, not less. The United States has, by far, more guns in more hands than any other country in the developed world. It has, by far, the highest incidence of firearm-related homicides and suicides. Correlation is not causation, but since Americans aren\u2019t dramatically crazier than other nationalities, what other explanation is there?\n\nGun advocates often make the claim that the mere presence of firearms deters crime. But research from Stanford\u2019s John Donohue suggests that \u201cright to carry\u201d state laws have led to a 13 to 15 percent jump in violent crime. New York City, with the most aggressive enforcement of gun laws of any major U.S. city, has seen its homicide rate drop to levels not experienced since the 1950s.

The company\u2019s business depends on people being highly engaged with what is posted on its sites, which in turn helps make it a marquee destination for advertisers.\n\nWhen suggestions first arose after the 2016 election that Facebook may have influenced the outcome, Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, dismissed the concerns. But by last September, Facebook had disclosed that the Internet Research Agency had bought divisive ads on hot-button issues through the company. It later said 150 million Americans had seen the Russian propaganda on the social network and Instagram.\n\nThe resulting firestorm has damaged Facebook\u2019s reputation. Company officials, along with executives from Google and YouTube, were grilled by lawmakers last fall. Facebook has since hired thousands of people to help monitor content and has worked with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading the investigation into Russian election interference. It has also changed its advertising policy so that any ad that mentions a candidate\u2019s name goes through a more stringent vetting process. Mr. Zuckerberg has vowed to not let Facebook be abused by bad actors.\n\nYet Facebook\u2019s multiple mentions in Friday\u2019s indictment renew questions of why the world\u2019s biggest social media company didn\u2019t catch the Russian activity earlier or do more to stop it. How effective the company\u2019s new efforts to reduce foreign manipulation have been is also unclear.\n\nRob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of advertising, waded into the discussion on Friday with a series of tweets that argued that Russia\u2019s goal was to sow chaos among the electorate rather than to force a certain outcome in the election. On Saturday, President Trump cited those tweets as evidence that Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign was not aimed at handing him a victory.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where Facebook has its headquarters, some critics pilloried the company after the indictment became public.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Facebook does just the opposite, enabling every user to have a unique set of facts, driving the country apart for profit.\u201d\n\nJoel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement that the company was grateful the government was taking action \u201cagainst those who abused our service and exploited the openness of our democratic process.\u201d\n\nHe added that Facebook was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections to ensure that a similar manipulation campaign would not take place. \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook has previously questioned whether law enforcement should be more involved in helping to stop the threat from nation state actors. Facebook said it worked closely with the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nYouTube did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. PayPal said in a statement that it has worked closely with law enforcement and \u201cis intensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Internet Research Agency, created in 2014 in St. Petersburg and employing about 80 people, was given the job of interfering with elections and political processes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe group began using American social media to achieve those aims in 2014, when it started making Facebook pages dedicated to social issues like race and religion. Over the next two years, the indictment said, the Russians stole the identities of real Americans to create fake personas and fake accounts on social media. The group then used those to populate and promote Facebook pages like United Muslims of America, Blacktivist and Secured Borders.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy 2016, the indictment said, the size of some of these Russian-controlled Facebook groups had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of followers.\n\nThe Russians then used these groups to push various messages, including telling Americans not to vote in the 2016 election for either Mr. Trump or his opponent, Hillary Clinton. In October 2016, according to the indictment, one Russian-controlled Instagram account called Woke Blacks posted a message saying: \u201cHatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we\u2019d surely be better off without voting AT ALL.\u201d\n\nAround 2015, according to the indictment, the Russians also started purchasing ads on Facebook and other social media sites like Twitter, targeting specific communities within the United States. The group used stolen PayPal accounts to pay for the ads and to promote posts, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the outreach.\n\nIn one ad, published to promote a Facebook event called \u201cDown with Hillary,\u201d an image of Mrs. Clinton was shown with a black \u201cX\u201d painted across her face. The text read, \u201cHillary Clinton is the co-author of Obama\u2019s anti-police and anti-Constitutional propaganda.\u201d\n\nBy mid-2016, according to the indictment, the Russians were using their fake Facebook personas to organize political rallies in the United States. That June, for example, posing as the United Muslims of America on Facebook, they promoted a rally called \u201cSupport Hillary. Save American Muslims.\u201d For an August 2016 event organized through Facebook, the Russians also paid for a cage to be built that was large enough to hold an actress depicting Mrs. Clinton in a prison uniform.\n\nAt every step, the Russians used Facebook\u2019s own tools to make sure their propaganda was as effective as possible. Those tools allowed them to get real-time results on which types of ad campaigns were reaching their target audience or which posts were getting the most engagement with viewers.\n\nResearchers said that those tools are still widely available and that while the company has worked to remove fake accounts and stem the flow of disinformation, it has refused to let outside researchers examine the data on how Russian actors used the platform so effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking steps to fix this, but there\u2019s no easy solution,\u201d Anton Vuljaj, a Republican media strategist who has advised campaigns and media groups, said of Facebook and other social media companies. \u201cThis also shows that the public needs to be more vigilant about what is real and what is not online.\u201d\n\n", "title": "To Stir Discord in 2016, Russians Turned Most Often to Facebook", "authors": ["Sheera Frenkel", "Katie Benner"]}

Only 35 percent of the toads that shared habitat with the beetles coughed them up, compared to 57 percent of the toads with no common habitat. The findings suggest that regular exposure to bombardier beetles has allowed some toads to evolve a tolerance to their poison.\n\nSize mattered, too. Large beetles escaped more frequently than small beetles, and small toads were more likely to vomit beetles than large toads. The reason, presumably, is that large beetles are able to produce more poison, and smaller toads are less able to tolerate it, said Dr. Sugiura.\n\nTo be sure that the beetles were using their spray to escape, the researchers also fed the toads beetles that had been forced to expel their poison just before being consumed. Nearly all of those beetles were successfully digested.\n\nThe authors say it\u2019s still not clear whether the beetles have evolved a resistance to a toad\u2019s digestive fluids and enzymes, which may have helped them survive their ordeal inside a toad\u2019s belly. That may be the case, but it\u2019s also possible that their poison spray prevented the toads from producing enough digestive juices to harm them.\n\nBombardier beetles are not the only creatures that can shoot toxic liquids. Fire ants, spitting cobras and even some species of birds are known to disable their prey with harmful sprays.\n\nBased on the current study, Dr. Sugiura predicted that other spraying species may also be able to escape from a predator\u2019s stomach. \u201cWell-defended species that force some predators to vomit will be found in other animal groups,\u201d he said.

In 2015, users of the site began posting reports of food poisoning from a Chipotle location in Simi Valley, Calif. Eventually, it became clear that they were part of a larger norovirus outbreak, one of many food safety issues that would haunt Chipotle for the next couple of years, cutting its stock price in half and eventually forcing the resignation of its chief executive.\n\n\u201cI could tell that Chipotle was a problem brand,\u201d Mr. Quade said. \u201cThe rate of reporting was averaging nine or 10 times higher than other brands. It was a really powerful leading indicator.\u201d\n\nOne day last summer, Chipotle\u2019s stock fell more than 5 percent after reports that a store in Virginia had been the subject of multiple IWasPoisoned complaints. Another cluster of reports in December sent the stock down 3 percent. In both cases, Chipotle found no evidence of a wider outbreak, and conspiracy-minded industry watchers began wondering if short-sellers were deliberately sabotaging the company by submitting false reports in hopes of causing a stock scare.\n\n\u201cReports made to these third-party reporting sites have no clinical validation, are made anonymously, and are unreliable,\u201d Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe constantly monitor all available sources of information \u2014 including social media platforms and third-party reporting websites \u2014 to ensure we are aware of any allegation of illness, and we have robust procedures in place to look into any claims that are made.\u201d\n\nAfter the 2015 Chipotle incident drew attention to the site, Mr. Quade realized that IWasPoisoned could become a real business. He quit his job at Morgan Stanley, and began to work on the site full time. He now has three employees, a handful of remote contractors and a makeshift office at a co-working space in Manhattan. The company makes less than $20,000 per month in revenue, but Mr. Quade expects that to grow. Soon, he plans to release a mobile app, which will alert a user when walking near a restaurant with an active food poisoning complaint.\n\nAs it has matured, IWasPoisoned has developed an unusual business model that reflects Mr. Quade\u2019s Wall Street roots. Power users \u2014 like, say, a hedge fund that can profit from knowing about an E. coli outbreak at a major restaurant chain ahead of the rest of the market \u2014 pay up to $5,000 a month for real-time alerts whenever a new report is posted to the site.

In exchange, prosecutors agreed not to seek a prison sentence for Mr. Filber.\n\nSuch state\u2019s witness agreements in Israel usually involve a criminal suspect giving up a bigger fish. Mr. Filber\u2019s direct superior was Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nMr. Filber was expected to tell the police that in his role at the ministry he was carrying out explicit and detailed instructions from Mr. Netanyahu, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 2 evening \u201cNews\u201d program, and that he came to realize he was being exploited.\n\nThrough a spokesman, Mr. Netanyahu responded, \u201cIt never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main question is, what does he know?\u201d said Oren Gazal-Ayal, dean of the University of Haifa law faculty and a criminal-law specialist. \u201cAccording to suspicion, Filber was the one offering Bezeq all the benefits. He changed the policies of the government from the minute he became director-general of the ministry. If Netanyahu changed the regulations to get good coverage, and you can prove that, that\u2019s definitely a criminal offense.\u201d\n\nIn his first response to Mr. Filber\u2019s agreement with prosecutors, Mr. Netanyahu projected bravado. He posted part of a biblical verse, Exodus 1:12, on his Facebook page \u2014 \u201cBut the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread\u201d \u2014 referring to the Egyptians\u2019 dread of the enslaved Israelites gaining strength.

One, known as Case 1000, involves accusations of illicit gifts for favors. In the other, Case 2000, he is accused of back-room dealing with the publisher of Yedioth Ahronoth, a major Israeli newspaper, also for more favorable coverage. The police recommended last week that Mr. Netanyahu be prosecuted on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Mr. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\nAny actual indictment may be months away, pending a hearing with Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers and a decision by the attorney general.\n\nAdding to the prime minister\u2019s woes, however, Mr. Filber is not the first former ally to have turned against Mr. Netanyahu. Many analysts predicted as early as August that Mr. Netanyahu was doomed after the police signed a state\u2019s witness deal with Ari Harow, his former chief of staff and once one of his closest confidants, in Cases 1000 and 2000.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An academic report highlighted the poor record of gender diversity in music and at the Grammys, where for the last six years only 9.3 percent of nominees have been women. This year, only one woman won a solo award during the televised ceremony.\n\nAnd Lorde, the sole female nominee for album of the year, was not offered a performance slot of her own. In a gesture interpreted as protest, Lorde stitched a provocative poem by the artist Jenny Holzer into the back of her red dress: \u201cRejoice! Our times are intolerable,\u201d the poem began. \u201cTake courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best.\u201d\n\nWhen asked after the awards whether it was a mistake not to offer Lorde a solo spot, Ken Ehrlich, the longtime producer of the show, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can really deal with everybody.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA day after Mr. Portnow made his \u201cstep up\u201d remark, he issued another statement saying that the music world \u201cmust welcome, mentor and empower\u201d women.

In an email dated Jan. 27, 2017, Ms. Holderness sent the F.B.I. agent who had interviewed her a set of four photographs that showed her with a black eye that she said Mr. Porter had given her. She followed with another email containing more photos of her swollen eye, which she said she suffered while the couple took a trip abroad.\n\nMr. Porter told his colleagues on Tuesday night that he had called one of his former wives an expletive on their honeymoon, but he insisted that he was not physical. The bruised eye that one wife had on another trip, he told colleagues, came not from his hand but after he tried to keep her from throwing a piece of Italian glass to the ground, and she fell and hurt herself.\n\nRob Cromwell, a former senior F.B.I. agent who oversaw all background investigations for the bureau, including those at the White House, said it would be highly unusual for the agency not to have informed the White House of such allegations.\n\n\u201cA serious allegation like that?

For years, legal migration was such a force that little towns here were given nicknames like Little Norway and Little Britain, for where their people had gone.\n\nHomes here hint at the mass migration. Tidy mud-brick village houses, surrounded by wheat and rice fields, have been increasingly replaced by mansions with gaudy ironwork and colorful tiles, built with money from overseas relatives.

Some of the men\u2019s last messages relayed the horror of being captive and beaten while others around them were tortured. Pressed for money, their families begged the smuggler in Gujrat to help and eventually came up with $1,000 more to secure the men\u2019s journey onward.\n\nThis new path through Libya should get more scrutiny, said Mohsin Waheed Butt, an officer with the Pakistani Federal Intelligence Agency. \u201cImmigration officers, they need to inquire why people are going to Libya,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat kind of a person is going to Libya right now?

She needs her parents to consent to that, and they can refuse.\n\nThe 17-year-old can consent to her infant\u2019s hearing testing, vaccines and anything else the baby might need. But she cannot consent to a long-acting, reversible contraceptive \u2014 such as an IUD or an arm implant \u2014 to prevent her from getting pregnant again. Once again, she needs her parents\u2019 permission, and if her parents aren\u2019t around, she\u2019s out of luck.\n\nAccording to a report released this month by the Guttmacher Institute, 24 states do not explicitly give all minors the right to receive contraceptives without their parents\u2019 permission. Minors in 11 states still do not have the right to consent to contraception even after giving birth. There are situations where a minor can consent \u2014 if married, legally emancipated or on active military duty, or after a sexual assault by a family member \u2014 but these apply to only a small minority of teenage mothers.\n\nFor many years now Americans have been celebrating the decline in teenage pregnancy rates.

He and his colleagues also treated six other teenagers, some of whom were in the emergency room and others who were rolled off to operating theaters.\n\nThen, about an hour after the victims began pouring into Broward Health North hospital, word came that another patient was about to arrive. With distraught relatives and journalists converging on the hospital in Deerfield Beach, Fla., the medical staff now faced the challenge of treating the man accused of causing all the carnage.\n\n\u201cDealing with trauma patients, you\u2019re always going to have to deal with the bad guys, too,\u201d Dr. Nichiporenko said, recalling the myriad times when crime suspects and victims were in rooms next to one another. \u201cYou have to be professional and do your job.\u201d\n\nThis was a tragedy of rare magnitude: 17 killed at a high school just miles down the road.\n\nWhen President Trump visited wounded victims of the shooting at the hospital on Friday, he was not far from the room where the suspect in the attack, Nikolas Cruz, was treated two days earlier.\n\nAs the frequency of mass shootings rises, the arrival of a captured gunman in a hospital remains unusual \u2014 studies show the majority die at the time of the crime. Many commit suicide, as did the Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock. Some are killed by those trying to stop them: A police shootout ended the slaughter by Omar Mateen at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla., in 2016.\n\nOccasionally, however, the very medical staff tending to victims of a mass shooting are called on to treat the suspect.\n\nThat happened in November 2009 in Fort Hood, Tex., after Maj. Nidal Hasan opened fire. He took aim at a 23-year-old Army medic, Specialist Francisco De la Serna, and missed. Specialist De la Serna, who stanched the bleeding of many of Major Hasan\u2019s victims, also applied a dressing to the gunman\u2019s chest wound after he exchanged fire with the police. Major Hasan, himself a doctor, was then transported to a hospital where his victims were being treated. \u201cIt was the right thing to do,\u201d said Mr. De la Serna, who was later honored for his bravery and is now a medical student at the University of Kansas. \u201cIt was the opposite,\u201d he added, \u201cof what somebody of that mind-set would have done.\u201d\n\nImage Nikolas Cruz Credit Broward's Sheriff's Office\n\nAs of Monday, two survivors of the shooting last week at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High remained hospitalized in fair condition at Broward Health North, and two others remained in fair condition at Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, according to Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the health system.\n\nIn all, 17 patients from the attack were treated at three of the system\u2019s hospitals. The teacher and student pronounced dead after reaching Broward Health North were the only shooting victims who died in those hospitals. Others were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe patients who arrived at Broward Health North had gunshot wounds mainly in their chests and abdomens, Dr. Nichiporenko said. They seemed pale and quiet as they were carried in, which can be an ominous sign of major bleeding.\n\n\u201cI think they were all in stress and emotionally shocked,\u201d Dr. Nichiporenko said. \u201cNobody was screaming.\u201d\n\nThey were \u201c14-, 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds,\u201d Dr. Nichiporenko said, though the level-two trauma center is not specifically designated for children under 16. \u201cWe\u2019re all trained to take care of pediatric patients if we need to treat them and stabilize them,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the call came about the suspect\u2019s arrival, the hospital staff made arrangements to treat him. \u201cThey called in with a gunshot wound,\u201d Dr. Nichiporenko said. \u201cHe stated that he was shot, so everybody thought he was injured.\u201d\n\nA team of four was assigned to treat Mr. Cruz in the emergency room \u2014 two nurses and two doctors, including Dr. Nichiporenko, the hospital\u2019s trauma director, who trained as a trauma surgeon at St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center in New York and hails from Moscow.\n\n\u201cWe just picked people we know can stay cool,\u201d Dr. Nichiporenko said. \u201cWe chose the ones who wouldn\u2019t get emotional about it.\u201d The hospital had already been locked down \u2014 its entrances, exits and trauma rooms were guarded by security staff.", "title": "Treating the Victims, and the Teenager Accused of Gunning Them Down", "authors": []}

While Bouchard reached the top five at the end of a breakout 2014 season in which she reached the final at Wimbledon and the semifinals at the Australian Open and French Open, her form dipped significantly in 2015.

As a child Follett had been enormously precocious, publishing an acclaimed novel at 12; two years later, her beloved father abandoned her mother for a younger woman. Smith expertly traces the impact of this separation: \u201cBarbara developed some cynical ideas about marriage. It was the antithesis of freedom, and freedom mattered most.\u201d But Follett did go on to marry, and in the course of this memoir, Smith gets married too.\n\nSmith is skillful and sensitive in teasing apart the complexities of Follett\u2019s life \u2014 this tension between freedom and the longing for love \u2014 but her insight falters somewhat in the book\u2019s memoir sections. Married at 25, Smith resents the \u201ctotal lack of spontaneity\u201d in her new life, and begins making a series of increasingly drastic decisions to shake things up. Like anyone, she fears monotony, but this hardly seems to account for such extreme, almost self-destructive restlessness. Describing the unfulfilling existence she most dreads, Smith writes: \u201cAt night I would fold laundry, organize drawers and closets, and pause to wonder when this had become my life.\u201d As worst-case scenarios go, the prospect of organizing a closet does not seem memorably terrifying. Smith is perhaps, at least in this book, a sharper analyst of others than of herself.\n\nMY LAST LOVE STORY\n\nBy Falguni Kothari\n\n293 pp. Graydon House. Paper, $15.99.\n\nPhoto\n\nKothari\u2019s novel plays out a dark fantasy. The narrator, Simeen, has a husband who is terminally ill. When an old friend moves in with the couple to help out, a flame is rekindled between wife and friend. In the hands of another novelist, the husband\u2019s illness could function as a simple narrative device, moving him offstage at the convenient moment and allowing Simeen\u2019s romance with their friend, Zayaan, to proceed blamelessly. But Kothari takes the story in an unexpected direction, forcing her characters to contemplate the idea of sustained romantic commitment outside the boundaries of monogamous love instead.\n\nAt one point, Simeen wonders why it\u2019s unacceptable \u201cfor three people to openly love each other.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting thought, one that poses a fresh conceptual question about marriage and love. But the power dynamics among the characters aren\u2019t sufficiently developed to dramatize that question convincingly. As for the status of her husband, Nirveen, in the triangle, Simeen says: \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Jump.\u2019 We\u2019d ask, \u2018How high?\u2019 He was dying. We were not. It was that simple.\u201d Was it?

A shooting that killed 20 first graders and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 came near the start of Mr. Murphy\u2019s time in office, and gun restrictions became a defining issue for him. The shooting deaths of over two dozen people at a church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., in November prompted Mr. Cornyn to be a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nAfter the Texas shooting, Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked the F.B.I. to conduct an extensive review of the database because, as he said in a statement at the time, \u201crelevant information may not be getting reported.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet on Monday, Mr. Murphy said that the bill alone would do little to stop the what he called an \u201cepidemic\u201d of violence.\n\nThe president, who has spoken favorably about gun rights over the years, has held wavering views on gun restrictions.

Aluminum companies including Alcoa, Rio Tinto Aluminum and Constellium issued statements urging the administration to exempt Canada, a major supplier of aluminum, from the rule, and focus on the issue of Chinese overcapacity instead.\n\nMr. Trump will have authority to determine which countries should be subject to any trade action, in part because of way in which the investigation was started. In April, the administration opened an investigation into steel and aluminum imports with a little-used provision of trade law that gives the president broad discretion to act to protect national security.\n\nDrastically remaking American trade has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s defining political promises. But his first year in office delivered a mixed record on trade. He withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade deal, and began renegotiating trade pacts with South Korea, Canada and Mexico. Those talks now look likely to take longer than he anticipated.\n\nThe administration is also weighing a series of trade cases this year that would protect American industries against imports. In January, the Trump administration decided to impose tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules to help domestic industries. It has also started an investigation into claims that China infringed on American intellectual property, which could result in investment restrictions or further tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration has said that its steel and aluminum investigation would help address a global issue created by China, which has used generous state subsidies to dominate the global metals trade. China now produces roughly half of the world\u2019s steel and aluminum, after making little two decades ago. That surge in production has helped push down global metal prices to a point where American companies say they can no longer compete.\n\nBut American options for aiming at China directly are limited. Because the United States has already imposed a raft of restrictions on Chinese steel in previous years, only 2 percent of American steel imports came directly from China in 2015.\n\nThat means that any measures from the Trump administration are likely to weigh more heavily on other countries, including some close allies. In 2016, Canada accounted for the largest proportion of United States steel imports, about 17 percent, followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, Turkey and Japan.\n\nAllies including the European Union, South Korea and Japan have also pushed back against the United States curbing imports, saying their products support the American military by providing a secure supply of metals, rather than harming it.", "title": "Trump Administration Proposes Stiff Penalties on Steel and Aluminum Imports", "authors": []}

The TV pundit Tucker Carlson, supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed cuts last year, called the arts spending \u201cwelfare for rich, liberal elites.\u201d\n\nThe truth is the National Endowment for the Arts is the exact opposite: It amplifies the voices of Americans who aren\u2019t the so-called coastal elite, or the aristocratic, or the advantaged. It seeks to diversify the stories we tell and the lives we see. This diversity can take many forms. It can be seen in racial difference and regional difference, in terms of gender and in terms of class.\n\nTake the case of a 32-year-old man who in March 1970 returned home to his wife and two kids from his day job, opened the evening paper and saw that he had won a few thousand dollars from the National Endowment for the Arts. The grant changed his life. This man had lived in red counties in blue states all over the Pacific Northwest, pumping gas, sweeping corridors, even picking tulips. His wife waited tables and sold book digests door-to-door. The arts grant was not much at all.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "At one level, none of this should be a surprise. The current infrastructure nonplan looks a lot like the sketchy proposal the Trump campaign laid out in 2016, back when he was still pretending to be a different kind of Republican, less committed to the party\u2019s economic orthodoxy. Even then he was claiming that he could do infrastructure on the cheap, that a relative pittance of federal money could somehow generate vast investment (although the mystery multiplier has gotten even bigger this time around).\n\nYet there is something puzzling about Trump\u2019s failure to come up with a remotely plausible infrastructure plan. After all, there would be major economic and political advantages to such a program.\n\nFirst, the economics: America desperately needs to repair and upgrade its deteriorating roads, water systems, power grid and more. True, we\u2019re no longer a depressed economy that needs public investment to put the unemployed back to work; massive infrastructure spending would have been an even better idea five years ago. But it\u2019s still something that needs doing.\n\nWhere would the money come from? Well, if you don\u2019t worry too much about deficits \u2014 and as we\u2019ve just seen, Republicans don\u2019t care at all about deficits as long as a Democrat isn\u2019t in the White House \u2014 we can just borrow it. Despite a modest rise in interest rates, the federal government can still borrow very cheaply: The interest rate on inflation-protected long-term bonds is still less than 1 percent, which is below realistic estimates of long-run economic growth, let alone the Trump administration\u2019s fantasy numbers. So borrowing now to pay for essential infrastructure would still be good economics.\n\nAnd as I said, there would be political advantages, too. If Trump just pushed ahead with a straightforward, conventional public investment plan, he could trumpet the number of workers employed on new projects. Furthermore, he could surely find a way to stick his name on many of those projects. Historically, many politicians have had what\u2019s known in the trade as an edifice complex \u2014 an urge to build big stuff to promote their personal brand and feed their vanity.

Last year, he signed off on a troop surge in Afghanistan and he permitted the Pentagon to loosen its rules of engagement that dictate how the armed forces can pursue targets in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump named the attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott Pruitt, who had sued the agency multiple times.\n\nMr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord and announced his intention to move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 moves most Republicans say other conservative presidents would likely have found too unsettling.\n\nBut if once-skeptical Republicans can find reasons in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies to look the other way on some of his personal shortcomings, there are also many who see little to like about his similarities with Mr. Bush, who turned budget surpluses into gaping deficits and helped spark the Republican backlash that became the Tea Party movement.\n\nMany activists have been ratcheting up the pressure. In response to Mr. Trump\u2019s signing the budget agreement and his embrace of a pathway to citizenship for younger immigrants brought here illegally as children, the Tea Party Patriots, one of the president\u2019s most reliable supporters, said conservative voters were not getting what they signed up for.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of frustration among a lot of people who supported President Trump from the very beginning of his campaign,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, the group\u2019s president. \u201cThey feel a bit betrayed and they don\u2019t feel like President Trump is keeping his promise.\u201d", "title": "Trump Edges Toward a Conventional Republican Approach, at Least on Policy", "authors": ["Jeremy W.

{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2006 and again in 2013, Republican moderates joined Democrats in the Senate to pass sweeping overhauls of the nation\u2019s immigration laws with a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, only to see the compromises torpedoed by a wave of angry activism in the conservative news media and grass roots.\n\nThis time, as senators again search for a way forward on immigration, a revolt from the right has so far failed to materialize, in large part because of the intransigence of a different player: a man in the White House who has mostly satisfied immigration hard-liners.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s gamble was risky. And at first his plan struck many conservatives as too generous because it would offer 1.8 million young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children the opportunity to become citizens. But by coupling his offer with demands to sharply reduce legal immigration \u2014 a trade-off many Democrats say they cannot accept \u2014 then threatening to veto anything that does not meet those demands, the president has made a bipartisan compromise exceedingly difficult.\n\nThat may have been the point, as it sits just fine with many on the right who never wanted a deal in the first place.", "title": "Trump Gets What He Wants in Immigration Debate: Quiet on the Right", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-02-01 00:00:00", "text": "Steven Gold, a sociologist at Michigan State University, emailed me:\n\nMany Democrats fear that extensive investments and political posturing made on behalf of immigrants will be regarded as of little value to a large swath of independent voters whose support Democrats need to increase their representation in Congress.\n\nIn a reference to the demonstrated electoral liabilities of so-called \u201cidentity politics,\u201d Gold argued that concerned Democrats worry that\n\nby emphasizing particularistic rather than practical issues with a broad impact, they will once again lose the politically advantageous position that appears to be taking shape for them in 2018 and 2020.\n\nMore bluntly, Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton, declared in an email responding to my inquiry:\n\nThe Democrats don\u2019t have a lot of good options other than to support it enough that it can pass with unified Republican support.\n\nMcCarty explained further:\n\nBlocking it would allow the Trump Administration to suggest that the Democrats were willing to trade Dreamers for \u201clottery\u201d and \u201cchain\u201d migration, as well as position them as soft on border security.\n\nAn advantage in accepting the Trump proposal, McCarty continued,\n\nis that border security appropriations and visa programs can be fixed if the Democrats regain control. The effects of Dreamer deportations and/or sending them back into the shadows is far less reversible.\n\nTrump and Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to the president, have clearly made this calculation and decided that they win either way. Take, for example, the following tweet from the president\u2019s account on Jan. 27:\n\nI have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it!\n\nRobert L. Borosage, president of the left-liberal Institute for America\u2019s Future, argued that Democrats should make every effort to get the immigration issue off center stage. \u201cIn my view,\u201d Borosage said in an email, \u201cTrump wins as long as we\u2019re arguing about this. So it would be good to get this done soon.\u201d\n\nBorosage went on:\n\nWhat should Democrats do? I\u2019d take the deal, after pushing for concessions on family unification and lottery system, and pushing against full commitment of $25 billion as an outrage.\n\nBruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, makes the case that political logic favors Democratic cooperation with Trump on immigration:\n\nIf the Democrats compromise on a few of the non-DACA items and the (Congressional) Republican position is no DACA relief, then the Republican position becomes untenable and looks as though are caving to their extreme nativist faction. And if the Democrats make their position a clean bill on DACA and no compromise on the other items, it hands the Republicans a perfect wedge item going into the 2018 election, possibly keeping them in control of both houses.\n\nIn fact, I found an unexpectedly high percentage of the experts I contacted \u2014 most of whom are sympathetic to the plight of immigrants \u2014 in general agreement that Democrats would be wise to come to some kind of an agreement with Trump.\n\nDaniel Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, noted, for example, that the public supports both \u201ca pathway to citizenship for Dreamers\u201d and \u201cenhanced border security.\u201d But, he warned,\n\nin today\u2019s political climate, it\u2019s very hard to imagine a deal that will placate both sides for long, as both parties seem to define winning in zero-sum terms.\n\nSo far at least, arguments in favor of cutting a deal are not selling with the Democratic leadership \u2014 although the leaders\u2019 position may be more of a bargaining tactic than a principled stance.\n\nChuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, tweeted on Jan. 26 that \u201cthis plan flies in the face of what most Americans believe,\u201d adding\n\nWhile @realDonaldTrump finally acknowledged that the Dreamers should be allowed to stay here and become citizens, he uses them as a tool to tear apart our legal immigration system and adopt the wish list that anti-immigration hard-liners have advocated for years.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, was more outspoken. In a Jan. 26 statement that received wide press coverage, she described Trump\u2019s proposal as \u201cpart of the Trump Administration\u2019s unmistakable campaign to make America white again.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump reiterated his immigration proposals in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Pelosi stood firm in her opposition:\n\nThe president represents himself as generous towards Dreamers, but he is holding them hostage with the most extreme anti-immigrant agenda in generations. We heard more insulting words of ignorance and prejudice towards patriotic immigrant families last night.\n\nIn a detailed critique of the Trump proposal, William Frey, a demographic specialist at Brookings, argued that\n\nthe so-called compromise between DACA and border security is extremely disproportional \u2014 weighted heavily toward the latter which is characterized by simple bumper sticker messages about family migration, border security and the visa lottery that is aimed at appealing to the extreme anti-immigrant wings of Trump\u2019s Republican base.\n\nFrey wrote in his email that he could\n\nnot imagine Democratic senators or congressmen agreeing to anything close to this plan \u2014 in light of their base which not only includes Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other minorities \u2014 but also rising support in recent state and local elections they have received from suburban college graduate women and millennials.\n\nNonetheless, in a Washington Post op-ed published in 2015, Frey pointed out that\n\nDemocrats cannot make the politics of fear go away simply by courting the young-adult and minority voting blocs. While it is true that the supersize turnout and support of those groups helped elect President Obama twice, the white portion of the electorate, which votes strongly Republican, underperformed in support of John McCain in 2008, and white turnout was down in 2012.\n\nThere is, Frey continued, \u201ca sharp lag in diversity between the overall population and the portion that turns out on Election Day.\u201d It is \u201cthe older electorate \u2014 those most greatly fearing change,\u201d he wrote,\n\nthat will be gaining as baby boomers continue to age. By my calculation, the number of (mostly white) eligible voters over age 45 will be 26 percent larger in 2024 than those under age 45. This disparity will be further widened by the higher turnout of older white voters, who may not determine future elections but will continue to have a strong voice.\n\nWhen I asked him if there was a disparity between his recent comment to me and the Post op-ed, Frey wrote back:\n\nI stand by the fact that the politics of fear (to older non-college whites) can work to some extent. But I also think white women, especially college graduate white women, can help to mute the impact on the immigration issue because of their disdain for Trump. If Dems are looking at 2018, it\u2019s not just the immigration issue that is important to those women but Trump\u2019s stance on women\u2019s issues in general \u2014 critical of planned parenthood, abortion, his support of Roy Moore in Alabama, his disdain for political correctness and his overall boorishness may counter whatever gains he may get, on immigration, from older white non-college men and women (and even the latter support may be more tenuous). Another group is millennials, now strongly anti-Trump, who could be motivated to turn out in greater numbers. In short, the base that will respond to Trump playing the \u201cimmigration card\u201d may be dwindling in light of his other positions and demeanor since in office \u2014 including his handling of the Russian investigation. I think the Democrats are counting on that.\n\nIt may seem surprising now, but the Pew Research Center found that from 1994 to 2006 there was very little difference between the views of Republican and Democratic voters on immigration. Since that time they have diverged sharply.\n\nIn response to the question, \u201cWhich comes closer to your view, \u2018immigrants today strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents,\u2019 or \u2018immigrants today burden the country by taking jobs, housing and health care\u2019?\u201d there was almost no difference in the responses of Democrats and Republicans in 2006.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Has Got Democrats Right Where He Wants Them", "authors": []}

Alas, they both fell before the anti-immigration furor of the Trump administration. But then President Trump\u2019s own hard-line immigration bill fell much harder, leaving the fate of the so-called Dreamers in limbo.\n\nThe compromise measures would have resolved the fate of the Dreamers, the 1.8 million immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children and whose plight has generated broad sympathy. One bill written by a bipartisan group of senators calling itself the Common Sense Coalition would also have given Mr. Trump money for his much-ballyhooed wall along the Mexican border, though over a 10-year period, while putting off more contentious questions about immigration.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Trump is not interested in resolving a difficult problem if he can exploit it for political gain. After threatening to veto any measure that didn\u2019t include his tough demands, and getting Department of Homeland Security officials to bad-mouth the compromise measures, the president succeeded in getting most Republicans to vote against them, leaving both short of the 60 votes they needed, one by eight votes and one by six.\n\nMinutes later, the Senate even more decisively beat the White House\u2019s own proposal, which would have provided a path to citizenship for the Dreamers while also severely limiting family-based immigration and ending the diversity visa lottery program.

Ryan, the vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, said that if the funds were truly Mr. Cohen\u2019s, the payment was an excessive contribution, and if not, \u201cwe still need an investigation to figure out whose money this was.\u201d\n\nIf the commission dismisses the complaint without an investigation, he said, the group is considering filing a lawsuit against the agency or against the Trump campaign.\n\nAnother set of potential issues raised by Mr. Cohen\u2019s admission centers on legal ethics. As a New York lawyer, he is subject to rules of professional conduct in that state and could face disciplinary action \u2014 ranging from private admonishment to losing his license to practice law \u2014 if he violated them, although the still-uncertain details make it impossible to precisely identify which standards apply.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the facts,\u201d said Philip Schrag, a Georgetown University law professor and specialist in legal ethics issues. \u201cThere is an awful lot of speculation here about the facts, which we need before we can go into the legal analysis.\u201d\n\nDepending on what the circumstances turn out to be, he and other ethics specialists pointed to Rule 1.8, which governs financial arrangements between a lawyer and a client. One provision generally prohibits lawyers from lending money to clients during contemplated or pending litigation, although Ms. Clifford appears to have been threatening to talk \u2014 not to sue.\n\nAnother provision requires a written and signed agreement if there is a loan between a lawyer and a client. If it turns out that the arrangement was envisioned as a loan that Mr. Trump would eventually repay, Mr. Cohen was obliged to create such a document.\n\nBut if Mr. Cohen intended to make a gift to Mr. Trump by paying off Ms. Clifford without expecting any reimbursement, then no written agreement was required, the specialists said. Nor would the rule have required a document if some third party, like one of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy associates, had reimbursed Mr. Cohen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast month, Mr. Cohen sent Wall Street Journal reporters a written statement in Ms. Clifford\u2019s name denying that she had had \u201ca sexual and/or romantic affair\u201d with Mr. Trump or \u201creceived hush money from Mr. Trump.\u201d He also issued his own statement saying that Mr. Trump \u201cvehemently denies\u201d any affair with her.\n\nIf evidence emerged showing that those statements were false and that Mr. Cohen knew they were false, his role in disseminating them could violate Rule 8.4, several legal ethics specialists said. It prohibits lawyers from engaging \u201cin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawyers are not allowed to lie,\u201d with some exceptions, said Lisa Lerman, a legal ethics professor at the Catholic University of America, and they are \u201calso not allowed to induce other people to engage in conduct that they are prohibited from.\u201d\n\nBut Stephen Gillers, a New York University professor of ethics law, said that in practice, the ethics rule against dishonesty is generally not interpreted so broadly as to cover facilitating a lie to the public or to journalists.\n\nStill, Mr. Gillers said that Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cexplanation is sufficiently improbable to spark a disciplinary committee investigation.\u201d Anyone can file a complaint asking the committee to investigate him, or it can open a file on its own, he said, cautioning that it works slowly and that its proceedings are secret unless they result in public discipline.\n\n\u201cThe committee has the jurisdiction to get to the bottom of it if it wishes to do so.\u201d", "title": "Trump Lawyer\u2019s Payment to Porn Star Raises New Questions", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Charlie Savage"]}
{"date": "2018-02-27 00:00:00", "text": "Those two facts go a long way toward explaining why there were so many Democratic-friendly analyses of voting demographics and polls over the last decade. The exit polling made it seem as if the Republicans, in a diversifying country, could not win with big gains among older, white working-class voters.\n\nAnd if the exit polls overestimate Republican vote share among various demographic groups, then pre-election national polls will seem to show Democrats doing well, since they\u2019re weighted by education and aren\u2019t adjusted to match a result. The exit poll tendency to overestimate Republican vote share will also tend to obscure Republican strength in pre-election polls, like Mr. Trump\u2019s big gains among white voters without a college degree.\n\nOver the last year or so, national media organizations have made a concerted effort to cover those white working-class voters. Some have argued that those efforts have gone too far. But so far there has been little or no movement to better represent white working-class voters in public political data and analysis. Only a handful of state pollsters have begun to weight by education, and the exit polls have not announced any methodological changes intended to remedy these issues either.\n\nThe consequences can be significant. For better or worse, lawmakers and campaigns make policy decisions based on political calculations, and the exit polls play a huge role in shaping how people judge the landscape of American electoral politics. Even Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity briefly supported comprehensive immigration reform in November 2012, after the exit polls made it seem as though Hispanic voters, not white working-class Midwesterners, decided the election in President Obama\u2019s favor.\n\nOne way to avoid the issue: retire the use of the exit polls in post-election analysis, and make apples-to-apples comparisons between current and older pre-election polls. The most important trends of the 2016 election were more apparent using this approach, including Mr. Trump\u2019s strength among white working-class voters. And today, it would make President Trump seem more resilient among well-educated white voters.", "title": "Trump Losing College-Educated Whites? He Never Won Them in the First Place", "authors": []}

Standards for making and revoking rules are frequently changing, and courts and Congress can tweak and review them as well. But available metrics indicate that Mr. Trump is wrong to claim he has already stopped or eliminated more federal rules than any other president.\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs says it withdrew 635 rules in 2017 \u2014 a fast pace over a one-year period by any measure. But that is not more than any previous presidency \u2014 Mr. Obama withdrew 1,814 federal rules during his eight-year term and Mr. Bush eliminated 2,813 while in office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Program for Economic Research on Regulation, at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., combs the Federal Register to quantify the number of rule-making actions by regulatory agencies. University researchers found that federal regulations actually grew by about 0.65 percent during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office. They also noted that the rate of growth was slower than what it was annually from 1970 to 2016, when it averaged about 2.1 percent.\n\nExperts said that Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to cut through the bureaucracy fall far short of the structural changes made under Ronald Reagan, who abolished entire regulatory agencies and eliminated some economic regulations in the transportation, telecommunications and energy industries. \u201cNothing Trump has done to date compares to that in terms of impact on Americans,\u201d Ms. Dudley said.\n\nCary Coglianese, the director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, agreed that \u201ca lot of the key institutions\u2019 processes that we have today, dealing with regulation, were established by Reagan.\u201d He pointed to the 1981 enactment of cost-benefit analyses and legal challenges to Mr. Reagan\u2019s deregulation policies that set current standards for administrative law, which govern how federal, state and local agencies operate.\n\nDeregulatory Successes and a Word of Caution\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hyperbole not withstanding, he can claim some deregulatory successes.\n\nPrevious reports in The New York Times have detailed the Trump administration\u2019s lax enforcement of certain rules across several agencies. Early in his administration, Mr. Trump rolled back Obama-era rules though an unprecedented use of the 1996 Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to \u201cdisapprove\u201d regulations issued within 90 days with the help of the president.\n\nDan Goldbeck of the American Action Forum, a nonprofit conservative group that promotes smaller government, said he sees a more concerted effort to streamline and trim back regulations under Mr. Trump than under many previous administrations.\n\nThe pace of consideration for significant regulations also has slowed. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs reviewed 60 rules that were described as economically significant between Jan. 21, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2018. The last time so few federal rules were reviewed in one-year was 1984, under Mr. Reagan.\n\nRegulations, Going Forward\n\nThe federal regulatory system will continue to evolve throughout \u2014 and beyond \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s time in office. So will his own approach, experts said.\n\nSo far in the 2018 fiscal year, the administration has shifted its deregulation efforts toward making substantive changes through the regular rule-making process, Mr. Goldbeck said. As evidence, he pointed to a new rule to amend the federal meat inspection process that the Department of Agriculture estimates could save millions of dollars annually, according to a department estimate. \u201cBut expect to see a delay\u201d in how much fruit these efforts will bear Mr. Goldbeck said. \u201cThat\u2019s just nature of the process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Mr. Trump has reversed at least one of his own decisions, backtracking on his waiver to regulate state government drug-testing rules.\n\nAdditionally, there is no guarantee that regulations that have been waived will survive legal challenges, nor that they will remain in place in future presidential administrations. Once agencies complete the rule-making process, Ms. Dudley said, \u201cthey will likely have to defend their deregulatory action in court, where they may or may not succeed.\u201d Congress also could later decide to reverse Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cRegulatory change is not forever.

{"date": "2018-02-02 00:00:00", "text": "The number of illegal immigrants who would eventually qualify for an amnesty, whether they are Dreamers or not, will probably be much larger than current estimates suggest. Back in 1986, one provision of the Immigration Reform and Control Act was expected to grant amnesty to 400,000 farm workers. In fact, 1.1 million applied. When California granted illegal immigrants the opportunity to get a driver\u2019s license in 2013, Department of Motor Vehicles offices were swamped, with illegal immigrants coming in at twice the expected rate.\n\nAny attempt at limiting chain migration creates a new problem. There is a waiting list of about 3.9 million chain-migration applicants, and many have waited years for the golden ticket. Amazingly enough, some potential immigrants from the Philippines have been waiting since Oct. 1, 1994. Many people will think that we need to grandfather in those applicants. But that would require temporary rules that might allow, say, 400,000 immigrants per year until the queue was cleared out.\n\nWe should also be skeptical of claims that an amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, many of whom have little schooling, or even just to the Dreamers, who typically have a high school diploma, will be an economic boon. The amnesty is going to be expensive. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the net cost of granting amnesty to the Dreamers (the additional expenses minus the taxes they pay) would run to $25 billion over the next 10 years. An amnesty will be far costlier if it is extended to the entire illegal population, which is less skilled on average.\n\nSo the first step in any deal will be \u2014 must be \u2014 securing the border. A deal where enforcement is the first priority ensures that illegal immigration will be greatly curtailed, and this provision alone may well be worth its weight in gold. Past administrations, both Democratic and Republican, looked the other way as illegal immigration graduated from a relatively minor problem (the 1986 immigration act granted amnesty to fewer than three million illegal immigrants) into a major distortion of the immigration system.\n\nA sensible immigration policy that generates economic benefits for Americans and for immigrants already here ensures that we can better adapt to the economic shocks that will visit us in the next few decades. And the best way to maximize those benefits is to filter the pool of persons who want to migrate.\n\nBefore jumping in to claim that such \u201cfiltering\u201d is un-American, it\u2019s worth remembering that anything short of open borders inevitably involves filtering. Between the 1920s and 1965, the filtering was done through national origin, giving preference to immigrants born in Western European countries. Since 1965, we have preferred immigrants who have relatives already living here. Filtering on the basis of economic potential ensures that immigration generates the largest possible economic gain for our country.\n\nThere is some concern that whatever deal the Trump administration reaches will be easily undone by the next administration. I\u2019m not so sure this is a valid point. History teaches us that it is extremely difficult to change immigration policy. The stars aligned only twice in the past century: once in the 1920s and then again in the 1960s.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Sets Up a Grand Bargain on Immigration", "authors": []}

We go into this cleareyed that this is going to be quite a challenging election.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans have a significant structural advantage as they try to protect their one-seat majority in November: They are defending just eight seats, while Democrats have to protect 26, including those of two independents who caucus with them. Of the seats Democrats are trying to retain, 10 are in states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016.\n\nAnd after struggling to woo top-tier candidates in some states, Republicans are starting to find more success as they receive a lift from the tax overhaul they passed in December. In addition to Mr. Romney, Representative Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, after heavy lobbying by Mr. McConnell and Mr. Trump, reversed himself and said on Friday that he would challenge Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat seeking re-election in a state that the president won by 36 points.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvisers to Gov.

Party leaders fear that a candidacy by Mr. McDaniel could create a competitive race, and perhaps even spiral into a debacle similar to what happened in Alabama last year, when Roy S.

Republicans close to Mr. Cochran, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, say that while he is not ruling out stepping down this year, he will not contemplate quitting until Congress finishes its 2018 spending bill next month.\n\nMore broadly, Mr. McConnell said he was open to intervening in some party primary contests, as he did in the Tea Party era, but would do so on a state-by-state basis.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe made clear he was supporting Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, who is running against a pair of immigration hawks to replace Senator Jeff Flake. And he said he did not want to see Don Blankenship, the former coal mine owner imprisoned for violating federal mine safety standards, become the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia.\n\nMr. McConnell harshly criticized a series of red-state Democrats, but took repeated aim at Mr. Manchin, with whom he has tangled in the past and is plainly eager to beat in a state that has otherwise embraced the Republican Party.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cJoe thinks he can just kind of talk his way through all of this, but talk is really cheap when your record doesn\u2019t meet the rhetoric,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, noting Mr. Manchin\u2019s opposition to a series of Republican measures, including the tax bill.\n\nMr. McConnell acknowledged that some of his candidates were struggling to raise money \u2014 \u201cI concede the fund-raising problem,\u201d he said. But he said it was largely the result of having to face so many incumbents, who are typically better able to draw donors.\n\nStill, he said that a Supreme Court case, scheduled to be argued on Feb. 26, that is expected to curb the ability of public sector unions to automatically deduct dues from their members could have an impact on Democratic fund-raising.\n\nHe called the case \u201can example\u201d of why he had found it so important to block former President Barack Obama from replacing Antonin Scalia on the court after his death in 2016, a move that Democrats remain bitter about.\n\nAnd, without being prompted, Mr. McConnell said he hoped that the court would broadly address what he described as the left\u2019s effort to outlaw gerrymandering.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think the founding fathers had in mind when they gave it to the state legislatures?\u201d he said of redistricting powers. \u201cThey thought it was going to be a political exercise.\u201d\n\nWhile eager to trumpet the tax measure, Mr. McConnell said that \u201cthe single best thing we\u2019ve done, in conjunction with the administration, are the court appointments,\u201d including that of Neil M.

But she suggested that she would not stand in the way of lawmakers who wanted to vote their conscience.\n\nPressing the issue further, Ms. Pelosi and the next two highest-ranking House Democrats sent a letter to Mr. Ryan noting their desire for the government to remain open and imploring him to make a public statement about the scheduling of a vote on legislation to protect young undocumented immigrants who are now shielded from deportation by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMost of our members believe the budget agreement is a reasonable compromise to address America\u2019s military strength and critical domestic priorities, like fighting the opioid crisis, boosting N.I.H., moving forward to resolve the pension crisis, caring for our veterans, making college more affordable and investing in child care for working families,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe are writing to again reiterate our request that you make a public statement regarding the scheduling of a vote on a DACA bill.\u201d\n\nThe run-up to the House vote, when passage was no foregone conclusion, highlighted the divisions within the Democratic caucus over how hard to push on the issue of immigration as Congress prepares to turn its focus to that politically volatile subject.\n\nThe text of the deal, stretching more than 600 pages, was released late Wednesday night, revealing provisions large and small that would go far beyond the basic budget numbers.

Once the budget deal has been approved, he said, \u201cwe will focus on bringing that debate to this floor and finding a solution.\u201d\n\nThe fate of the Dreamers has been in question since Mr. Trump moved in September to end DACA. The president gave Congress six months to come up with a solution to resolve their fate.\n\nIn recent months, Democrats have tried to make use of the leverage they have in fiscal negotiations, and the issue of immigration played a central role in last month\u2019s shutdown.

But in the months that followed, little information emerged about the investigations. In September, the commerce secretary Wilbur L. Ross Jr., said that a decision on the steel measure would be delayed until after Congress approved a new tax law, because the administration did not want to \u201cunnecessarily irritate\u201d lawmakers.\n\nThe Commerce Department formally submitted the results of its investigations into steel and aluminum imports to the White House in January.

Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, thanked Mr. Trump for recent tariffs imposed to protect American manufacturers of washing machines, and urged tough measures on steel imports.\n\nMr. Brown said he was hopeful that the administration\u2019s renegotiation of Nafta would succeed, noting that if it was written in a way that supports workers, \u201cwe can deliver Democrat support.\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, urged the president to include \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions in his infrastructure plan, and asked the administration to publicly release reports that the Commerce Department had submitted last month to the White House.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a chance to see the analysis done by the secretary in order to make thoughtful recommendations,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s support for the steel measure, he gave no indication of potential timing, Mr. Wyden added. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel that a decision had been made.\u201d", "title": "Trump Tells Lawmakers He\u2019s Mulling Limits on Imported Steel", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

The last time that the United States imposed these kinds of tariffs, on steel imports under President George W.

On Oct. 7, his administration formally accused Russia of stealing and leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and a range of other institutions and individuals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama, his former aides said, had hoped that the announcement, by the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., and the Department of Homeland Security, would follow a bipartisan statement by congressional leaders about the need for state and local authorities to guard their voter-registration and balloting machines from Russian hacking.\n\nThe White House provided an intelligence briefing to the lawmakers, including Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader. But Mr. McConnell, two former officials said, refused to back a statement publicly challenging Russia and told Mr. Obama that he would view an effort by the White House to do that as partisan.\n\nDon Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, said that the White House asked him to sign a letter warning about the threat of cyberattacks, and that he did so. But that letter did not name Russia and only spoke generally about the threat to the electoral process.\n\nOther Republican senators faulted the Obama administration on Tuesday for failing to warn officials in 21 states where intelligence agencies had detected efforts by the Russians to probe voting machines that they were at risk of being infiltrated. In some cases, officials in those states were not cleared to be briefed on the intelligence.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned that the Obama administration did so little,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. She added, referring to the F.B.I. director at the time, \u201cThey were aware \u2014 the intelligence community leaders were fully aware, whether it was Jim Clapper or James Comey, that the Russians were attempting to interfere in our elections \u2014 and they put out that brief statement before the election.\u201d\n\nSenator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, said that even after Mr. Obama formally named Russia, the administration declined to declassify information related to meddling by the Kremlin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure why they continued to sit on that information,\u201d he said.\n\nSome former administration officials said they pushed for the United States to take pre-emptive or deterrent measures against Russia in the summer of 2016. But the White House was reluctant, in part because the intelligence agencies still had not reached a consensus about who was responsible for the hacking. There were also concerns about Russia retaliating and whether the United States should use similar tactics.\n\nLooming over all this was Mr. Obama\u2019s worry that if he spoke out strongly, he would be viewed as trying to tilt the vote.\n\n\u201cHe really did feel, in September and October of an election year, as the head of the Democratic Party, that his role in adjudicating the information Americans received should be limited,\u201d Mr. Rhodes said. \u201cIf he had ratcheted up that rhetoric, we would have seen exactly what we see today.

{"date": "2018-02-13 00:00:00", "text": "After a long campaign by free-speech organizations, the British libel law was finally amended five years ago. The 2013 Defamation Act introduced a new defense of \u201chonest opinion.\u201d It insisted that a libel claimant had to show that he or she had suffered \u201cserious harm\u201d and required all claimants to demonstrate that Britain was the most appropriate place in which to bring the claim.\n\nIt was an improvement on the previous law, but still hugely restrictive. The defendant, for instance, if using a defense of \u201ctruth,\u201d is still required to prove that his or her statement was true.\n\nShortly after the Defamation Act became law, Cambridge University Press declined to publish \u201cPutin\u2019s Kleptocracy,\u201d a book by the American academic Karen Dawisha. The publisher wrote in a letter to the author that while there was \u201cno reason to doubt the veracity of what you say,\u201d Mr. Putin and others \u201cwould be motivated to sue and could afford to do so.\u201d And even if the publisher were \u201csuccessful in defending such a lawsuit, the disruption and expense would be more than we could afford.\u201d\n\nThis is the sort of law Mr. Trump would like to impose on the United States. The American view of free speech is different from the British. The First Amendment frames the American debate and constrains those who would assault freedom of expression.\n\nIf Mr. Trump were to try to change libel laws, he would most likely have to face down opposition both from Congress and from the judiciary, all the way up to the Supreme Court. However much he may wish to possess British-style powers to silence his critics, Mr. Trump would find it difficult to achieve his aims.\n\nAnd yet, the First Amendment is not as strong a shield as many assume it to be. Throughout its history, politicians and judges have sought to restrict its scope for political reasons. When, in 1917, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes coined the famous line \u201cThe most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic,\u201d he did so to insist that to distribute antiwar leaflets to conscripts was just like \u201cfalsely shouting fire in a theater.\u201d\n\nIn 1951, the Supreme Court upheld the imprisoning of 11 United States Communist Party organizers, who were tried and convicted under the Smith Act, which prohibited conspiring to advocate or advocating the violent overthrow of the government. One of the two dissenting judges, Hugo Black, observed that courts should not be \u201csuppressing freedom of speech\u201d on the basis of \u201cour own notions of \u2026 \u2018reasonableness.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat is precisely what those who possess power \u2014 whether the state or influential individuals \u2014 have long sought to do. The United States does not need Britain\u2019s libel laws. All of us need the First Amendment \u2014 to its fullest extent.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Wants British Libel Laws.

And it would be expensive, costing millions of dollars and most likely tearing up Washington\u2019s streets. Does that make sense when the Pentagon is complaining that its $700 billion annual budget is inadequate, Congress is cutting vital programs, the State Department is being eviscerated and a Republican tax cut for the wealthy has added billions of dollars to the deficit?\n\nThe United States used to regularly hold national military parades, generally to mark military victories. They took place after the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Most recently, the first President George Bush presided as 8,800 troops, with weapons, marched through Washington after the 1991 Persian Gulf war ended. But after American combat troops were withdrawn from Iraq in 2011, the Pentagon declined a ticker-tape parade in New York for gulf war veterans, saying it would not be proper while Americans were still fighting in Afghanistan.\n\nSo what would be the purpose of organizing such a parade today, with Americans still fighting in Afghanistan and again in Iraq? The White House says Mr. Trump wants to support \u201cAmerica\u2019s great service members who risk their lives every day.\u201d Yet, especially since 9/11, most Americans have been acutely aware of, and overtly appreciative of, the service of military troops and emergency medical workers, who are regularly recognized at public events and in public speeches.\n\nMr. Trump, who dodged the Vietnam War with five deferments, has developed an unusual reliance on the military. His defense secretary and chief of staff are retired generals, and his national security adviser, another general, is still on active duty. The president is doing everything he can to make the Pentagon his prime instrument of national security policy by promising \u201cone of the greatest military buildups in history,\u201d expanding the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal and issuing threats to use military force.\n\nMr. Trump is trying to exploit the armed forces as a political prop, even as he daily undermines the country\u2019s other real and enduring strengths, including an independent judiciary and a free press. During the Cold War, such military spectacles were a hallmark of the Soviets. Today, North Korea regularly stages its own robotic displays of military power in an effort to intimidate adversaries.\n\nTo defend itself and its allies, the United States must have a strong military. Yet what Americans and the world need from Mr. Trump is not martial pageantry, but a demonstration that he understands that national strength relies on much more than military power.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Wants a Big Parade.

There\u2019s a difference between the Twitter and the Teleprompter version of Trump policy.\u201d\n\nIn any case, only about 1 percent of the United States federal budget goes to foreign aid \u2014 and about 40 percent of that is considered security assistance, rather than economic or humanitarian aid.\n\nAmericans nonetheless remain convinced that the country spends far more. In a 2015 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average respondent thought that 26 percent of the federal budget went to foreign aid. More than half the respondents thought the United States was spending too much on foreign aid.\n\nEven if the amounts of American aid are relatively small, the payoff can be substantial in leverage for the United States, in enhancing its image and promoting its values, others noted. That is changing.\n\nMr. Trump, in his speech, referred to the many countries that voted disapproval of his decision to eventually move the American Embassy in Israel to disputed Jerusalem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Thursday, his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, told Republican legislators that she was \u201ctaking names\u2019\u2019 at the body, adding: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how helpful it is to have a Congress that backs us up. When y\u2019all play the heavy, it makes it so much easier for me to play the bad cop with a smile.\u201d\n\nBeyond retribution, however, Mr. Trump has also made a theme of \u201cAmerica First,\u201d proclaiming his dislike of programs like democracy promotion and generic humanitarian aid.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Trump thinks it\u2019s different, but in practical terms the U.S. has always been giving aid based on U.S. interests and needs,\u201d said Xenia Wickett, a former United States official who runs the Americas program at Chatham House, the foreign affairs research institution.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changing is the view of American soft power,\u201d she added. \u201cWith Jerusalem and the State of the Union, there is a view that America is no longer doing the right thing and no longer for the right reasons. Its self-interest is explicit, as if it doesn\u2019t care, so those who gave Americans the benefit of the doubt no longer do so, and it does damage.\u201d\n\nMarc Otte, the former European Union special representative for the Middle East peace process and a senior fellow at the Egmont Institute, Belgium\u2019s Royal Institute for International Relations, said that cutting American aid reduces, not enhances, American influence.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But because the economy is so large, Americans still provide more foreign aid in total than any other country, and aid cuts do cause disruptions.\n\nEven before the United Nations vote in December against the American decision on Jerusalem, Mr. Trump said he wanted to cut the Obama administration\u2019s spending on foreign aid, about $42.4 billion, to $27.3 billion, and fold the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department.\n\nAnd he warned that he would withhold \u201cbillions\u201d from countries that voted against him. \u201cLet them vote against us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll save a lot.

Pressed by Norway, the European Union held an emergency session last week to seek faster contributions to the refugee agency.\n\nEven the Israeli government has quietly criticized the cut to the agency, which provides much of the schooling and health care in Gaza and the West Bank, meaning that Israel, considered by most of the world as an occupying power, is not under obligation to do so.\n\nMr. Bildt suggested that the Europeans should not contribute more, but let Israel cope with the fallout of the aid cut. Noting that Israel was lobbying in Washington against the cutbacks, he asked: \u201cWhy should we jump in there? If it collapses, it is the responsibility of the occupying country, Israel, which should pay the costs of its occupation.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has also suspended aid to Pakistan over its ties to the Taliban, and that is a more popular act, said Ian Lesser, a former American official who runs the German Marshall Fund office here.\n\n\u201cOn Egypt and especially Pakistan,\u201d which receive large amounts of United States aid, \u201ca lot of the foreign policy establishment will agree,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pent-up dissatisfaction with countries that have not been helpful.\n\n\u201cWith some key countries,\u201d he added, \u201cit could be that Trump\u2019s assertiveness comes together with this pent-up frustration to produce change.\u201d", "title": "Trump Wants to Aid Only \u2018America\u2019s Friends.\u2019 If Only It Were That Easy.", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"]}
{"date": "2018-02-15 00:00:00", "text": "The administration\u2019s focus is not random. Nor is it illogical, if one\u2019s goal is to maximize the influence of white people. Since the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act, the chromatic composition of the country\u2019s population has undergone a fundamental transformation. People of color used to make up 12 percent of the United States population in 1965, and that percentage has more than tripled over the past several decades to the point where nonwhite people are nearly 39 percent of the residents of the United States (it is no accident that the country\u2019s first African-American president was elected when he was elected). Mr. Trump\u2019s team understands that the specific laws it seeks to eliminate have played a significant role in that demographic revolution.\n\nAs distasteful as many people find unapologetic advocacy for public policies that favor white people, the truth of the matter is that immigration laws have been among the longest-standing and most strongly defended cornerstones of our government. The very first immigration law passed, the Naturalization Act of 1790, declared that to become a citizen, one had to be a \u201cfree white person.\u201d That demarcation was the explicit law of the land for the next 162 years, until 1952. There are 20th-century Supreme Court cases explicitly holding that Asian immigrants could not become United States citizens because they were not white. Even after 1952, the practical effect of immigration policy continued to promote white people above others through mechanisms such as the Asia Pacific Triangle, which restricted immigration from Asian countries.\n\nMost people would probably like to believe that the era of widespread public support for white supremacist policies is over, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the timidity and rhetorical reticence of progressive and Democratic leaders. When they had the leverage to demand a vote on protections for the Dreamers, Democrats surrendered that influence because they feared the electoral consequences of being seen as fighting for the rights of immigrants. The assessment was that white voters in swing states would retaliate against Democratic candidates, imperiling the prospects for taking back Congress.\n\nSetting aside the morality of the matter, these Democratic electoral calculations are flawed in two fundamental respects. First, they underestimate the capacity of white people to rise above racism and stand for justice and equality. Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign was a very thinly veiled appeal to racial anxiety and grievances of white people in America. Study after study has confirmed that racial anxiety, sometimes described as cultural discomfort, was the motivating factor among many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. And yet the fact that Mr. Trump still needed to speak mostly in code shows that there are limits to the effect of explicit racial appeals. In the 2017 elections in Virginia and Alabama, the increase in support among white voters for Ralph Northam for governor and Doug Jones\u2019s Senate candidacy affirmed that racial pandering also alienates whites.\n\nThe second Democratic miscalculation is that they overlook the political potential and power of the swelling ranks of nonwhite voters in America. Democrats need to win two Republican-held seats to flip control of the United States Senate, and based on the 2016 election results, the two most likely pickups are in Arizona and Nevada. In both of those states, Latino voters hold the balance of power. Hillary Clinton lost Arizona by about 91,000 votes, and there were more than 600,000 Latinos who were eligible to vote but didn\u2019t cast ballots in 2016. Democrats won Nevada in the last three presidential elections, so the primary task is bringing those voters back to the polls for the midterm elections. The protective cushion in Nevada can come from the pool of 150,000 eligible, nonvoting Latinos; the incumbent Republican won his last election by less than 12,000 votes.", "title": "Opinion | Trump Wants to Make America White Again", "authors": []}

Democrats and Dreamer advocates can lobby him and other Republicans, hoping to put political pressure on them, as happened on health care last year. But Trump will ultimately have a decision to make.

Moore, the Republican candidate who lost his bid for an Alabama Senate seat after being accused of child predation, and Bill O\u2019Reilly, the disgraced TV personality who, along with his former employer, Fox News, paid tens of millions of dollars to settle sexual harassment claims.\n\nMr. Trump, critics noted, has not let due process prevent him from rushing to judgment in other cases. He has avidly promoted conspiracy theories, like those of the birther movement, whipped up his supporters at campaign rallies with chants of \u201clock her up\u201d about Hillary Clinton, and demanded the death penalty for five young black and Latino men wrongly accused of assaulting and raping a white woman in Central Park.\n\nFor the #MeToo movement, which has spread into virtually every corner of American society \u2014 redressing a legacy of injustice even as it wrestles with questions like the dangers of a rush to judgment \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s words were sure to make him, yet again, a lightning rod.\n\nHis apparent defense of his two aides \u2014 Rob Porter, the staff secretary, and David Sorensen, a speechwriter \u2014 ran counter to the White House\u2019s portrayal of its response to the accusations of emotional and physical abuse leveled against them. Administration officials maintained that they acted decisively in each case.\n\nBut it was in keeping with the White House\u2019s initially defensive reaction to the charges against Mr. Porter \u2014 a messy trail of conflicting statements that has left the West Wing in turmoil, with angry officials pointing fingers at one another.\n\nThe White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, staunchly defended Mr. Porter initially. Ms. Sanders said the president had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in his performance, while Mr. Kelly described him as \u201ca man of true integrity and honor.\u201d\n\nYet the allegations against Mr. Porter and Mr. Sorensen were longstanding, well documented, and at least in Mr. Porter\u2019s case, known to the White House for months, even as he held one of the West Wing\u2019s most sensitive positions, channeling paperwork to the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of Mr. Porter\u2019s former wives, Jennifer Willoughby, obtained a restraining order against him, while the other, Colbie Holderness, presented a photograph of herself with a black eye, which she said came from being hit by Mr. Porter while the couple was on vacation in Italy.\n\nThe F.B.I. informed the White House of these charges, which held up Mr. Porter\u2019s application for a permanent security clearance. Mr. Kelly has told his staff he ordered Mr. Porter to be fired 40 minutes after learning of the charges, an assertion that other officials disputed.\n\nIn the case of Mr. Sorensen, his former wife, Jessica Corbett, told F.B.I. agents conducting a background check on her husband that he had run over her foot while driving a car and extinguished a cigarette on her hand during a turbulent two-and-a-half-year marriage.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Lieu, a Democrat from California, said on Twitter. \u201cVictims deserve due process as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has a history of coming to the defense of accused men. In addition to Mr. Moore and Mr. O\u2019Reilly, he defended Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, who resigned amid multiple allegations of misconduct; Corey Lewandowski, his former campaign manager, who was charged with battery after grabbing the arm of a female reporter; and Mike Tyson, the boxer who went to jail for raping an 18-year-old beauty queen.\n\nFrequently, Mr. Trump notes that the charges are old, that they might not be true and that the accused has denied them.\n\n\u201cForty years is a long time,\u201d he said of allegations that Mr. Moore had molested girls as young as 14. \u201cHe\u2019s run eight races, and this has never came up.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Mr. Lewandowski, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s a fine person, he\u2019s a very good person.

He has consistently denied the charges, often in terms not unlike those he uses in defending other men.\n\n\u201cA lot of things get made up over the years,\u201d he said in 2016, responding to an investigation by The New York Times that detailed what multiple women described as lewd comments and unwelcome advances. \u201cI have always treated women with great respect. And women will tell you that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s call for due process does reflect a fear shared by others that the #MeToo movement has gained so much momentum that in some cases, men accused of misconduct are being judged too quickly or punished too severely for sexual behavior that falls into a gray area.\n\nYet Mr. Trump has been quick to judge in other instances. In the 1989 case of the Central Park jogger, Mr. Trump bought a full-page ad in newspapers calling for the five suspects to be given the death penalty. Even after the convictions against the men were dropped 13 years later, Mr. Trump insisted they were guilty.\n\n\u201cYou falsely alleged rape by the #CentralParkFive even AFTER they were exonerated, but said nothing about due process for 5 black boys,\u201d Cornell William Brooks, a former president of the N.A.A.C.P., said in a tweet. \u201cFor 2 white men accused of wife beating, you argue due process. Due process applies to more than @WhiteHouse staff or white men.\u201d\n\nTo some critics, Mr. Trump\u2019s defensive tone on Saturday was less a setback for the #MeToo movement than evidence of its success \u2014 a political and social tidal wave crashing on the doorstep of the White House.\n\n\u201cTrump is now tweeting to legitimize domestic violence,\u201d said Amy Siskind, who publishes a weekly list on the web of how Mr. Trump is changing the country. \u201cLike months ago when he defended a pedophile.

(Most C.D.C. directors do not carry weapons, but those in the Public Health Service, like the current acting director, Anne Schuchat, hold the rank of admiral and wear a naval uniform that comes with a sword.)\n\nMr. Trump admires bold military leadership so much that he surrounds himself with generals who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, men with nicknames like Mad Dog.\n\nAbout 4,500 Americans died in Iraq, and about 2,400 in Afghanistan.\n\nAmerican flu deaths are not just far greater. They are also more predictable than ambushes or I.E.D.s. In recent years they have occurred within a regular range, from 12,000 in a mild season to 56,000 in a bad one.\n\nIt was screamingly obvious that this season might well be bad. Australia, where the flu peaks in August, just endured a particularly vicious year, and the British papers blared headlines about \u201cAussie Killer Flu\u201d heading north. Genghis Khan moved with more subtlety.\n\nBut the C.D.C. issued no unusual warning and appeared to do less than usual to promote the intervention that matters most: flu shots.\n\nIt also missed a P.R. opportunity: This is the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed at least 50 million worldwide, and the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Hong Kong flu, which killed one million.\n\nEven though shots are easier to get than ever through pharmacies, schools and workplaces, it is a rare year when 40 percent of Americans have gotten the shots by November.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWorse, those numbers have been slipping. Last November, 2 percent fewer Americans had received flu shots than in November 2016. Coverage among Hispanic adults fell precipitously, by 7.7 percent. The C.D.C. called that \u201cdiscouraging,\u201d but offered no explanation.\n\nIn previous years, the C.D.C. usually held autumn events to encourage flu shots. Led by the director, they could involve detailed discussion of the looming viral threat. Dr. Fitzgerald, new to office, did not hold one.\n\nMr. Price\u2019s tenure focused less on public health than on repealing the Affordable Care Act, a mission Mr. Trump demanded. \u201cHe better get the votes,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Tom, you\u2019re fired!\u2019\u201d\n\nOne day before he actually was fired \u2014 or at least forced out \u2014 Mr. Price spoke at a flu-related event and got his own shot in front of the audience. But by then, he had been under fire for three weeks over his travel, and the room was full of political reporters, who shouted questions as he fled, jacket still in hand.\n\nFlu preparedness never made the front burner \u2014 and now flu is here with a vengeance.\n\nFew may remember, but the 2009 swine flu pandemic was one of the first crises of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. In April, a spike in deaths from a mysterious respiratory illness caused panic in Mexico, closing schools and restaurants. Almost immediately, the same symptoms struck a Queens high school where students had just returned from spring break in Cancun, and the virus was soon ricocheting around New York City.\n\nTwo days later, health and Homeland Security officials declared a public health emergency. Three days after that, on his 100th day in office, Mr. Obama made a prime-time broadcast from the White House urging Americans to take precautions and asking Congress for $1.5 billion to flight the flu.\n\nBy October, a new vaccine was ready in record time, and the president and the first lady got their shots on camera. Ultimately, that flu proved not very lethal, but the country was as ready as it could be.\n\nMr. Trump has an opportunity here. Because he is over 70 and overweight, he represents the cohort of Americans most in danger right now: the elderly with underlying morbidities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHas he had the shot? In a 2015 radio interview, he boasted that he had never had one, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of injecting bad stuff into your body.\u201d\n\n(Paradoxically, some germophobes fear the very vaccines that can protect them because they are made with killed, weakened or chopped-up versions of those germs.)\n\nNonetheless, he appears to have had one this season. He was examined by a White House doctor in January who said his vaccinations, \u201cto include his seasonal influenza, are all up-to-date.\u201d He should now acknowledge getting one and urge all Americans to do so.\n\nInfluenza is not the only battleground on which bold public-health leadership could save lives.

In a meeting with a group of aides, including several from the press office, everyone agreed that Mr. Porter would have to resign, the people briefed on the situation said, and a statement from Mr. Kelly was drafted to provide to The Mail.\n\nBut Mr. Porter continued to deny the accusations from his former wives. One aide in the discussions pushed back on the belief that Mr. Porter should resign, saying that these were mere allegations, and that if Mr. Porter were forced out over them, other people could be forced from their posts any time an allegation was made. Other aides agreed, and argued for waiting for the story to play out.\n\nAt that point, they reached out to Mr. Kelly, who had left for the visit to the Capitol, by phone, the people said, and he said he agreed, telling them to make his statement about Mr. Porter more supportive.

It enrolls only lower-income students, most of them from Appalachia, and doesn\u2019t charge tuition. But the idea that congressional Republicans are just trying to protect low-income students \u2014 their rationalization for the carve-out \u2014 is ridiculous.\n\nFor one thing, those same members of Congress have repeatedly taken steps to make college more expensive for both low- and middle-income families. So have state-level Republicans, which helps explain why nationwide per-student funding for higher education has dropped 16 percent since 2008. Trump and House leaders both recently proposed further cuts.\n\nFor another thing, Berea, admirable as it is, happens to be tiny. It graduated about 315 lower-income students last year. By comparison, N.Y.U. graduated more than 1,000 lower-income students. Arizona State \u2014 located in the state suffering from the deepest college funding cuts \u2014 graduated 7,500 such students. McConnell hasn\u2019t done any \u201cinsisting\u201d on their behalf.\n\nAll of this hypocrisy is certainly maddening. But as the old saying goes: Don\u2019t get mad, get even. The Trumpism-for-thee phenomenon helps point the way to fighting back against Trumpism.\n\nIn other countries, the most effective way to stop recent demagogues has been to treat them as normal politicians who are failing to deliver on their promises, as Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago has noted. Don\u2019t focus mostly on the outrages, the insults and the scandals. Most voters have become inured to them. Focus instead on the demagogue\u2019s policies and job performance.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t want college to become more expensive. They don\u2019t want medical care to become less accessible.

They don\u2019t want the top priorities of the federal government to be maximizing corporate profits and reducing taxes on the wealthy, at everyone else\u2019s expense.\n\nOften, Trump simply lies about what his policies would do. But his aides and the leaders of Congress know they can\u2019t always get away with lying. Instead, they create carve-outs.

The national debt has already topped $20 trillion, and the Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that the nation is expected to bump up against its borrowing limit a month earlier than expected because the Treasury Department is bringing in less revenue as a result of the $1.5 trillion tax cut.\n\nThe hands-off approach is similar to the one the White House pursued with its tax cut, in which the president laid out broad parameters and drew senior lawmakers into the process of determining the details. But such a process faces long odds on infrastructure, given that Republicans are far less united on the issue and the president will not be able to rely on unified partisan support to force through a plan over the objections of Democrats.\n\nPassing a plan through a polarized Congress, in an election year, will require \u201cstrong presidential leadership, a bipartisan effort by leaders in both parties and bringing together the broad constituency of stakeholders who will push their lawmakers to get something done,\u201d said Ed Mortimer, the chamber\u2019s executive director of transportation infrastructure. \u201cThat\u2019s how we take advantage of this opportunity to do something transformational.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say the White House has not seriously courted their input. Several Senate Democrats and their aides noted that the administration appeared to be rejecting their longstanding call for much more federal spending. \u201cUnless we get real dollars, we will not build the infrastructure we need,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader.\n\nWhite House officials said they had met with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, including members of key committees that oversee infrastructure policy. They also said they spent months meeting with mayors and state officials to determine infrastructure needs throughout the country and the funding streams available to finance them. They concluded that a larger package than Mr. Trump had initially proposed was necessary and feasible.\n\nAdministration officials say an increase in federal funds would unleash a wave of spending from cities, states and the private sector, the result of unspecified incentives in the plan. But many local and state officials have expressed concern in recent days that the administration\u2019s faith in that potential effect is misplaced. Some Democrats and progressive groups have branded the plan a \u201cscam,\u201d meant to reward wealthy investors and gut environmental regulations under the guise of a job-creating, economy-juicing initiative, and said it would not prove sufficient to meet America\u2019s need to improve roads, bridges, communications and other infrastructure.\n\nThe idea that a $200 billion federal investment would drive $1.5 trillion in total spending is \u201cthe great hocus-pocus,\u201d said Kevin DeGood, director of infrastructure policy at the liberal Center for American Progress think tank. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no evidence for that.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Is Light on Federal Funds, and Details", "authors": []}

When the campaign gave presentations to reporters in the final two weeks of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Parscale used the website 270towin.com to show the path to victory, as opposed to presenting sophisticated models.\n\nThe specifics of Mr. Parscale\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, including his tactics to reach voters using social media platforms, has also been of interest to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Last year, he agreed to meet with the House Intelligence Committee as part of its investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign,\u201d Mr. Parscale said after he agreed to appear. \u201cThe only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by Facebook, Google and Twitter.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump may be itching to hit the campaign trail, where he is happiest, but the White House still has a rail-thin political operation. Despite efforts to hire new staff members, it has struggled for months to catch up to speed.

He called for comprehensive gun control legislation that would expand background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and on the internet, keep guns from mentally ill people, secure schools and restrict gun sales for some young adults. He even suggested a conversation on an assault weapons ban.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Trump suggested that law enforcement authorities should have the power to seize guns from mentally ill people or others who could present a danger without first going to court. \u201cI like taking the guns early,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cTake the guns first, go through due process second.\u201d\n\nThe declarations prompted a frantic series of calls from N.R.A. lobbyists to their allies on Capitol Hill and a statement from the group calling the ideas that Mr. Trump expressed \u201cbad policy.\u201d Republican lawmakers suggested to reporters that they remained opposed to gun control measures.", "title": "Trump Stuns Lawmakers With Seeming Embrace of Comprehensive Gun Control", "authors": []}

Mr. Trump would allow no new applicants other than immediate family members, and even these would no longer include parents. Imposing these restrictions and ending the diversity visa lottery would cut in half the number of legal immigrants.\n\nIt is hard to gauge how much of what Mr. Trump says is meant as a scare tactic and how much he really will demand. The one notion that runs through all he says or tweets about immigration is that it is a door for criminals and terrorists to enter the United States. Yet data studied by the Cato Institute indicates that diversity-visa holders and illegal immigrants, the groups most maligned by Mr. Trump, are far less prone to crime than native-born Americans.\n\nPoliticians have wrestled for decades with how to deal with immigrants who are in the United States illegally \u2014 now around 11 million people. But immigration in itself has been widely regarded as good for America and for the American dream. The preponderance of evidence shows that immigrants help the economy grow. They are more likely to own businesses or to start businesses than the native-born; of the 87 privately held companies currently valued at more than $1 billion, 51 percent had immigrant founders.\n\nThere are questions worth examining and debating about whether the United States ought to admit more skilled immigrants and what criteria it uses to screen applicants. But such a debate can\u2019t unfold in the shadow of Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to imminently expel the Dreamers. So what is Mr. Trump really after?\n\nA Gallup poll last June found 62 percent of Americans support maintaining current levels of immigration or even increasing them. And since the country is at nearly full employment, the timing of these anti-immigrant demands might seem odd. Yet it\u2019s no more odd than the president\u2019s tough-on-crime talk at a time when crime is lower than it\u2019s ever been, or his obsession with Islamist terrorists, even though the Government Accountability Office found that right-wing extremists have committed far more domestic attacks against Americans since 2001. Mr. Trump\u2019s approach seems intended less to rationalize the immigration system than to inflame his core supporters by demonizing nonwhite people, as he did when he disparaged immigrants from nations like Haiti and Mexico while praising Norwegians.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Backward View of Immigration", "authors": []}

But Mr. Trump is president, in no small part, because he was able to exploit the sporting spirit within us.\n\nAs Americans have become geographically uprooted and spiritually unmoored, they have turned to sports as a source of tribal identity, a primarily masculine refuge from the anxieties of adulthood, the lingua franca in a fragmented culture. The hours we spend consuming sports dwarfs the amount devoted to political activism, volunteer work, even religious worship.\n\nFrom the moment he began his campaign, Mr. Trump understood that most Americans have exchanged the burdens of citizenship for the pleasures of fandom. And he intuited that politics, for all its precious norms and pretensions, was at its root a blood sport.\n\nWhile his primary opponents droned on about policy, Mr. Trump dominated debates simply by trash talking. At rallies, he bragged about his poll numbers and urged partisans to pummel protesters. He mocked elitist losers and vowed to usher in an era of winning.\n\nEstablishment Republicans yelped that he needed to pivot to a gentler, more inclusive tone. But in the end nearly all of them voted for Mr. Trump. They did so because of what political scientists call \u201cnegative partisanship,\u201d an ingrained hatred for the other party that is often entirely divorced from ethics or policy.\n\nOrwell would have seen in this pattern the infiltration of the sporting spirit into our political culture. The result is voters whose prevailing ethos boils down to the motto of Al Davis, the former owner of the Oakland Raiders: \u201cJust win, baby.\u201d Even if you need to suppress votes, or gerrymander districts, or get help from Russian agents to do it.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Blood Sport Politics", "authors": []}

He looks weak, not only in Moscow but throughout the world.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s silence has not necessarily stopped lower levels of his administration from responding to Russian actions, sometimes going further than Mr. Obama, who was also criticized for not doing enough to counter Moscow\u2019s threat. The Trump administration has decided to send weapons to Ukraine so it can defend itself against Russian intervention, and recently imposed sanctions on more human rights violators. After Russia ordered the American Embassy in Moscow to shed most of its staff, the administration responded by ordering Russia to close its consulate in San Francisco and diplomatic annexes in New York and Washington.\n\nLikewise, in just the past few days, the Trump administration formally blamed Russia for an expansive cyberattack last year called NotPetya and threatened unspecified \u201cinternational consequences.\u201d The nation\u2019s intelligence agency directors, including those appointed by Mr. Trump, unanimously warned in congressional testimony that Russia was already meddling in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s own aides readily acknowledge the reality that he does not. Besides describing Russian interference as undeniable on Saturday, Lt. Gen. H.R.

When his Justice Department indicted the 13 Russians and three Russian entities on Friday for trying to \u201csow discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d the president focused on the fact that no evidence was presented that he or his campaign was knowingly involved.\n\nIndeed, the indictment made no assertion that the president or anyone affiliated with him did anything wrong, understandably a relief for Mr. Trump, given a year of investigation and media reports exploring the possibility of collaboration with Russia. The \u201cinformation warfare against the United States,\u201d as one Russian organization called it, started as early as 2014, predating Mr. Trump\u2019s entry into the race.\n\nBut the indictment also determined that by 2016 the effort had evolved into a deliberate attempt to support Mr. Trump and disparage Mrs. Clinton. And the charges against the Russians are not the end of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, nor do they mean that there were no contacts or cooperation that may eventually spell legal trouble for people in the president\u2019s orbit.\n\nPrevious legal filings and news accounts have documented multiple contacts between Mr. Trump\u2019s team and Russians in 2016. Among them was a June 2016 meeting hosted by Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, and Paul J. Manafort, his campaign chairman, on the promise that Russian visitors would provide incriminating information about Mrs. Clinton as part of the Russian government\u2019s support of the elder Mr. Trump.\n\nThe findings included in Friday\u2019s indictment bolstered the conclusions of American intelligence agencies, which for more than a year have said that Russia interfered in the election, a determination that Mr. Trump has occasionally accepted but more often dismissed as a \u201choax.\u201d Only in a written statement that aides issued in his name after his tweet on Friday was any concern expressed about the Russian attack described in the indictment, and then only to urge his critics to stop questioning him.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow those seeking to sow confusion, discord and rancor to be successful,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s time we stop the outlandish partisan attacks, wild and false allegations, and far-fetched theories, which only serve to further the agendas of bad actors, like Russia, and do nothing to protect the principles of our institutions. We must unite as Americans to protect the integrity of our democracy and our elections.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s position stood in contrast to that of fellow Republicans who responded to the indictment with calls for tougher action against Russia. To many, the president\u2019s reaction once again raised the question of why he would go easy on Moscow. He has spoken about Mr. Putin in generally flattering or friendly terms and avoided direct criticism even during moments of enormous stress in the relationship between the two countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the moment, the government is left to act without the president. Jeh C. Johnson, a secretary of homeland security under Mr. Obama, said the best way to stop Russia from interfering in the future is the threat of a powerful response. \u201cWhen it comes to cyberattacks, it will always be easier to be on offense than defense,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it comes to cyberattacks between nation-states, the most effective defense is to simply make the offensive behavior cost-prohibitive.\u201d\n\nBut the best way to do that, experts said, is for the president to lead the way. \u201cThe U.S. government cannot mobilize an effective strategy without White House leadership and prioritization,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, a State Department official under President George W. Bush who testified at a Senate hearing in the past week on defending against Russian interference.\n\nDespite the warnings by the intelligence chiefs and the threat detailed in the indictment, she said, \u201cthere continues to be no policy message or response, leaving our country unprotected and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nJohn P. Carlin, a former assistant attorney general for national security and chief of staff to Mr. Mueller when he was F.B.I. director, said the president\u2019s silence sent a message to Russia and the world.\n\n\u201cI think it does have consequences,\u201d he said. The American government can warn against further interference, but \u201cit would be better if it gets driven by the commander in chief. The goal is to drive a clear message that says the United States and our allies throughout the world that share our values are drawing a line that says \u2018stop, this is unacceptable.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Conspicuous Silence Leaves a Struggle Against Russia Without a Leader", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

That shows you the power of strength.\u201d Unmoved by the Arab Spring, he tweeted in September 2012, \u201cWe threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy.\u201d While campaigning for president, he enthused about torture and suggested killing the family members of terrorists.\n\nAs president, Mr. Trump has welcomed thugs from Egypt, Turkey and Vietnam to the White House. In October, he hosted the leader of Thailand\u2019s military-controlled government, who had been spurned from White House visits since leading a coup in 2014. Mr. Trump swoons when his autocratic Chinese or Saudi hosts welcome him with displays of military pageantry. Notwithstanding his recent rhetoric about North Korea, he praised Kim Jong-un \u2014 the murderous, dynastic tyrant of a totalitarian Stalinist regime with a gulag \u2014 as \u201ca pretty smart cookie.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s underlings have occasionally taken advantage of his shambolic mismanagement to sneak human rights into policy. In January of last year, Mr. Trump, while insisting that torture works, announced that he would defer on interrogation policy to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who like most United States generals opposes torture. In December, the administration singled out some individuals and entities for economic sanctions and visa restrictions, using an innovative 2016 law aimed at those who engage in human rights abuses or corruption around the world. But these flickerings of conscience do little to prettify Mr. Trump\u2019s overall record.\n\nOf course, Mr. Trump is hardly the first United States president to be hypocritical or selective about promoting human rights. Yet he presents a special threat, for several reasons. For one thing, he is more overtly hostile to human rights than any American president since Richard Nixon, which makes his intermittent admonitions in their name ring particularly hollow. And he is an inveterate liar, which makes it all too easy for the despots he chooses to scold to dispute his statements.\n\nIn addition, because Mr. Trump is so hated abroad, his fitful embrace of human rights is most likely only to further tarnish the cause. In Europe, according to a Pew poll released in June, Mr. Trump came into office roughly as reviled as George W. Bush became in the aftermath of the Iraq war. In a recent Gallup survey of 134 countries, the median approval of United States leadership plummeted from 48 percent in Barack Obama\u2019s final year to just 30 percent \u2014 and that was before it was revealed that Mr. Trump had vulgarly insulted Haiti and the nations of Africa.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Cynical Use of Human Rights", "authors": []}

These are the forces that have been largely responsible for the decline in mining jobs and the closing, or conversion to natural gas, of hundreds of coal-fired plants.\n\nWhat miners need are real programs to help transition them to new jobs, not promises of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d That, incidentally, is not a new promise. Clean coal technology involves turning coal into a gas, then stripping out the carbon dioxide and burying it so it cannot pollute the atmosphere. Many environmental groups (and this board) hoped it would work. It hasn\u2019t. In 2015, the Obama administration finally pulled the plug on a clean coal experiment called FutureGen; then the Southern Company gave up on a clean coal venture in Mississippi after spending billions of dollars.\n\nAmerica\u2019s leverage in world markets has indeed improved, due largely to a spectacular surge in domestic oil and gas production from big shale deposits in Texas and North Dakota. Domestic production recently hit 10 million barrels of crude oil a day, a figure not seen since 1970. Oil imports have steadily dropped. This has helped change the old dynamic in which the United States was forced to rely too heavily on unstable parts of the world for its oil supply.\n\nAll this production, however, has a dark side, rarely mentioned in the huzzahs about the 10-million-barrel milestone: the continued carbon-loading of the atmosphere as global temperatures rise, as one extreme weather event follows another, as almost all mainstream scientists say that to avoid a climate catastrophe, the world must leave a big chunk of its fossil fuels in the ground and spend heavily on more benign forms of energy. That is one reason Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry, did not approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada\u2019s oil sands.\n\nSuch concerns are nowhere to be found in the playbook of a man who says that climate change is a hoax.

Putin\u2019s denials of interference over the conclusions of American intelligence agencies.\n\nMr. Trump also called Mr. Schiff, the California congressman, \u201cLiddle Adam Schiff\u201d and branded him \u201cthe leakin\u2019 monster of no control,\u201d even as he praised him for his criticism of Mr. Obama\u2019s muted response to the Russian threat.\n\nThe president in the past has traded bitter Twitter messages with Mr. Schiff, accusing him of leaking classified information from the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s actions. Mr. Schiff shot back at Mr. Trump on Sunday, saying on Twitter that \u201cif McMaster can stand up to Putin, why can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInitially, Mr. Trump had been swayed by advisers who described the indictment announced on Friday as a victory for him, since it identified particular bad actors outside the campaign and used the word \u201cunwitting\u201d to describe the contacts with the Trump campaign.\n\nBut as the weekend went on, Mr. Trump\u2019s longstanding frustrations with an inquiry that he has branded a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d once again came to the fore. While the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, had noted repeatedly in announcing the indictment that it does not say that Russia changed the outcome of the election, Mr. Trump was angry because his own team had not gone further in his defense.\n\nThat included General McMaster, who, as an active duty military officer, takes the constrictions on what he can say politically very seriously. When he spoke in Germany, Mr. McMaster did not believe he could go further than the cold facts of the document, a reality that deeply frustrated the president, two administration officials said.\n\nAlthough incensed by coverage of the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump spent part of the weekend focused on the school shooting. On Sunday, the White House announced that he would hold a \u201clistening session\u201d with high school students and teachers in Washington on Wednesday, and meet with state and local officials on school safety on Thursday.\n\nMr. Trump also called three local officials, including Christine Hunschofsky, the mayor of Parkland. In an interview, Ms. Hunschofsky said she was struck by how affected the president had seemed by his hospital visit.\n\n\u201cHe gave his condolences, and then he talked quite a bit,\u201d Ms. Hunschofsky said. \u201cHe said he had talked to somebody recovering in the hospital.

The World Bank, to take a prominent example, has a long history of pushing the privatization of people\u2019s most basic infrastructure need \u2014 water. Perhaps the best-known example is Cochabamba, Bolivia, where popular opposition to the privatization of the water system forced a return to a publicly run system in 2000. In another failed privatization, this time branded as a public-private partnership, residents of Manila face unreliable access, infrastructure neglect and rates that are unaffordable for many.\n\nWhile the World Bank claims to have no preference between public and private infrastructure, promoting public-private partnerships remains its bread and butter. At a 2016 training event, bank staff learned \u201chow to promote water P.P.P. projects\u201d and convince government officials \u201cof the interest of the P.P.P. approach.\u201d What\u2019s more, bank leadership is now evangelizing what it calls the \u201cCascade\u201d approach, which prescribes the bank to \u201cfirst consider private investment for projects; then public-private partnerships; and if the first two are not available then, only then, consider public finance.\u201d\n\nThe budget of the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, which advances the bank\u2019s development priorities in the lowest-income countries, recently added $2.5 billion to provide corporations with risk insurance, guarantees, loans and equity investments.\n\nThe Trump administration and World Bank leadership clearly have shared interests, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of deep cuts to development funding. The bank\u2019s president, Jim Yong Kim, has raised eyebrows by offering bank staff members to advise Mr. Trump on infrastructure policy. At a World Bank conference last October, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin praised what he called the Cascade approach\u2019s key pillar: that the World Bank \u201cwill not provide financing if the private sector is able to do so.\u201d Perhaps this shared pro-corporate vision is why Mr. Trump has proposed funding the World Bank at levels close to the Obama-era budget last year.\n\nAs Puerto Rico\u2019s dire situation proves, the United States, like much of the rest of the world, has critical infrastructure problems to fix. But the privatization solution promoted by the Trump administration and popular among global elite is not the answer.

Engineers and researchers say that construction plans should consider these design constraints at the outset. Their concern is that a plan led by a White House that has both discounted climate science and weakened climate change regulations could mean that costly projects may be vulnerable to damage or, in a worst-case scenario, quickly rendered obsolete by the changing environment.\n\n\u201cThe impact of not considering climate change when planning infrastructure means you end up building the wrong thing, in the wrong place, to the wrong standards,\u201d said Michael Kuby, a professor of geographical sciences and urban planning at Arizona State University and contributing author to the National Climate Assessment, the federal government\u2019s most comprehensive scientific study of the effect of global warming on the United States. \u201cThat\u2019s a whole lot of waste.\u201d\n\nClimate change already poses one of the most significant threats to the nation\u2019s infrastructure, according to dozens of scientific and engineering studies, including several prepared by the federal government. A 2017 report by the Environmental Protection Agency concluded that, through the end of the century, up to $280 billion will be needed to adapt the nation\u2019s roads and railways to the effects of a warming climate.\n\nA White House spokeswoman, who asked to remain anonymous because the plan was not yet public, declined to discuss whether climate change reports were considered in the preparation of Mr. Trump\u2019s blueprint. \u201cThe president\u2019s team spent almost a full year formulating his infrastructure plan and all relevant scientific data was considered,\u201d she said in an emailed statement.\n\nSince the beginning of his administration, Mr. Trump and his appointees have steadily worked to roll back climate change regulations. Mr. Trump\u2019s E.P.A. chief, Scott Pruitt, has taken the lead role in the administration\u2019s efforts to undo climate policies and question the validity of climate science. On Wednesday, Mr. Pruitt suggested that global warming could benefit humanity.\n\nThose views are contradicted by research conducted by his own agency.\n\nThe 2017 E.P.A. report warned that some 6,000 bridges nationwide face a greater risk of damage in coming decades from the effects of a warming climate. It provides analysis showing that \u201cproactive adaptation\u201d \u2014 essentially, planning for global warming before you build \u2014 could save the government up to 70 percent in future costs of repairing damage caused by climate change-driven weather events such as deluges, coastal flooding and heat waves.", "title": "Trump\u2019s Infrastructure Plan May Ignore Climate Change.

The government is supposed to be providing a public service,\u201d Mr. Sclar said.\n\nThe president\u2019s plan recasts the federal government as a minority stakeholder in the nation\u2019s new infrastructure projects. Half of the $200 billion promised over 10 years will be used for incentives to spur even greater contributions from states, localities and the private sector. Mr. Trump also wants to speed up the approval process.\n\nThe White House budget, separately released on Monday, also gives federal agencies the authority to sell assets that would be better managed by state, local or private entities in cases where a sale would \u201coptimize taxpayer value.\u201d The budget suggests that Ronald Reagan Washington National and Dulles International Airports could be among the assets ripe for new owners.\n\nComing up with the $200 billion in federal funding will not be easy. Republicans have already ballooned the deficit in last week\u2019s spending agreement and with their tax cuts. Democrats are unlikely to go along with cuts that would offset the cost of Mr. Trump\u2019s plan.\n\nWith his infrastructure framework, the president is rethinking Washington\u2019s role.\n\nEconomic development has been the justification for federal involvement going back to the country\u2019s efforts in the early 1800s to improve harbors and rivers for navigation. It animated the 1902 Reclamation Act that funded irrigation projects that developed the western United States.\n\n\u201cNational economic development benefits were the cornerstone of federal support,\u201d said Debra Knopman, a principal researcher at the RAND Corporation. \u201cThat was the point.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPublic health, safety and national defense were added in the 20th century as core values, when the government developed the national highway system and passed the Clean Water Act.\n\n\u201cNow, they\u2019re putting out incentive programs that don\u2019t have to generate national or regional economic developments,\u201d said Ms. Knopman, the lead author of a new 110-page RAND report on transportation and water infrastructure in the United States. \u201cIt may happen, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re interested in and that\u2019s not the way they\u2019re screening these projects.\u201d\n\nThe math for the infrastructure plan also relies on a lot of unknowns.\n\nAlong with private investors, cities and states are being counted on to put up significant funds.

And even if the plan appears to put much of the onus on them to finance projects, any additional federal funding is welcome.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many states have already expressed concern that it will be hard for them to increase state and local taxes, because deductions on them have been limited.\n\nSome are considering other ways, such as gasoline taxes, to raise funds, but it may not be enough to fund new infrastructure projects. A report released last month by Fitch, the ratings agency, found that many states could see their tax revenue fall from the changes to the individual and corporate taxation laws.\n\nDavid Damschen, Utah\u2019s treasurer, said his state faces many infrastructure challenges as it works to accommodate a growing population, expand its stock of affordable housing and improve the transportation system. He said Utah was already looking for new sources of tax revenue to fund projects because sales tax and gas tax revenue had been declining.\n\nBut Mr. Damschen also noted that public-private partnerships do not tend to work well in his state. \u201cWhen things roll out, you\u2019ll find what the market will do with these ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes creative ideas don\u2019t always have the level of acceptance in the marketplace as you hoped.\u201d\n\nThe amount of federal funds \u2014 $20 billion a year \u2014 will be spread very thin when stretched across the entire country. It is also unclear how much new money, as opposed to repurposed funds, the federal government is actually supplying.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne analysis by the Penn-Wharton Budget Model at the University of Pennsylvania said that other pieces of the White House budget could end up reducing federal infrastructure spending by $55 billion over 10 years \u2014 despite the president\u2019s new plan.\n\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and the president of the conservative American Action Forum, complimented aspects of the president\u2019s initiative that dealt with streamlining regulations and using federal credit guarantees. But he doubted the promised total could be reached.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the $200 billion to $1.5 trillion, if you do the arithmetic,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond the math, the revamped selection standards, too, are untested. The new criteria likely stemmed from the administration\u2019s attempt to distinguish its program and try something new.\n\nIndeed, criteria announced just last year by the Trump administration for other transportation and infrastructure grants relied on more traditional standards. One lists safety, overall condition, economic competitiveness, environmental sustainability and quality of life as \u201cprimary selection criteria.\u201d Another cites \u201csupport for national or regional economic vitality\u201d as the No. 1 one objective, while coming up with new money was second.\n\nThe new plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t allocate money in terms of congestion, economic need or the public good,\u201d said Martin Klepper, the former executive director of the Transportation Department\u2019s Build America Bureau. \u201cIt does it mostly on the basis of the leverage issue.\u201d\n\nMr. Klepper, who spent decades in the private sector developing, financing and selling large infrastructure projects, was recruited to lead the bureau in the final weeks of the Obama administration.

Kislyak, picked up on a favorite theme of Mr. Trump\u2019s: questioning the credibility of the F.B.I. and intelligence agency assessments.\n\n\u201cI have seen so many indictments and accusations against Russians,\u201d Mr. Kislyak said on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI am not sure I can trust American law enforcement to be the most truthful source against Russians.\u201d He added, \u201cThe allegations being mounted against us are simply fantasies.\u201d\n\nMr. Kislyak, who has been caught up in the investigation because of meetings with Trump campaign officials during his time as ambassador, went on to cite a study, which he said he was keeping in his briefcase, that proved the \u201cmain source of computer attacks in the world is not Russia.

The Americans argued they were just matching Russian capabilities and charged that Moscow was in continued violation of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement, limiting tactical weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet the cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and others, and the use of Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to spread propaganda, dominated the discussion and reflected how quickly the use of these techniques has become the new battleground in a very different kind of post-Cold War conflict.\n\nThe White House cybercoordinator, Rob Joyce, was particularly direct in his accusations that Russia was behind the broad attack on Ukraine last June, called \u201cNotPetya.\u201d He described the attack as \u201cindiscriminate\u201d and noted that it paralyzed operations far beyond Ukraine, the intended target, and included the Maersk shipping system. He said the United States would retaliate, but did not say how, adding \u201cwe will not telegraph these punches.\u201d\n\nMr. Joyce is no newcomer to offensive cyberoperations; previously he ran the Tailored Access Operations unit of the National Security Agency, overseeing American cyberaction against other counties. \u201cWe are going to conduct cyberoperations,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe need to do it in a responsible, balanced way.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster, in his comments, argued that Russia had bridged the partisan divides in the United States, citing a 98 to 2 vote in the Senate to impose Russian sanctions. He did not mention that the administration has yet to impose those sanctions, saying the threat of them alone has begun to change Russian behavior.\n\n\u201cThat sanctions bill has not yet been used as a tool against the Russians,\u201d Christopher Painter, a former coordinator for cyberissues at the State Department, who also attended the conference. \u201cThe question now is whether they will actually use it to create consequences. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nGeneral McMaster was questioned by the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russian Federation Council, the country\u2019s equivalent of the Senate, about whether the United States was ready to enter into some kind of negotiation with Russia about the use of cyberweapons.\n\nIt was not the time for that yet, General McMaster said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m surprised there are any Russian cyberexperts available based on how active they have been in undermining the democracies\u201d of the world.", "title": "Trump\u2019s National Security Chief Calls Russian Interference \u2018Incontrovertible\u2019", "authors": ["David E.

Some are paying out one-time bonuses to employees. Others are raising salaries. Others plan to open new factories.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, American companies\u2019 investments in things like factories and business equipment grew by 6.8 percent. That was the fastest growth rate since 2014, but far from the giant surge in capital spending that was promised ahead of the tax overhaul.\n\nBut the buying back of shares is also at record levels.\n\nAlmost 100 American corporations have trumpeted such plans in the past month. American companies have announced more than $178 billion in planned buybacks \u2014 the largest amount unveiled in a single quarter, according to Birinyi Associates, a market research firm.\n\nSuch purchases reduce a company\u2019s total number of outstanding shares, giving each remaining share a slightly bigger piece of the profit pie.\n\nCisco said this month that in response to the tax package, it would bring back to the United States $67 billion of overseas cash, using $25 billion to finance additional share repurchases. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, authorized up to $8.6 billion in stock purchases. PepsiCo announced a fresh $15 billion in planned buybacks. Chip gear maker Applied Materials disclosed plans for a $6 billion program to buy shares. Late last month, home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s unveiled plans for $5 billion in purchases.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire might be open to buy some of its shares. The remarks helped send Berkshire\u2019s stock \u2014 and the broader market \u2014 higher.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore buybacks are almost certainly on the way. UBS analysts covering Apple said the iPhone maker might authorize another $30 billion in share purchases when it reports its next quarterly earnings in April. That would be on top of the $30 billion it already spends each year to buy back its shares.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting buybacks to get to a record for 2018,\u201d said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst with S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m disappointed, there\u2019s a lot of people with me.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe flurry of planned buybacks has been good for the stock market. Early this month, stocks were down more than 10 percent from their January peak. The prospect of companies flooding markets with \u201cbuy\u201d orders helped the market recoup some of its losses.\n\nThe broader impact on the economy is less clear. Economists believe a rising stock market benefits the economy, helping support consumer and business confidence. But the vast majority of the billions of dollars in planned share purchases will benefit the richest 10 percent of American households, who own 84 percent of all stocks. The top 1 percent of households own about 40 percent of all stocks.\n\nUltimately, the effect of the rising stock market depends on how those wealthy investors use their windfall. It helps the economy more, for example, if they put the money toward productive new companies than if they invest in government bonds.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That plan, championed by President George W. Bush, was sold as a way to get American companies to invest more in the domestic economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome $300 billion came back to the United States that year. But economists estimated that as much as 92 percent of it may have been paid out to companies\u2019 shareholders \u2014 mostly in the form of buybacks.\n\nStudies have shown that the tax change lifted companies\u2019 stock prices but did not expand their American work forces.\n\nUntil the early 1980s, the practice of buying shares with corporate money was considered borderline illegal because it was thought to potentially open the company up to charges of manipulating share prices.\n\nBut in 1982 the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that gave the green light to most share repurchases, as long as they followed certain rules.\n\nHistorically, American companies had paid out profits with a quarterly check, known as a dividend. But after the S.E.C.\u2019s rule change, companies started using more of their profits to buy their own shares, in the process giving their shareholders a bigger piece of the company.\n\nBuybacks soon soared. By 2016, the most recent year for which there is complete data, companies spent $536 billion on purchasing their own shares, according to data from S. & P. Dow Jones Indices.\n\nThat was about 5 percent less than those companies spent on new plants, research and development and other investments. By contrast, 20 years ago, companies spent four times as much on such investments as they did on buybacks.\n\nSome economists think the surge in share buybacks has something to do with the relative decline in capital investments, which recently have been lower than expected.\n\n\u201cWe have some causal evidence that because of short-termism companies are doing some stock repurchases that maybe they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Heitor Almeida, a professor of corporate finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cAnd maybe that\u2019s causing them to reduce investment.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts in Hand, Companies Spend More on Themselves Than on Wages", "authors": ["Matt Phillips"]}

Republicans are likely to deny the validity of the charges on the grounds that the investigators are biased and Republicans in Congress, as they\u2019ve repeatedly demonstrated, will stick by Trump since the base is with him. Trump, of course, will continue with the \u2018hoax\u2019 narrative, and his surrogates in the media will be only too happy to back him up. At that point, we will have a very real threat to the rule of law.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks on the F.B.I. are a case study in his polarization strategy. Since its founding in 1908, the F.B.I. has had substantial popular support, especially among Republicans. Historic poll data is revealing. A 1949 Gallup poll asked \u201cWhat is your opinion of the F.B.I.?\u201d 41 percent said \u201cvery high, excellent, it does wonderful job,\u201d and 53 percent said \u201cgood, approve of it,\u201d for a total of 94 percent. Three percent voiced \u201cmild disapproval,\u201d and the responses of 1 percent were \u201cderogatory.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll tracked partisan views of the F.B.I. from December 2014 to January 2018. Over that three-year period, the percentage of Democrats voicing \u201ca great deal or quite a bit of confidence\u201d in the agency rose from 34 to 53 percent.\n\nRepublican confidence moved in the opposite direction, from 46 to 31 percent.\n\nJust this month, a February 1-2 Survey Monkey poll sponsored by Axios found that favorable views of the F.B.I. among Republicans \u2014 putatively members of the law-and-order party \u2014 had fallen to 38 percent, while a plurality, 47 percent, disapproved. Among all voters, 49 percent approved of the F.B.I. and 28 percent disapproved; Democrats were favorable by 64-14.\n\nAlex Theodoridis, a political scientist at the University of California-Merced, wrote me:\n\nPolarization by party identity is so powerful at the moment that most voters see the world through thick red and blue lenses. Almost everything is politicized. And, in almost every study I have run, I find that Republicans are more intense partisans than Democrats on average. We\u2019ve seen partisanship color Republican evaluations of the FBI (negatively) and Russia and Putin (positively).\n\nTheodoridis argued that the damage to \u201cany given institution is not likely to last beyond its usefulness in a specific political context.\u201d But, he warned,\n\nthe more pernicious problem is the very phenomenon of universal politicization. If everything, even the most esteemed institutions and norms, is subjected to the power of partisan motivated reasoning, then there really cease to be esteemed institutions and norms.\n\nMoving from politicization to politics, how likely are these trends to play out in the midterm elections?\n\n\u201cA Democratic turnaround in 2018 is far from assured,\u201d Robert Y. Shapiro, a political scientist at Columbia, emailed me:\n\nIf the economy stays strong and swing voters see benefits to the economy and themselves from tax cuts, the Republicans may well hold on to the House and, more easily, the Senate.\n\nThe recent volatility of the stock market poses dangers to Trump and the Republican Party generally. Still, Trump\u2019s ratings, always unfavorable, have improved in recent weeks.\n\nIn a setback for Democrats, the generic House vote in opinion surveys \u2014 \u201care you likely to vote for a Democrat or Republican for the House?\u201d \u2014 has fallen from a 12.9 point Democratic advantage as recently as Dec. 30 to a 6-point Democratic advantage on Feb. 7.

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "Many years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the earth and some Republicans still talked sense, the Reagan administration pursued a policy of tax cuts and military buildup even as the Fed was tightening monetary policy to fight inflation. This policy mix bore some obvious resemblance to Trumponomics. And two things happened at more or less the same time: for the first time ever, the U.S. began running large peacetime full-employment budget deficits, and we began running large, sustained trade deficits.\n\nAt the time, Martin Feldstein famously linked the two, calling them \u201ctwin deficits.\u201d While this oversimplified matters \u2013 in the late 1990s we ran both budget surpluses and trade deficits, thanks to booming investment \u2013 the logic made sense. Fiscal stimulus directly raised trade deficits by boosting overall spending, and the fiscal-monetary collision raised interest rates, pushing up the dollar and shifting spending from U.S. to foreign goods.\n\nNow the always interesting Brad Setser suggests that a similar story might be unfolding now, with tax cuts feeding a rising trade deficit \u2013 an irony given Trump\u2019s obsession with trade deficits as the root of all economic evil. His post is well worth a read, but I have a few suggestions/modifications to make.\n\nOne is simply to note that so far we\u2019ve seen only modest increases in interest rates and no rise at all in the dollar. So this doesn\u2019t look much like Reaganomics yet. Maybe it\u2019s still something that will happen; or maybe the Trump tax cuts won\u2019t deliver much fiscal stimulus, just pile up in retained earnings or get used for stock buybacks that don\u2019t do much for consumer spending. Or maybe, as Setser implicitly suggests, we need to do a \u201cbut for\u201d: but for the tax cut other factors, like the very real strengthening in the European economy, would be driving the dollar sharply lower.", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s Twin Deficits (Wonkish)", "authors": []}

Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who headed the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel under President George W. Bush. \u201cAnd it\u2019s happening largely because the president is being investigated.\u201d\n\nThe attacks are having an impact. A SurveyMonkey poll for Axios, a news website, released on Saturday showed that only 38 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of the F.B.I., compared to 64 percent of Democrats. In interviews, more than a dozen officials who work at or recently left the Justice Department and the F.B.I. said they feared that the president was mortgaging the credibility of those agencies for his own short-term political gain as he seeks to undercut the Russia inquiry led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n\n\u201cThanks to this rhetoric, there is a subset of the public that won\u2019t believe what comes out of the Mueller investigation,\u201d said Christopher Hunter, a former F.B.I. agent and prosecutor who left the Justice Department at the end of last year. Mr. Hunter said he worried that juries might be more skeptical of testimony from agents even in criminal trials unrelated to Mr. Trump. \u201cAll it takes to sink a case,\u201d he said, \u201cis for one juror to disbelieve the F.B.I.\u201d\n\nFor some career professionals, a siege mentality has taken hold. \u201cUntil recently, people in the department were in raised eyebrow mode,\u201d said Sharon McGowan, a former principal deputy chief of the appellate section of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department who left soon after the new administration took over. \u201cBut now they\u2019re starting to get worried.\u201d\n\nSince taking office, Mr. Trump has assailed a number of major institutions in society, including Congress, the courts, the news media, intelligence agencies, Hollywood, professional sports and even his own party. But the attacks on law enforcement are tied up with his own political fate as investigators bear down.\n\nThe closest analogy historians summon is the Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate prosecutor, and both the attorney general and his deputy resigned rather than comply, leaving it to the Justice Department\u2019s No. 3 official to carry it out. Even then, Nixon was publicly targeting the prosecutor, not the institutions themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEver since, the notion of a president dismissing investigators looking at his own actions had been unthinkable in Washington \u2014 at least until Mr. Trump fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, last year. President Bill Clinton\u2019s surrogates relentlessly criticized Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel investigating him, but ousting him was never a viable option, and as much as Mr. Clinton detested Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. director at the time, he did not launch a sustained public attack on him or the agency.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven before this past week, Mr. Trump had publicly assailed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation and left open the possibility that he might even fire him. Last summer, Mr. Trump sought to fire Mr. Mueller, only to back down after the White House counsel threatened to resign, The New York Times reported last month. He also considered firing Mr. Rosenstein, who oversees Mr. Mueller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary when someone can use the forces of government for their own benefit, the way Nixon did and the way this president is now doing,\u201d said Sidney Davidoff, a onetime adviser to Mayor John V.

They said the memo, drafted by Republicans led by Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman, and declassified by Mr. Trump, raised serious and legitimate questions about the way the F.B.I. used information gathered by a former spy paid by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democrats to help justify a warrant for surveillance on a former Trump campaign adviser tied to Russia.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Neither the F.B.I. nor the Justice Department should be above questioning, they say, and Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to do so should not be taken as a slight against the vast majority of people who work there.\n\n\u201cThe president has stated many times that he respects the rank and file of the F.B.I., the 25,000 men and women who do a great job there,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, said on Fox News. \u201cThis particular investigation has taken a lot of twists and turns, and it\u2019s led us to a few bad actors who had direct responsibility for an investigation about his political opponent who are obviously biased against him.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump seized on the memo on Saturday to assert that it renders the Russia investigation moot. \u201cThis memo totally vindicates \u2018Trump\u2019 in probe,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBut the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the memo represents the latest example of a secret document containing explosive information that shadowy, powerful figures do not want made public, like the famous long-form birth certificate that President Barack Obama was supposedly hiding to cover up that he was born in Kenya. (Mr. Obama eventually released the form, which showed that he was born in Hawaii, and Mr. Trump ultimately acknowledged that Mr. Obama really is a native-born American.)\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump often seized on documents as a potential holy grail. At one point, it was sealed pages of a congressional report into the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that he argued would show who was behind them. At other moments, he pointed to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails or the hacked emails of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, which were released by the website WikiLeaks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDavid Strauss, a University of Chicago law professor, said Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations against the F.B.I. and the Justice Department were not mere political rhetoric, but messages with consequences. \u201cWe have a president who seems to have no understanding of the professional ethos of the Justice Department, who has no understanding how these people think about their jobs,\u201d he said.\n\nEspecially upsetting, some former officials said, is that Mr. Trump has publicly taunted specific individuals \u2014 a top F.B.I. official, an F.B.I. lawyer and an F.B.I. supervisor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the president to criticize political appointees \u2014 although it is quite odd for him to criticize his own political appointees,\u201d said Alan Rozenshtein, a lawyer who left the Justice Department\u2019s national security division in April and now teaches at the University of Minnesota law school. But to attack career employees at the F.B.I. who are barred by regulations from publicly responding, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s really bad.\u201d\n\nJosh Campbell, who spent a decade at the F.B.I. and worked directly for Mr. Comey at one time, wrote in The Times on Saturday that he was resigning so that he could speak out. \u201cThese political attacks on the bureau must stop,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf those critics of the agency persuade the public that the F.B.I. cannot be trusted, they will also have succeeded in making our nation less safe.\u201d\n\nOne F.B.I. supervisor in a field office said public shaming of his colleagues had wiped out any desire he had to work at the bureau\u2019s headquarters in Washington. \u201cI\u2019d rather chew glass,\u201d he said.\n\nMary McCord, a former acting assistant attorney general for the national security division, left the Justice Department in May after 23 years. Every new administration, she said, ushered in new priorities and policies. But only Mr. Trump, she said, had put the entire department under a cloud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen attacks on the F.B.I. or the D.O.J. like we\u2019ve seen in the last year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me just really sad.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Unparalleled War on a Pillar of Society: Law Enforcement", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere", "Katie Benner", "Peter Baker"]}

La David Johnson, was killed while serving on a strange mission in Niger.\n\nIt did not go well. Ms. Johnson said the president seemed to forget her husband\u2019s name. His idea of comfort, she said, was to tell her La David knew \u201cwhat he was signing up for.\u201d Trump naturally denied everything. Representative Frederica Wilson, a family friend, made the whole disaster public. Kelly then waded in with an emotional speech in which he assailed Wilson for taking credit for getting funding for a Florida building named after two slain F.B.I. agents. Its overall weirdness was matched only by its total inaccuracy.\n\nThe next step, in theory, would be an apologetic call from Kelly to the congresswoman. Or assigning someone to reach out to La David Johnson\u2019s widow and try to smooth the whole awful situation over.

FIRST CLASS\n\nScott Pruitt, the champion of fossil fuel interests who is busily trying to destroy the Environmental Protection Agency, and his aides have made the ludicrous argument in recent days that he must fly first class because he is not safe in economy. This has elicited howls of laughter from aviation experts. Mr. Pruitt and his staff have racked up a tab totaling many thousands of dollars for domestic and international trips, including $1,641 for a brief flight from Washington to New York. Mr. Pruitt told The New Hampshire Union Leader that he has to travel in the front of the cabin because people in coach are mean to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where there\u2019s not much civility in the marketplace, and it\u2019s created, you know, it\u2019s created some issues,\u201d he said.\n\nEUROPEAN IDYLL\n\nIn other travel news, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, last week struggled to explain why the government spent $4,000 to fly his wife to Europe so she could accompany him for what was supposed to be a trip to attend a conference on veterans\u2019 issues. Turns out, the happy couple spent nearly half the trip checking out sites like Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen and Buckingham Palace in London. Oh, and they also improperly accepted free tickets to watch a tennis match at Wimbledon, according to the V.A.\u2019s inspector general. Dr. Shulkin said he was repaying the Treasury for the cost of his wife\u2019s ticket, though not before producing an unusual 28-page rebuttal to the inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nFAVORITISM AT THE F.C.C.\n\nAt the Federal Communications Commission, Chairman Ajit Pai is under fire from Democrats in Congress for relaxing rules that restrict how many local TV stations a business can own in one market, weeks before a large conservative broadcaster, Sinclair, announced it was acquiring more stations by buying Tribune Media. The commission denies any wrongdoing, but has refused to respond to members of Congress who have sought information about Mr. Pai\u2019s contacts with Sinclair executives. The Times reported in August that the chairman and his staff met and corresponded with Sinclair several times. Earlier, The New York Post reported that Mr. Trump had met with Sinclair officials and discussed the F.C.C. rules. Clearly, there is nothing to see here.\n\nFAMILIAL SUPPORT\n\nIt is hard to get good help when unemployment is at 4.1 percent. Perhaps that\u2019s why Ben Carson, the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, saw fit to let his son, Ben Carson Jr., organize a \u201clistening tour\u201d for the secretary in Baltimore, despite warnings from department lawyers that doing so could violate ethics rules. One lawyer wrote in a memo that the son\u2019s involvement could give \u201cthe appearance that the secretary may be using his position for his son\u2019s private gain\u201d because his son and his son\u2019s wife might be doing or seeking business with people invited to attend events on the tour, according to The Washington Post. Mr. Carson says that he and his family did nothing wrong and that they were \u201cunder attack by the media.\u201d\n\nThis is hardly a complete list. We haven\u2019t even gotten to the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, his wife, Louise Linton, and their penchant for traveling on military planes when far cheaper options are available. And there are Trump appointees like Tom Price, the former health and human services secretary, and Brenda Fitzgerald, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have had to bail out of the administration because of scrutiny they were under for expensive air travel (Mr. Price) and dubious investments (Dr. Fitzgerald).", "title": "Opinion | Trump\u2019s \u2018Best People\u2019 and Their Dubious Ethics", "authors": []}

The move, they said, was intended to lay down a marker that the administration is serious about pressing for about $85 billion in other cuts to food assistance programs that will be achieved, in part, by imposing strict new work requirements on recipients.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any support for their box plan. And, I worry that it\u2019s a distraction from the budget\u2019s proposal to cut SNAP by some 30 percent.

It was quickly embraced by Mr. Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk who is seeking to steer a debate increasingly dominated by free-spending Republicans and Mr. Trump, who has insisted on major budget increases for the Pentagon and Homeland Security.\n\nNeither man had any illusions that the plan would be immediately embraced by congressional Republicans, who were not given advance notice of the proposal, the officials said.\n\nThat the food-box approach has been tried only in small demonstration projects and never been seriously discussed during dozens of congressional hearings on the SNAP program in recent years did not stop administration officials from putting the force of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency behind it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was quickly dismissed by two Republican committee chairmen, Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, who leads the Senate agriculture committee, and his counterpart in the House, Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas.\n\nMr. Conaway is drafting a farm bill that is expected to slash billions in spending in the SNAP program through the tightening of some eligibility requirements. Mr. Roberts is overseeing an effort to craft a version of the bill that is expected to include fewer cuts in hopes of gaining the bipartisan support needed to push the measure through the Senate.\n\nSNAP, like many other safety net programs, is designed to expand during hard economic times and contract when the economy improves. Nonetheless, the program\u2019s rolls have remained at historically elevated levels, reaching a peak of 47.8 million recipients in 2012 before edging down to 45.6 million last year, according to federal estimates.\n\nMr. Perdue, in particular, has been outspoken in his call to reduce its rolls, criticizing what he calls a culture of dependency among SNAP recipients.\n\nBut Mr. McGovern said the administration was painting \u201ca distorted picture\u201d of the poor and ignoring the fact that most SNAP recipients are employed and more than a quarter are disabled and unable to seek work.\n\n\u201cThey have to stop playing to the cheap seats,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of people in the program are children and seniors and people working in jobs that pay too little to feed their families.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018Harvest Box\u2019 Isn\u2019t Viable in SNAP Overhaul, Officials Say", "authors": ["Glenn Thrush"]}

But news that Washington was preparing to create a 30,000-strong Syrian border force out of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or Y.P.G. \u2014 a plan since disavowed by the Trump administration \u2014 was the \u201clast straw,\u201d Fahrettin Altun, a columnist for a pro-government newspaper, Daily Sabah, wrote Thursday. That announcement directly precipitated Turkey\u2019s military offensive against Kurdish militias in the enclave of Afrin in western Syria, Mr. Altun wrote.\n\nTurkey views the Y.P.G. as an arm of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., an insurgent group in Turkey that has carried out attacks here for decades. The Turkish view of the connection between the two groups was bolstered this week by an American intelligence assessment equating them and concluding they \u201cprobably will seek some form of autonomy\u201d \u2014 exactly what Turkey fears.\n\nThe last time Mr. Tillerson was in Ankara, the Turkish news media was in a frenzy about a leaked phone record that to them suggested American collusion in the 2016 coup attempt, an accusation American officials found almost laughable. This time, newspapers were filled with references to the \u201cOttoman slap.\u201d Public expressions of anti-American sentiment here have become routine and intense since 2016.\n\nIn an indication of just how far apart the two sides remain, Mr. Cavusoglu said that Mr. Tillerson had promised that the Y.P.G. would soon leave the strategically important city of Manbij.\n\n\u201cOnce the Y.P.G. leaves there, we will have trust,\u201d Mr. Cavusoglu said. \u201cThis is a commitment that the United States of America has made to us and we will be talking about how this implementation will be made.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his own remarks, Mr. Tillerson would say only that security around Manbij was \u201ca topic of discussion going forward.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish military has been advancing slowly in its offensive against Kurdish militias in Afrin. So far it has cleared 44 villages, the Anadolu news agency reported, but has yet to take any of the main towns. Turkey has lost 31 soldiers in the operation that began on Jan. 20, the Defense Ministry says.\n\nTurkish officials say the Kurdish militias in Afrin have fired more than 100 rockets and mortars over the border into Turkey in that time, killing seven civilians and one soldier in a border observation post.", "title": "Turkey and U.S. in Talks on Worsening Syria Crisis", "authors": ["Gardiner Harris", "Carlotta Gall"]}

Half the country\u2019s judges were suspended, compounding the problem of managing the judicial process.\n\n\u201cMany of us are concerned today by the length and scope of the ongoing state of emergency,\u201d Thorbjorn Jagland, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, said in a speech to some 400 candidate judges and prosecutors from the Turkish Justice Academy. \u201cMeasures taken must be strictly proportionate to the situation and limited in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that so many journalists, members of parliament, mayors and human rights defenders are deprived of their liberty,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe result of casting the net too widely is to spread a chilling effect across society as a whole.\u201d\n\nMr. Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway, met with President Erdogan and senior officials in Ankara on Thursday to raise the issues, as he sought to remind Turkey of its commitments to the rule of law as a member of the Council of Europe and signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nMr. Jagland\u2019s words carried weight in Turkey. He was one of the first foreign officials to condemn the attempted coup of July 2016 \u2014 he won applause from his audience in appreciation \u2014 and he spoke with understanding of the trauma Turkey had experienced from the bloody events, which left 250 people dead.\n\nHe emphasized the need to prosecute those responsible. But he also laid out the judicial quandary that Turkey has presented to the Council of Europe and in its broader relationship with Europe.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEvery citizen of Turkey has the right to apply to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg if their rights are violated. The court faces being inundated with cases if the rule of law fails in Turkey, Mr. Jagland said.\n\nNearly 120,000 purged government employees have applied to have their cases reviewed in Turkey. If they do not find justice, they are likely to turn to Strasbourg for recourse. Some 2,000 Turks have already appealed to the European court.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt would be much better for Turkey to handle them at home,\u201d Mr. Jagland said in an interview after his speech.\n\nIf thousands of cases came to Strasbourg, it would ruin Turkey\u2019s relations with Europe and its chances to be accepted into the European Union, he added.\n\nThe case of two of the journalists condemned to life imprisonment Friday \u2014 a well-known author and journalist, Ahmet Altan; and his brother, a columnist, Mehmet Altan \u2014 showed the arbitrary nature of Turkey\u2019 judicial system that has become the norm in recent months.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Germany issued a travel advisory warning business travelers and tourists that they risked arbitrary arrest if they traveled to Turkey.\n\nThe threat to investment and tourism was enough to cause the Turkish government to change its ways, European diplomats and analysts say. Turkey toned down it antagonistic rhetoric, and started to release some of the citizens that Germany considered political cases.\n\nOf a dozen in jail last summer, about half have been released, although most still faces charges. Mr. Yucel\u2019s case has been among the most prominent.\n\n\u201cThe Turks seem to be walking a fine line between strong rhetoric and finding areas of compromise,\u201d said Amanda Sloat, a senior fellow at Brookings and former foreign policy official in the Obama administration. \u201cDoing the right thing removes a bilateral irritant but does not fully repair relations.\u201d\n\nMr. Gabriel urged that the moment Friday be seized as a chance to resume discussions with Turkey, despite domestic debates over Turkey\u2019s use of German tanks against the Kurds in northern Syria.\n\nBut he, too, nodded to Europe\u2019s concerns that Mr. Erdogan was using his state of emergency to roll back democratic norms.\n\n\u201cLarge differences of opinion between us remain, but I think there is also evidence that it makes sense despite such difficulties to remain in dialogue with one another and to try to help Turkey to end the state of emergency, to return to the previous, or similar views about the development of the European Union, the rule of law and democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the relief at one man\u2019s freedom, many Germans remained wary.\n\n\u201cFreed hostages do not make a springtime. There are still Germans sitting in Erdogan\u2019s dungeons, without even mentioning the thousands of Turks,\u201d wrote Berthold Kohler, publisher of the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine daily. \u201cBut Yucel\u2019s deportation, faced with the threat of 18 years in prison and other sights at least indicated that Turkey, a NATO partner, is interested in d\u00e9tente.\u201d", "title": "Turkey\u2019s Effort to Repair Relations Trips Over Its Crackdown", "authors": ["Carlotta Gall", "Melissa Eddy"]}

For the last couple of years, at festivals like Nature World Night Out, hardcore and hip-hop have coexisted side by side. (What\u2019s more, the record executive who signed Turnstile is also a rapper, Cody B. Ware of World\u2019s Fair.)\n\nPerhaps there is more logic to this moment in hardcore than is immediately evident, because strangely, and somewhat unexpectedly, the mantle of heavy music in pop has over the last year or so migrated into hip-hop, thanks to the emergence of SoundCloud rap, which in its purest early form was as dogmatic as hardcore.\n\nMuch of that is owed to the producer Ronny J, who was responsible for several of the scene\u2019s earliest hits (Smokepurpp\u2019s \u201cAudi,\u201d Lil Pump\u2019s \u201cMolly\u201d).

Smokepurpp sounds like a classicist here on \u201cOne Time,\u201d but there are also differing styles: the wordy Wifisfuneral (\u201cSnakes\u201d) and Ronny J himself, who sing-raps on several songs using heavy vocal processing.

Now it is using algorithms to try to show the most important tweets first, making the site more engaging.\n\n\u201cIf you show the right tweets to the right person at the right time, it creates user happiness,\u201d Mr. Greenfield said. \u201cThat means more time spent on the site, which means more opportunities for advertising.\u201d\n\nThis has been a good week for social media companies that are not Facebook. On Tuesday, Snap reported much better revenue than expected, and a slightly narrower loss. Its shares also soared on the news. In contrast, Facebook said last week that it had made changes that reduced the hours its two billion users were spending on its pages.\n\nOver all, Twitter reported a profit of $91 million in the final three months of 2017, compared with a loss of $167 million a year earlier. Margins were much better, expenses were lower and stock-based compensation decreased sharply.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Revenue from advertising, which makes up the bulk of its revenue, increased 1 percent. In general, Twitter exceeded low expectations.\n\n\u201cA solid result across the board and builds upon the momentum\u201d from the third quarter, analysts at UBS wrote in a research note.\n\nOne quarter is not much of a streak, and Twitter has often been unable to keep it up. Jim Cridlin, the global head of innovation at Mindshare, a unit of the advertising giant WPP, said that while Twitter\u2019s momentum continued into the fourth quarter, the company still faced \u201csignificant headwinds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLeadership is one issue. Mr. Dorsey splits his time between Twitter and his other company, the digital payments firm Square. Last month, Anthony Noto, Twitter\u2019s chief operating officer and one of Mr. Dorsey\u2019s most trusted deputies, left the company to become chief executive of the embattled online lender Social Finance.\n\nTwitter also faces criticism as federal and state authorities scrutinize companies that sold millions of fake followers on social media platforms. More than one million followers of entertainers, athletes and others have disappeared after an article by The New York Times detailed the business practices of a company called Devumi. Twitter previously said it would take action against Devumi\u2019s practices.\n\nFor the current quarter, UBS calculated that Twitter would generate $583 million of revenue, $11 million more than analysts were predicting. That might keep the party going.\n\nWhat really is helping Twitter is that there are only three American social media companies that count. Facebook is by far the largest, but is under pressure from all quarters precisely because of its size and influence. It is trying to moderate the latter without hurting the former, which is going to be tricky. Snap is a singular effort forging its own direction as a communications platform.\n\nThat leaves Twitter, troubled as it might be.\n\n\u201cAdvertisers have a huge desire to be on mobile devices more, but there are not a lot of ways to reach people on applications worthy of your home screen,\u201d said Mr. Greenfield. \u201cTwitter is on your home screen.\u201d", "title": "Twitter Has Good News for Once: Its First Quarterly Profit", "authors": ["David Streitfeld", "Chad Bray"]}

One of the tours introduces them to nonprofits including a migrant shelter.

Mexican border cities are always a little busier and more alive than their American counterparts. Cars backed out of parking spots from every direction, and people moved briskly along the sidewalks. Amid endless pharmacies and dental offices catering to mostly-gone Americans, local life pulsed and thrived.\n\nAs I turned a corner and made my way toward Calle Internacional, the street that once singularly marked the border, to view the wall art, I glimpsed a young woman on the American side of the fence who was reaching through it as she lovingly stroked the head of a teenage boy squatting on the other side. And I remembered Jessy Zamorano\u2019s comment about tourists reacting when they witness these displays of humanity.\n\nIt seems something fantastic happens when you draw a line on the ground: People almost instinctively reach out across it toward each other.

The two Koreas have also learned to use Olympic diplomacy to achieve in a small, symbolic way a much bigger goal that eludes them in the real world: a show of unity across the divided Korean Peninsula.\n\n\u201cIt is not an impossible dream,\u201d South Korea\u2019s president, Moon Jae-in, said at the United Nations in September. He said the coming Olympics, which are being held in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang, \u201cwill become a candle that sheds light on peace.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEven the limited show of cooperation during the Pyeongchang Olympics is the culmination of a long process of sports rapprochement that has tracked the ups and downs of the larger political relationship between the Koreas. No evidence has surfaced of the wealthy South paying off its impoverished neighbor in exchange for Olympic cooperation, but the advances have come at times when the South was more forthcoming with aid and investment.\n\nLast year, the administration of Mr. Moon offered to donate $8 million to two United Nations humanitarian programs working in North Korea. Mr. Moon suspended the plan after international pushback that the offer might undermine United Nations sanctions against the North\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs.\n\nIn Pyeongchang, South Korea will pay for the joint uniforms to be worn by athletes of both sides during the opening ceremony, and foot the bill for housing and feeding hundreds of North Korean dancers and cultural entertainers who will perform during the Games. However, no money will go directly to them, South Korean officials have said.\n\nThe North Koreans are also quite likely to be the only athletes not to receive a free smartphone from the Olympic sponsor Samsung. South Korean officials said they were eager to dispel concerns, particularly in Washington, that they were making payments to the North that could violate sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to brief the Americans so thoroughly about every detail of matters concerning sanctions and the North Korean delegation that they get tired of hearing it,\u201d said Cho Myoung-gyon, who as South Korea\u2019s unification minister is in charge of dealings with the North.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.O.C. first urged North and South Korean sports officials to meet in 1963, a time when East and West Germany had created a joint Olympic squad. But the two Koreas could get no further than deciding that a hypothetical joint squad would use a well-known Korean folk song, \u201cArirang,\u201d instead of picking one of their national anthems.\n\nThey agreed to talk again before the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. But when they met on their shared border, the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, the talks quickly devolved into mutual recriminations. South Korea demanded that the North apologize for its bombing of Mr. Chun\u2019s presidential delegation in Burma the previous year, which killed 17 South Koreans, while North Korea called Mr. Chun a \u201cbloody-handed\u201d dictator for ordering the massacre of protesters in the city of Kwangju in 1980.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was nothing but a slandering match,\u201d said Lim Tae-sun, 83, a former South Korean negotiator who was present at the meeting. \u201cWe hardly discussed the real agenda.\u201d\n\nIn 1985, the I.O.C. invited the two Koreas to Lausanne, Switzerland, in an attempt to broker an end to North Korea\u2019s bitter campaign against the 1988 Summer Games awarded to Seoul. The North insisted on sharing the Games, arguing that \u201chosting of the Games by one part of the nation aggravated the antagonism and division between the two peoples.\u201d\n\nIt also made veiled threats, telling a visiting I.O.C. vice president that \u201cany accidental error would have disastrous effects on the peaceful celebration of the Games.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When North Korea boycotted the 1988 Games, only a handful of its allies, including Cuba, followed suit.\n\nThe first breakthrough came at the end of the Cold War, when the two Koreas agreed in 1991 to form a joint team for the World Table Tennis Championships in Chiba, Japan.\n\nUnder the deal, the two governments agreed that the unified team would use the name Korea and carry a blue-and-white flag showing an undivided Korean Peninsula. The South also made a key concession, agreeing that each Korea should contribute the same number of players.\n\nThe brief sports d\u00e9tente came to an abrupt end that same year when a North Korean attending a judo championship in Barcelona, Spain, defected to South Korea. The North receded into deeper isolation during a devastating famine.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the late 1990s, South Korea persuaded the North to resume sports exchanges with the help of economic aid from a private citizen, Chung Ju-yung, the billionaire founder of South Korea\u2019s Hyundai conglomerate. In 1999, the two Koreas played friendly basketball matches in Pyongyang and Seoul after ground was broken for an arena Mr. Chung donated in the North Korean capital.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSports exchanges flourished as the two Koreas achieved a political rapprochement during the early 2000s, when liberal administrations in South Korea pursued a Sunshine Policy of promoting warmer ties backed by generous offers of aid and investment. The two Koreas marched together in the Olympic opening ceremonies in 2000, 2004 and 2006.\n\nBut even during these years, a joint Olympic team remained out of reach. South Korean athletes objected to relinquishing their hard-won spots. Coaches said the two Koreas remained just too far apart in thinking, training and abilities.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to imagine archers from the two Koreas competing on the same team,\u201d Seo Keo-won, an executive at the Korea Archery Association in Seoul, said at the time.\n\nThe sports diplomacy froze in 2008 as a new conservative government in Seoul limited ties with the North, refusing to turn a blind eye to its weapons programs. Talks to field a joint team at the Summer Games that year in Beijing collapsed after the South rejected the North\u2019s condition of equal numbers of athletes.\n\nThis year\u2019s deal came after Mr. Moon, a political liberal who has expressed eagerness to restore inter-Korean exchanges, took office last May. The North also showed flexibility in agreeing to a joint squad in women\u2019s hockey, one of the few winter team sports in which it competes.\n\nThe joint team was created by adding 12 North Koreans to the existing South Korean national team of 23 players. The head coach is a Canadian appointed by South Korea, who must select at least three North Koreans to play in each game.\n\nSouth Korean officials say they did not promise aid for the deal. But they did make one important concession: postponing joint military exercises with the United States.\n\n\u201cSports exchanges can prosper only when political issues are resolved,\u201d said Chang Ung, a North Korean member of the I.O.C., after landing in Seoul this week. \u201cThat is an unbreakable rule on the divided Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "title": "Two Koreas, Split by War, Use Olympics to Make Rare Shows of Unity", "authors": ["Choe Sang-Hun"]}

{"date": "2018-02-16 00:00:00", "text": "The 2011 story is clearly the principal one, although not necessarily the most engaging. In it, a second-tier tennis pro, Sandy Allison, falls in love with Alice du Pont, the wealthy owner of Windermere, a Newport estate whose maze, based on the one at Hampton Court in England, provides the novel\u2019s central metaphor. Alice has cerebral palsy, is bipolar and always looks (to Sandy) \u201clike she was being electrocuted.\u201d She wears bowling shirts and pedal pushers as well as rodeo, biker and hippie outfits, and her interest in history helps link 2011 to the novel\u2019s other stories. Indeed, at one point, she leads Sandy on a tour of historical Newport, walking, she tells him, \u201cfrom the 21st century backwards\u201d \u2014 a nudge to nodding readers who may have missed the novel\u2019s pattern.\n\nImage\n\nOf the other stories, most are in the first person and written as notebooks or journals; the best is by Henry James, who did in fact live in Newport as a young man. Smith\u2019s portrait of James is at times excellent, rivaling that of Colm Toibin in \u201cThe Master.\u201d We follow James, a self-described \u201cbudding novelist,\u201d as he strikes up an acquaintance with a young woman, a friendship that goes terribly wrong when she mistakes it for courtship and, to his horror, asks him to marry her. Smith sprinkles James\u2019s distinctively fresh early style with just the lightest pinch of turgid fussiness \u2014 the language is pitch perfect \u2014 and his insights into James\u2019s character and mind are flawless.\n\nSmith\u2019s ability to capture the character of the languages used in each of his historical periods is remarkable. His 18th-century British officer, stationed in Newport during the American Revolution in the 1778 chapters, is a chillingly convincing sexual predator of the spoiled and privileged sort described by Samuel Richardson. Almost a century earlier, Smith\u2019s teenage Quaker girl makes a refreshing contrast. The richness of these 17th- and 18th-century voices makes the 21st-century chapters sound flat in comparison.\n\nThe different strands of the narrative are skillfully braided. Each is interrupted by the next at a salient moment, and each is strong enough that readers can forgive the omnibus ending, whose breathless melodrama feels out of sync with the rest of the novel, and whose struggle to highlight parallels and links between the stories becomes a bit ham-handed. The feeling here is that the writer began with a method that acts like a template and so has to see it through, with the result, for example, that Henry James\u2019s comeuppance is improbably (and not credibly) similar to that of one of Smith\u2019s fortune hunters.\n\nLucy Hughes-Hallett\u2019s \u201cPeculiar Ground\u201d is more modest in its formal ambitions but more ambitious in its plenitude and sweep. Like \u201cThe Maze at Windermere,\u201d \u201cPeculiar Ground\u201d is centered on a great house, in this case Wychwood in Oxfordshire, England, and, as in Smith\u2019s narrative, the historical roots of the story go back to the 17th century, when a five-mile-long wall is being built around Wychwood. In contrast to Smith, however, who in postmodern fashion slices, dices and shuffles his history, Hughes-Hallett takes a more modernist approach by embedding her story inside a frame. The novel begins in 1663, not long after the end of the English Civil War, then jumps to the 20th century for the bulk of the narrative before returning to the 1600s at the end. The 20th century is clearly Hughes-Hallett\u2019s chief focus, and she frames its narrative in turn by beginning in 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built, and ending in 1989, when it fell. Frames and walls, then, are formal devices in this novel as well as thematic obsessions, and are the chief metaphors on either end of a 300-year hiatus. A wall includes and excludes; it encloses and protects privileged inhabitants and means to keep all others out, including religious dissenters and those fleeing the plague; yet it also, as one character notes, creates toxic and stagnant communities for its \u201cprisoners.\u201d\n\nLest all this sound cold and mechanical, a wall\u2019s social straitjacket also induces a certain vital energy, a desire to fling one\u2019s arms apart, and this large and rich kitchen sink of a novel (as in everything but) is full of drama, vivid characters, wit, gorgeous writing and fascinating botanical, religious and social detail. Among its themes \u2014 and perhaps the most engaging one \u2014 is the decline of the great houses of England. We witness the estate of Wychwood being built, watch it survive fire and flood. We both applaud and cringe when it changes hands and becomes first a venue for the \u201970s subculture, with its voluptuaries, dropouts, druggies and rock musicians, its wealthy patrons and hangers-on, and then, at the end, a \u201cpublic show\u201d with a little train that takes tourists on rides through the estate, a wildlife park, a craft center and garden shop and \u2014 the ultimate indignity \u2014 a television series whose measure of success is its sale to an American network.", "title": "Two Novels Trace Parallels Between Past and Present, or Create Them", "authors": []}

The last matter is becoming a central element of possible legislation to be considered when lawmakers return to Washington next week.\n\nThe problem is that while those views might represent a majority of the nation and even a bipartisan majority of the House and Senate, they seem to be a minority sentiment among the Republicans who control Congress as well as the White House.

And conservative Republican voters, at least in the past, have been more driven on these issues than Democrats or moderate Republicans.\n\nBut while Republican leaders have been able to successfully thwart the bipartisan push behind both gun safety and immigration legislation, loud public demands for action have meant they could not ignore them altogether.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith a special program for young undocumented immigrants at risk of expiring, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, was forced to allow votes on the immigration proposals that went nowhere last week. Backers of a bipartisan plan that would have given the Dreamers \u2014 but not their parents \u2014 a path to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall on the Southern border sought by the president believed they had the 60 votes needed to advance any significant legislation in the Senate.\n\nBut their deal came under scathing attack from the administration, which also wanted new curbs on family-based migration opposed by Democrats and some Republicans. Several anticipated Republican votes for the bipartisan deal melted away, and gridlock resulted once again.\n\n\u201cIt was all or nothing and they got nothing,\u201d said Mr. Sharry, who noted Mr. Trump sacrificed what had previously been his overriding immigration priority, the wall.\n\nAs lawmakers start to discuss among themselves about possible approaches to gun safety after the Florida shooting, they are fearful of the same dynamic emerging. They worry that a majority of Republicans will entertain votes on consensus gun safety measures only in exchange for support for measures that other lawmakers and gun safety advocates find unacceptable.\n\nLawmakers and congressional officials say suggestions are already percolating that any legislation tightening background checks would be tied to a House-passed proposal that would require state-issued permits to carry concealed weapons to be transferable across state lines, forcing all states to recognize a permit issued in one jurisdiction. Currently, states have widely varying standards for issuing such permits and the push to grant \u201creciprocity\u201d would meet stiff Democratic resistance in the Senate, diminishing chances for any bipartisan agreement.\n\nGun control supporters were somewhat heartened by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday at the White House that gun control efforts would this time go beyond simple \u201ctalk,\u201d but they are also realistic, particularly with crucial midterm elections looming and both parties grappling for the political upper hand.\n\n\u201cI find myself hoping that this time it is real and that it isn\u2019t Lucy and the football,\u201d Mr. Coons said. \u201cI have to keep believing in the possibility of a functional Senate, but on gun violence I am not optimistic. \u201c\n\nIn light of the recent shared experience with both gun safety and immigration proposals, he probably shouldn\u2019t be.", "title": "Two Polarizing Issues, Gun Control and Immigration, Have Thwarted Compromise", "authors": ["Carl Hulse", "On Washington"]}

I now find myself banned from Turkey, unable to enter the United States and unable to get a journalist visa from the Syrian government. The Syrian and Turkish governments frequently deny passports and visas to intimidate and humiliate their own citizens, and to deter journalists from writing uncomfortable things.\n\nI had expected better from the United States and think of the country as second to none in its egalitarian treatment of outsiders. Many of these restrictions, including the legislation that means that I can no longer claim the visa waiver, pre-date the Trump administration. But the more restrictive approach to immigration under Mr. Trump, and the closer scrutiny of visa applications as a result, have certainly made matters worse.\n\nData on journalists who have been excluded from the United States is difficult to come by. People prefer to seek behind-the-scenes assistance or simply wait. But the stories are trickling out.\n\nIn 2016 Reporters Without Borders highlighted the case of the Spanish journalist and historian Manuel Martorell, whose reporting on Kurdish issues appears to have led to his being refused a tourist visa to fly with his family to the United States. He eventually received a letter from the State Department informing him that his visa request had been denied thanks to alleged \u201cterrorist activities.\u201d\n\nKarl Penhaul, a well-known British journalist reporting for the American press in Colombia, found himself unable to fly to the United States, most likely the result of flawed information received from an intelligence agency in Colombia about his alleged chumminess with the rebel group FARC, which he reported on extensively. A tourist visa application he subsequently submitted, he told me, has been \u201cin process\u201d since January 2014.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s travel bans, incidents of racist violence and concerns about personal safety have decreased the number of international students coming to the United States. The number of arriving international students, according to a survey of 500 campuses by the Institute of International Education, declined an average 7 percent in fall 2017, with 45 percent of campuses reporting drops in new international enrollment.\n\nIf the United States continues to treat foreigners with the suspicion and condescension of an authoritarian regime, it will snuff out a good deal of its carefully accumulated expertise on the rest of the world. An atmosphere of openness and intellectual exchange is easily squandered and very difficult to get back.\n\nThe result may be a cycle of ignorance and missteps, which is bound to be damaging to American interests in the future.

Buck, the first American woman to win the award, whose 1930s novels about Chinese peasant life now read as twee and patronizing Orientalist fairy tales.\n\nNot all works of art age as well as others. Some remain consistent sources of wonder and awe and provocation for century upon century; others, removed from their context, curdle into irrelevance, if not offensiveness. The artist\u2019s difficult job is to create something that addresses the concerns of her time while also contending with the timeless: the needs and desires and frustrations that are particular not to a certain age, but to human existence. The stuff that endures is the work that does both, that manages to reflect a moment while also transcending it. But the vast majority of art is subject to the ebb and flow of cultural tides. Sometimes it\u2019s buried beneath the wave, and sometimes \u2014 when circumstances change \u2014 it\u2019s tossed up again to the surface, a reminder of lost treasure glinting on the water\u2019s crest.\n\nThe subject of our cover story, \u201cThe Boys in the Band,\u201d is a good example of how a piece of art born from a specific moment can find itself newly resonant in an entirely different one.

This May, it will have its Broadway debut, with a cast composed entirely of out gay actors, produced and directed by out gay men. The fact that there are now enough openly gay, well-known working actors to populate a Broadway ensemble play \u2014 and, indeed, to be considered draws \u2014 is remarkable: both because many of us remember when this would never have been possible ... but also because many of us can\u2019t imagine it would ever be anything but possible.\n\nIn the intervening five decades between the play\u2019s premiere and its latest revival \u2014 50 years that have seen the Stonewall riots, the official de-pathologization of homosexuality (which was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders only in 1973), AIDS and same-sex marriage \u2014 Crowley\u2019s work has been assessed and reassessed, revived and dismissed, beloved and reviled. But it has always, as The Times\u2019s co-chief theater critic Jesse Green notes in his lovely, searching essay, been relevant, a work of art that every gay playwright since its debut has had to be in conversation with in one way or another. \u201cBoys\u201d was, Green writes, \u201cvery much a ghetto play, a peephole aimed at gay men.\u201d The titular boys were to be witnessed and gawked at; Crowley sought to humanize them, but humanization came through objectification and minimization.

{"date": "2018-02-07 00:00:00", "text": "Here at T, we spend a good deal of time discussing people we admire: fashion designers, artists, writers, architects, chefs and performers of all kinds. Some are notable because they produce works of art that land at the exact right moment in the culture, that seem to not just speak to, but articulate, the global mood. Some are notable because they make art that has proven itself timeless, things or ideas in which every successive generation can find some echo of itself.\n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older, however, the artists I find most mysterious \u2014 and therefore compelling \u2014 are the prophets, the people who have had to wait for the culture to catch up to them. People like Margaret Atwood, whose novel \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d while certainly acclaimed upon its publication in 1985, was also dismissed in some quarters as a fevered fantasy \u2014 though no longer. Or Kengo Kuma, the Japanese architect who was making buildings that were deliberately humble in both size and material (Kuma prefers to use cedar, a staple of prewar Japanese structures) through decades in which architecture and its critics tended to favor technologically wrought spectacles. Kuma, however, had foreseen a time in which architecture would have to answer, somehow, to the realities of diminishing resources and overstuffed cities, a time when architects would seek not to change the landscape, but integrate themselves into it. (Our story on Kuma will go live on Feb. 15.)\n\nThen there\u2019s our cover star, Judy Chicago, a medium- and genre-defying artist who, at 78, is and will be the subject of a number of major solo gallery and museum shows over the next 18 months. The past year saw her most celebrated work, the monumental (in all senses) \u201cThe Dinner Party\u201d (1979) \u2014 a vulvic-inspired table with ceramic plates for 39 women from across the centuries, from Sappho to Virginia Woolf \u2014 become a pop-cultural touchstone, a visual shorthand for women\u2019s exclusion from the annals of history and a revisionist fantasy: Here, literally, was their place at the table. For Chicago, who has spent almost 40 years watching her creation be, alternately, reviled, praised, sneered at, ignored and celebrated, the work\u2019s triumph is a relief. From its conception, she told writer Sasha Weiss, she knew \u201cit needed to be permanently housed, because if it hadn\u2019t been, it would have simply reiterated the story of erasure it recounts.\u201d The work now has a permanent home \u2014 physically, and in the annals of art and feminism \u2014 at the Brooklyn Museum. Still, Chicago admits, \u201cI had no idea it was going to take this long\u201d \u2014 words that resonate for many of us, in many ways.\n\nIf you are an artist, there is nothing sweeter than having your art be seen, discussed, debated and, ultimately, appreciated. One could argue that it doesn\u2019t matter when that appreciation comes \u2014 for most artists, it never arrives at all. And yet being a cultural Cassandra, being possessed of what Weiss characterizes as Chicago\u2019s \u201clonely clairvoyance,\u201d is a difficult and often isolating role. Getting to say \u201cI told you so\u201d is little reward for what can be decades of ignominy, if not outright ridicule. Playing outside the club \u2014 and in the art world, being female or a person of color has more or less guaranteed you\u2019ll probably be far outside \u2014 requires a special kind of determination, powered by one\u2019s strength of conviction and singular vision, as well as the rare gift (sometimes natural, sometimes borne from necessity) not to seek or crave validation \u2026 or, at least, to convince yourself you won\u2019t and don\u2019t.\n\nOne of Chicago\u2019s own struggles was redefining what art should look like. And for all the challenges of our current era, we are collectively lucky to live in an age in which those definitions (and those dictating what an artist looks like, for that matter) are changing. Not fast enough, perhaps, not soon enough \u2014 I had no idea it was going to take this long \u2014 but changing nonetheless. The same can be said of beauty, generally. This issue is a celebration of all the different ways beauty is expressed and manifested, and all the different faces it wears. That redefinition begins with our cover, which, along with Chicago, features two other beautiful people: the Dominican-American model Dilone, whom I love for her coltish, spunky grace; and the model I came into adulthood admiring, Jenny Shimizu. If you are an Asian-American of a certain age, then the Japanese-American Shimizu\u2019s arrival on the scene \u2014 via a now-iconic 1994 CK One ad \u2014 was a jolt, and a promise. What we didn\u2019t know was that it would be an unacceptable number of years until we\u2019d once again see an Asian face in a major ad campaign. As image-makers, our job is to make sure that with every month, our definition of beauty gets a little more expansive.

Those suspicions were not assuaged when in 2013 Syria signed onto the Chemical Weapons Convention and claimed to give up its chemical weapons stocks.\n\n\u201cWe knew stuff was going on,\u201d Mr. Newcomb said. \u201cWe really wanted to up the game on chemical weapons programs, and we just weren\u2019t able to get what we needed to do so.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe report, which is more than 200 pages long, includes copies of contracts between North Korean and Syrian companies as well as bills of lading indicating the types of materials shipped. Much information was provided by unidentified United Nations member states.\n\nThe military-related cooperation, if confirmed, indicates major shortcomings in the international effort to isolate both countries. The shipments would have eluded detection even though both nations are subject to highly restrictive sanctions, and are under the intense scrutiny of American and other spy services.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s relationship with Syria takes up one section of the report, which also documents the many ways the government of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, has tried to circumvent sanctions. It describes how North Korea uses a complex web of shell companies and sympathetic foreign citizens to gain access to international financing, employs sophisticated cyber operations to steal military secrets and enlists its own diplomats in smuggling operations.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt also criticizes Russia and China for failing to do enough to enforce sanctions on items like oil, coal and luxury goods.\n\nThe sanctions, it says, have yet to be matched \u201cby the requisite political will, international coordination, prioritization and resource allocation necessary to drive effective implementation.\u201d\n\nThe report gives fresh details of a military relationship between North Korea and Syria that goes back decades. During the Arab-Israeli wars in the 1960s and 1970s, North Korean pilots flew missions with the Syrian Air Force. Later, North Korean technicians helped to develop Syria\u2019s arsenal of ballistic missiles and to build a nuclear power plant capable of producing plutonium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Israel destroyed the plant in 2007.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The unveiling ceremony, held as Syria\u2019s civil war raged, featured North Korean and Syrian dignitaries, military officials and a marching band.\n\nNorth Korea has provided training and support for Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program since at least the 1990s, according to a coming book by Bruce Bechtol, a former Korea analyst at the United States Defense Intelligence Agency who is now a professor at Angelo State University in Texas. The book also describes an accident in 2007 in which several Syrian technicians, along with North Korean and Iranian advisers, were killed in the explosion of a warhead filled with sarin gas and the extremely toxic nerve agent VX.\n\nThe relationship with Syria \u201chas been a boon for the North Korean military-industrial complex,\u201d Mr. Bechtol said in an interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe United Nations report says the cooperation continued during Syria\u2019s civil war, despite international sanctions. Crucial evidence of that was found in January 2017, when two ships carrying acid-resistant tiles, commonly used in the construction of chemical weapons factories, were interdicted at sea en route to Damascus, the report said.\n\nThose shipments were among five deliveries agreed to in a contract between a government-owned company in Syria and the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp., a North Korean company involved in arms exports, according to the report. It based those findings at least in part on copies of contracts provided by the shipping company, identified as Cheng Tong Trading Co. Ltd., based in China.\n\nVideo\n\nThe report said the three other shipments had been sent between Nov. 3 and Dec. 12, 2016.\n\nThe report did not say which country interdicted the two January tile shipments or whether the other three shipments were delivered to Damascus. The contract stipulated that the materials were to be delivered to the Metallic Manufacturing Factory, a company run by the Syrian government that was penalized by the United States Treasury Department last year for its involvement in Syria\u2019s weapons industry.\n\nSeveral months earlier, in August 2016, a delegation of North Korean missile technicians visited Syria, at which point there was a transfer of \u201cspecial resistance valves and thermometers known for use in chemical weapons,\u201d the report said, without elaborating. An unidentified United Nations member country told the report\u2019s authors that North Korean missile technicians worked at Syrian chemical weapons and missile facilities in Barzeh, Adra and Hama.\n\nIn 2013, after the Obama administration threatened military action in response to a sarin gas attack on the rebel enclave of Ghouta that some experts estimated killed 1,400 people, Mr. Assad agreed to destroy his stockpile and join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which comprises 192 countries that are to have dismantled their chemical weapons programs.\n\nBut Western officials and nonproliferation experts have long suspected that Mr. Assad retains some chemical weapons.\n\nSo far this year, according to diplomats and witnesses, several chlorine gas attacks have occurred in rebel-held areas in Ghouta, Idlib and Afrin. A separate United Nations panel also said Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were responsible for a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held village of Khan Sheikhoun last April that killed at least 83 people and sickened roughly 300.\n\nMallory Stewart, a former State Department official who was involved in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle Syria\u2019s chemical weapons program, said that there were always concerns that the Assad government had not listed all of its chemical weapons stockpile on its declared inventory of what it gave up. The report, she says, \u201cconfirms everything we\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly what we tried to do in the last administration is dismantle the entire chemical weapons program,\u201d Ms. Stewart said, \u201cwhich we know they never did.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEstablishing the origins of such weapons has been difficult. In November, Russia used its Security Council veto to end the work of an independent panel investigating chemical weapons used in the Syrian conflict.

One U.S. Bank employee left references to the staffing problem out of the minutes of internal meetings, fearful of what regulators would think, the Justice Department said. Tests of the alert system were halted after they showed that the bank had failed to report suspicious customer activity to regulators.\n\nDana Ripley, a U.S. Bank spokesman, said that most of the senior employees involved in the practices at issue had left by 2014, when the bank overhauled its anti-money laundering program.", "title": "U.S. Bank Cited by Federal Authorities for Lapses on Money Laundering", "authors": []}

The committee, known as Cfius, plays an advisory role to the president, but it can effectively block foreign acquisitions of American companies over national security concerns.\n\n\u201cDespite our best efforts to secure approval, it has become evident that Cfius will not clear this transaction,\u201d Mr. Tacelli said.

It\u2019s a conspiracy of pedophiles and their enablers.\u201d\n\nThe notion that American gymnastics was synonymous with the failures of its governing body has not sat well with American gymnasts, including Simone Biles, the 2016 Olympic all-around champion. Biles, 20, a survivor of Nassar\u2019s abuse who began training again last year, wrote pointedly on Twitter that gymnasts \u201cdon\u2019t stop working hard just because our organization is falling apart.\u201d\n\nAsked what they wanted the public to know, every gymnast interviewed said largely the same thing. None disputed the importance of organizational and cultural change in U.S.A. Gymnastics.

He had a history of money laundering and a thin legitimate cover business \u2014 a nearly bankrupt company that sold portable grills for streetside sausage salesmen, according to British incorporation papers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe distinction between an organized criminal and a Russian intelligence officer and a Russian who knows some Russian intel guys \u2014 it all blurs together,\u201d said Steven L. Hall, the former chief of Russia operations at the C.I.A. \u201cThis is the difficulty of trying to understand how Russia and Russians operate from the Western viewpoint.\u201d\n\nAmerican intelligence officials were also wary of the purported kompromat the Russian wanted to sell. They saw the information, especially the video, as the stuff of tabloid gossip pages, not intelligence collection, American officials said.\n\nBut the Americans desperately wanted the hacking tools. The cyberweapons had been built to break into the computer networks of Russia, China and other rival powers. Instead, they ended up in the hands of a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has since provided hackers with tools that infected millions of computers around the world, crippling hospitals, factories and businesses.\n\nNo officials wanted to refuse information they thought might help determine what had happened.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the bedeviling things about counterintelligence and the wilderness that it is \u2014 nobody wants to be caught in a position of saying we wrote that off and then five years later saying, \u2018Holy cow, it was actually a real guy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hall said.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies believe that Russia\u2019s spy services see the deep political divisions in the United States as a fresh opportunity to inflame partisan tensions. Russian hackers are targeting American voting databases ahead of the midterm election this year, they said, and using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media. The Russians are also particularly eager to cast doubt on the federal and congressional investigations into the Russian meddling, American intelligence officials said.\n\nPart of that effort, the officials said, appears to be trying to spread information that hews closely to unsubstantiated reports about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings in Russia, including the purported video, whose existence Mr. Trump has repeatedly dismissed.\n\nRumors that Russian intelligence possesses the video surfaced more than a year ago in an explosive and unverified dossier compiled by a former British spy and paid for by Democrats. Since then, at least four Russians with espionage and underworld connections have appeared in Central and Eastern Europe, offering to sell kompromat to American political operatives, private investigators and spies that would corroborate the dossier, American and European intelligence officials said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican officials suspect that at least some of the sellers are working for Russia\u2019s spy services.\n\nThe Times obtained four of the documents that the Russian in Germany tried to pass to American intelligence (The Times did not pay for the material). All are purported to be Russian intelligence reports, and each focuses on associates of Mr. Trump. Carter Page, the former campaign adviser who has been the focus of F.B.I. investigators, features in one; Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the billionaire Republican donors, in another.\n\nYet all four appear to be drawn almost entirely from news reports, not secret intelligence. They all also contain stylistic and grammatical usages not typically seen in Russian intelligence reports, said Yuri Shvets, a former K.G.B. officer who spent years as a spy in Washington before immigrating to the United States after the end of the Cold War.\n\nAmerican spies are not the only ones who have dealt with Russians claiming to have secrets to sell. Cody Shearer, an American political operative with ties to the Democratic Party, has been crisscrossing Eastern Europe for more than six months to secure the purported kompromat from a different Russian, said people familiar with the efforts, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid damaging their relationship with him.\n\nReached by phone late last year, Mr. Shearer would say only that his work was \u201ca big deal \u2014 you know what it is, and you shouldn\u2019t be asking about it.\u201d He then hung up.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\n\nMr. Shearer\u2019s efforts grew out of work he first began during the 2016 campaign, when he compiled a pair of reports that, like the dossier, also included talk of a video and Russian payoffs to Trump associates. It is not clear what, if anything, Mr. Shearer has been able to purchase.\n\nBefore the Americans were negotiating with the Russian, they were dealing with a hacker in Vienna known only to American intelligence officials as Carlo. In early 2017, he offered to provide them with a full set of hacking tools that were in the hands of the Shadow Brokers and the names of other people in his network, American officials said. In exchange, he wanted immunity from prosecution in the United States.\n\nBut the immunity deal fell apart, so intelligence officials decided to do what spies do best: They offered to buy the data. That is when the Russian in Germany emerged, telling the Americans he would handle the sale.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike Carlo, he had previously dealt with American intelligence operatives, American and European officials said. He served as a fixer, of sorts, brokering deals for Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., which is the successor to the Soviet K.G.B. American intelligence officials said that he had a direct link to Nikolai Patrushev, a former F.S.B. director, and that they knew of previous work he had done helping move illicit shipments of semiprecious metals for a Russian oligarch.\n\nBy last April it appeared that a deal was imminent. Several C.I.A. officers even traveled from the agency\u2019s headquarters to help the agency\u2019s Berlin station handle the operation.\n\nAt a small bar in the former heart of West Berlin, the Russian handed the American intermediary a thumb drive with a small cache of data that was intended to provide a sample of what was to come, American officials said.\n\nWithin days, though, the deal turned sour. American intelligence agencies determined that the data was genuinely from the Shadow Brokers, but was material the group had already made public. As a result, the C.I.A. said it would not pay for it, American officials said.\n\nThe Russian was furious. But negotiations limped on until September, when the two sides agreed to try again.\n\nLate that month, the American businessman delivered the $100,000 payment. Some officials said it was United States government money but routed through an indirect channel.\n\nA few weeks later, the Russian began handing over data. But in multiple deliveries in October and December, almost all of what he delivered was related to the 2016 election and alleged ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and Russia, not the N.S.A. or C.I.A. hacking tools.\n\nIn December, the Russian said he told the American intermediary that he was providing the Trump material and holding out on the hacking tools at the orders of senior Russian intelligence officials.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEarly this year, the Americans gave him one last chance. The Russian once again showed up with nothing more than excuses.\n\nSo the Americans offered him a choice: Start working for them and provide the names of everyone in his network \u2014 or go back to Russia and do not return.\n\nThe Russian did not give it much thought. He took a sip of the cranberry juice he was nursing, picked up his bag and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d Then he walked out the door.", "title": "U.S. Spies, Seeking to Retrieve Cyberweapons, Paid Russian Peddling Trump Secrets", "authors": ["Matthew Rosenberg"]}

Sakharov, the famed Russian dissident, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and nuclear physicist.\n\nSuch moves are not limited to Russia, either.\n\nCongress proposed renaming the street on which the Chinese Embassy sits in honor of Liu Xiaobo, the dissident and Nobel laureate who died last year. Beijing called that effort \u201ca political farce.\u201d In 2014, Chinese commentators retaliated by suggesting renaming the street in front of the American Embassy in Beijing \u201cSnowden Street\u201d for Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who disclosed secret documents detailing the United States\u2019 mass surveillance programs, or \u201cOsama bin Laden Road.\u201d Neither capital acted on the suggestions.\n\nNor is the practice limited to major powers. On Monday, the mayor of Ankara, the Turkish capital, approved renaming a street outside the United States Embassy \u201cOlive Branch,\u201d after Turkey\u2019s continuing military campaign in Syria. The United States and Turkey have found themselves awkwardly on opposite sides of the fighting in Syria, because of the American military\u2019s support for a Kurdish militia. The proposal is expected to be approved just days before Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson is expected in Ankara on Thursday.\n\nPreviously, the Islamic Republic of Iran famously stripped the name of Winston Churchill from the street outside the British Embassy in Tehran and renamed it after Bobby Sands, a member of the Irish Republican Army who died in prison on hunger strike.\n\nLast year, the Iranians also named the street where the Saudi Arabian Embassy sits after Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a clerical leader from the Shiite Muslim minority who was executed in the kingdom.", "title": "U.S. and Russia Revive Cold-War Game of Provocative Street Names", "authors": []}

American negotiators are working to rewrite trade pacts with Mexico and South Korea, in large part because these countries run large bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.\n\nSome left-leaning groups that support the president\u2019s promises to end offshoring embraced the view that the administration\u2019s trade policies simply haven\u2019t gone far enough.\n\n\u201cThe same trade policy that Trump attacks ferociously and promised to speedily replace is still in place,\u201d said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the deficit is up because in year one there has been a wide gulf between Trump\u2019s fiery trade rhetoric and action.\u201d\n\nDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent promises to reduce the trade deficit, many economists believe that his trade policies will be largely powerless to reverse the trend. That\u2019s because the overall trade deficit is governed by macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. So while changes in trade policy can shift imports and exports from one country to another, for example, reducing the American trade deficit with China while increasing its trade deficit with Thailand, they are unlikely to reduce the American trade deficit overall.\n\nAnd Mr. Trump\u2019s signature economic policy so far \u2014 the $1.5 trillion tax cut \u2014 is likely to widen the trade deficit in coming years by encouraging more investment in the United States, many economists say.\n\nBryan Riley, director of the Free Trade Initiative at the National Taxpayers Union, said that an increase in the trade deficit from the prior year \u201cshould not be viewed as a problem to be fixed, but as a predictable result of a growing economy that enables people to afford more imports.\u201d\n\nEswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, cautioned against Mr. Trump\u2019s interpretation of the bilateral trade deficit as a scorecard for an economic relationship.", "title": "U.S.-China Trade Deficit Hits Record, Fueling Trade Fight", "authors": []}

For Waymo, the financial terms were not as important as scoring concessions on not using Waymo\u2019s technology, said a person familiar with Waymo\u2019s deliberations who was not authorized to discuss them.\n\nThe settlement included an agreement that none of Waymo\u2019s confidential information was being incorporated in Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology.\n\nAfter almost a decade of work on self-driving cars, the Uber stake may be the first substantial money that Waymo has made from the technology.

He calls his father \u201cchief kebab engineer.\u201d\n\nAll meats are presented in broad, shallow wooden bowls that might elsewhere be destined for salad. Each plate, generously priced under $10, is identical in its accessories \u2014 a handful of cucumbers and tomatoes, yogurt and Uighur polo, a dish general to Central Asia. To make polo (akin to pilaf), rice is cooked with carrots, olive oil and bone-in lamb that\u2019s left in the pot until the very end. (In Kashgar, Mr. Yakup said, they would keep the meat to eat, but for people here \u201cit\u2019s not soft enough.\u201d)\n\nThe menu also lists naan (flatbread) as part of each plate, but all I received was a panel of dough blanketing the bottom of each bowl, skinny and stiff as a store-bought tortilla. In Beijing, I once watched a Uighur baker pull rounds of naan from the cavernous mouth of a tonur (akin to a tandoor), the bread thick and half-blackened \u2014 nothing like this.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt wasn\u2019t naan, as it turned out, but in fact a tortilla, meant to be decorative, like a placemat. Two wedges of naan were supposed to go on top, chewy flatbread from an Uzbek bakery in Queens; someone in the kitchen had simply forgotten to put them on my plates, Mr. Yakup explained apologetically. He hopes to bake his own some day. \u201cThere are hundreds of kinds,\u201d he said. \u201cOnes big as the wheels of a car, ones small as fists.\u201d\n\nThe dining room is a minimalist black box, with orders placed and picked up at the counter and tables up for grabs.

In other words, it\u2019s not the easiest place to build the dense housing required by a growing city.\n\nNeither housing nor open space was much of a concern in 1825, when a black shoeshiner named Andrew Williams bought three lots there; the area was several miles from the center of New York City, then concentrated below 14th Street. Several other black residents soon joined him in buying property, as did the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, whose building likely sat atop the foundation.

The transition included an 1821 law that gave suffrage to free black males \u2014 provided they owned at least $250 worth of property. By 1845, more than 10 percent of the city\u2019s black voters lived in Seneca Village.\n\nSeneca Village is usually remembered as a free black community, but by the end of its existence, nearly a third of its population was white \u2014 mostly Irish immigrants who had escaped the potato famine, along with a few Germans.\n\nIn the debate over where to place the great park, however, uptown landowners and newspapers painted the village as a shantytown at risk of becoming the next Five Points, occasionally describing it with racial slurs.\n\nThe initial choice was along the waterfront on the Upper East Side, but those landowners had enough clout to make the city look elsewhere, unlike the residents of Seneca Village.\n\nThe state authorized the city to claim the land through eminent domain, reportedly undervaluing many properties. The community disbanded, failing to form again elsewhere.

Removing her from public view for any length of time potentially affects attendance, so museum officials tried to keep the examination period as short as possible, and to keep her in the public eye as much as possible.\n\nInstead of taking her up to the restoration studio, Emilie Gordenker, the Mauritshuis\u2019s director, decided to put the whole research project on display in the museum\u2019s Golden Room, a regal chamber with 18th century d\u00e9cor, where the \u201cGirl\u201d and the research team will be enclosed in glass partitions while video monitors allow visitors to observe what\u2019s happening inside.

In 1994, researchers employed tools such as X-radiography, UV photography and infrared reflectography, and took tiny paint samples out of the painting.\n\nToday\u2019s imaging tools are noninvasive, which means there\u2019s nary a brush or Q-tip in sight, and there will be no removal of particles. The technologies that have been brought together for this examination will \u201ccull a few terabytes of data,\u201d said Joris Dik, one of the lead researchers, from Delft University of Technology.

He is widely regarded as a leading academic proponent of the views that the Fed should focus on controlling inflation and minimize its interference with financial markets, both popular positions among conservative Republicans.\n\nThose views and his stumbling performance at his January confirmation hearing, in which he struggled to explain why his inflation predictions after the economic crisis a decade ago were wrong, have solidified Democratic opposition. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said he was voting against Mr. Goodfriend because he questioned his commitment to the Fed\u2019s dual mandate, which requires the central bank to pursue maximum employment in addition to stabilizing inflation.\n\nHe said Mr. Goodfriend, who repeatedly criticized the Fed\u2019s post-crisis economic stimulus campaign, had a record of \u201cprioritizing hypothetical inflation over real people losing jobs.\u201d\n\nSenator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who has often voted for the Trump administration\u2019s nominees, said he opposed Mr. Goodfriend because of his comments at the hearing that there was no need for the federal government to guarantee 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said Thursday that he was concerned about a paper Mr. Goodfriend wrote in 2000 proposing that the government put magnetic strips on money so it could, under certain circumstances, impose a tax on cash. The proposal was intended to help the government encourage spending during periods of low inflation and low interest rates.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound very exciting to me,\u201d Mr. Paul, a libertarian, said Thursday.\n\nMr. Goodfriend has since abandoned the specific proposal, but in his academic writings he has continued to advocate other forms of \u201cnegative interest rates\u201d \u2014 policies that make it expensive to hold money when the government wants to encourage spending.\n\nRepublicans have a 51-vote Senate majority, and Vice President Mike Pence is available to break ties.

Democrats in 2008 refused to vote on a pair of President George W. Bush\u2019s nominees. Republicans responded two years later by blocking the confirmation of Peter Diamond, who won a Nobel Prize in economics while he was waiting for a Senate vote.

A protest was planned for Friday, and earlier this week, the word \u201cWynn\u201d was vandalized with black paint.

Allegations against Mr. Cosby, who faces criminal charges as well as lawsuits, have included claims that he drugged women to have sex with them, and that he sexually assaulted a woman on Penn\u2019s campus during the Penn Relays track meet, where he was officiating in 2004.\n\nIn 2015, the university rebuffed calls to revoke Mr. Cosby\u2019s honorary degree. At that time, the university said that while the allegations against Mr. Cosby were deeply troubling, \u201cit is not our practice to rescind honorary degrees.\u201d\n\nBefore Thursday, Penn had not rescinded an honorary degree in a century, since it took similar action against Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff of Germany during World War I.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn explaining the university\u2019s decision, which was made by an executive committee of the board of trustees, Dr. Gutmann and Mr. Cohen wrote that once the committee decided that Mr. Wynn\u2019s honorary degree, bestowed in 2006, needed to be revoked, it had to do the same with Mr. Cosby\u2019s 1990 honor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe decision to remove the name Wynn Commons could not be made independently of considering the other ways in which the university had previously recognized Mr. Wynn,\u201d the email said. \u201cIt became necessary, therefore, to consider the appropriateness of Mr. Wynn\u2019s honorary degree and any other honorifics Penn had previously bestowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat decision in turn made it also clear that the multiple and highly credible charges involving Bill Cosby warranted the same action.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They may have been evolution\u2019s version of an especially useful Tinkertoy piece: versatile, easy to assemble in new configurations, already in the tool kit.\n\nIt may have been a similar situation for this protein implicated in both taste and balance.\n\nEmily Liman of the University of Southern California, who led the study, and colleagues were on the hunt for a sour sensor when they made the discovery chronicled in their latest paper. They had made a list of all the genes expressed in sour taste cells and identified those that might make cells sensitive to acids.

When he took the White House job last summer, he was seen by many as a mature figure who could impose order on a chaotic building. By most accounts, he has indeed created a more organized operation. But he has also generated repeated furors with words and deeds.\n\nHe engaged in a heated back-and-forth with an African-American Democratic congresswoman, distorting statements she had made at a ceremony they both attended. He opined that the Civil War resulted from \u201cthe lack of an ability to compromise.\u201d He said that Mr. Trump had not been \u201cfully informed\u201d about border issues as a candidate and had since \u201cevolved,\u201d drawing a public retort from the president.\n\nMr. Kelly generated further heat this week when he dismissed many of the more than one million immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children but who did not apply for the protection of an Obama-era program that Mr. Trump ordered ended next month. Some of them \u201cwere the people that some would say were too afraid to sign up, others would say were too lazy to get off their asses, but they didn\u2019t sign up,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nMr. Kelly at first came to the defense of Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary, who resigned in the face of allegations of spousal abuse. \u201cRob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor, and I can\u2019t say enough good things about him,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cHe is a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional.\u201d\n\nAs outrage grew over a photograph showing an ex-wife of Mr. Porter with a black eye, Mr. Kelly issued a new statement. \u201cI was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no place for domestic violence in our society.\u201d But he added: \u201cI stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Porter\u2019s case raised questions about what Mr. Kelly knew and when.

In that role he saw up close the rapid spread of Type 2 diabetes among children, and he was particularly struck by the link between the disease and socioeconomic status.\n\nLooking at maps of San Francisco, he said, he noticed that diabetes hospitalization rates differed tenfold from one neighborhood to the next, driven by factors like income, education levels, segregation and soda consumption rates. While the public discourse around Type 2 diabetes tended to revolve around \u201cshame and blame\u201d \u2014 the idea that people who develop the disease knowingly make bad choices \u2014 Dr. Schillinger looked at these diabetes hot spots and began to think of the crisis as a social and environmental problem.\n\nMany of his diabetes patients live in poor neighborhoods awash in fast food chains, liquor stores and billboards advertising junk foods. With severely limited incomes, his patients are often forced to purchase the cheapest, highest-calorie meals to feed their families, which often means choosing packaged goods and fast foods instead of fresh produce. Many are riddled with chronic stress from poverty and the threat of violence in their neighborhoods.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI have many patients who say they will not let their kids go outside and play after school or after dark because they\u2019re afraid of gangs and shootouts,\u201d he said.\n\nOne day he attended a Youth Speaks event where he saw an overweight 16-year-old girl perform a poem about her body image issues, her addiction to junk food and the diabetes that runs in her family.\n\n\u201cShe was describing how she was eating cupcakes even as she wheeled her aunt who had diabetes and kidney failure into her dialysis appointment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was basically a food addiction poem in the context of the diabetes epidemic, with the addiction being a consequence of poverty, stress and insecurity. There were so many forces acting on this child that the pathways inevitably led to diabetes.\u201d\n\nA light bulb went off for Dr. Schillinger and for James Kass, then executive director of Youth Speaks. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, the U.C.S.F.

Meta!\n\nThe literary passage is from a book by Alison Frankel, \u201cDouble Eagle,\u201d about the amazing history of the 1933 $20 gold coins that were minted, but never circulated, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the United States off the gold standard in an effort to stave off the Depression. There are more twists and turns of fate in the journey of one of these gold coins than in most thrillers. First it gets coin-napped from the U.S. Mint, which was about to melt it down; then it disappears during a world war, turns up in a coup, almost gets destroyed on 9/11, and, in 2002, makes one coin dealer about $3 million at auction (after he was jailed for possessing it and had to fight the American government for joint ownership).\n\nI daresay one of you aspiring cinemateurs could make a go of it.

There were signs on Monday that those issues had not gone away.\n\nFirst among them is Egypt\u2019s relationship with North Korea, which has grown into a significant point of contention. North Korea has a large embassy in Cairo, which American officials say is used to illegally sell arms and evade international sanctions. American demands that Egypt downgrade its ties to North Korea were a major factor in Mr. Tillerson\u2019s decision last August to slash $96 million in military aid to Egypt, and to freeze a further $195 million.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Shoukry acknowledged that North Korea had come up, but insisted that Egypt\u2019s relationship with North Korea was \u201climited to representation, and there is almost no existing economic or other areas of cooperation.\u201d Mr. Tillerson did not comment on North Korea ties.\n\nAmerican officials say that Mr. Tillerson is still concerned over Mr. Sisi\u2019s treatment of civil society and aid groups, which since May have been subject to a draconian new law that some fear will force them to close. With Mr. Sisi, Mr. Tillerson said they discussed \u201cthe importance of the protection and promotion of human rights and the vital role of civil society in Egypt.\u201d\n\nAmerican officials also are concerned about the resurrection of a court case involving 43 Western and Arab democracy workers who were convicted, many of them in absentia, in 2013.\n\nThe politically charged prosecution, which targeted employees of the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, as well as other groups, elicited sharp criticism of Egypt in Congress.

She seems to make an appearance in the Times puzzle every 30 years or so, but I\u2019d never heard of her, her \u201csignature song,\u201d or even the movie that song came from (\u201cHello, Frisco, Hello\u201d). Some of this can be explained by time, and by the fact that, according to her Times obituary, Alice Faye was one of those \u201cfew movie stars to walk away from stardom at the peak of her career.\u201d\n\nIn the department of what goes around comes around, an orchestration of Ms. Faye\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Know\u201d appears on the soundtrack for \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d and that soundtrack is nominated for an Oscar this year.\n\n9D: On Saturdays, we get clues like this. \u201cRequest for backup?\u201d seemed to call for a pun in its punctuation, and I thought of \u201cbackups\u201d like floppy disks, understudies, traffic jams \u2026 I just got cleverer and cleverer to no avail.

The decision to knock Pluto off the mobile is still controversial, and there are arguments to expand the solar system even further \u2014 so this clue could be obsolete, one day. But not today!\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nSam: Talk about goals: Once upon a time, I was an avid solver absolutely obsessed with Byron\u2019s work. His grids were always loaded with interesting answers; how was he able to fill such wide-open areas so smoothly \u2026 and with such a unique touch? After meeting him at the ACPT a few years ago, we realized how similar our approaches to themeless puzzles were, and last spring over Facebook chat, I got the green light I\u2019d been looking for: \u201cWe should collab sometime on a themeless \u2014 would be fun to see what we could come up with.\u201d After briefly fainting, I set out to make the craziest, most wide-open grid I could, just so I could compare with Byron\u2019s normal wavelength. Beginning with PIBB XTRA crossing LGBT ___, I designed the grid skeleton you see now, filling in the NW corner all the way down to AREA CODE MAP / SON OF ADAM (sorry about EYE-HAND!). I passed it off to Byron, and with several grid constraints already in play, was worried that he\u2019d have trouble with what remained. Well, not only did he prove that something was possible \u2026 he made a freaking MINI-THEME out of the SE stack. Unbelievable! The swath of white space leading into the NE corner was by far the hardest to fill, but it ended up being the most fun. We bounced around various possible fills \u2014 Byron had SAW GERRERA work at one point! \u2014 but nothing was quite satisfying enough. Finally, the non-database-discoverable GO ASK ANYONE came to mind, and that proved to be the breakthrough. We\u2019re thrilled with the final result, and hope it kicked off well with Byron\u2019s brilliant HALL PASS clue. Huge thanks to Byron for working with me on an unforgettable puzzlemaking experience. Whew! It may be a bit before I wade back into 64-word waters \u2026 we\u2019ll see. Byron: When Sam sent me that corner, I almost sent it back saying this was too good to share, but I\u2019m not that noble. It already had plenty of good stuff in the fill. The main thing, I thought, was to round the corner heading SE in a reasonable way that maintained the openness into the smaller corners. My general goal when constructing, especially themelesses, is to find one bottleneck in the grid that is hard to eliminate and find a way to eliminate it. In this case, that meant maintaining the AREA CODE MAP / SON OF ADAM combo and running something long through them. My self-indulgence was trying to do that with KAZAKHS and DANZA, the former for the crazy consonant mash-up and the latter as a hat tip since my wife has very fond memories of working with him in her former career in film production. It was so much fun working with Sam.

He was admitted to the hospital shortly afterward, and so far is doing well.\n\nBut I wondered whether the delays in his treatment hadn\u2019t worsened his chance of being cured. I understand that, particularly in this age of breathtakingly expensive cancer treatment, there is a need for checks and balances on our treatment recommendations and their potential benefit.

The reader can\u2019t know if the Shadow Man is real because he never makes an appearance, but it is he who has orchestrated the death of Codama so the unnamed author in the mystery story can be framed for murder, tortured and forced to confess, then be executed. By the end of the fictional sequel, the Shadow Man murders the fictional Codama and the state executes the fictional author. However, the reader will discover that the author is innocent because the diabolical Shadow Man has engineered the execution of both writers.\n\nMizuno is a morally suspect, slothful and self-centered man, yet he\u2019s sufficiently talented that his social misdemeanors \u2014 rent arrears, missed deadlines, personal debts, lies, cruelty to others \u2014 are tolerated. Here, as elsewhere in Tanizaki\u2019s oeuvre, there are recognizable sexual obsessions and female types. Mizuno has an ex-wife who left him because he wrote too many wife-murder stories; she ends up marrying a Methodist minister and converting to Christianity. Then Mizuno falls under the spell of Fr\u00e4ulein, a heartless Japanese prostitute who speaks German and eats black bread and sausages.

A Rolex Submariner, for example, costs about 30 percent less in Miami than it would in Brazil, according to Elton Morimitsu, a research analyst who focuses on Brazil\u2019s luxury market for Euromonitor.\n\nIn addition, industry experts say, Miami offers a broader selection of brands and watches than would be found in the typical Latin American city. In the Miami Design District, a large complex of upscale designer boutiques that\u2019s been developed over the last few years (and where Watches & Wonders will be held), Herm\u00e8s has a 13,500-square-foot triplex space and Louis Vuitton\u2019s store sprawls over four floors.\n\n\u201cWe chose Miami because it is a hub between North America and South America,\u201d said Fabienne Lupo, chairwoman and managing director of the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie, the industry organization that oversees Watches & Wonders and the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, held last month in Geneva. \u201cNothing had been done in Miami in terms of a fine watchmaking event, and we really wanted to put it on the map.\u201d\n\nDuring the event, the 15 participating brands that have stores in the district \u2014 including Piaget, IWC Schaffhausen and Hublot as well as Herm\u00e8s and Louis Vuitton \u2014 will have in-store displays of new watches and special demonstrators like the Argentine bootmaker at Jaeger-LeCoultre and the master watchmakers at Van Cleef & Arpels. Six other brands, including Romain Jerome and Armin Strom, will open temporary stores; and lectures, workshops and an exhibition will be held in a building in the district.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor several luxury watch brands, Mexico has become a particular focus: Sales there were up 12 percent last year, and 9.2 percent in 2016, according to Euromonitor International. And some brands are outpacing that growth; Parmigiani Fleurier\u2019s Mexico sales increased by 30 percent in 2017. Mexican luxury watch sales from all brands amounted to nearly $500 million last year, more than half of those in Latin America overall.\n\n\u201cIn the region, the market that is really pulling the business is Mexico,\u201d said Michel Cheval, IWC\u2019s regional brand director for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cThere are lots of opportunities. Mexico is really the country where now the industry is focusing.\u201d His brand, for example, expanded its footprint in Mexico City a couple of years ago beyond the local retailers Berger Joyeros and Peyrelongue Chronos to include in-store shops in two locations of El Palacio De Hierro, an upscale department store chain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd Hublot plans to open three boutiques in Mexico this year, including one next month in the new Artz Pedregal development in Mexico City.\n\n\u201cMexico, for sure, is the star,\u201d said Antonio Seward, chief executive of Audemars Piguet North America and a former managing director of Latin America for the company. \u201cIt has always been, even before the current global efforts of the luxury brands in Mexico. Even in the 1990s, it was very strong. In terms of maturity, in terms of customer base, it is by far No. 1.\u201d\n\nAudemars Piguet has found that, in Mexico, pink gold outsells stainless steel, and that the best-selling sizes of its classic Royal Oak model are on the larger side, with diameters of 41 to 44 millimeters. So it is introducing a 100-piece limited edition pink gold Royal Oak at 41 millimeters that was designed with the Mexican market in mind and will be displayed at Watches & Wonders.\n\nPhoto\n\nSuch limited editions, and the message of exclusivity they convey, tend to resonate in Latin America.\n\nWatch fans there \u201care very interested in something that is unique, with craft,\u201d said Hamdi Chatti, vice president of watches and jewelry at LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton. \u201cThey like something distinctive.\u201d Louis Vuitton, for example, monogrammed a watch movement for one client in the region, and recently created customized watches based on its Tambour style so a group of Brazilian collectors could select the metals and the bezel gemstones for their timepieces.\n\nMany styles that will be shown at the fair are particularly well-suited to the Latin American market, which leans toward large-faced watches, often with a decidedly sporty feel (although many Chileans, industry experts said, are the exceptions \u2014 preferring traditional looks). So Panerai, known for its large watches, will showcase its L\u2019Astronomo Luminor 1950 Tourbillon Moonphase GMT, which is 50 millimeters in diameter, and the Luminor Due 3 Days Automatic Acciaio, which comes in three sizes, including a 45-millimeter version.\n\nFor Latin American watch fans, there is one practical aspect to buying and wearing luxury watches in locations like Miami rather than at home: less fear of theft.\n\nIn the region, \u201cyou don\u2019t see a lot of expensive watches on people\u2019s wrists in the street \u2014 it\u2019s potentially dangerous,\u201d Mr. Cheval of IWC said. \u201cPeople buy them to collect, and to wear at private events, private parties, dinners at home and also when they travel.\u201d\n\nAll of which makes Miami that much more appealing to hungry shoppers.\n\n\u201cJust that notion that you don\u2019t have to worry as much is very comforting for the Latin American and Mexican customers when they go to Miami,\u201d Mr. Seward of Audemars Piguet said. \u201cThat is a luxury in itself: to be able to enjoy them, to not just have them in your safe but be able to wear them and not just wear them at home, but be able to have lunch in a restaurant.\u201d", "title": "Watches & Wonders, Now in Miami, Hopes to Lure Latin American Buyers", "authors": ["Rachel Felder"]}

Waymo is considered a leader in autonomous vehicles, and was pouring resources into research and development long before other companies.\n\nBut in the last few years, competitors have been hiring former Google engineers for their own self-driving-car projects. Among them, Uber is considered formidable because it has billions to spend and can test the technology using its vast ride-sharing network.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn an indication of how closely this case is being followed, a line to get into the courtroom at the federal courthouse in San Francisco started forming an hour before the trial was scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m.\n\nThe witness list includes technology billionaires like Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former chief executive, and Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet. The judge, William Alsup, even said he had been informed that someone was impersonating him on Twitter.\n\nWaymo argues that Uber has misappropriated eight trade secrets pertaining mainly to lidar \u2014 an abbreviation for \u201clight detecting and ranging\u201d \u2014 sensors that help the cars navigate on their own. The company is asking for an injunction preventing Uber from developing an autonomous vehicle using its lidar technology. In addition, it wants financial compensation for Uber\u2019s use of the technology.\n\nWaymo\u2019s lawyers repeatedly drew a comparison to Ms. Ruiz, one of the most brazen cheaters in sports history. Charles K. Verhoeven, Waymo\u2019s lawyer, said Uber, like the disgraced marathoner, wanted to win no matter what and realized that it couldn\u2019t win playing by the rules.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing this case because Uber is cheating,\u201d said Mr. Verhoeven, who is a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. \u201cThey took our technology to win at all costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe highlighted internal communications from Uber executives talking about how winning was an imperative and saying that the company needed to find \u201ccheat codes.\u201d The internal messages also noted that the lidar technology being developed by Mr. Levandowski was essential for Uber\u2019s success in self-driving cars and that there was no substitute.\n\nIn their opening statements, Uber\u2019s lawyers countered that the company had developed its technology on its own and that any similarities were due to the information\u2019s being generally known or easy to figure out for Uber\u2019s engineers. And there is no evidence that any of Google\u2019s technology made its way to Uber, they said.\n\nSo why, then, has Waymo dragged Uber into court?

Mr. Carmody said the hiring of Mr. Levandowski, a pioneer in the field of self-driving vehicles, wasn\u2019t an act of desperation. Instead, it was the act of a strong team trying to land the best available talent \u2014 the way the Golden State Warriors signed the basketball star Kevin Durant in 2016 to an already championship-caliber lineup.\n\nAt the same time, Uber also distanced itself from Mr. Levandowski, who is expected to exercise his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination when he is called to testify.

But when Mr. LaPierre, the leader of the National Rifle Association, addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, he invoked the Second Amendment in much the same way that a significant portion of the left has long spoken of the rights it values. According to this conception, rights are zones of personal autonomy where the individual owes no explanation and the community has no jurisdiction. This manner of thinking about rights is a serious barrier to reasonable regulations of firearms. The N.R.A. ritually claims the mantle of the Constitution, but the American founders who framed it had a far richer view in which individual rights were subject to considerations of the common good.\n\nThere may be good reasons not to regulate firearms further, but the individual\u2019s absolute claim that his or her guns are nobody\u2019s business is not one of them. To even make this assertion is an illustration of what the legal scholar and diplomat Mary Ann Glendon calls \u201cthe illusion of absoluteness,\u201d an idea that is hostile to the possibility of political community. All rights have limits. The question is who determines them. For the framers of the Constitution, the answer was that the people do.\n\nOne of the earliest American assertions of rights, the 1641 Massachusetts Body of Liberties, delineated rights against everything from banishment to dismemberment but subjected them to regulation by the legislature. The community could take these actions only according to rules known in advance and equally applicable to all. The essence of rights in this early understanding was the rule of law \u2014 as propounded by the community \u2014 not the isolation of the individual.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, whose \u201cunalienable rights\u201d individualists are so quick to claim for themselves, dealt with rights similarly. In legal parlance, to \u201calienate\u201d something is to exchange it for an equivalent \u2014 precisely what individuals do with their rights when they form a political community. The Declaration\u2019s rights are coherently \u201cunalienable\u201d only if they are possessed by what the document calls \u201cone people.\u201d This interpretation is backed by the fact that many of the complaints against King George that the document proceeds to enumerate are not that he did something absolutely forbidden but rather that he did so without the legislature\u2019s consent.", "title": "Opinion | Wayne LaPierre\u2019s Unconstitutionalism", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-02-26 00:00:00", "text": "Legally, this should be an easy win for the unions. The Supreme Court upheld fair-share fees four decades ago in a unanimous ruling it has reaffirmed repeatedly, and on which more than 20 states have relied in negotiating thousands of contracts covering millions of public employees, including firefighters, teachers and police officers. The logic is simple: When the government is an employer, it has more control over its employees\u2019 speech than over that of regular citizens. Any burden the fees impose on employees\u2019 First Amendment rights is justified by the need to eliminate free riders \u2014 workers who enjoy union benefits without having to pay for them, which can deplete the unions\u2019 resources in states where they are legally required to represent all workers, members and nonmembers alike. Anti-union advocates dismiss the free-rider concern, but it\u2019s very real: In states that have ended the fees, more than one-third of public-school teachers are free riders.\n\nNone of this seems to register with Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who has made no secret of his dislike for that 1977 opinion, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, and has been searching for the votes to overturn it for at least six years, writing opinions intended to set up its demise. Justice Alito probably assumed he had victory in hand in 2016, when the court considered the same question in a case brought by California public-school teachers against their union. But when Justice Scalia, whose remarks during oral arguments strongly suggested he would provide the fifth vote against the union, died a few weeks later, the case deadlocked.\n\nAs it turned out, Justice Scalia\u2019s death only briefly slowed the march of corporate interests that have sought for years to protect their huge profits and kill off the last remnants of organized labor in America. They and the right-wing groups that support them quickly regrouped around another plaintiff, a child-support specialist from Illinois named Mark Janus, who makes the same argument the California teachers did: Activities by public-sector unions are inherently political, so it\u2019s impossible to separate the costs of collective bargaining from those of political lobbying. No matter what benefits the unions negotiate on his behalf, he shouldn\u2019t have to pay a dime. Mr. Janus lost decisively in the lower federal courts for the same reason the teachers did: the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent in the Abood case.\n\nThat precedent should guide the justices here, too. Beyond the court\u2019s core principle of stare decisis, which keeps it from overturning its own prior decisions except in extraordinary circumstances, the Abood decision reasonably balanced workers\u2019 First Amendment rights against the government\u2019s interest in labor peace. Two notable conservative scholars go further, arguing in a supporting brief to the court that the First Amendment does not apply at all in this case. The government is allowed to compel subsidies of others\u2019 speech all the time without violating the Constitution, they point out, such as by collecting and spending taxes.\n\nIn Monday\u2019s arguments, several of the conservative justices seemed immune to such reasoning. Justice Alito referred to fair-share fees as \u201ccompelled speech\u201d that infringes on a worker\u2019s \u201cdignity and conscience.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | We All Must Live With Mitch McConnell\u2019s Proudest Moment", "authors": []}

NBC has responded by learning to make money from viewers who stream its programs \u2014 and now it is learning how to put a number on it. The key is gathering statistics from services like NBC.com, the NBC app, video on demand and Hulu to determine how much money its shows are pulling in from streamers.\n\nTake \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d According to the network\u2019s data crunchers, NBC has earned around 47 percent of the revenue generated by its 2016 pilot episode from advertising through digital views. Over all, 44 percent of the revenue NBC has earned from \u201cThis Is Us\u201d has come through digital viewership.\n\nSimilarly, the critically acclaimed sitcom, \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, has earned roughly 36 percent of its revenue from digital advertising, NBC said.\n\nThe new source of revenue is NBC\u2019s attempt to make up for a larger decline in advertising dollars. Television ad sales fell 8 percent in 2017, one of the biggest drops in years, Bloomberg reported. That\u2019s why executives like Mr. Greenblatt need to make the digital business work sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not insignificant now,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think over time it grows into becoming really significant.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNot every show is making big money from digital views. About three-quarters of the revenue NBC made from the 2015 pilot of \u201cBlindspot,\u201d for instance, has been earned the old fashioned way.\n\nBut NBC was less savvy back then in extracting money from viewers who preferred streaming. By the time of the first \u201cThis Is Us\u201d season, NBC had wised up, striking a deal that allowed it to earn money from Hulu ads shown during episodes of the hit tear-jerker.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGenerating revenue from streaming is relatively new for the networks, said Jeff Bader, NBC\u2019s president of program planning, strategy and research.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They were just watching shows on their own schedules.\n\nNBC has intensified its efforts to measure the nontraditional audience with the Winter Olympics. Its latest ratings reports have combined the number of viewers it reaches through broadcast, cable and streaming platforms under a single figure it calls total audience delivery. This is the network\u2019s attempt to counter the Nielsen measure, which shows a shrinking Olympics audience.\n\nNBC understands the reason for the advertising community\u2019s skepticism concerning the number of people who watch shows via streaming, however.\n\n\u201cThat is the frustrating part of the whole ecosystem,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t have a third-party objective measuring system that everyone has adopted that we all buy into.\u201d\n\nUntil that third-party system emerges, Mr. Greenblatt said that his sales department has gone all-in on selling advertisers on a statistical portrait that is prettier than the one painted by Nielsen.\n\n\u201cThis started for me purely on looking at viewership numbers, because I wanted to be able to make the argument, \u2018People aren\u2019t just bailing on network TV,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen it occurred to us, it\u2019s not just a viewership number we\u2019re defending.

The lawsuit did not name Mr. Glasser, but it referred to him by his title and said that the sale of the company could result in employees\u2019 reporting to some of the same managers \u201cwho failed to investigate\u201d Mr. Weinstein\u2019s conduct or protect female employees from him.

The Weinstein brothers, who jointly own about 42 percent of the studio, would have received no cash from the proposed sale, with other equity holders also wiped out.\n\nEric Soufer, the director of communications for Mr. Schneiderman, said in a statement on Monday that the attorney general\u2019s office had \u201cproductive discussions with both parties\u201d during the past two weeks about how to accomplish his priorities.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that despite a clear path forward on those issues \u2014 including the buyer\u2019s commitment to dedicate up to $90 million to victim compensation and implement gold-plated H.R. policies \u2014 the parties were unable to resolve their financial differences,\u201d Mr. Soufer said. \u201cWe will continue to pursue justice for victims in the event of the company\u2019s bankruptcy, and our investigation into the pattern of egregious abuse by Harvey Weinstein and his enablers is ongoing.\u201d\n\nMs. Contreras-Sweet\u2019s group had pulled ahead of other bidders like Lionsgate by promising to keep the studio intact and the staff employed.

Our understanding of American modernism of the 1930s and 1940s is not complete without Price\u2019s contribution.\u201d\n\nWriting to a conductor in the \u201940s, Price described \u201can accumulation of hundreds of unpublished and unsubmitted manuscripts.\u201d She continued to compose up to her death; absent her tenacity and advocacy for her own music, her legacy was incompletely preserved and has had to be reconstructed piece by piece. But she was also meticulous, and the manuscripts that were discovered nine years ago, now in the University of Arkansas library with many of her other papers, are mostly complete and easily performed.\n\nThe question is, who will perform them. Even by late last year, when challenged by a group of local musicians to diversify their programming, the Boston Symphony replied that, while it was working on the problem, audiences still wanted to hear \u201cspecifically the universal masterworks composed between 1600 and the mid-1900s.\u201d The orchestra had programmed music by Price some months prior, but only a string quartet in a community concert, not one of the larger symphonic pieces she created as her style matured.\n\nIf American orchestras truly wish to diversify their programming \u2014 the Chicago Symphony and Philadelphia Orchestra, to name just two important examples, recently announced seasons without music by a single female composer, living or dead \u2014 Price is one of the many artists who deserves greater exposure. The Fort Smith Symphony in Arkansas is beginning a project to record her four symphonies for the Naxos label, based on editions prepared by the composer James Greeson, and in May will perform her First Symphony and (in a world premiere) the Fourth, another of the works unearthed in her summer house.\n\n\u201cWhile Price was quite proud of her accomplishments, she always felt like there was a limitation on the reception of her music, because of her race and because of her gender,\u201d Mr. Carter said. When she tried to find a publisher for her song \u201cSympathy,\u201d set to a Dunbar poem that later inspired Maya Angelou, one told her it was just a little bit too chromatic.\n\nMr. Carter speculates that Price identified with the caged bird in the poem.

Finally, a small sliver of the money will find its way into paychecks of rank-and-file employees, but it won\u2019t be a big boost and will probably come in the form of a temporary bonus, rather than a lasting raise.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts estimated that 43 percent of corporate tax savings would go to buybacks and dividends and nearly 19 percent would help pay for mergers and acquisitions. Just 17 percent would be used for capital investment, and even a smaller share, 13 percent, would go toward bonuses and raises. Other Wall Street analysts have issued similar reports. If more evidence was needed, Axios reported that just nine pharmaceutical companies have announced $50 billion in buybacks since the tax law was passed.\n\nMr. Trump might argue that it doesn\u2019t much matter that the tax cuts will be a boon for investors because many Americans own stocks. The president has recently touted the rising value of 401(k) accounts as a benefit of the tax law. But roughly half of all families own no stock, and most people have holdings that are worth less than $5,000. Most stock holdings, a whopping 84 percent, are in the hands of people whose incomes put them in the top 10 percent of households.\n\nRepublicans might further argue that none of this matters because the tax law is becoming more popular as people learn more about it. Indeed, a recent poll for The Times found that the law now has more supporters than opponents. But this swing in public sentiment might be less important than it appears. Consider the results of a recent Politico/Morning Consult poll that shows that just 25 percent of registered voters said they had noticed an increase in their paycheck because of lower tax withholding while 51 percent had not. The poll also found that high-income people were more likely to notice that their take-home pay had gone up. That\u2019s because Republicans designed the law to principally benefit wealthy families while offering crumbs to low-income and middle class families.\n\nThose crumbs, by the way, disappear after a few years. Further, many taxpayers in states like California, New Jersey and New York will be hit with higher tax bills when they file their 2018 tax returns and realize that they can now only deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes.\n\nThere was a legitimate argument for reforming the tax code in a way that reduced the corporate tax rate, closed loopholes and made the economy fairer and more productive. But Republicans chose a plan that rewards the rich at the expense of workers. They had to lie to make this scheme seem legitimate.

Did the court assume bias on the part of Mr. Steele or the funders of his research, as courts regularly do when considering evidence supporting a request for a warrant? The memo doesn\u2019t say.\n\nYou know what would help to answer questions like these? Even more transparency. It would be useful, for instance, if we could see all of the supporting evidence in the warrant application \u2014 with necessary redactions, of course, to protect sources and methods. Also helpful would be the 10-page response memo prepared by Representative Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, who, unlike Mr. Nunes, has actually seen the intelligence underlying the application.

Since the Florida shooting, a dozen others are considering similar measures.\n\nRhode Island has also joined with Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York in a coalition to combat gun violence. The group plans to create a multistate database to trace and intercept guns used in crimes or transported across state lines.\n\nFlorida\n\nLawmakers have proposed a package of gun measures that defy the powerful National Rifle Association, but fall well short of the more restrictive measures, like an assault weapons ban, favored by the shooting\u2019s survivors.\n\nGov. Rick Scott, a Republican, proposed raising the minimum age to buy assault rifles to 21 and called for a raft of measures he said could keep mentally ill or violent people from purchasing weapons and keep schools safer. Republicans in the House and Senate, who appear supportive of Mr. Scott\u2019s proposals, also called for a three-day waiting period on the purchase of those weapons, which already exists for those who wish to buy handguns.\n\nMr. Scott proposed $450 million in new funding for school security and $50 million in mental health funding and called for a law enforcement officer to be posted in every public school.\n\nPhoto\n\nVermont\n\nGov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has done an about-face in his rural state, where hunting is a major pastime and which has some of the most lax gun laws in the country. Even after the shooting, he told the Vermont publication Seven Days that he saw no need for changing laws. \u201cI believe our gun laws are balanced,\u201d said Mr. Scott, who has a 93 percent rating from the N.R.A.\n\nBut shortly after, a student at a Vermont high school was accused of planning a mass shooting.

The Senate Judiciary Committee last week unanimously passed one bill \u2014 to allow law enforcement to remove guns from people considered at extreme risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nThe committee was divided on the second, more controversial bill \u2014 an expansion of background checks \u2014 but in an unusual step, appeared ready to allow it to move to the Senate floor without a committee vote. The State House is likely to take up the two measures later next month.\n\nOregon\n\nThe day after the shooting, Oregon\u2019s House passed a bill making it illegal for people convicted of domestic violence or those with restraining orders against them to possess weapons, even if they are not married to, do not live with, or do not have children with their victims.\n\nOne of the three Republicans who joined Democrats in voting for the bill said pressure from groups like the N.R.A. made him want to \u201ccrawl under my desk in the fetal position,\u201d according to The Oregonian.

It would also make the sale of those weapons subject to state and federal background checks.\n\nThe bill would also create a program to allow students to report threats or potentially violent activity anonymously to the attorney general\u2019s office and would require the state to give grants to school districts for emergency response systems.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLawmakers in Washington are also working on a ban on bump stocks, which accelerate the rate of fire on semiautomatic firearms.

One would require gun dealers to be licensed, much like car dealerships or beauty salons. The other, similar to the \u201cextreme risk\u201d laws in other states, allows a judge to bar a person from possessing weapons if family members or law enforcement officers ask the court to do so.\n\nMr. Madigan said lawmakers this week would also introduce legislation to raise the minimum age to purchase military-style assault rifles to 21.\n\nIndiana\n\nSome bills loosening gun restrictions have advanced in the state since the Florida shooting, according to The Indianapolis Star. A Senate committee last week advanced a bill that would do away with a $125 fee for a lifetime license to carry a handgun, and would increase from four years to five years a permit that exempts holders from background checks when purchasing a handgun.\n\nIn the House, a committee passed a bill last week allowing people to carry weapons at churches that share property with schools, as long as they are working for or attending the church, and the church does not prohibit weapons. This month, before the shooting, the measure was passed by the full Senate.\n\nKansas\n\nThe state is considering legislation to lower the age at which people can carry hidden, loaded guns in public to 18 from 21, while also requiring anyone under 21 to get a permit, including for carrying their weapons on college campuses. The State House passed the measure earlier this month. It is now before the State Senate.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nThe House has passed a measure that the N.R.A. calls \u201cself-defense\u201d legislation.

Although rarely stated now with as much confidence as it was during its heyday in the 1990s, the efficient market hypothesis remains a background assumption of much central-bank and economic policy.\n\nThe hypothesis survived the absurdities of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and early 2000s, as well as the meltdown in derivative markets that led to the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. Although the hypothesis should have been refuted by those disasters, it lived on, if only in zombie form.", "title": "Opinion | What Bitcoin Reveals About Financial Markets", "authors": []}

The sea ice has always retreated during summer, even before climate change exacerbated the trend. Spring, just before the sea ice begins its seasonal breakup, is a critical time for polar bears to gain the weight they need to carry them through until the sea ice re-forms, so the researchers tracked the bears in April of 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\n\u201cSpring is the pupping season for the seals,\u201d said Dr. Bechshoft. \u201cThey don\u2019t move a whole lot so they\u2019re basically laid out as one big buffet for the bear to go around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course this presumes that the bears can find the seals in the first place. Less sea ice means the bears have to work harder to find them.\n\nThe researchers hypothesize that the bears\u2019 lazy hunting style \u2014 when it works \u2014 allows them to conserve energy, helping them survive through the summer months when food is scarce. But it\u2019s not working, and the problem is exacerbated by their high metabolism \u2014 their base metabolic rate was 60 percent more than scientists expected.\n\nUsing the GPS and video collars and the metabolic information, the researchers determined that the more a bear had to search for food the more energy it used. But less sea ice means they have to walk or swim more in search of food. And every additional mile that a polar bear has to traverse under its own power is that much more food the bear has to eat. The only way for the bears to restore that lost energy was to catch more seals.\n\n\u201cWe found that they were really dependent on their ability to catch seals,\u201d Mr. Pagano said. \u201cIf they were successful they did quite well.\u201d\n\nFour of the bears, mostly the older ones, did gain as much as 10 percent of their body mass over the study period. Because of the video footage, the researchers know that these bears gained weight because they caught seals. But because of the small study size, it was not possible to tell if this was a trend in which age brought wisdom, or if it was just a lucky week for the older bears. One bear that managed to catch some seals lost a negligible amount of weight.\n\nFour other bears lost up to 10 percent of their body mass over the same period, the result of not catching seals.\n\n\u201cThe other bears either scavenged or they fasted, and they all lost mass,\u201d as much as 10 percent of their body mass, Mr. Pagano said.\n\nAlthough the study results seemingly reflect the roughly 40 percent decline in polar bear populations seen in this part of the Arctic, the study was not broad enough to draw large conclusions. But the new information on how dwindling sea ice affects the health of female polar bears could be important for conservation efforts.\n\n\u201cNo sea ice, no polar bears, it\u2019s really simple,\u201d said Dr. Bechshoft.", "title": "What Cameras on Polar Bears Show Us: It\u2019s Tough Out There", "authors": ["Kendra Pierre-Louis"]}

Why?\n\nA recent article in The Times tracks New York City\u2019s changing dog preference by analyzing the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene\u2019s dog license registrations from 2012 to 2016, and comes to some interesting conclusions.\n\nIn \u201cThe Secret Code to a Changing New York: Its Dog,\u201d Stefanos Chen writes:\n\nNew York\u2019s dogs are as varied as its people, and their numbers can be just as telling. They can be a cipher for understanding gentrification, and sometimes predicting it \u2014 when the designer pups arrive, rising home prices may not be far behind. They become part of the identity of a neighborhood, and their shifting numbers, rising or falling, can say much about its future. Most of all, they say something about the humans who take them home. As housing prices rise in an area, dog breeds tend to skew smaller and more expensive. But certain breeds maintain their dominance, like the pit bull in certain parts of Brooklyn and the Rottweiler in the Bronx. ...Citywide, the top dog in 2016 was the Yorkshire terrier, or Yorkie, the well-coifed lap dog that grows to about seven pounds, followed by the Shih Tzu, another small dog, and the much larger Labrador retriever (up to 80 pounds). The Chihuahua came in fourth, followed by the muscular pit bull, which includes a number of terrier breeds. Next came the tiny Maltese and the brawny German shepherd (up to about 90 pounds). The beagle, poodle and Pomeranian rounded out the list. New York dogs had names like Max (the most popular), Bella, Coco, Charlie, Rocky and Lola. There was also a Biggie in every borough \u2014 156 registrations in all, ranging from a Rottweiler in Queens to a French bulldog in Staten Island \u2014 perhaps in honor of the Brooklyn-born rapper Biggie Smalls. By and large, cramped city living means smaller dogs. Overall, one-third of registrations, the most of any group, were toy dogs, the smallest type recognized by the American Kennel Club, ranging from about five to 20 pounds. But there were exceptions: SoHo, one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city, tied blue-collar Stapleton on Staten Island for the biggest share of dogs over 50 pounds \u2014 roughly 19 percent overall.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Even if you don\u2019t live in New York City and have never visited, what in this article was most telling to you about how dog breeds map to different neighborhoods?\n\n\u2014 What do you notice about the dogs in your area?

W. Norton & Company. (2006)\n\nOstensibly, this book is about Michael Oher, a black child who grew up poor in Memphis, raised by a crack-addicted mother until he was adopted by a family who helped him graduate high school and primed him for a career in professional football. (His story was adapted into a movie of the same name starring Sandra Bullock.) But Lewis also \u201ccontinues what he began with \u2018Moneyball,\u2019\u201d wrote our reviewer, \u201cadvancing a new genre of journalism that shows how market forces and economic reasoning shape the evolution of sports.\u201d Lewis explains how the success of Lawrence Taylor, a large and agile linebacker for the New York Giants, created a demand for left offensive tackles who could cover a quarterback\u2019s blind side; Taylor paved the way for Oher. According to our reviewer, even those disinclined to enjoy football will like this book.\n\nImage\n\nTHE EDUCATION OF A COACH\n\nBy David Halberstam\n\n277 pp. Hyperion. (2005)\n\nBill Belichick, the head coach for the New England Patriots, is not an easy subject. The writer calls him \u201ca hard man to reach and to understand completely.\u201d Yet our reviewer noted that Halberstam is \u201cgifted and inquisitive enough\u201d to make this story, about how Belichick became the coach he is today, work. Drawing on interviews with Belichick, Halberstam details the lessons the man has learned from other coaches he\u2019s worked with, starting with his father, Steve, a lifelong assistant coach who taught his son how to analyze game film. He chronicles Belichick\u2019s ambitious climb, demonstrating how, though lacking the charisma of other coaches, Belichick is a \u201cquiet man of chalk.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nABOUT THREE BRICKS SHY \u2026 AND THE LOAD FILLED UP\n\nA Highly Irregular Lowdown on the Year the Pittsburgh Steelers Were Super but Missed the Bowl\n\nBy Roy Blount Jr.\n\n310 pp. Little, Brown.

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "Global competition also drove American agricultural prices down. And the rules of the gold standard enforced tight money and credit conditions \u2014 what we would today call austerity policies. The consequent economic distress among farmers in the South and the West fueled the populist movement. The populists viewed the railroads as well as the financial and commercial interests of the Northeast, the defenders of the gold standard, as their main opponents. Throwing off the shackles of the gold standard and reclaiming national monetary sovereignty became their rallying cry.\n\nPopulism in the 21st century is as much a reaction to globalization as its late-19th-century version. While the backlash in the United States and Europe differs in specific details, the broad outlines are similar. Large segments of the workers in these advanced economies \u2014 older, less-skilled manufacturing employees and the communities they live in \u2014 have seen their earnings decline or stagnate and their relative social status take a big hit. These groups see governments as increasingly in the pocket of financial and business elites, the big winners of globalization. The discontent in turn fuels populist leaders who promise to wrest control from faceless global market forces and re-empower the nation-state.\n\nThe populist backlash unleashed by advanced stages of economic globalization should not have been a surprise, least of all to economists. The warning signs are right there in the basic economic theory we teach in the classroom. Yes, globalization expands economic opportunities: There are gains from trade. But globalization also entails stark distributional consequences, with some groups almost always left worse off. Factory closings, job displacement and offshoring are the flip side of the gains from trade.\n\nWhat is more, these redistributive effects loom larger relative to the overall economic gains as globalization advances and trade agreements begin to aim at less consequential barriers. In other words, in its late stages, globalization looks less and less as if it is expanding the overall economic pie and more and more as though it is simply taking money from some groups and giving it to others.\n\nIn principle, an active government can take the edge off the resentment produced by redistribution. In Western Europe, an extensive welfare state has historically provided the safety nets that in turn enabled levels of economic openness that are much higher than in the United States. But often the response of the government has been to plead incapacity in the face of inexorable global economic realities: \u201cWe cannot tax the winners \u2014 the wealthy investors, financiers and skilled professionals \u2014 because they are footloose and they would move to other countries.\u201d This reinforces populists\u2019 yearning to reassert national economic control.", "title": "Opinion | What Does a True Populism Look Like?

{"date": "2018-02-21 00:00:00", "text": "The Players\u2019 Tribune originally gave athletes newsroom titles: David Ortiz, the jolly Red Sox slugger, was editor at large; Matt Harvey, the Mets hurler, was New York City bureau chief. On Twitter, jokes about Kobe Bryant \u2014 the editorial director! \u2014 flourished. Just imagine him screaming in the face of a middle reliever about a missing nut graf. For sports media, it was a way to grin in the face of the prickly existential fear they\u2019d lived with ever since social media forever changed their industry. Twitter and Instagram had already conditioned athletes to communicate with the public directly. Might they, the middlemen and middlewomen, one day be cut out altogether? Wouldn\u2019t athletes simply tell the same tales of humdrum perseverance that they do in Gatorade commercials? Didn\u2019t good writing still require good writers?\n\nThree years on, The Players\u2019 Tribune has become a regular source of breaking news: Kevin Durant announced his league-upheaving move to Golden State in July 2016 with an essayistic memo, which then become a recurring format. In November 2015, Kobe Bryant announced his retirement via 11 stanzas of spare, Japanese-style poetry, which, unfortunately, did not. And confessional pieces like Thomas\u2019s, written by N.H.L. also-rans and Brazilian soccer stars alike, have regularly gone viral.\n\nAt its helm is Jeter, who spent 20 years in New York saying nothing to the press. He is an athlete famed, almost revered, for blankness. But the fact that he played in that Yankees spotlight for as long as he did and mostly avoided off-the-field notoriety suggests that Jeter might possess some hidden guile. After all, The Players\u2019 Tribune represents the first truly new wrinkle in sportswriting in a decade. But what is it, exactly? It\u2019s not fair to call it P.R. The access it provides is genuine. But you can\u2019t really get around one tricky fact: When you give the subject the final cut, you can\u2019t call it journalism either. Perhaps The Players\u2019 Tribune can be best understood as an effort by athletes to seize that most precious contemporary commodity \u2014 the narrative.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs recently as the early 1980s, the walls between pro athletes and the sportswriters who covered them were permeable. Local newspaper reporters would travel with the team, dine with the team and sometimes have one too many cold domestics with the team. These people were, essentially, co-workers. By the \u201990s, money, and the instincts for self-preservation that money engenders, had created a system of formalized control that holds to this day. Technically, there is access galore: before and after practice, before and after pregame warm-ups, before and after the game itself. But locker-room interviews are notoriously fruitless. Gary Hoenig, a 71-year-old ex-newspaperman and the founding editor of ESPN the Magazine, who now works for The Players\u2019 Tribune as an editor, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think showering and standing there half-naked with a mic in your face is a great way to relate what your actual life is like.\u201d And yet beat reporters trudge dutifully on, Bics in hand, and regularly do great work in unpromising situations.\n\nBut as meaningful access withered alongside print media, a new generation of sportswriters decided they would just stay in their living rooms and take their shots from there. The columnist Bill Simmons and the blog Deadspin pushed back against the hidebound conventions of sportswriting, the former with a hyperpersonal style defined by homerism, looseness and joy, the latter by happily pointing out all the ways we were being lied to. (I worked for Simmons at ESPN\u2019s Grantland for four years.) Take, for example, their coverage of Jeter. Simmons and the baseball writers at Grantland assailed this purportedly unassailable figure, running geeky statistical analysis to prove that, despite his five Gold Gloves, he was actually a miserable defensive player. Deadspin, originally a Gawker affiliate, delighted in unearthing Jeter\u2019s foibles. Once, it published a post suggesting he liked to watch his own highlights, in the nude, while shouting, over and over, \u201cYeah Jeets!\u201d That this was based on an unverified rumor sourced from Reddit didn\u2019t really matter. Deadspin was unconvinced that anyone, let alone a baseball player, should be uncomplicatedly revered. For millions of young fans, that mentality \u2014 that mainstream sports media presents a facile master narrative that is to be warred with at all times \u2014 became a defining principle.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s ESPN, which hovers above the whole system, Death Star-like, doing everything from dry game recaps to experiential multimedia packages to breaking-news pieces to talk shows that have come to define the way we shout about sports to websites like Grantland, which existed, to some extent, to question all of this. During his time at the network, the commentator Skip Bayless was well known for insisting that LeBron James was not, in fact, very good at basketball but was, rather, somewhat bad at basketball. And he never broke character. For the thinking sports fan, this was ESPN\u2019s great tragedy: The network wanted it all, every last nook, and so it coupled its ambitious, unparalleled coverage with shameless, soul-crushing shouting.\n\nFor years, no one has dared to imagine a way to win back access. But The Players\u2019 Tribune did, by completely redefining it. The site gives its subjects final approval of their own coverage. Normally, this would be a journalistic sin, were it not for an elegant and cynical workaround: giving the subject the byline. The model has precedent in the form of the ghostwritten as-told-to sports memoir, which has bred some stone-cold classics: \u201cI Am Zlatan,\u201d the Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s prickly and strange 2011 autobiography, is one of the best things I\u2019ve ever read. (As a boy, Ibrahimovic celebrates personal milestones by stealing bicycles.) But being a bona fide literary achievement doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not brand management.\n\nLast fall, on the West Side of Manhattan, I visited the consummately start-up-like offices of The Players\u2019 Tribune, with its open-floor plan and glass-walled conference rooms, its espresso bar and its espresso bar\u2019s adjoining patio and its adjoining patio\u2019s stunning Hudson River views. Jeff Levick, The Players\u2019 Tribune chief executive, greeted me in his large, airy and spare office. Slim, small and slightly mod, Levick speaks quickly and while speaking quickly says things like \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201caspirations\u201d and \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cdisruption.\u201d He had come onboard just a few weeks earlier as the company\u2019s first C.E.O., and he was promising to turn a catchy idea with millions in financing from venture capitalists and athletes into a moneymaker. He was previously the chief revenue officer at Spotify, and, he explained, he saw the two companies as fundamentally alike. Both are \u201cplatforms,\u201d he told me: one for music, the other for what he calls \u201cA.G.C.\u201d \u2014 \u201cathlete-generated content.\u201d\n\nLevick was happy to tell me, in the classic manner of the disrupter, about how his company was about to upend an angry, worn-out industry. Sitting bolt upright, eyes locked onto mine, gesticulating with purpose, he pointed to the large flat-screen TV behind us: therein lay the enemy. \u201cI have ESPN on all day long, and I get where these athletes are coming from,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys are the best in the world at what they do, and they can\u2019t catch a break! They\u2019re getting beaten up all day. Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t get beaten up like that.\u201d His point was this: All that unnecessary negativity that ESPN\u2019s TV shows churn out is ultimately a boon to the bottom line of The Players\u2019 Tribune because that negativity is persuading athletes to share their proprietary, much-desired content with The Players\u2019 Tribune.\n\nI suggested to Levick that there were still certain unique advantages that only traditional reporting can offer. \u201cWell, then, I guess the story of how the Isaiah Thomas trade went down would have happened somewhere else,\u201d he politely scoffed. \u201cThat, to me, was a piece of journalism that would never have been told through a sports reporter. They weren\u2019t going to get access to that story. And it\u2019s an amazing story.\u201d\n\nSean Conboy is an intense, handsome, wide-eyed true believer who wears all black. At 31, he is the executive editor of The Players\u2019 Tribune, which means he\u2019s the chief ghostwriter, responsible for many of the articles that have gone viral. He has a desk somewhere, I assume, but whenever I caught him at the office, he and his laptop were itinerant. The first time I saw him, he was on a couch near a Pop-A-Shot basketball hoop, plotting a coming business trip to Madrid. The next time we sat entombed together in a fishbowl meeting room that at least felt, and may indeed have been, soundproof.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConboy had previously worked at Wired and Sports Illustrated and was brought in before The Players\u2019 Tribune concept had been publicly revealed, while athletes were still being recruited as investors. He remembers thinking, as it was explained to him in his first sit-down, that it could be interesting. \u201cOr,\u201d he recalled thinking, \u201cit could be terrible!\u201d Now he oversees a team of 10 out of an overall staff of nearly 80. They\u2019ve developed a few routine practices to attempt, as best as possible, to simulate an editor-writer relationship with the athlete. They push to get direct cell numbers and emails. They warn of the commitment to come. \u201cWe say off the bat, this is not a dashed off thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a transcript of an interview. You\u2019re signing up for a partnership. We wanna make a movie.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When the former N.H.L. goalie Corey Hirsch wrote about the undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder that nearly pushed him to drive his car off a cliff, he spoke with Conboy five or six times. (Hockey has been the source of a number of The Players\u2019 Tribune\u2019s best stories, churning out compelling characters at a rate incommensurate with its place in the culture at large: The former Bruins enforcer Shawn Thornton once provided an anecdote about his Parkinson\u2019s-afflicted grandmother trying to talk him into letting her slug some booze out of the Stanley Cup.) Hirsch first revealed his story without being sure he would actually go through with publishing it. He was nervous about how his family would perceive it; and he nearly pulled it. That risk is part of the process at The Players\u2019 Tribune: Whether it\u2019s video or print, athletes have final cut and can kill a whole project. But Hirsch went through with it, and his article has been read more than a million times.\n\nLike Hirsch, the Miami Heat shooting guard Dion Waiters is not a player familiar to casual fans. But his April 2017 essay is perhaps the best thing the site has published. Waiters is a famously overconfident shooter \u2014 a chucker. In the article, through tales of violence, doubt, heartbreak and nausea, he doesn\u2019t bother defending himself. Instead, he doubles down. \u201cI see what people say about me,\u201d he writes. \u201cI see the GIFs and all that. They say, \u2018He never seen a shot he don\u2019t like.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s got irrational confidence.\u2019 \u2018He thinks he\u2019s the best player in the N.B.A.\u2019 Hell yeah I do.\u201d The essay was published during the N.B.A. playoffs, but the Heat\u2019s season was already over. The title of the piece: \u201cThe N.B.A. Is Lucky I\u2019m Home Doing Damn Articles.\u201d\n\nAfter Conboy finishes his ghostwriting, a lot of athletes can get judicious, carefully pruning or deleting moments of oversharing. \u201cWe want athletes that go in the Google Doc and just go to town,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s the best version of this.\u201d He recalled Isaiah Thomas\u2019s writing his first piece for the site. \u201cIt was 1 a.m. East Coast time, and he\u2019s texting about line edits,\u201d Conboy said. \u201c \u2018Move this around. What if this was said this way.\u2019 \u201d Some players even act just like prima donna magazine writers and fight with their editors over every word. \u201cKobe writes his own drafts,\u201d Conboy said, smiling. \u201cLiterally, he writes his own drafts.\u201d\n\nBut most don\u2019t. In fact, the process, as Conboy described it to me, was oddly familiar. For the Waiters story, Conboy and his subject went out for cheese steaks in Philly, then later did a two-hour interview. \u201cProfile writing, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said, picking his words carefully. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting two hours anymore hardly anywhere.\u201d But Conboy could. Effectively, The Players\u2019 Tribune has found a way to simulate the access of olden times by putting control in the hands of the wealthy and attractive subjects. In a way, Conboy did profile Waiters. He just didn\u2019t receive the byline.\n\nThe Players\u2019 Tribune has an annual tradition called the \u201cathlete board meeting.\u201d It\u2019s open to just about anyone in the biz; a big room full of obscure Olympians and megastars, retired and active, male and female alike. They hold it in Los Angeles every July, the week of ESPN\u2019s awards show, the ESPYs. This past year\u2019s meeting was led by Bryant, one of the company\u2019s more enthusiastic investors. (A member of the editorial staff told me about an early meeting in Los Angeles, purportedly just a low-key hang to kick around story ideas; Bryant showed up via helicopter with a small black notebook that he quickly filled as he proceeded to ask an intense stream of highly informed digital-media-strategy questions.) At one point, Levick recalls, Bryant threw out a question to the room: \u201c \u2018What keeps you up at night?\u2019 \u201d One of the athletes responded, \u201c \u2018The thing that keeps me up at night is that my legacy will only be what people see on the field. That they won\u2019t know me for all the other things that are interesting to me.\u2019 And all these hands went up. \u2018Totally.\u2019 \u2018Totally.\u2019 \u2018That worries me so much.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCan this really be a going concern? That our obsessive sports media is missing heretofore untold, profound personal truths about our heroes? For all its peaks, on any given day reading The Players\u2019 Tribune, you might just run into a variation of \u201cHey [Insert City] \u2014 we\u2019re gonna give it our all this year.\u201d Neither the site itself nor its social media has become a real destination. According to comScore, the site gets a respectable 3.4 million unique views a month; its Twitter account has just over half a million followers. A lot of its content is, frankly, repetitive and predictable. The pieces that succeed effectively float away from The Players\u2019 Tribune and into the national conversation.\n\nIn 2015 Katie Nolan, then the host of the scrappy, low-budget Fox Sports show \u201cGarbage Time,\u201d lodged a critique of The Players\u2019 Tribune model. \u201cIt isn\u2019t for us fans,\u201d she said in a segment on the show, which had a certain outsider credibility. (It has since been canceled.) \u201cIt\u2019s for the players who want to appear like an open book without the risk of getting themselves in trouble for being an open book. And maybe I\u2019m being cynical, but that sucks.\u201d\n\nI brought this up to Hoenig, the Players\u2019 Tribune editor. Hoenig has had a long, lucrative career. You get the sense that he\u2019s quite pleased to be at The Players\u2019 Tribune and that he\u2019s not all that worried about what happens next. Now, though, he let himself get worked up. \u201cIs it P.R. to say I\u2019m putting a face on somebody that you feel completely free to attack willy-nilly without knowing who they are?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it\u2019s good strategy for an athlete to control his own \u2014 I don\u2019t even call it image \u2014 his own narrative. That\u2019d be a good strategy for you and me too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe first time I saw Jeter at The Players\u2019 Tribune, he appeared, fists pounding on the door, at a corner office where I had been chatting with Jon Sakoda, an early-stage investor. Laid on a low piece of cabinetry was a massive, glitzy championship belt given to the Players\u2019 Tribune president, Jaymee Messler, by her pal Stephanie McMahon, daughter of the W.W.E. chief executive Vince McMahon. Jeter and Sakoda spent a few minutes admiring it. \u201cYou\u2019re getting one next!\u201d Jeter promised Sakoda. Then he briefly ambled off to find help in figuring out why Uber wasn\u2019t working on his new phone. It was another sunny day in the well-lit Manhattan offices of a celebrity-backed, moneyed start-up with ambitions far beyond its page views.\n\nJeter spends most of his time in Miami, where he\u2019s the chief executive of the Marlins, and doesn\u2019t have his own full-time office here. We met later in a vacant office, under a wall of perfectly arrayed framed memories: photos from charity parties, past Jeter press coverage, Bryant\u2019s poem. In person, Jeter looked good \u2014 in his bluejeans and dark gray henley, the picture of casual bro chic. But there were moments that remind you that he has been around awhile. He rolled out a rotator cuff, slowly; he smashed a fist into a spike of pain on his lower thigh. His rookie season was 1996. He dated Mariah Carey! For the better part of the first half of his career, the worst-case scenario was a Page Six write-up on what Meatpacking District club he was at last night.\n\nI theorized that The Players\u2019 Tribune had been born as a retaliation to the gossip columnists who had poked and prodded him for so long. He shrugged it off. \u201cYou know how many phone calls I\u2019ve gotten from my mom through the years when I was younger asking me questions?\u201d he said. \u201cEventually you just try not to pay attention to it.\u201d He added: \u201cYou remember the Motorola two-way? When they came out? That was as good as it came. Then the color one came out. And all of a sudden. ...\u201d He trailed off. \u201cEverything you do is public knowledge.\u201d\n\nI asked him about Alex Rodriguez, his former teammate and frenemy, and a player famously, calamitously inept during his playing career at controlling his public image. (Just search for \u201cA-Rod kisses himself.\u201d) Did Jeter ever try to help him? \u201cI spoke with everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI would stress accountability to anyone that came to our organization.\u201d\n\nI asked whether, had today\u2019s athlete protests spread to the Yankees while Jeter was playing, would he have taken a knee. \u201cI\u2019m not in the clubhouse now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say: Everyone has a right to peaceful protest.\u201d\n\nWhat did I know about Derek Jeter? Not much and certainly nothing new after this brief encounter. I left the interview feeling as though, intentionally or not, he\u2019d made a good case for access journalism\u2019s uselessness. We already live among the distorting effects of Twitter and Instagram, the uncanny and calculated sense of intimacy that social-media platforms provide. Now we have a model that simulates objective journalism, supposedly written by the people who were once subject to that journalism\u2019s scrutiny.\n\nProjecting The Players\u2019 Tribune model forward, we can imagine a world in which athletes simply don\u2019t need to talk to reporters, in an echo of what feels like the unstoppable atomization of all news and information. Politicians, TV showrunners, labor-union leaders: theoretically The Players\u2019 Tribune platform is replicable for any public professional. In the future, perhaps, every last person will get to broadcast his or her own particular worldview, free of objectivity, on a bespoke, partisan media organ, with slick photography and design. And it will be up to us to decide what version of the truth we want to believe.", "title": "What Happens When Athletes Do the Sportswriting?", "authors": ["Amos Barshad"]}

Even when researchers restricted the analyses to the most adherent subjects, there were no significant differences over all in B.M.I.\n\nThe good news is that babies ate on their own: Parents can be reassured that coaxing their infants to eat more is not the only thing keeping them from malnutrition. The bad news is that more than 10 percent of the infants in the intervention group were overweight by 2 years of age . One of the most significant predictors of being overweight as an adult is being overweight as a child.\n\nThe best method of feeding babies has long been a subject of debate. An article published in 1948 in the same journal as this study, JAMA Pediatrics, reviewed the \u201cliterature on the so-called self-demand schedule of infant feeding\u201d for prematurely born infants after they were discharged from the hospital. It noted that there was an increasing trend (in the 1940s!) toward allowing infants to regulate their own feeding. It noted the cyclical swings in thought between rigid regimentation of feedings and allowing too much freedom in a self-demand schedule.\n\nIt appears that some things have not changed.\n\nThe concerns expressed in the 1940s were very different from those of today, however. Then, people were focused on making sure babies got enough nutrition to grow and develop properly. Now, we are more worried about overconsumption and obesity.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether humans are programmed to maintain a healthy weight on their own. Animals in the wild are subject to outside forces \u2014 the need to forage or kill, to compete, and to prepare for future shortages. Domesticated animals\u2019 eating is regulated by us. Anyone who has owned a pet knows not to leave them alone with an open food supply, unless you want all that food to be gone.\n\nThis study supports the idea that, left to their own devices and supplied with more than enough food, babies will overeat. We still need to intervene. Nonetheless, there might be merit to giving infants more control over their eating: This study found that baby-led weaning resulted in children who were less fussy about what they ate and who seemed to enjoy their food more. Both of those things are good.\n\nBut if we want to find a larger solution to the issues of overweight American children and obesity, it seems we\u2019re going to have to work harder.

Why?\n\nBefore you read this article, what are some things you have learned from the movies?\n\nIn \u201c28 Days, 28 Films for Black History Month,\u201d Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott write:\n\nIT HAS BEEN ALMOST A YEAR since Barry Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight\u201d won the Oscar for best picture. This awards season, Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d and Dee Rees\u2019s \u201cMudbound\u201d have received multiple nominations and accolades, optimistic signs that black filmmakers are receiving more opportunities in the movie industry. Soon these titles will be joined by two of the most anticipated releases of the year: Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d the first Marvel superhero movie from a black director, and Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time,\u201d the first movie with a $100 million budget directed by a black woman. The critical and box-office success of \u201cGet Out\u201d and the very existence of big-studio productions like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d are good reasons to revisit the remarkable, complex story of black filmmaking in America. For Black History Month, we have selected 28 essential films from the 20th century pertaining to African-American experiences. These aren\u2019t the 28 essential black-themed films, but a calendar of suggested viewing. We imposed a chronological cutoff in an effort to look back at where we were and how we got to here. We begin in the 1920s with Oscar Micheaux (1884-1951), a novelist and bold, prolific independent filmmaker. Micheaux along with black directors like Spencer Williams made \u201crace movies,\u201d low-budget films with all-black casts for black audiences (some from white producers). During the Jim Crow era, the color line ran through movies, including into segregated theaters, and most Hollywood films depicting black life were produced by whites, including musicals, like \u201cCabin in the Sky,\u201d with all-black casts of well-known singers, dancers and musicians. From the early 1930s to the late \u201950s, the mainstream industry\u2019s Production Code specifically banned representations of sexual relations between black and white people. When African-Americans in Hollywood were not singing or dancing, they were often cast as maids, butlers, porters or other servile, peripheral figures. There are exceptions, including \u201cImitation of Life,\u201d a 1930s melodrama with a storyline about a black character who \u201cpasses\u201d for white, as well as \u201cIntruder in the Dust,\u201d a 1940s parable of white conscience. Both are worth viewing because of the power and integrity of their featured black actors \u2014 Louise Beavers, Fredi Washington and Juano Hernandez \u2014 who with the humanity of their performances challenge and movingly subvert the mainstream industry\u2019s racism. Race movies disappeared shortly after World War II, and soon the mainstream industry turned toward social issues. Yet even as the civil rights movement gathered force, black characters and their experiences were seen through a white lens, often myopically. Consider this sobering fact: Between 1948 (when Micheaux\u2019s last film appeared) and 1969 (when Gordon Parks\u2019s \u201cThe Learning Tree\u201d arrived on the big screen), almost no movies directed by African-Americans were released commercially in the United States. Our selections for subsequent decades are exclusively the work of black directors. For the later 20th century, we have chosen titles that represent waves and countercurrents: Blaxploitation, the independent film scenes in Los Angeles and New York in the \u201970s and \u201980s, the flowering of commercial and independent movies in the \u201990s. There are comedies and crime stories, historical epics and slices of ordinary life, socially conscious dramas and sublimely silly comedies. Taken together, they do not offer a unified theory of African-Americans in cinema, but a great multiplicity.\n\nStudents: Read about some of the suggested movies in the rest of the article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 What do you think the authors hope readers could learn from watching these films?

Boys are somewhat more likely to be risky drivers, and kids whose friends are risky drivers are more likely to drive that way themselves. There\u2019s an adolescent style of driving with fast starts and sharp turns and late hard braking, which tends to decrease with age; some of this is lack of experience, but some may be experimenting with the car, and enjoying the fun of driving dramatically. Still, the typical teenage driver, Dr. Foss said, is driving carefully, and trying to follow the rules.\n\nMind you, all novice drivers of whatever age have higher crash rates, but for older people, the rates start lower and come down faster. And similarly, talking on cellphones or texting are risky behaviors for any of us as drivers, but the risk increases more sharply for adolescents. There are a variety of technological \u201cfixes\u201d out there that parents may want to consider, from apps to cellphone blocking technology, but no clear data yet about what helps, or what is most likely to be used. And of course, road safety depends not only on your own level of distraction, but also on the other drivers around you.\n\n\u201cNow cars are loaded with distracting technology,\u201d Dr. Foss said. \u201cSomething that used to be as simple as picking a radio station now on some vehicles is infinitely more complicated and distracting that what I had on my 1954 Ford when I started driving, and we\u2019re not going to ameliorate that by saying, now don\u2019t be distracted, concentrate on the road.\u201d\n\nBut those same newer cars also can come with important safety features, and since most teenagers will drive a car that already belongs to the family, it should be the safest possible car. \u201cParents tend to put the teen in the oldest car the family owns, which in general is the least safe car,\u201d Dr. Foss said. Teenagers should be driving cars with every possible airbag, he said, and with electronic stability control, which prevents rollover crashes. Ideally, they should not be driving very small cars or compacts, which are not as protective.\n\nIf you do buy a car for your teenager, he said, think about safety; \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean go out and buy a brand new Volvo, it means if you\u2019re going to buy a car for them, find one that\u2019s as safe as possible for what you can afford.\u201d The Institute for Highway Safety has a list, updated every year, of recommended safe cars for teenage drivers in different price ranges.", "title": "What Helps a New Driver?

{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "My old iPad is, to be precise, a late-2012 iPad Mini, model number A1432, black, with 16 gigabytes of storage. It retailed, at release, for $329. It has a few scratches and a couple of flat spots on its metal edges, where it made contact with one hard surface or another, but it\u2019s otherwise the same thin, shiny slate that I popped out of its plastic packaging five years ago. It isn\u2019t worn in; in fact, it has acquired no physical character at all. In many ways, it\u2019s the exact opposite of a baseball mitt in its resistance to sentiment and nostalgia. It exists in memory, barely, as a sort of rectangular green screen, disappearing completely until I remember that it had to have been there. It has been present for the entirety of my relationship with my wife but holds no special significance to us. It has been handled by every member of my immediate family, not all of whom are still alive, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what any of them did with it. The device seems to repel whatever personal experiences it is exposed to; it has a coating on its screen that resists fingerprints.\n\nPhoto\n\nFifteen years ago, before I would replace a desktop computer or a laptop, it would have quite conspicuously broken down, its fans getting louder, its spinning hard drive grinding to a halt. When I would replace it with something newer or faster or more capable, it would enter a promising second life: it could be repurposed as a spare, a computer for a friend, a terminal for playing old games or for doing undistracted work. It could be given to someone who could make use of it.\n\nAs I did when I first got it, I still use my old iPad for passive consumption: reading, watching videos, checking feeds. My routine has barely changed, but one by one, formerly easy tasks have become strained. Social apps have become slow, videos take longer to load and Safari can\u2019t seem to handle the most important and fundamental services of the modern web.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs my iPad has aged, I\u2019ve started to notice it more, not because I\u2019m growing fonder, but because I\u2019m getting frustrated: by the fact that it won\u2019t do what it ought to or even what it used to. But what I find most frustrating of all is the gradual disappearance of all options other than buying a new iPad. I understand the reasons for this. I understand the concept of \u201cplanned obsolescence\u201d less as a conspiracy than as the unfortunate but universal prerogative of dominant, profit-driven companies that make their money from selling hardware.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I could purchase a kit from a site like iFixit, with a fresh battery and tools to pry my iPad apart, for $39.99. But the repair is quite involved and requires, among 71 other steps, heating up the device in order to pry its screen free of its glue. I could send it to Apple, which says out-of-warranty iPad battery service is $99 plus $6.95 in shipping plus local taxes, which totals more than I would get if I sent it to an Apple partner called Brightstar to be \u201crecycled\u201d: a $45 gift card to the Apple store. Lower down the rung is Gazelle, a company that buys old devices and resells them, often abroad. A tool on their website offered me $30, conditionally.\n\nBut the iPad was never really meant to be tinkered with, examined or torn open and modified. When it first appeared, Steve Jobs pitched it as essentially a portal: a simple tool for consumption, as useful and wonderful as the seemingly infinite things that might manifest on its screen. This was accurate on more than one level. It was a tool for consumption, sure, but it was also a consumable. Early criticism of the device, which was minor and muffled by enormous sales, focused on the few things that made it noticeable, like its weight or the size of the black border around its screen. (The iPad Mini was an answer to both complaints.) It was, in contrast to the iPhone from which it descended, understood by its users as simply good enough \u2014 not life-changing, but handy. It was to be used until its users started noticing it, at which point it was to be replaced. It was, like the iPhone, immune to attachment. But unlike the iPhones, which might be reclaimed by a cellular carrier as part of a scheduled trade-in or just shoved aside by a two-year upgrade, iPads tend to linger. They have time to reveal their tragic thingness.\n\nPerhaps the best option is to sell my old iPad overseas to a consumer who understands what it is: not quite an iPad, but nevertheless a machine that will still chat, that will manage FaceTime, that can receive email or maybe take payments for a shop. But before long, it will lose the ability to do these things. It will still be a wonder of industrial design and a technological marvel, right up until the moment it is destroyed for scrap.", "title": "What I Learned from Watching My iPad\u2019s Slow Death", "authors": ["John Herrman", "On Technology"]}
{"date": "2018-02-06 00:00:00", "text": "An armed convoy came to my quarters to take me and others to MACV. There were a large number of top-secret documents in my office that needed to be destroyed. I went outside to burn the papers in a special incinerator but had to take cover because of enemy rounds ricocheting off the incinerator, fired at me from across the street near Tan Son Nhut, South Vietnam\u2019s largest airport and the headquarters of the United States 7th Air Force.\n\nNerves were frayed, even at high levels. One very early morning I received an \u201cimmediate\u201d message through the general service network for Westmoreland from Adm. U. S. Grant Sharp, the head of Pacific Command and Westmoreland\u2019s immediate superior. I decided the message was not critical enough to awaken Westmoreland but instead woke the major general who was his operations chief to handle the matter.\n\nAs I later learned from Westmoreland\u2019s chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Walter Kerwin, Sharp discovered I had not immediately delivered his message to Westmoreland and was furious, directing that I be court-martialed. Kerwin called me into his office, asked what I had done with the message, told me of Sharp\u2019s direction and, like a Dutch uncle (Kerwin\u2019s nickname was Dutch), said to make sure I followed Sharp\u2019s preferences in the future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

I showed Westmoreland a classified message concerning the surface-to-air Talos missile, which was to be used to shoot down enemy aircraft. He wrote a note on the message, explained to me its meaning and told me to meet with the commanding general of the 7th Air Force at Tan Son Nhut to coordinate rules of engagement \u2014 a mission otherwise way above my pay grade.\n\nThere was also a kind of camaraderie that developed under the pressure of Tet and its aftermath. I was impressed by the relationship between Westmoreland and his deputy (and soon to be successor), Gen. Creighton Abrams. The two had graduated the same year from West Point, 1936. Both had distinguished themselves in combat during World War II, Westmoreland under Gen. Maxwell Taylor and Abrams under Gen. George Patton. I saw nothing but mutual regard between the two, observing occasions when Westmoreland would ask something of \u201cAbe,\u201d who would respond in his gravelly voice, with familiarity yet deference for all to see: \u201cYes, sahr.\u201d\n\nI remember one particular private conversation I had with Abrams. Shortly after Tet, American forces had suffered a combat setback near a region nicknamed the Parrot\u2019s Beak, a bit of Cambodian territory that jutted into South Vietnam toward Saigon. After I asked about the engagement during a customary daily briefing I gave him, Abrams rose from his simple steel desk, picked up a ubiquitous cigar, pulled out a telescoped pointer, squatted down in front of a map board in his office, described the disposition of friendly and enemy forces, and explained why he thought things had not gone well \u2014 the sort of careful, thorough response a general officer would give a peer, near-equal or a visiting dignitary, but not a junior officer like me. I had been nervous asking the question, and deeply surprised with his response; by such grace is loyalty cemented.\n\nThe intensity of the fighting during Tet also concentrated the chain of command. Signals intelligence indicated a noteworthy movement of the North Vietnamese Army in I Corps, the tactical area immediately below the Demilitarized Zone that included Hue, the imperial city of Vietnam that was largely occupied by enemy forces during Tet. Westmoreland was away, so I woke Abrams and showed him the information. Bleary-eyed, he asked for pencil and paper. Sitting on the side of his bed, he deliberately wrote an articulate operations order that I sent to the Marine commanding general in the area, moving artillery, armored, airborne and infantry units to respond to the threat, stating that he would establish a jump command post and arrive the next day. The occupation of Hue was eventually lifted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA powerful demonstration of our military might regularly arose out of the Combined Intelligence Center in the basement of MACV headquarters (my office was in an additionally secured area at the rear of the center). Westmoreland and Abrams would be briefed, on large maps showing all information that had been gathered, by senior staff like the brigadier generals in charge of intelligence and the Combat Operations Center. The goal was to determine targets for B-52 bombers flown out of Guam to support ground operations. There were three B-52s, or \u201ccells,\u201d in each strike, in what was called Operation Arc Light. Each B-52 bombed an area half a kilometer wide and a kilometer long; each carried a payload of 80 or more 500-pound bombs, arriving in the silence of the jungle from an altitude of 33,000 feet. To observe the decision-making process and be in the middle of the \u201cbrain\u201d directing such firepower across such vast spaces was a humbling experience; it was like watching a Thor toss thunderbolts.\n\nA striking incident occurred a few weeks after Tet. Westmoreland summoned me to his office. I had already seen him that day; such a call at his initiative was unusual. I closed his door and he showed me a message he had written requesting 200,000 or more troops (there were about 500,000 troops in-country then). He told me: \u201cSend it back channel to\u201d Gen. Earl Wheeler, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \u201cShow it to no one else.\u201d I sent the message to Wheeler. After review at the highest levels, the request was denied.\n\nTensions remained high. At the end of March, I received from the White House an advance copy of the speech President Lyndon Johnson was scheduled to make to the nation on March 31. It did not contain the passage in which he declared he would not run for another term; that he added, secretly, at almost the last minute. I printed copies and went to Westmoreland\u2019s conference room, where he had gathered with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, Abrams and others. Westmoreland asked when the speech would be delivered. I responded with the hour and minute, Saigon time. Abrams barked: \u201cHow come you\u2019re always so goddamned positive?\u201d\n\nA few days later, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. My wife, Lynda, was working at the State Department, and I learned that Washington was under curfew. I stood in a long line to make a Military Auxiliary Radio System call to her. MARS calls relied on civilian ham operators relaying straight-line shots across the Pacific, tower to tower. Lynda told me she saw downtown Washington on fire from the top of our apartment building on Connecticut Avenue. I asked from the capital of the war zone whether there was anything I could do for her in our nation\u2019s capital. She said: \u201cYes. Come home.\u201d We heard the ham operators chuckle.\n\nThe next month, President Johnson promoted Westmoreland to chief of staff of the Army and named Abrams to replace him. Soon after, I went to Tan Son Nhut to catch a military hop to Danang to command a small unit in I Corps with the 23rd Infantry Division, known as Americal, whose area of operations included My Lai, where Lt. William Calley and his platoon had killed South Vietnamese civilians two months earlier. Pacing in the airport waiting area, I passed a sailor\u2019s transistor radio leaning on an open window sill and heard the announcement that Senator Robert F. Kennedy had been shot.\n\nShortly after I had arrived in Vietnam, six months earlier, the Army had offered to send me to graduate school on my return in order to teach at West Point. Following the King assassination, I requested approval of my resignation as a commissioned officer. In 1968, an average of 45 Americans died in Vietnam every day. With any luck, in another six months, I would be going home.", "title": "What I Saw During the Tet Offensive", "authors": ["Joseph Zengerle"]}

But he had married a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, once China\u2019s top leader and one of the most important figures in modern Chinese history. Other early Anbang directors included Levin Zhu, son of a former prime minister, and Chen Xiaolu, the son of a famous army marshal. In China, those are the kinds of connections that can help bring in business.\n\nWho Owns Anbang?\n\nIn the years after it was founded, the names of Mr. Wu and some of the other early players disappeared from the company\u2019s filings with Chinese officials. On paper, the company was owned by a number of individuals working through various holding companies.\n\nIn a 2016 investigation, The New York Times tried to find these individuals, who were not well known investors or famously wealthy people \u2014 even though their ownership stakes in Anbang would make them some of the richest people in China. It found that many of the people who owned the shares were family members or acquaintances of Mr. Wu. Addresses for some shareholders led to shabby buildings or to business that open shell companies.\n\nIt is common in China for wealthy people to own their property under the names of others, usually friends and family. Such arrangements are known in Chinese as baishoutao, or white gloves. Anbang has said it is owned by a number of shareholders who make their required disclosures to the government.\n\nHow Did It Get So Big?\n\nAnbang still sells insurance policies.

They are often sold directly to individual, mom-and-pop investors looking for higher returns but less risk than China\u2019s frequently unstable stock market offers.\n\nThe products are a common way for Chinese companies and others to raise money. But they have grown in volume to the point that many people consider them a potential threat to the stability of the financial system. They are also lightly regulated, and it often isn\u2019t clear to investors where their money is going.\n\nAnbang sold wealth management products heavily. In one six-year period, the assets of Anbang\u2019s life insurance unit multiplied 2,876-fold, to $213 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat Did It Buy?\n\nThe Waldorf Astoria gets the headlines, but Anbang bought much more.\n\nTwo years ago it agreed to buy a hotel business from Blackstone, the private equity group, for $6.5 billion in a deal that gave it hotels in New York, Chicago and San Diego, among other places. It bought Tongyang Life, a South Korean insurer, for $1 billion, and Vivat, a Dutch insurer, for about $170 million but pledged to inject as much as $1 billion more.\n\nThe biggest target was the one that got away. Anbang bid $14 billion to acquire Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which would have been the largest purchase of an American company by a Chinese buyer. Then, without explanation, Anbang backed off.\n\nWhy Did Anbang Get in Trouble?\n\nAbout the time Anbang was bidding for Starwood, China began to take a hard look at its big deal makers.\n\nChina was coping with slowing economic growth and a flood of money leaving its borders. Amid that, officials began taking a hard look at the debts some of its companies were racking up, and criticizing some of the purchases they were making.\n\nAs the pressures mounted, Mr. Wu was detained last year by Chinese authorities, without explanation.", "title": "What Is Anbang?

A total of 16 rocks \u2014 eight per team \u2014 are thrown during each end, and the teams alternate shots. One of the quirks of curling is that only one team can score in each end, and that point goes to the team that puts a rock closest to the button once all 16 of them have been thrown. If that team has two rocks closest to the button, they get two points \u2014 and so on.

Occasionally he would wince at having mislaid a board, then pick it up again and set it down someplace else. He worked hurriedly, and by the time the others returned from their meals, he was finished, having arranged the materials into precise groups from which the winning shades could be selected. That afternoon, he and his collaborators finalized the palettes. In six weeks, the forecast would be available to anyone interested enough to part with $795.\n\nColor forecasters like Shah and his team at Pantone have tremendous influence over the visible elements of the global economy \u2014 the parts of it that are designed, manufactured and purchased \u2014 though their profession itself is all but invisible. If you\u2019re familiar with color forecasting at all, it\u2019s most likely thanks to a scene in the 2006 film \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d in which the fashion-magazine mandarin Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, explains to her young, fashion-skeptical assistant why the assistant, played by Anne Hathaway, happens to be wearing a sweater in a very particular shade of blue known as cerulean. Cerulean, Priestly explains, first showed itself a few years earlier in a collection by Oscar de la Renta and was soon adopted by a number of other influential designers before it \u201cfiltered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner, where you no doubt fished it out of some clearance bin,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThat blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of comical how you think that you\u2019ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you\u2019re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.\u201d In reality, it was selected by Pantone. Six years before the release of \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d Pantone\u2019s forecasters named cerulean the company\u2019s first-ever Color of the Year.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since then, as digital design and social media have expanded the ranks of color obsessives, Pantone has become not just a company but a sensation, its brand bestriding the globe like a behemoth. Its color forecasts, too, have retained their reputation as some of the most influential in the world, even as the field of competitors has grown crowded \u2014 not just with other companies but, thanks to the internet, with people on social-networking sites like Tumblr and Pinterest who have a knack for spotting color trends and enough followers to matter. For the class of fashion and industrial designers who make up Pantone\u2019s customer base, picking the right color \u2014 and exactly the right shade of that color \u2014 can feel like one of the most important decisions they\u2019ll make all year. Companies will pay almost anything to get it right, and the rarefied, vaguely mystical art of doing just that happens to be Pantone\u2019s business.\n\nFor most of history, dyestuffs were derived only from natural materials like plants, minerals and invertebrates, offering people a narrow range of colors from which to choose. Only the rich could afford to clad themselves in more-exotic hues. This changed in the mid-19th century with the rise of the synthetic chemical industry. In London, in the spring of 1856, a college student named William Henry Perkin was experimenting with aniline, an organic compound he extracted from coal tar, in an attempt to synthesize quinine, an antimalarial drug then in great demand among inhabitants of the British Empire\u2019s equatorial possessions. As Regina Lee Blaszczyk recounts in her 2012 book, \u201cThe Color Revolution,\u201d the experiment failed but by accident produced a dark, viscous substance. It happened to stain a rag, and presto! Mauve was born. Two years later, Princess Victoria, the queen\u2019s oldest child, was married in a mauve dress, igniting the world\u2019s first fashion craze for a synthetic color.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore discoveries soon followed: magenta, Hofmann\u2019s violet, Lyons blue, malachite green, Bismarck brown and aniline black. By the 1880s, dye houses in Germany, which was by then the center of the chemical industry, and French textile mills were issuing seasonal color cards and ribbon samples of various synthetic shades. When the outbreak of World War I cut off the supply of German dyestuffs, threatening the color industry with collapse, a consortium of American mills and manufacturers formed the Textile Color Card Association, which developed the first industrywide color library and trend forecast, based solely on dyes that could be manufactured domestically. After the armistice, the group continued to be a hub for the best intelligence on color trends emanating from Europe\u2019s fashion capitals and, in 1955, renamed itself the Color Association of the United States. Similar organizations soon took form in other countries around the world.\n\nThe modern color industry had arrived, if only in a confined sort of way. Born out of the fashion business, it remained rooted there for decades even as it exerted powerful influence on distant parts of the consumer economy, such as the automotive and home-furnishings sectors. But at the turn of the millennium, the color industry\u2019s center of gravity shifted seemingly overnight with a big bang in the field of industrial design: the release, in 1998, of Apple\u2019s iMac G3 desktop computer.\n\nAvailable in 11 translucent shades, from Bondi Blue to Tangerine, the iMac ushered in a new era in which consumers began to value everyday purchases not strictly, or even primarily, for their utility but as a form of self-expression. \u201cThat colorful plastic was everywhere in industrial design for the next several years,\u201d Virginia Postrel, the author of several books on aesthetics, told me. \u201cNot just consumer electronics but all sorts of ordinary objects like irons and trash cans. It was an easy and cheap way to make things look fun and fresh.\u201d Eventually, the enthusiasm faded; Apple itself shifted its palette to neutral whites, blacks and silvers. But the larger idea that the iMac inaugurated \u2014 namely that color choices are serious business and can determine the success or failure of any product in any industry \u2014 continues to ripple through the marketplace.\n\nSteve Jobs\u2019s revolution in commercial aesthetics would have been impossible without another one that occurred 35 years earlier. A nagging problem had troubled the color industry from its inception: how to communicate accurately the subtleties of perception. In his 1963 book, \u201cInteraction of Color,\u201d the Bauhaus artist and Yale professor Josef Albers wrote: \u201cIf one says \u2018Red\u2019 (the name of a color) and there are 50 people listening, it can be expected that there will be 50 reds in their minds. And one can be sure that all these reds will be very different.\u201d There are innumerable colors, he continued, but only about 30 names for them. And even if you could describe all of those colors, wouldn\u2019t your sense of them still differ from someone else\u2019s? As the British journalist Kassia St. Clair writes in \u201cThe Secret Lives of Color,\u201d \u201cYou could no more meaningfully secure a precise universal definition for all the known shades than you could plot the coordinates of a dream.\u201d\n\nThe man who came closest to doing just that was Lawrence Herbert. In 1956, Herbert, who had recently graduated with a degree in biology and chemistry from Hofstra University on Long Island, took a job as a press operator and color matcher at M & J Levine, a New York-based advertising firm and the parent company of a small printing concern called Pantone Press. As the company\u2019s founders turned to other lines of business, Herbert took over the printing division and in a few short years, pioneered a cheaper, more accurate printing method that allowed him to produce a full spectrum of colors from 10 basic pigments. Not long after that, he bought out the company\u2019s printing unit, along with its name, and in 1963 introduced the Pantone Matching System.\n\nHerbert\u2019s system was at once transformative and elegantly simple. It measured precisely the mixture of pigments necessary to produce a specific shade, each of which was assigned a reference number. Pantone then compiled the colors and numbers into books. Rather than provide inks directly, it sold the means by which a printer could faithfully and consistently reproduce any color in Pantone\u2019s library. In doing so, Herbert tamed color\u2019s mysterious nature and turned it into a commodity, in essence quantifying what had until then been unquantifiable.\n\nPantone and its parent company, X-Rite \u2014 a maker of color-management systems and software that acquired Pantone in 2007 \u2014 now have 17 offices and production facilities around the world and offer products used by 10 million designers and manufacturers every day. Pantone\u2019s color library, which continues to grow by the year, contains roughly 10,000 unique shades. The company\u2019s expansion has been helped along by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. With designers in Europe, say, marketers in the United States and factories in China, a company can easily communicate color choices up and down the supply chain, so long as everyone involved references the same Pantone chip \u2014 Albers\u2019s 50 reds reduced to one.\n\nThose chips have become the lingua franca of the visual world, and every single one of them is manufactured in a squat, two-story brick building on Commerce Boulevard in a gritty, industrial section of Carlstadt, N.J. The plant employs about 75 people, whose days are spent in the manufacture of Pantone color standards \u2014 the company\u2019s shades applied to materials like cotton, paper and plastic. When I visited one rainy morning last August, I was surprised by how aggressively anti-chromatic the facility was \u2014 gray carpets and walls painted in a shade that a sign identified as Snow White (11-0602). The building\u2019s blandness, I learned, is no accident: Colors are best viewed in a neutral environment in which their essence can be more easily seen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI met Beverly Bell, Pantone\u2019s manager of color and quality standards for textiles, in a dimly lit room adjacent to the factory floor. Nearby, an employee in a white lab coat was standing at a countertop light box, checking a fresh batch of cotton-based color standards for flaws. The box emits D65 light, which, Bell said, simulates the midday sun in Western Europe \u2014 supposedly the purest possible illumination and the industry standard for assessing color.\n\nSuch exacting controls are in place at every stage of production. Cotton swatches, for example, after being dyed, are conditioned overnight in a machine that exposes them to D65 light and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit at 50 percent humidity. Afterward, they are measured with a spectrophotometer, which compares colors against the Pantone standard with hyperaccuracy. If they pass inspection, the swatches are then hermetically sealed inside plastic, ultraviolet-resistant envelopes, which protect against fading. Colors applied to paper and plastic undergo similar testing.\n\nThe final quality safeguard is the human eye. Every Pantone employee is required to pass an annual exam called the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue Color Vision Test. The test taker has to arrange four rows of samples, 85 in all, into descending order based on their shade. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s actually working with color has to get a \u2018superior\u2019 rating,\u201d Bell said. \u201cSo that means no more than three errors.\u201d That morning, trying my luck on a blue/purple row, I made only one mistake, and might have congratulated myself had Bell not already told me that Pantone\u2019s reigning color-test champion, a woman named Madlin Tadros, who works in the textiles department, has never erred in 21 years.\n\nThe unremarkable appearance of Pantone\u2019s offices belies the excitement the brand engenders around the world. Designers, regardless of their industry, always seem to have Pantone\u2019s color books within reach, like some sacred text of a secret society. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you look at it,\u201d an interior designer told me. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine working with anything else.\u201d The company\u2019s color standards are often employed by exacting obsessives for decidedly off-label purposes too. A fish company recently enlisted Pantone to assist with a guide for sushi freshness. And Calvin Klein, according to Lisa Marsh\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe House of Klein,\u201d used to keep a Pantone chip taped to the wall next to the office coffee maker \u201cto ensure he\u2019d get just the right mix of coffee and milk every time.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade, Pantone has become a consumer brand in its own right: It now licenses clothes, shoes, cosmetics, kitchenware, furniture, cellphones, jigsaw puzzles, children\u2019s books, skateboards, key chains and thumb drives, in Pantone colors and bearing its logo. Pantone does not report financial information, but Fast Company wrote in 2015 that a full 15 percent of its millions of dollars in annual revenue now derives from commercial licensing.\n\nAnd the cult of Pantone extends far beyond the company\u2019s own merchandise. An online fan club of the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example, has taken to calling itself by the team\u2019s official shade of blue, Pantone 294. An authorized Pantone-themed boutique hotel in Brussels immerses its guests in a kaleidoscopic array of colors, right down to their bedspreads and coffee mugs. Several Instagram users, each with tens of thousands of followers, regularly pair their photographs with the corresponding Pantone chips, and a Brazilian photographer named Ang\u00e9lica Dass has made portraits of more than 3,000 people in 13 countries, all sorted by skin color according to the Pantone Matching System.\n\nThis alchemy of color chips into cultural cachet is largely the work of Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, a small in-house consultancy, founded in 1986. A native New Yorker with shoulder-length brown hair, Pressman arrived at Pantone nearly 20 years ago, shortly after the color industry\u2019s iMac-inaugurated big bang, and since then has worked to make Pantone a household name. Her division produces several seasonal forecasts, as well as a magazine called Viewpoint Colour, which anticipate trends up to three years in advance. It has also helped brands \u2014 from Tiffany and Victoria\u2019s Secret to Barbie, Schweppes and the Royal Mail in Britain \u2014 develop proprietary shades. On the day I visited, Pressman showed me an uncut sheet of soon-to-be-released Pantone chips for Love Symbol No.2, a shade adapted from the purple paint on one of Prince\u2019s favorite pianos and commissioned by his estate after his death.\n\nThat a company engaged in the manufacture of something so intangible \u2014 and, for most consumers, so useless \u2014 as color standards could develop a widespread and devoted following among people far removed from its intended clientele speaks to a larger cultural phenomenon: a growing popular enthusiasm for color in its own right and for its own sake, free of the constraints of form or function. Color\u2019s liberation owes much to the rise of the internet, particularly the explosion of photo sharing on social media. As this digital revolution took shape, Pantone found itself perfectly positioned to exploit it. \u201cPantone did not create desire for color,\u201d said Ellen Sideri, founder and chief executive of ESP TrendLab in the garment district in New York. \u201cIt has, though, facilitated the use of color globally by creating a common digital color language.\u201d A result is that \u201cour culture has become supervisual, and more than ever before. Color has become a definer of many things.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEach December for nearly two decades, the Pantone Color Institute has tried to capture the moment in the form of its Color of the Year, which it has described as \u201ca color snapshot of what we see taking place in our global culture that serves as an expression of a mood and an attitude.\u201d This year\u2019s pick is Ultra Violet (18-3838), a bluish purple that, the company asserts, is associated with the counterculture, nonconformity, mindfulness and visionary thinking, and that \u201csuggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead and the discoveries beyond where we are now.\u201d The release of the Color of the Year occasions a media frenzy and, after it, a torrent of bandwagon-hopping service journalism: For months after this year\u2019s selection, Google Alerts continued to crowd my inbox with articles suggesting how I might use Ultra Violet to update my wardrobe, redecorate my living room, create floral bouquets or crochet a scarf. A Swedish art director created a recipe for an Ultra Violet-colored smoothie.\n\nSometimes Pantone\u2019s pick validates an established trend, as Rose Quartz (13-1520) did for the shade popularly known as Millennial Pink in 2016 \u2014 about as risky a choice as the N.B.A.\u2019s picking LeBron James for Most Valuable Player. In other cases, like Ultra Violet, the company has treaded nearer to the leading edge, more a demonstration of power, perhaps, than astuteness. \u201cThe actual tones themselves I\u2019ve not loved,\u201d Jane Monnington Boddy, the London-based color director at WGSN, a tracker of global fashion trends, told me. But over all, she said, she was impressed with \u201cthe philosophy behind them and how they\u2019ve captured what\u2019s happening in life.\u201d\n\nThe Pantone Color Institute is less the elite unit its name implies than a loose network of specialists drawn from Pressman\u2019s contacts. They live in roughly 20 countries and travel the world, she told me, from the established fashion capitals of Europe to other \u201ctrend forward\u201d cities like Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Melbourne and Cape Town, scouring the fashion, technology, houseware, home-furnishing and automotive industries for glimmers of nascent color trends. \u201cI\u2019m very circumspect about who I bring in,\u201d Pressman told me. \u201cThat person has to be of a certain caliber.\u201d\n\nThe person whose judgment Pressman trusts most lives and works in a restored farmhouse painted in the earthy red shade of Rosewood (19-1532). It is set amid towering coniferous trees along a quiet, well-to-do street on Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound, about 35 minutes by ferry from downtown Seattle. The rolling grounds surrounding the house feature carefully tended gardens of hydrangeas in various colors and a rainbow of other flowering plants, each one identified, like shades in a Pantone fan deck, with a label staked into the loam. The owner is the Pantone Color Institute\u2019s always immaculately dressed executive director, Leatrice Eiseman. She began consulting for the company in 1985 at the invitation of the founder, Larry Herbert, and since then has become its public face or, as one of her European associates put it, \u201cMs. Color in America.\u201d\n\nI visited Eiseman in July, when she was teaching her annual class on trend forecasting and color psychology at the Bainbridge Island Museum of Art, and she allowed me to sit in. When I met her at the museum, Eiseman, with her thick-framed glasses, jewelry and bobbed, sandy blond hair, bore more than a passing resemblance to Anna Wintour. Her long-sleeved shirt and patterned pants, precisely coordinated, offered an eye-catching blend of oranges, greens and blues, as if she meant her attire to double as a kind of couture business card.\n\nI sat in the back row of a classroom on the museum\u2019s second floor and watched her students file in. There were two dozen of them, most in their 20s or 30s, all but one of them women. Rami Kim, the founder of a color institute in Seoul who was on her third pilgrimage to Bainbridge, had brought along seven other South Koreans. Sitting to my right was a former nurse from South Africa, now an interior designer, who said she was hoping to learn more about color combinations, and to my left, a young woman who worked for a small family-owned party-supply company, who told me she was interested in the application of color to edible paper. The lone man in the class was a software engineer contemplating a change of careers to something \u201cmore creative.\u201d All the students paid $1,775 for the privilege of being there, and several of them spoke of their instructor with a respect bordering on reverence. \u201cThere\u2019s no one who can talk about color like she can,\u201d one of them told me.\n\nPromptly at 8 a.m., Eiseman switched off the lights and asked a student to close the blinds. \u201cThe colors will be more vibrant if we get more darkness,\u201d she said. For the next six hours, clicking through illustrative photographs from her travels to more than 60 countries, Eiseman delivered a cascade of assertions: Kids everywhere in the world gravitate to red, blue and yellow crayons; people living near the Equator tend to prefer brighter colors; readers have better recall if texts are printed in something other than black and white; gamblers place higher bets under red lights than under blue ones; there was no word for the color \u201corange\u201d in Europe until the fruit arrived sometime in the Middle Ages; blue shutters in the American southwest are meant to ward off evil spirits; many fire departments have begun painting their engines yellow-green because red, the traditional color, too often appears brown in twilight. At one point, when Eiseman paused to take questions, a young woman raised her hand.\n\n\u201cAre there people you can\u2019t teach color to, people who just don\u2019t get it?\u201d she asked.\n\nEiseman thought for a moment, and said, \u201cYou get resistance from people when you\u2019re working, people who think that color is immaterial, not as important as everything else, but you can usually find something to talk about in their background, mostly coming out of their childhood, that will trigger a response.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe idea that colors exert powerful, often subliminal forces on the human mind is at once Eiseman\u2019s ardent belief and her professional stock in trade. As she wrote 18 years ago in \u201cPantone Guide to Communicating With Color,\u201d \u201csome experts believe that humans have an \u2018ancient wisdom,\u2019 that throughout eons of evolutionary history going back to the beginning of time, we have an associative memory concerning space, form, patterns and colors.\u201d Leveraging that wisdom and revealing the unspoken meanings and emotions conveyed by slight, almost imperceptible variations in color has been her life\u2019s work.\n\nEiseman was born and raised in Baltimore. As a teenager, she dabbled in modeling and won a voice scholarship to the Peabody Institute, but turned it down after deciding against pursuing a career in music. A few years later she met Herb Eiseman, her future husband, a Hollywood talent agent who went on to lead the music publishing division at 20th Century Fox. The couple married and moved to the Los Angeles area, where Eiseman finished her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at Antioch University and, afterward, earned a counseling certificate from U.C.L.A. She and Herb had two children, and while they were in school, Eiseman began teaching classes part time at an occupational-training center for women in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nIt was there that she began thinking systematically about color. \u201cThe concept that I developed was called the \u2018color clock,\u2019 and it was based on color as it appears in nature,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow Monet painted the haystacks, various things at various times of day, and how the color seemed to change because of the light.\u201d She applied the idea to women\u2019s clothes and cosmetics, \u201cusing my students as guinea pigs to see if it really held weight.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, she published a book called \u201cAlive With Color.\u201d Soon, she was fielding phone calls asking her to weigh in on the color of everything from living rooms to medical equipment. One caller was Pantone\u2019s Larry Herbert, who invited her to meet with him in New York. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know Pantone existed,\u201d she said. It turned out that Herbert, who\u2019d seen her book, was on the hunt for someone with expertise in the psychology of color, in part to help elevate his company\u2019s public profile. Eiseman jumped at the chance, and 33 years later, she\u2019s still Pantone\u2019s ambassador at large.\n\nEiseman believes that our reaction to colors \u201cgoes beyond the psychological into the physiological\u201d and that colors carry inherent messages that all humans innately understand \u2014 the whispers of that \u201cancient wisdom.\u201d She doesn\u2019t deny the important influence of memory and social factors on color perception, but often, she says, \u201cour response is involuntary, and we simply have no control over it.\u201d As evidence, she points to word-association tests she has administered over the years during her work with Pantone. I asked to see a sample test and some results, but Eiseman refused and said they were proprietary. You can get a feel for her methods, though, from a 2015 interview she gave to Nautilus magazine. \u201cYou take a Pantone color chip and you ask, \u2018Give us the first word that pops into your mind when you look at this color,\u2019 and you see whether that corresponds to a positive, negative or indifferent response,\u201d Eiseman said. \u201cIf you show people a chip of Pantone Sky Blue, about 90 percent or more will respond in the same way: It\u2019s the color of the sky, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s a light color, it reminds you of that openness. It\u2019s a near-universal response that you get.\u201d\n\nLast October, Eiseman published her 10th book, \u201cThe Complete Color Harmony, Pantone Edition,\u201d her boldest statement yet on the psychology of color \u2014 and one that might rightly be displayed in the self-help section. Consider a chapter titled, \u201cPersonal Colors: What Do They Say About You?\u201d which offers a kind of chromatic horoscope that locates truths not in the cosmos but in the spectrum of visible light. Take blue, my favorite color. \u201cBlue people aspire to harmony, serenity, patience, perseverance and peace, and have a calming influence on other people,\u201d she writes. \u201cYou are generally unflappable, even-tempered and reliable, a team player and good co-worker.\u201d\n\nYep, that\u2019s me down to the ground, I thought as I read it. But what about people who don\u2019t like blue? \u201cPerhaps you want to change your job, a relationship or even your life, and long for more excitement,\u201d Eiseman writes. \u201cYou wish that you were wealthy or brilliant (or both), because that would enable you to have all the good things in life without working so hard.\u201d\n\nAll that from a color? And the fortunetelling continues. Do you like green? \u201cYou are the good citizen, concerned parent, involved neighbor, the joiner of clubs and organizations.\u201d Have an aversion to red? You may be \u201cirritable, exhausted or bothered by many problems.\u201d Yellow? \u201cYou are optimistic, hopeful and encourage others to do their best.\u201d Perhaps strangest of all, though, is Eiseman\u2019s observation about those of us who dislike blue-green shades like turquoise or teal: \u201cA little voice inside you (was it your mother, your father or your roommate?) keeps telling you to clean up your room.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe flip tone of these pronouncements, combined with the lack of any grounding in scientific rigor or research apart from Eiseman\u2019s own observations, may tempt you to dismiss color psychology altogether, consigning it to the bin with other junk sciences, like phrenology or cold fusion. But a great many people take it seriously \u2014 so many, in fact, that for all my searching, I found only one person willing to question it. When I put Eiseman\u2019s assertions to David Comberg, a senior lecturer of design at the University of Pennsylvania, he scoffed and said that color preferences are highly subjective, unpredictable and, in his experience, \u201cprimarily influenced by culture and emotion and are not easily quantified.\u201d When we see red, for instance, are we reacting to the color itself or to a personal experience, perhaps buried in the subconscious, that we associate with it? \u201cAnd what about taste, smell and sound? Artificial intelligence and neuroscience may one day answer all this, but I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Comberg said. \u201cIt all seems subjective and irrational.\u201d\n\nBut among people in Eiseman\u2019s profession, as with the hordes of credulous color enthusiasts who populate the internet, her views are not only uncontroversial but well within the mainstream. \u201cWe are born to understand that green equals calming, because it\u2019s found in nature; red equals danger, because it\u2019s the color of blood,\u201d Jenny Ross, a creative- design manager in the footwear department at New Balance, told me. \u201cYellow equals energy, because it\u2019s the color of the sun.\u201d WGSN\u2019s Jane Monnington Boddy agreed, saying, \u201cPeople do have an inbuilt, preprogrammed understanding of colors, as animals do in nature.\u201d What else explains our instinct to recoil from red-and-black snakes, she asked, or from yellow-and-black flying insects?\n\nUltimately, though, whether blue makes you think of the sky or Papa Smurf, by this point, color psychology may matter less to Pantone\u2019s success than something much less mysterious. \u201cHow do you sell color?\u201d David Shah had asked me rhetorically when I met him in London. \u201cYou can be 10 times cleverer than me. You can be much more intelligent, much more creative. But it\u2019s Pantone, with a million Instagram followers. If you\u2019re hidden away, even though your color is better, you don\u2019t win the argument.\u201d\n\nAt a certain point, Pantone\u2019s prognostications began to take on the weight of self-fulfilling prophecies. Much like investors who base financial decisions on the assessments of Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s, Pantone\u2019s clientele seems to understand that, for all the time and effort the company expends in identifying color trends, it\u2019s the judgments themselves, regardless of the research behind them, that matter most. \u201cBecause of our platform, we\u2019re able to promote,\u201d Shah said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s self-perpetuating \u2014 when people believe you\u2019re right, they buy you. You get to be right!\u201d\n\nWhen I brought up the Color of the Year, Shah trod carefully at first \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything about what I think about this, O.K.?\u201d \u2014 then went on: \u201cYou might go: \u2018Oh, my God! That\u2019s the most awful color in the world! Who would choose it?\u2019 And then you\u2019re like, \u2018I better be careful, because it\u2019s the Pantone Color of the Year, and everybody\u2019s looking at it, and if I don\u2019t, I could be left out.\u2019 When you\u2019ve got a platform like that, you can say it\u2019s the color of my toenails! Can I afford not to do it, even if I don\u2019t believe in it? It\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nMADE IN THE SHADE Choosing exactly the right color has become a high-stakes decision.

For example, he vowed to purge the state university system of any employee who supported \u201cNegroes in the same schools with white folks in Georgia,\u201d a stand that helped cost the state\u2019s white colleges their accreditation. He staged an electoral comeback with a pledge to restore all-white primary elections. He used martial law to wage political turf battles, and he was implicated in corruption.\n\nNone of that stopped the state from naming a bridge over the Savannah River for Mr. Talmadge in the 1950s, when his son Herman Talmadge was governor. By the 1980s, that cantilever-truss bridge was posing problems for large new container ships headed for the Port of Savannah. So the state replaced it in 1991 with the cable-stayed bridge that appears in so many postcards and snapshots today \u2014 and kept on using the Talmadge name, perhaps out of no more than habit.\n\nAnd that, Mr. Stephens said, could create the opening for state lawmakers to give the bridge a new name, unburdened by having to formally remove the old one.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, there is a huge resistance for us to start doing that, and making those changes at a later time,\u201d said Mr. Stephens, who has sat in the Legislature through years of arguments over the Confederate symbols on the state flag.\n\nIf officials do find proof that the 1991 bridge was formally named, any proposal to change it will be \u201cdead in the water,\u201d he said, but \u201cas long as you\u2019re not talking about a renaming, I\u2019m not running into resistance at all.\u201d (Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, whose board had the power to name bridges until 2002, said Friday that formal action to name the new bridge in 1991 had not been necessary.)\n\nGov.

The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don\u2019t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.\u2019s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation.\n\n\u2014 Peter J. Henning\n\nSomething spooked investors on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day.\n\nWhy?\n\nThere didn\u2019t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish.\n\nPerhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday\u2019s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank\u2019s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed\u2019s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market\u2019s plunge. The minutes state:\n\nIn connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nBroadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid\n\nQualcomm defied Broadcom\u2019s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated.\n\nBroadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm\u2019s shareholders. From the news release:\n\nBroadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS\u2019s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm\u2019s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP\u2019s activist stockholders.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the math\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom\u2019s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom\u2019s last bid \u2014 the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close \u2014 still stand.)\n\n\u2022 Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price.\n\n\u2022 Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn\u2019t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year.\n\nThe bet on the shareholder meeting\n\nBroadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm\u2019s annual shareholder meeting.\n\nBroadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm\u2019s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees.\n\nA Qualcomm representative didn\u2019t have an immediate comment.\n\nHow the shares moved today: Qualcomm\u2019s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom\u2019s were up slightly. Shares in NXP \u2014 the real winner in this deal saga so far \u2014 were essentially unchanged.\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nThe deals flyaround\n\n\u2022 Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm.

Annual growth in output per hour worked, previous five years % 4 3 2 1 0 0.9% 1960 1980 2000 Annual growth in output per hour worked, previous five years % 4 3 2 1 0 0.9% \u201955 \u201960 \u201965 \u201970 \u201975 \u201980 \u201985 \u201990 \u201995 \u201900 \u201905 \u201910 \u201915\n\nUntangling the productivity mystery.\n\nAn economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes \u2013 and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot\u2019s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey\u2019s main finding:\n\nThe latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy \u2014 what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it \u2014 but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don\u2019t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so.\n\nLittle in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey\u2019s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity.\n\nIn the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence.\n\n2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries?\n\nFirst, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain\u2019s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nOr is productivity suffering because certain companies have become too big?\n\nNew research posted by France\u2019s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy \u201cmonopoly rents,\u201d the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms.\n\n\u201cIf these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.\u201d\n\nDavid Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nJ.P.

I believe they did all they could, and when it became clear that he would die, they were very supportive. I was 20 weeks pregnant at the time, and they went above and beyond to look after us both. One example: We had decided not to know the sex of the baby, but when we realized he wasn\u2019t going to make it to the birth, the midwives in the hospital brought a mobile scanner up to the ward so that my husband could have a last look at the baby, and we could learn the sex together. That meant so much to us. And after he died I had extra appointments and scans (at no extra cost) to reassure me that the stress and emotions hadn\u2019t affected the baby. Again, not everything was perfect, but I just can\u2019t imagine going through all of that, and having to deal with insurance companies and money worries as well. \u2014 Kate Trouw, United Kingdom\n\nI would not wish the U.S. medical system on anyone\n\nI am an American living in Britain.

We get paid a lot of money to do so, so I\u2019m going to live with it, and I don\u2019t think I would ever get tired of it.

While current climate models can provide broad statistical projections of how average temperatures and rainfall patterns are likely to shift across large regions over the coming century, it remains difficult to predict such shifts precisely over shorter time scales \u2014 which is what companies are often most concerned about.\n\n\u201cForecasting at 10-20 year time periods is perhaps the most difficult period to forecast,\u201d Simon Mason, a climate scientist at Columbia University\u2019s International Research Institute for Climate and Society who is not involved with Jupiter, wrote in an email. \u201cIf that is not enough, trying to predict severe weather events rather than long-term averages is even harder still!\u201d\n\nPast efforts to provide what are known as \u201cclimate services\u201d have struggled with this issue. In 2009, the German government established the Climate Service Center to provide information about global warming risks to cities and businesses. But Guy P. Brasseur, a climate scientist who helped start the center, said potential clients were often disappointed with the uncertainty in the resulting forecasts.\n\n\u201cOne airline wanted to know how often the airport in Frankfurt would be closed because of snowstorms next year,\u201d Dr. Brasseur said. \u201cWe were unable to answer a question like that.\u201d\n\nJupiter, which acknowledges the uncertainties in climate forecasting, will have to prove that a market exists. But at least one firm in the insurance industry sees potential value in the company\u2019s approach, particularly after flooding and other disasters caused $306 billion in damages last year in the United States and record losses by insurers.\n\n\u201cThat certainly raised the stakes in terms of trying to get the best possible science on your side when you\u2019re pricing risk,\u201d said John Drzik, president of global risk at Marsh, one of the world\u2019s largest commercial insurance brokers, which is currently in talks with Jupiter to explore what types of data and risk analyses might be most useful to its clients.\n\nMr. Drzik noted that many of the traditional catastrophic risk models used by the insurance industry are rooted largely in historical data and don\u2019t always grapple fully with how climate change could shift those risks in the future. While his company is still evaluating whether Jupiter\u2019s climate-oriented models are useful enough to be worth paying for, \u201cit grabbed us as something that had a lot of promise.\u201d", "title": "What Land Will Be Underwater in 20 Years?

His latest, \u201cLewis Black \u2014 Black to the Future,\u201d was released last fall.\n\nMr. Black travels the country doing as many as 200 shows a year, so he has become obsessed with finding direct flights \u2014 \u201cAll I care about are direct flights.

{"date": "2018-02-12 00:00:00", "text": "Many of them had spent their weeks looking for jobs or permanent housing, or walked over to a nearby church that had opened up its kitchen for them to cook in. The children went to school. But this was a Friday night, and as they splayed out on beds watching TV, listened to music or played video games, it felt like they were just killing time, one day passing like so many others before it.\n\nThey had air-conditioning. They were not waiting for hours in lines for food, water and fuel. They had cable television. Still, the aimlessness that plagued them seemed like an extension of the storm\u2019s trauma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for anybody to live like this,\u201d Janette Febres told me in the room where she, her husband and 12-year-old son had shared a bed for months.\n\nI have never traveled to Puerto Rico, before or after Maria. My impressions of how so much had been upended were formed by the stories told by Puerto Ricans, the photographs they showed me, the distress I saw in their lives. On the other hand, my partner on the story, Luis Ferr\u00e9-Sadurn\u00ed, who visited a hotel in Queens, was a native of Puerto Rico. He had spent nearly 40 days there reporting after Hurricanes Irma and Maria and had experienced, as he put it, the dire conditions that \u201cdisrupted their lives and led thousands to take that leap of faith\u201d to leave behind their homes for the mainland.\n\nMy reporting was certainly informed by my own experience with storms. I grew up on the Gulf Coast of Texas. I\u2019ve spent hours packed into a minivan with family and the dog, trying to get a couple of hundred miles away, and spent weeks staying with relatives wondering what I would return to. But the scope of the turmoil and uncertainty these families from Puerto Rico faced was well beyond what I knew.\n\nLuis and I were taken by similar observations of the dilemma these families faced: \u201cTry to make it on the mainland, where many have struggled to find jobs and housing,\u201d Luis said, \u201cor return to Puerto Rico, where stability is still elusive.\u201d\n\nMost of the families he interviewed, he said, \u201chad not yet found what they ultimately left their homeland looking for: a sense of stability.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all the people we met, a young family that Luis found in Queens stuck with me the most. Yanitza Cruz was nearly eight months pregnant; her due date and the expiration date for her family\u2019s FEMA-provided hotel were worryingly close. The family traveled from a remote mountain town to New York using almost all of their savings. Her husband, Joel Garc\u00eda, even panhandled.\n\nBut they maintained an incredible level of optimism. They talked about getting an apartment in New York, and him finding work as a barber. As most of us in New York groan over subway delays, he was astonished at how he could journey across a metropolis for the swipe of his MetroCard. And the family marveled at the generosity they have been shown.\n\nOn a visit to the Puerto Rican Family Institute, they met a maintenance worker who took Mr. Garc\u00eda to a department store and bought every member of the family a jacket. He did not even look at the price tags. His name was Nate. \u201cI\u2019m never going to forget you,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda said he told Nate.\n\nOf all that remained uncertain, he and his wife had settled one thing: When she gives birth next month, they plan to name their son Nate.", "title": "What Life Is Like in a Hurricane Hotel", "authors": ["Rick Rojas"]}
