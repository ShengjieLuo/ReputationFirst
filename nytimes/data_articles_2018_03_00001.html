Elected on promises to enact more business-friendly labor laws, put the pension system on sounder footing, cut some taxes on the wealthy and address a host of other issues that his predecessors failed to solve, he has spent his first 10 months in office methodically working through his to-do list.\n\nBut there is also concern among his critics that a young and inexperienced legislature is deferring to him too much, allowing him at times to govern almost by edict, often bypassing debate and dismissing criticism.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a bad example for democracy, but a good example for reform,\u201d said Patrick Vignal, a survivor from the previous assembly and now a supporter of Mr. Macron in Parliament. He spoke with a grin, but some of his colleagues express similar sentiments with dead seriousness.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Macron has come to embody a paradox of French politics. Abroad Mr. Macron has been seen as vital European defender of liberal democratic values after France sidestepped the West\u2019s turn to populism by rejecting the far-right National Front in elections last year.\n\nBut in place of populism, France got a sort of humanist but all-powerful leader who muses aloud about the solitary exercise of power, faces little internal dissent, and has effectively neutered the opposition.\n\nLess than a year into his presidency, Mr. Macron\u2019s push to upend France has spawned intense and sometimes overheated reactions. He is routinely if perhaps hyperbolically compared to either Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis XIV in the French press.\n\nBut there is no appetite to challenge or slow Mr. Macron down in the National Assembly, which is wholly dominated by his newly branded political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, or the Republic on the Move.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe assembly has become a showcase of Mr. Macron\u2019s forceful powers of persuasion and the ways he wants to reshape and update all of France.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a complete cultural shock,\u201d said Jean-Paul Delevoye, a senior official in Mr. Macron\u2019s government who helped pick his candidates for Parliament.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve completely overturned the sociology of the assembly,\u201d he added.\n\nDiet Coke replaced wine as the most popular item at the assembly\u2019s bar.

There is little patience for them in any case.\n\nBut the ambition is also infused with arrogance, critics say, a charge frequently leveled at Mr. Macron himself.\n\n\u201cThey give the impression that the world begins with them,\u201d grumbled Boris Vallaud, a rare remaining Socialist. \u201cBefore, there were only imbeciles.

Mr. Macron wants to end the hiring-for-life, early retirement and enhanced medical insurance that have contributed to a whopping deficit.

Some of Mr. Macron\u2019s recent initiatives have made it ever more clear that he is not thinking about them very much.\n\nHe is aiming to limit the rights of members to propose amendments, and he wants to cut back on the number of deputies altogether, by about one-third.\n\nFor his dedicated supporters in Parliament, subordination is not an issue. Asked whether he had been in disagreement with the government, Mr. Potterie replied: \u201cAh, no. No. At the margins maybe. But for the moment, no.\u201d\n\nIn the National Assembly, \u201cit\u2019s true that we don\u2019t challenge the government,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s because we were elected to carry out their program.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat sense of purpose runs deep.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true that we are simply puppets,\u201d insisted Ms. Bourguignon, the former Socialist. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a government that reforms, and we\u2019ve got to follow the government.\u201d", "title": "Emmanuel Macron Becomes France\u2019s Answer to Strongman Populism", "authors": ["Adam Nossiter"]}

And former officials pointed to the publication this week of Mr. Olmert\u2019s memoir, which includes his account of the operation. Mr. Barak\u2019s memoir is expected to come out in May.\n\nRevisiting the episode may help rehabilitate the reputations of some of the protagonists, particularly Mr. Olmert, who resigned from office in 2008 in disgrace. Already blamed for what many Israelis saw as an unsuccessful war in Lebanon in 2006, he left under a cloud of criminal investigations and was later convicted of corruption charges. He served 16 months in jail before his release last year.\n\nIn excerpts from his book published in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot on Wednesday, Mr. Olmert accused Mr. Barak, who became defense minister in June 2007, of seeking to delay the attack on the reactor even if that meant waiting until after it had become \u201chot,\u201d or operational. At that point, any strike could have led to radioactive contamination of a large area.\n\nMr. Olmert contended that Mr. Barak believed Mr. Olmert would soon have to resign, and that Mr. Barak could then carry out the strike himself and reap all the glory. Yediot Ahronot\u2019s publishing house is publishing Mr. Olmert\u2019s book.\n\nMr. Barak denied any such motivation in Israeli media interviews. Describing the atmosphere in Mr. Olmert\u2019s security cabinet as one of \u201chysteria,\u201d he said his interest had been in making sure the operation was properly planned and that contingencies were in place in case war broke out.", "title": "Ending Secrecy, Israel Says It Bombed Syrian Reactor in 2007", "authors": []}

But that\u2019s different. They have opposition parties who pick their faults every day.\u201d\n\nHow did it become important?\n\nThe presidential term limit became more important in the 1990s, when Deng prepared to pass power to his successor, Jiang Zemin.\n\nUnder Deng in the 1980s, there was turmoil in succession, as two prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were forced to resign following student demonstrations. Deng tried to ensure the success of his final choice, Mr. Jiang, by setting him up in China\u2019s three most powerful posts: Communist Party general secretary, chairman of the commission in charge of the military and the presidency, which Mr. Jiang took over in 1993.\n\nBut Deng also wanted to ensure that Mr. Jiang did not stay on indefinitely. He started a succession cycle by also promoting Mr. Jiang\u2019s younger heir-apparent, Hu Jintao.\n\nUnder Mr. Jiang and later Mr. Hu, a new norm formed. The top leader had clear authority because he held all three main posts. But he had to hand them to a successor after about a decade.\n\n\u201cThe three-in-one leadership system and form \u2014 of party general secretary, state president and military commission chairman \u2014 is not only necessary but also the most fitting for a great party and a great country like ours,\u201d Mr. Jiang said in 2004.\n\nThat arrangement allowed two of the most stable transitions of power in China\u2019s modern history, from Mr. Jiang to Mr. Hu in 2002, and then Mr. Hu to Mr. Xi six years ago.\n\nIs the presidency powerful in China?\n\nIn China, the political job that matters most is the general secretary of the Communist Party. The party controls the military and domestic security forces, and sets the policies that the government carries out. China\u2019s presidency lacks the authority of the American and French presidencies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis difference is reflected in language. In Chinese, China\u2019s president is called \u201czhuxi,\u201d which really translates as \u201cchairman.\u201d Foreign presidents get a different title, \u201czongtong.\u201d So in effect, Chinese people are referring to Mr. Xi as the \u201cstate chairman,\u201d though in English his title is officially translated as \u201cstate president\u201d to put him on an even footing with other world leaders.\n\nStill, the Chinese presidency is not entirely ceremonial. The president has the power, acting with the legislature, to declare war or a state of emergency. In times of crisis, disagreement between a party leader and president could cause trouble.\n\nThe presidency has become increasingly prominent thanks to China\u2019s growing global stature. At home, Mr. Xi usually speaks as party leader; abroad, he appears as president, who is the formal head of state. Mr. Xi relishes the prestige of state visits to the White House or Buckingham Palace, which might be awkward if he were not president.\n\nWhy change the system?\n\nThe official Chinese news media have said that Mr. Xi wants to abandon the term limit so that he can keep his trinity of leadership posts. According to Xinhua News Agency and other party-run news outlets, having a term limit on just the presidency is unreasonable because neither of Mr. Xi\u2019s other two major posts \u2014 party leader and military chairman \u2014 has a similar limit.\n\nOf course, this argument does not address the other solution to that inconsistency: imposing limits on the party and military posts. His action leaves little doubt that Mr. Xi is clearing the way to remain top leader for a long time to come, and without clear rivals.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIf the term limit remained, Mr. Xi would have to step down as president at the end of his next five-year term, in 2023. Any successor could potentially become a rival.\n\nMr. Xi seems determined to remain \u201cthree-in-one\u201d leader because he sees himself on a historic mission to make China into a great power. Achieving that will take more than a decade, Xi has said.\n\nLast year, Mr. Xi showed his intent to stay in power by declining to promote a potential successor into the new Politburo Standing Committee, the party\u2019s most powerful body. Mr. Xi and Mr. Hu both served political apprenticeships in the Standing Committee before taking over.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWill Xi will be leader for life?\n\nMr. Xi has produced plenty of surprises in his first five years in power, not least his decision to abolish the term limit before his second term as president had even started. So predicting Mr. Xi\u2019s future steps isn\u2019t easy.\n\nEven so, The People\u2019s Daily said earlier this month that ending the presidential term limit does not \u201cimply a system of lifelong leadership.\u201d The point seems to be that while Mr. Xi may be around for a while, he won\u2019t be another Mao, who remained in power even as he grew ill and incoherent with age.\n\nBut Mr. Xi has not specified how many terms he plans on. Perhaps Mr. Xi himself does not have a firm idea yet.

And not just because I have been charged with doing so once a week. Here\u2019s the thing: Memory, where you store your vocabulary, expand and draw on it for tough clues, is stored in a different place in your brain than imagination, where you make creative connections.\n\nTo me, even if they\u2019re fanciful, those connections add an extra layer of gratification. Today\u2019s puzzle by Damon Gulczynski, for example, touched on one of my own interests (no, not CHEEZ WHIZ, people, have a heart) with two of its clues, 16A and 48A. Both are to do with Eastern religions, Buddhism and Taoism (the painting above is an illustration of a Taoist parable). I was honestly raised with no religion at all, and as a younger person read a bunch of Jack Kerouac and caught his fascination with Buddhism, then had the opportunity to study it a bit in school. I don\u2019t pretend to know much and I didn\u2019t know 16A, but my gray cells were activated enough to look at the world (for a day, at least) through a different lens entirely.\n\nI was surprised to find out there were only four debut entries here, and they weren\u2019t really such outlandish terms: POSTERIZE, NUDE SCENE, TATTOOIST and IT\u2019S A WRAP. Very Hollywood, all, and apt for this big award weekend. But otherwise there seemed to be a pretty exotic menagerie, including unfamiliar clues for names like SANTO, EDER and OMAR; a bunch of slangy expressions (including a couple of long ones \u2014 EXCUSE YOU, LAZYBONES); a ton of abbreviations and shortcuts, many of which solvers are primed to pick up on \u2014 REM, IPO, OPED \u2014 and a couple of oddballs, to me at least, like PARA and ASTI.\n\nTricky Clues\n\n1A: Truth be told, most of my waking hours are devoted to you people, but my actual day job depends on knowing technology. I\u2019d seen and used \u201crasterize\u201d before, a process that converts type, for example, to pixels on an image.

Accomplishing this involved four 15-letter entries \u2014 two across and two down \u2014 no mean feat for Mr. Huget, but really mean for us solvers.\n\nTo me there was an air of the classic forbidding Saturday puzzle to this one. With a couple of notably lowbrow exceptions (looking at you, IOU), the tone of the clues and the quality of the entries was less trendy than we\u2019ve seen of late, the cultural references (VERE, SOREN, LE CID) a bit more academic, and the jokes a bit upper crustier.\n\nTricky Clues\n\n8A: It struck me, while figuring this clue out, how obsolete the cassette recorder is. Could tapes ever have the cachet of vinyl, unless you have an affection for pops and hisses? I\u2019m old enough to remember people who hoarded audiotapes of Grateful Dead shows (and usually asked me to help them move, with giant stacks of these plastic boxes reverently mummified in duct tape). Anyhow, I\u2019d seen the word CAPSTAN before, as a nautical term, which is how it\u2019d previously been clued. It\u2019s a leveraged reel, basically, used on a ship for raising anchor, or on a cassette deck for hitching along your little magnetic strip so you can rock it with a boombox.\n\n17A: When you\u2019ve handled every last detail, you\u2019ve crossed all your T\u2019s and DOTTED every I.\n\n28A: I believe I\u2019ve been conflating \u201csheared\u201d and SHEERED my whole life. You shear a sheep: T his involves a lot of wrestling while wielding a clipping shear that runs down the body, shaving the hair as close as possible to the skin. If you\u2019ve ever tried this or watched it, there\u2019s something of a visual metaphor there for a ship\u2019s wake, or a harvester cutting through a field of wheat, in that this smooth path forms and the shears work in quick strokes that are sort of akin to quick changes of course elsewhere, such as at sea. I tend to think of \u201csheer\u201d in terms of transparency, or the steepness of a cliff, but it also applies to certain maneuvers like those of a ship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n35A: Since both long across entries involved pop culture, I figured I\u2019d explicate one of them. k.d. lang and Radiohead are contemporaries \u2014 Radiohead\u2019s first U.S. single, \u201cCreep,\u201d also dates to 1992 \u2014 and I can\u2019t get 31A out of my head at this point so I figured I wouldn\u2019t inflict that on you. But Radiohead, a band that is still around and labeled by some a 21st-century Beatles, is also commonly labeled ALTERNATIVE ROCK. It\u2019s a bit odd; usually college bands and less popular \u201csleeper\u201d acts fit this category, and Radiohead sells out huge stadiums. But it\u2019s definitely not your typical Top-40 band. Now I\u2019ve got 31A plus this track duking it out between my ears.\n\n1D: The role here refers to helicopters making emergency medical rescues, or MEDEVAC.

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Massing\u2019s book begins with chapters alternating equitably between the two men. However, Luther \u2014 obdurate and reckless, bilious and doctrinaire \u2014 eventually swamps the book, as he eventually swamped the urbane and ironic man of letters. The Christianity that Erasmus advocated \u2014 eschewing the finer points of metaphysics in favor of the humility, simplicity and charity he saw in Jesus of Nazareth \u2014 was overpowered by Luther\u2019s conviction that the Word of God, revealed in Scripture, speaks unambiguously on all doctrinal matters, no matter how abstruse. For Luther, who as a young monk had suffered from Anfechtungen (his word for the terror and despair at the thought that God would momentarily be judging him and find him failing), only apodictic certitude would do.\n\nBoth men displayed a fierce determination in the way they overcame their inauspicious beginnings. Erasmus was the illegitimate son of a physician\u2019s daughter and a priest; he rued the unlawfulness of the union all his life. He named himself Desiderius, meaning longed for. More apt would have been Desiderans, for longing. Both parents died early, and he was coerced by his guardian into a monastery and later into taking the vows of priesthood. He found monastic life suffocating, longing for the spirit of the Renaissance that had taken hold in Italy, inspired by the newly awakened passion for classical wisdom. Like Petrarch, Erasmus searched out the pagan manuscripts disintegrating in monasteries, laboriously taught himself ancient Greek and cultivated a stylistically dazzling Latin. Such achievements counted, for him, as moral achievements, almost on a par with the Christian virtues. He was a firm believer in human perfectibility, which is one of the convictions that would put him on a collision course with Luther, committed to the incorrigible depravity of human nature.\n\nErasmus\u2019s humanist scholarship and reformist Christianity converged in his \u201cNovum Instrumentum,\u201d the first Greek New Testament ever to be published. His motivation was to better Christianity by correcting corruptions of the original Greek that had insinuated themselves into the Latin Vulgate. While the orthodox condemned him, the implication that errors were embedded in church tenets made him a hero to some, including an obscure young man seeking certitude in a monastery in Wittenberg.\n\nImage\n\nWhere Erasmus had found it necessary to flee from monastic life, Luther fled to it, against his father\u2019s wishes. But even within the monastery, his Anfechtungen continued. How could one know that all one\u2019s pious efforts would be judged adequate in the eyes of God? He eventually found his answer, gleaned from his reading of Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans: We need not worry about failing, since nothing we do makes any difference. Our fate is predestined by God, and our salvation will come through faith in that conviction. Luther\u2019s famous principle of \u201cjustification by faith,\u201d making (some of) us passive recipients of God\u2019s unearned love, would become central in the movement that would eventually be known as Protestantism.\n\nFor Luther, nothing he didn\u2019t personally hear reverberating within the words of Scripture could be sanctioned, including the vast hierarchy of the church and its self-serving dictums. Erasmus\u2019s declaration (in his \u201cEnchiridion\u201d) that \u201cmonasticism is not piety\u201d resonated with him. He also used Erasmus\u2019s New Testament (the second of the five editions it would undergo) for his own translation of Scripture into German, so that the people themselves might take their religion directly from that one true source. \u201cAll Christians are priests,\u201d Luther provocatively wrote.", "title": "Erasmus vs. Luther \u2014 a Rift That Defined the Course of Western Civilization", "authors": []}

Many European leaders distrust Mr. Trump, who says he sees them less as allies than as competitors. But if moving closer to China once seemed like a smart hedge, at least while Mr. Trump was in office, now Mr. Xi also presents a problem \u2014 and he may not be going away.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection point,\u201d said Orville Schell, director of the Center on U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society. \u201cThe Western world now understands that we have to take China\u2019s push out into the world much more seriously than we have in the past.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s declaration that he will impose stinging tariffs on imported steel will hurt Europe more than China, another example of how Europe is getting caught between Washington and Beijing.\n\nEuropean political leaders were already growing wary of Chinese intentions, especially given the vacuum of foreign policy leadership from the Trump administration and the persistent meddling from Russia. Last month, Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel of Germany warned that China was pursuing its own model of world order and attempting \u201cto put a Chinese stamp on the world and impose a Chinese system, a real global system but not like ours, based on human rights and individual liberties.\u201d\n\nMr. Gabriel was especially concerned about China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, a huge infrastructure project promoted by Mr. Xi to expand Chinese power by developing new trade routes, including in Europe. To expedite this, Beijing has created the \u201c16 plus 1\u201d group, which brings China together with 16 European nations, 11 of them members of the European Union and the rest from the western Balkans.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t succeed in developing a single strategy toward China,\u201d said Mr. Gabriel in an earlier speech, \u201cthen China will succeed in dividing Europe.\u201d\n\nAt the time, some regarded his remarks as alarmist. Less so now. Despite Germany\u2019s huge exports to China and investment there \u2014 China is Germany\u2019s largest trading partner, with two-way trade last year of $230 billion \u2014 even the German ambassador in Beijing, Michael Clauss, has openly criticized China\u2019s policies and domestic repression, a marked change from years of German silence.\n\nPhoto\n\nChinese companies have also made waves by buying a major German machine-tool and robotics company, Kuka, and then trying to buy a key semiconductor company, Aixtron. The latter bid was blocked by American objections on security grounds. The sudden purchase last week of nearly 10 percent of Daimler, the iconic German car manufacturer, by a much smaller Chinese car company, Geely, has also raised hackles, and questions about where the money, some $9 billion, really comes from.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a highly public discussion about Chinese influence in Germany,\u201d said Angela Stanzel, an Asia expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThere have been 10 times as many articles about Daimler than about Xi prolonging his rule.\u201d\n\nBerlin and Brussels have been shaken amid concerns that the real intent of Beijing\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d program is as much political as economic.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Europe will have to find a new China strategy, Ms. Stanzel added, one free of any illusions, \u201cbecause now we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll have Xi for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nMinxin Pei, a China scholar at Claremont McKenna College, said China\u2019s actions in Europe, much like in the South China Sea, \u201chave a probing quality, to test where the weaknesses are and where the pushback is.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTrade is only part of the overall security and geopolitical picture, he said, noting that Mr. Xi may be pushing too hard, too fast and that \u201cthis grandiose vision and ruthless actions are a bit premature.\u201d\n\nPolitically, the European Union has been troubled by convulsions in recent years as far-right parties have challenged the political establishment, while leaders in Poland and Hungary are challenging democratic norms. No European leader confused China with being an emerging democracy, yet analysts say many Western officials hoped and assumed the Chinese system would gradually become more like the democratic West.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who is still fooling themselves about convergence and liberalization \u2014 Xi put an end to that long ago,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Godement, a China scholar at Sciences Po in Paris. \u201cOfficial China has been increasingly frank about a systematic competition with democracies.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy now, European leaders are accustomed to dealing with Mr. Putin and Russia. Mr. Xi is very different, says Susan Shirk, an expert on Chinese politics who served in the Clinton administration.\n\n\u201cWhile Putin wants to be a spoiler, Xi wants to be respected as a global leader,\u201d said Ms. Shirk, who is now director of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t tried to subvert the structures that exist. But he has recently started to build his own.\u201d\n\nWith China returning to a more Leninist system, \u201cwe still don\u2019t know what that will mean for global governance,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially with Trump abdicating and trashing it.\u201d Still, she said, the world must engage with China to get Mr. Xi \u201cto fulfill his ambitions in the context of existing structures, and not overreact every time China takes the initiative.\u201d\n\nFor Europe, the prospect of China as a strategic competitor, as well as a political competitor, is a major challenge. \u201cEurope is so disaggregated and so lacking in fortitude that its countries don\u2019t think like big leaders,\u201d said Mr. Schell. \u201cAmerica always has, but with Trump we\u2019ve gone missing, and nature abhors a vacuum.\u201d\n\nNow Mr. Xi\u2019s open-ended tenure could give China a chance to plan long-term and carry out its policies systematically with \u201ca steady hand on the helm of a great power,\u201d Mr. Schell said. \u201cBut it is rooted in Leninism, autocracy and control, which will make it a tremendous challenge for liberal democracies rooted in a different value system, especially in a world reeling with no leadership.\u201d", "title": "Europe Once Saw Xi Jinping as a Hedge Against Trump.

Many automakers, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Volvo, are scrambling to produce lines of electric, hybrid and plug-in models.\n\nSome of this next wave will be on display at the Geneva auto show, which opens to the public on March 8.\n\nAmong the models will be the Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered crossover that is something of a cross between a hatchback and a coupe. Jaguar unveiled the production version of the I-Pace last week in Graz, Austria, in a bid to build buzz ahead of the Geneva show.\n\nThe car is packed with advanced safety and driver-assist technologies and features two electric motors \u2014 one to deliver power to the front wheels and one for the rear axle. Together they are rated at 394 horsepower. The car is expected to go 240 miles on a single battery charge, Jaguar said.\n\nThe small vehicle, with its short hood, is also a jarring break from the classic Jaguar look of a low, sleek roof line, long hood and rounded back. \u201cIt\u2019s quite distinctive,\u201d Ian Callum, Jaguar\u2019s design director, said at the Graz event. \u201cIt\u2019s quite different.

Details of the brand\u2019s first model, the Polestar 1, will be released at the Geneva show.\n\nAudi is expected to offer showgoers test drives of the E-tron all-electric S.U.V. that is due in showrooms this summer.\n\nThose are only some of the electric models European carmakers have in the works. Daimler AG, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, is spending $11 billion to develop at least 10 new electric models, due on the road by 2022. Mercedes is expected to market them under the brand name EQ. BMW plans to introduce at least 12 electric models between now and 2025, including a self-driving car it is calling iNext. Before then, BMW plans to introduce improved versions of its i3 electric car and i8, an exotic sports car featuring a hybrid powertrain.\n\nWhile the company will continue offering cars powered by gasoline engines for years to come, BMW expects electric cars and hybrids to make up 25 percent of its sales by 2025.\n\n\u201cAt the core of our product offensive is a clear focus on electrification,\u201d Bernhard Kuhnt, chief executive of BMW North America, said in January at the Detroit auto show.\n\nFor the last several years, Porsche has offered hybrid versions of its sports cars and high-powered S.U.V.s, but in 2019 it is expected to add the all-electric car Mission-e. To ease worries about recharging the car, Porsche has started to install charging stations at its 189 dealers and at other locations in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing here is creating a new world for Porsche,\u201d said Stefan Weckbach, Porsche\u2019s head of battery electric vehicles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCarmakers are developing all of these models despite the reluctance of many car buyers. In 2017, 104,487 battery-electric vehicles were sold in the United States, less than 1 percent of the total market; 89,992 plug-in hybrids were sold.\n\nAnd manufacturers that have jumped in early have had a bumpy ride. BMW\u2019s i3 has been a slow seller. Last year, BMW sold 6,276 i3s, fewer than the number of 3 Series sedans it typically sells in a single month.\n\nBut one word convinces them that they are on the right track: Tesla. It is constantly on the minds of European makers, who fret about losing to the upstart maker of battery-powered luxury cars. Tesla sold more than 100,000 vehicles worldwide last year, making it a serious player in the upper-priced levels of the auto industry.\n\nThe United States market is not the reason Europe\u2019s automakers are racing ahead with electric technology, however. The European Union and China are tightening regulations that force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions. For years, many European manufacturers were counting on selling a heavy mix of diesel models to help them meet the stricter targets.\n\nBut Volkswagen\u2019s diesel scandal \u2014 the company for years equipped diesel cars with software that cheated emissions testing \u2014 has chilled sales and the willingness of governments to accept more diesels. Several large German cities have been pushing to ban certain diesel vehicles from their streets, and a landmark court ruing last month cleared the way for them to do so.\n\nBritain and France have said they intend to ban new diesel and gas cars by 2040. China has moved the same way on tailpipe emissions and is shaping regulations to increase sales of electric cars to combat the poor air quality in many of its congested megacities.\n\nDieter Zetsche, the chairman of Daimler, said it was unclear when the market for electric vehicles would take off, but he was certain it would.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a bottle of ketchup,\u201d he said in a conference call in January. \u201cIt will come.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "But rather than make the job of finding and selecting a good, interesting bottle easier, this new diversity seems to have made it more difficult. So many choices can be confusing. Rather than take a chance on the unknown, many people choose instead to settle for familiar grapes, enticing brand names and well-known places.\n\nI have great sympathy with this point of view. We have only so much time and energy to absorb new ideas, especially in a world in which the unexpected arrives at frightening speed. Good food and good wine are not everybody\u2019s priority.\n\nEven if you would like it to be a more important part of your life, wine still comes in too many varieties and from too many places to comfortably and quickly absorb. So I would like to offer some practical recommendations to make it easier to drink better every day.\n\nThink of wine as food. If you care where your food comes from, how it\u2019s raised, grown or made and about its ethical and health consequences, apply that same logic to wine. You will end up with wine that is grown and made more conscientiously, with greater thought and care. Your wines will be less likely to be widgets and more likely to be expressions of culture.\n\nTopple wine off its pedestal. It\u2019s just a beverage, a pleasurable drink. It should be thought of as a staple of the table, like bread or olive oil. It\u2019s not just for special occasions, it\u2019s not only ceremonial, it does not require special tools to enjoy or unusual powers of taste or smell to know what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. We know oysters are wonderful, for example, but some people cannot abide them, and the same is true with certain wines. It\u2019s just personal taste, not a judgment of one\u2019s personality or character.\n\nThink of the occasion, rather than what\u2019s at the top of a universal scale of greatness. Many might agree that grand cru Burgundy or first-growth Bordeaux or older Barolos are among the very best wines in the world. But those might not be the best wines for a weeknight, when you are tired and want a quick bite and an easygoing bottle. On those occasions, the very best wine might be a good Finger Lakes riesling, or a basic Etna Rosso, not a profound Chambertin.\n\nFind a good wine shop. This greatly increases the odds of finding good bottles, because conscientious merchants have weeded out much of the dreck. Avoid supermarkets and other indifferent outlets. Though you may find the occasional decent bottle, they are full of processed wines and vacuous brands that are the equivalent of empty calories.", "title": "Everyday Wines: The Most Important Bottles You Will Drink", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Nye\u2019s terms are now used by political scientists and business-school professors alike. They are a product of the same line of thinking that appears in a common expression: \u201cPower comes in many forms.\u201d This is the same line of thinking too that so often has undergraduate students intoxicated by the ideas of the French theorist Michel Foucault, who saw power as ephemeral, taking countless shapes, everywhere and nowhere: It was \u201cat once visible and invisible, present and hidden, ubiquitous,\u201d like a light emanating from a thousand pinprick sources. Foucault\u2019s idea of resistance was to spend your time mapping out all those pinprick sources of power, like the stars: If you wanted to speak truth to power, he suggested, you first had to divine your position inside a whole constellation of influence. This sort of thinking can make our view of power far more nuanced and complex, but it can also make it quite confusing. The dispiriting message some took away from Foucault was that things were, ultimately, a bit hopeless: Power was far too chaotic to help anyone figure out the right thing to do.\n\nThis dizzying and disordered vision of power isn\u2019t reserved for high-stakes international affairs or abstract philosophical contexts. It is a feature of almost every social or cultural battle we have. The question of power has buzzed its way, for instance, through a huge share of recent conversations about sexual harassment. In many #MeToo stories, the power a harasser has over his target is clear and hard as a diamond: He is the boss; he can hire or fire, promote or demote. But in so many others, a softer pull is involved \u2014 a matter of age, or ambient status, or standing within an industry. Last month, when several women told NPR about what they saw as exploitative relationships with the writer Sherman Alexie, one described her account as one \u201cabout power, and abuse of power.\u201d This wasn\u2019t because Alexie necessarily held any formal or official power over the other writers he encountered; the power his accuser was referring to derived from his literary success, influence and social standing.\n\nPeople hold countless opinions about accusations like this, and plenty of them have already been aired at great and contentious length. But even within those arguments, the question of who holds \u201cpower\u201d is a constant, each side insisting it lies with the other. In a Slate interview with Isaac Chotiner, the writer Katie Roiphe, who has expressed skepticism about what she sees as the rush to judgment of #MeToo, described being pilloried in response. When Chotiner tried to suggest that being vilified by Twitter users might not be so consequential, the two reached an impasse. \u201cYou are saying they don\u2019t have power, but I think they do have power,\u201d Roiphe said. She saw a group of social media critics and writers as having the power to set the terms of the conversation; they undoubtedly felt the same way about her, a tenured professor scolding them from the pages of a prestigious publication like Harper\u2019s.\n\nIt was this point, Chotiner said, that was \u201cthe crux of our disagreement.\u201d Which is in its own way a summation of where we all are: Everyone, from the online critic to the president, seems always to believe that power lies elsewhere, in some branch of the constellation beyond their reach. Try to map out almost any part of this cultural moment, and you will find something similarly chaotic \u2014 all the players passing by one another, each convinced they are doing the right thing, and very few convinced that they, in the face of powerful opposition, have enough influence to affect much at all.", "title": "Everyone Wants \u2018Power.\u2019 Everyone Thinks Someone Else Has It.", "authors": []}

Why he would be targeted years later is unclear, but political and security analysts have said that the attack was a warning to those who would cross Mr. Putin that, even in exile, they are never beyond the Kremlin\u2019s reach.\n\nRelations between Russia and the West were already rocky over Moscow\u2019s roles in the wars in Syria and Ukraine, Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, its meddling in elections in the United States and elsewhere, the assassination of Kremlin foes in Russia and abroad, cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against other countries and what Western officials have described as a broad, largely covert effort to destabilize and discredit liberal democracies.\n\nMr. Putin last year ordered the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff by 755 employees, mostly Russians working as guards, drivers and in other support jobs, after Congress ordered sweeping sanctions against Russia to punish it for meddling in the American election.\n\nRussia\u2019s decision on Thursday to evict 60 American diplomats will further strain the American Embassy\u2019s already reduced operations, making it even more difficult to process visas and watch over economic relations and other matters on which Russia and Washington still sometimes collaborate. The Russian retaliation is also likely to hurt Western espionage capabilities in Russia. The United States and its allies also use diplomatic covers for their spies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile relations were already strained, the nerve agent attack in Salisbury has frayed tempers so severely that mistrust between Moscow and the West has now spiked to a level not seen since a Soviet warplane shot down a Korean Airlines passenger jet from New York to Seoul in 1983. Soviet officials initially denied any role in downing the plane.\n\nIn often angry comments at a press briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry\u2019s spokesman, Maria Zakharova, said Britain had no evidence to support its accusations against Russia and compared them to a Nazi campaign to blame the Soviet Union for a 1933 fire at the German Parliament. The fire, exploited by the Nazis to rally support, played a crucial role in Hitler\u2019s rise to power.\n\nMs. Zakharova said Washington and Britain had dragooned unwilling countries into their \u201canti-Russian campaign\u201d through pressure and favors, which she did not detail.\n\nHer remarks seemed aimed at containing the diplomatic crisis to Russia\u2019s relations with London and Washington, the pillars of a trans-Atlantic alliance that Moscow, since the Cold War era, has accused of harboring a particular animus against Russia.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s actions also signaled to the Russian public that their country was not at odds with the whole of Europe, which would be an alarming prospect for millions of Russians who travel each year to countries like France and Germany.\n\nThe closing of the consulate in St. Petersburg will please Russians and others who responded to an opinion poll conducted by the Russian Embassy in Washington. The embassy invited people following its Twitter account to vote for which American consulate Moscow should close in response to the closing of Russia\u2019s Seattle consulate, and St. Petersburg was by far the favorite choice.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May of Britain and her government contend that Mr. Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with one of an extremely powerful class of nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the 1970s and \u201980s. The British say they have solid evidence that Russia was probably behind the attack, and that Mr. Putin himself probably approved it.\n\nThe Skripals were found unconscious in a busy shopping area in Salisbury, where Mr. Skripal lives. He remains hospitalized in critical condition, but his daughter is showing improvement, British officials announced on Thursday. British officials say that hundreds of people could have been exposed to the nerve agent used against the Skripals.\n\nSergey V. Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, said Thursday that Russia had called for a meeting next Tuesday of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to \u201cestablish the truth\u201d with respect to what Russia refers to as \u201cthe so-called Skripal case.\u201d", "title": "Expelling Diplomats, a Furious Kremlin Escalates a Crisis", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"]}

Then, have them discuss what they learned from the various formats, and what they thought was missing. What were the strengths and weaknesses of telling the story in each medium? Which do they think they prefer? Why?\n\nFor homework, they might then watch, read or listen to the two formats they missed, and write a reflection about the differences and their own reactions to them. Which format did they learn from most easily? Why do they think that is? What does that tell them about how they might prefer to gain access to news reporting in the future?\n\n(Note: Exercises like this were part of The Learning Network\u2019s recent News Diet Challenge, in which students were invited to experiment until they found the right personal mix of sources, platforms and formats to best consume the onslaught of information we are all confronted with daily.)\n\n2. Investigate sound elements:\n\nPhoto\n\nEmbellished by an elegantly produced mix of intricate musical interludes, soundbites and archival newsreel, the conversations on \u201cThe Daily\u201d give listeners an inside glimpse into the firsthand experience of reporting major news developments and watching them unfold.\n\nA Times Insider piece, \u201cHow \u2018The Daily\u2019 Sounds Out the News,\u201d explores what makes the audio unique:\n\nWith episodes five days a week, the one-year-old podcast uses sound in a way that often differs from traditional news podcasts and broadcasts. \u201cIt\u2019s more like an audio documentary,\u201d said Andy Mills, a reporter and one of the show\u2019s founding producers. While traditional audio reports can rely on journalists outlining the facts of the news, \u201cThe Daily\u201d asks reporters to describe the scene in which the news occurred, incorporating scene-setting audio and letting sources speak uninterrupted. Episodes are about 20 minutes long, and though there is no specific formula, there is a guiding principle: \u201cUse a lot of tape,\u201d Mr. Mills said. \u201cAnd by that we mean the sound of things happening in the world and the sound of people speaking unprompted, unscripted.\u201d To get that material, the team helps Times journalists to think with their ears. \u201cWe started to work with reporters to just vacuum up all of the sounds around them as they\u2019re reporting something, not just the quotable moments from when you\u2019re with the senator, but when you\u2019re getting out of the car, when you\u2019re walking up to the house,\u201d said Annie Brown, another reporter and \u201cDaily\u201d producer.\n\nAsk students to identify sound elements in the episode they listen to that help make the story more engaging and memorable. How many different types did they note? Which elements were particularly effective? (For example, here is an exploration of the role the theme song plays.)\n\nThe article also points out the role sound plays in \u201ccreating a world\u201d:\n\nThe show emphasizes emotion and the lives of the people connected to its stories by including clips that might not otherwise make it past the editing phase. Listeners have written in to talk about episodes that resonate with them, like one about assisted suicide, which included the sounds of family members celebrating the life of John Shields, a man suffering from an incurable disease, at a wake he threw for himself. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a world in which the story lives, rather than just using audio as ornamentation,\u201d Ms. Brown said.\n\nHow do the episodes your students listen to \u201ccreate a world\u201d? Invite students to identify print pieces in The New York Times that might benefit from sounds from the field as in the story mentioned above. What parts of the article suggest rich worlds of sound to them? If they were the producer turning the print piece into a podcast, what sounds would they suggest journalists capture? Why?\n\nFinally, students might listen to The Year in Sound: An Audio Time Capsule of 2017 to learn \u201cwhat a breathtaking year sounded like, from start to finish.\u201d Before they start, however, you might ask them to list predictions: What sounds captured the news of 2017? Then, as they listen, they can see how many are captured in this piece.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n3. Hone interviewing skills:\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Barbaro interviews his colleagues in a relaxed, conversational format, encouraging them to speak candidly in down-to-earth exchanges that highlight their personalities and those of the people they cover \u2014 an intimate style rarely conveyed in print reporting.\n\n\u201cOften times, [the reporters] have something figured out,\u201d he explained in an October 2017 interview with Recode Media. \u201cBut sometimes they\u2019re in the middle of figuring it out.\u2026 Journalists can say what they know and say what they don\u2019t know, and talk very openly about their process. It creates a lot of transparency that people really crave right now.\u201d For example, days after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017, Mr. Barbaro talked to a local City Council member and a Times reporter as the city was at a turning point. How does he help his audience understand the issues at stake?\n\nAsk students to observe the way Michael Barbaro interviews reporters and other people on his show. They might then discuss:\n\n\u2022 How do the interviews help listeners to become more actively invested in the story?\n\n\u2022 How would you compare his style to the style of other radio or television hosts who interview?\n\n\u2022 What aspects of Mr. Barbaro\u2019s interviewing style seem most effective? Least?\n\n\u2022 What can you learn from him about asking open-ended questions that encourage people to think aloud?\n\nThen ask students to identify an expert of any kind to interview on the topic of their choice, and have them compose their questions in advance. Then, have them conduct an interview and record it. Together as a class, have them then discuss what the experience was like. Did they get the information they were looking for? What would they do differently? Now that they\u2019ve tried their own hands at interviewing, will they hear podcast and radio interviews differently? How?\n\n4. Localize stories from \u201cThe Daily\u201d for your own community:\n\nPhoto\n\nWhich topics covered on \u201cThe Daily\u201d especially intrigue your students? Which connect best to their own lives or communities? What questions would they ask if they were conducting their own interviews on the topic with people they know?\n\nInvite them to brainstorm a list, then work in groups to choose a national or international story like \u201cA Ticking Clock for DACA\u201d or \u201cGuns and the Midterm Elections\u201d and brainstorm all the ways it affects the people they know. Whether for a school radio or TV station or for a school or community print paper, what piece could they write and produce about the issue\u2019s local resonance? Who are the people they would interview? What would they ask? How could they frame it? Where would they publish it, and for whom?\n\n5. Bring it all together: Use \u201cThe Daily\u201d as a mentor text for your own podcast:\n\nThis spring, The Learning Network will host its first-ever podcast challenge for teenagers. Though many details are yet to be announced, here is a brief overview. Visit our Contest Calendar on April 26 for more details and a related lesson plan.\n\nPodcast Challenge | April 26-May 25, 2018 Create a podcast of five minutes or less that is inspired by one of our thousand-plus Student Opinion questions. That question, however, should just be your starting point. As long as you address it somehow, your podcast can be in whatever format you think works best. For example, it can be structured as a one-person narration, a conversation between two or more people, or a series of interviews. It can be for educational or entertainment purposes, and can showcase reporting, a personal story or an opinion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConsider using \u201cThe Daily\u201d \u2014 as well as other Times podcasts like \u201cModern Love\u201d or \u201cStill Processing\u201d \u2014 as mentor texts for this challenge. To prepare, students might ask themselves questions like:\n\n\u2022 How does the structure of each episode hook the listener? How does it tell a story, with a beginning, middle and end? How does it keep you listening?\n\n\u2022 How does the host propel the narrative? What makes that person and his or her style appealing? Effective?\n\n\u2022 What elements of sound are used? Why? How? What makes them effective?\n\n_________\n\nSeven More Episodes Recommended for the Classroom\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Vandal and the Mosque: A New Chapter of Forgiveness in Arkansas: A powerful and sensitively told story about bigotry, mistakes and redemption\n\nBlue Collar Factory Jobs in the Rearview Mirror: A poignant episode on the very human side of a major political issue\n\nU.S. Ends Protections for Salvadorans: A good example of how the show takes deep dives into an issue, connects the historical dots and explains how we got to where we are now\n\nRobert Mugabe\u2019s Rise and Fall: A good example of how \u201cThe Daily\u201d can deepen understanding of a well-recapped major international story\n\nThe ACLU and the Alt-Right: A fascinating story about the complexities of the First Amendment\n\nMental Health and Mass Shootings: How can the mental health system stop gun violence when mental illness is so rarely the cause of it?

It allegorically pits the enlightened orchestra leader against a Machiavellian \u201cOverseer;\u201d the two play cards in an obscure battle for black humanity.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe crux of Sun Ra\u2019s philosophy emerges in a scene in which he and his emissaries, dressed in garb that evokes both sci-fi and ancient Egypt, confront a group of skeptical teenagers in an Oakland youth center. \u201cI do not come to you as a reality, but as a myth,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what black people are. Myths. I am a dream that the black man dreams long ago. I\u2019m actually a present sent to you by your ancestors.\u201d\n\nThe use of the present tense in describing a black man who \u201cdreams long ago\u201d is no accident. In Afrofuturism, time is frequently looped. The Art Ensemble of Chicago, a musical collective affiliated with the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (a group that tended to distance itself from Sun Ra because of differences in praxis) made its motto \u201cGreat Black Music: Ancient to Future.\u201d In the Wakanda of \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d incredible medical and construction technology exists hand in hand with ancient practices like the \u201cChallenge Day\u201d battle ritual shown early in the movie.\n\nSimilarly, although it deals exclusively with a circa-13th-century African myth, \u201cYeelen,\u201d or \u201cBrightness,\u201d a 1987 film directed by Souleymane Ciss\u00e9, can be considered in the context of Afrofuturism, particularly because Mr. Ciss\u00e9, a director from Mali, approaches it like a narrative documentary. The movie, available to stream on Kanopy, follows a young mage on a journey to confront his power-mad father. A man-hyena speaking from a treetop is treated matter-of-factly, rather than as a mystical or mystifying occurrence. Mr. Ciss\u00e9\u2019s languid but mindful pacing and his indifference to Western film language conventions on space and time transitions also contribute to the movie\u2019s distinction.\n\nMore radical still is \u201cTouki Bouki,\u201d a 1973 road movie of sorts directed by the Senegalese filmmaker Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty, which is available for streaming on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. Mory (Magaye Niang), a cattle herder (trigger warning: the movie opens with some very graphic slaughterhouse footage) rides a motorbike with a bull\u2019s horns attached to its handlebars; he\u2019s aiming to leave Africa for France and enlists the lithe, enigmatic Anta (Mareme Niang) to join him.\n\nPhoto\n\nEgged on by the Josephine Baker song \u201cParis Paris,\u201d they go in search of money and find mostly trouble. In one scene, in a tricked-out car, Mory is driven down a deserted road, declaiming his greatness; Mamb\u00e9ty cuts to scenes of crowds on a different road, seemingly cheering him on; these two lines of footage eventually converge. The movie is replete with such purposeful disjointedness, the better to articulate space-time dissociations. (And the movie\u2019s influence continues to resonate. Earlier this week, to announce their joint tour, Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 posted on Instagram an image paying direct homage to \u201cTouki Bouki\u201d: a shot of the couple seated on a motorcycle with a horned animal skull mounted on its handlebars.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYeelen\u201d and \u201cTouki Bouki\u201d are both arguably art films, but Afrofuturism doesn\u2019t adhere to genre hierarchies. If it did, you wouldn\u2019t be able to discuss it in the context of a superhero movie based on a comic book. Afrofuturism is equally at home with the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Parliament-Funkadelic.\n\nIn his essay, Mr. Dery also examined the works of African-American science-fiction writers like Samuel R. Delany. On Fandor, there\u2019s a good documentary film about him, \u201cThe Polymath: Or the Life and Opinions of Samuel R. Delany, Gentleman.\u201d Mr. Delany has a fascinating life story and a truly radical philosophy of life that reverberates through his books. Being an African-American gay man, he says, imposes on him a responsibility to live his life \u201cas if the world worked differently.\u201d Subsequently, he notes, to read his works \u201cyou have to inhabit the world I live in.\u201d\n\nThe film, directed by Fred Barney Taylor, presents central points in Mr. Delany\u2019s life out of linear order, as if the movie itself were unstuck in time. One of Mr. Delany\u2019s key works, his 1975 novel, \u201cDhalgren,\u201d is an after-the-end-of-the-world epic that\u2019s also reflective of the sexually exuberant pre-AIDS New York underground Mr. Delany inhabited at the time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a philosophical, confessional and fictional genius,\u201d the author Jonathan Lethem says of Mr. Delany in the movie. One tidbit in the documentary brings us back around to the medium in which \u201cBlack Panther\u201d originated: In the 1970s Mr. Delany was the writer for two issues of the DC comic \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d", "title": "Exploring Afrofuturism in Film, Where Sci-Fi and Mythology Blur", "authors": ["Glenn Kenny"]}

Exxon and Rosneft, which is only half-owned by the Russian government but state-run, agreed to invest $3.2 billion to search for oil in deepwater fields in the Arctic and elsewhere.\n\nAfter Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the United States and its European allies applied several sanctions on Moscow, eventually freezing Exxon\u2019s investments.\n\nIn a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Exxon said that it had decided late last year to abandon the ventures this year and would take an after-tax loss of $200 million. \u201cThe corporation and its affiliates continue to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations,\u201d the company said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith its investments already frozen by the sanctions, it was not clear what current activities, if any, Exxon\u2019s move affected. The company has operations in Russia that are allowed under the sanctions, including an oil and gas production venture on Sakhalin, an island in the Siberian Arctic, and has had a business presence there for roughly a quarter-century.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn Exxon spokesman said the company would have no comment beyond the filing.\n\nIn any case, the move sends a signal, said David Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy diplomat early in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that the company realizes that U.S.-Russia relations and in particular sanctions are not likely to change soon,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are an enormous source of friction with the government, and it is better business for them to steer their business away from sanctioned activities.\u201d", "title": "Exxon Mobil Scraps a Russian Deal, Stymied by Sanctions", "authors": ["Clifford Krauss"]}

On Thursday, they said they had interviewed Mr. Vance, who was injured in the crash, though not seriously.\n\nWhile that investigation goes on, the F.A.A. is reconsidering what its rules should be for the protection of passengers on doors-off flights, or whether they should be sanctioned at all. In the meantime, the administration has halted the flights altogether, a potentially hard blow to operators like FlyNYON, which had drawn a following by arranging open-door flights over Manhattan and around the Statue of Liberty. FlyNYON also operates doors-off flights in Las Vegas, South Florida and California.\n\nThe F.A.A. grounding may not apply to all doors-off helicopter flights.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly said there was \u201cno collusion,\u201d and his aides initially flatly denied any contacts between the campaign and Russia.\n\nBut journalists and investigators have uncovered repeated examples of those contacts, including one in which a Kremlin-connected lawyer met with top campaign officials at Trump Tower after promising politically damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Facebook executives rejected that proposal and instead reassigned Mr. Stamos\u2019s team, splitting the security team between its product team, overseen by Guy Rosen, and infrastructure team, overseen by Pedro Canahuati, according to current and former employees.\n\nApart from managing a small team of engineers in San Francisco, Mr. Stamos has largely been left as Facebook\u2019s security communicator. Last month, he appeared as Facebook\u2019s representative at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nOver the weekend, after news broke that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data on as many as 50 million Facebook users, Facebook\u2019s communications team encouraged Mr. Stamos to tweet in defense of the company, but only after it asked to approve Mr. Stamos\u2019s tweets, according to two people briefed on the incident.\n\nAfter the tweets set off a furious response, Mr. Stamos deleted them.\n\nRoger B. McNamee, an early investor in Facebook who said he considered himself a mentor to Mr. Zuckerberg, said the company was failing to face the fundamental problems posed by the Russian meddling and other manipulation of content.\n\n\u201cI told them, \u2018Your business is based on trust, and you\u2019re losing trust,\u2019\u201d said Mr. McNamee, a founder of the Center for Humane Technology. \u201cThey were treating it as a P.R. problem, when it\u2019s a business problem.

Mr. Zuckerberg was expected to address employees on Friday, when the company holds an all-hands meeting.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company has faced internal dissent over its broader role in spreading disinformation during the presidential campaign and its response to it. The tensions have prompted the planned departure of Alex Stamos, Facebook\u2019s chief security officer, who plans to leave in August.\n\nThe pressure on Facebook has been building for years.\n\nIt started in the European Union, where regulators have taken an aggressive attitude toward Facebook and other American technology giants for their sway over the region\u2019s 500 million people. The company has been the subject of several privacy investigations and charges by European regulators. Europe has approved a new privacy law, which takes effect in May, that will give users of Facebook, Google and other internet services more control over how their data is collected and what Silicon Valley companies know about them.\n\nAfter the 2016 presidential campaign, lawmakers at home joined the chorus of critics, citing the company\u2019s role in Russia\u2019s disinformation efforts. The social network was one of the top tools used by Russians to spread false news, and the company\u2019s executives have struggled to explain what happened and how they would prevent foreign interference in the future.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica revelations have forced Facebook to scramble to assuage fresh concerns by regulators and lawmakers. The company is sending its representatives to Capitol Hill and arranging conversations with state attorneys general to try to answer questions about how the firm collected the information of Facebook users.\n\nThe social networking giant is also facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency, according to a person with knowledge of the inquiry.\n\nThe F.T.C. investigation is connected to a settlement the agency reached with Facebook in 2011 after finding that the company had told users that third-party apps on the social media site, like games, would not be allowed to access their data. But the apps, the agency found, were able to obtain almost all personal information about a user.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe current investigation has parallels. The information on the 50 million users was harvested in 2014 by an outside researcher, Aleksandr Kogan. Mr. Kogan, a professor at Cambridge University, paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which collected private information from their profiles and from those of their friends. Facebook allowed that sort of data collection at the time.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen, Mr. Kogan gave the information to Cambridge Analytica, a firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House political adviser, and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor. Passing the information to a third party violated Facebook\u2019s policies, the company said last week.\n\n\u201cThere are all sorts of obligations under the consent decree that may not have been honored here,\u201d said David Vladeck, a former director of consumer protection at the F.T.C.\n\nThe company could face fines of $40,000 a day per violation if the agency finds that Facebook broke the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating,\u201d an F.T.C. spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously.\u201d\n\nFacebook said it expected to receive questions from the F.T.C. related to potential violations of the 2011 consent decree. \u201cWe remain strongly committed to protecting people\u2019s information,\u201d Facebook\u2019s deputy chief privacy officer, Rob Sherman, said in a statement. \u201cWe appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the F.T.C. may have.\u201d\n\nThe F.T.C. inquiry is just one piece of the regulatory backlash. On Tuesday, the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced that he was joining the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, in an investigation into whether Facebook had failed to protect the privacy of users in those states. New Jersey\u2019s attorney general announced a similar investigation.\n\nMr. Schneiderman and Ms. Healey sent a letter to Facebook on Tuesday that demanded records of the communications between the company and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Grassley, Republican of Iowa, to hold a hearing. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, organized by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to questions about how the data had been collected and if users were able to control the misuse of data by third parties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Mr. Zuckerberg and the other C.E.O.s to testify before Congress,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said on Tuesday. \u201cThe American people deserve answers about social media manipulation in the 2016 election.\u201d\n\nFacebook staff members were scheduled to brief the office of Mr. Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence committee, and the offices of members of other committees, including Commerce, this week.\n\n\u201cThe possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third-party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,\u201d Mr. Thune said in his letter.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a committee within the British Parliament sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg that asked him to appear before the panel to answer questions on the company\u2019s connection to Cambridge Analytica. The president of the European Parliament also requested an appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg.\n\n\u201cThe committee has repeatedly asked Facebook about how companies acquire and hold on to user data from their site, and in particular about whether data had been taken without their consent,\u201d wrote Damian Collins, chairman of the British committee. \u201cYour officials\u2019 answers have consistently understated this risk, and have been misleading to the committee.\u201d", "title": "Facebook Faces Growing Pressure Over Data and Privacy Inquiries", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang"]}

And investor retribution has been swift.\n\nSince hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.)\n\nWith Facebook\u2019s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks \u2014 Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google \u2014 and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak.\n\nFalling Star Since 2014, Facebook has been one of the hottest stocks in the market, but its recent troubles have caused it to lose about a quarter of its value. +400 % Facebook stock price +300 +200 +100 I.P.O.

Dow Jones Indices, who oversees statistical analysis for the S.&P. 500. \u201cThe FANG leadership is faltering. Social media hasn\u2019t faced much regulation, and now there\u2019s a cloud hanging over those companies.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a \u201csell\u201d recommendation for Facebook last fall.\n\nSo did Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group who covers media and internet companies. Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb, he downgraded Facebook to \u201csell\u201d last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers \u201csystemic management issues.\u201d\n\nNot only was it a lonely position, but \u201cthe stock went up and up,\u201d Mr. Wieser told me this week. \u201cBut I thought the market was wrong, full stop.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.\u201d\n\nThen, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was \u201cthe most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

This is digital advertising\u2019s original sin, and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning that even now I don\u2019t think most investors fully appreciate.\u201d\n\nThe other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo \u2014 whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey \u2014 wasn\u2019t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera\u2019s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia\u2019s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.)\n\nWells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell.\n\nWhen I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. \u201cAiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not meant to supplant human judgments.\u201d\n\nHe hasn\u2019t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. \u201cThe conventional wisdom was that people don\u2019t care that much about how their data is used,\u201d Mr. Sena said. \u201cThey like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cFacebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it\u2019s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, Facebook\u2019s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out.\n\nWhen he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser\u2019s price target was $152. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be trigger happy on this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.\u201d\n\nAiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn\u2019t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d recommendation, up from 39 a month ago.\n\nMr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn\u2019t changed his price target of $230. \u201cPeople are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,\u201d he said.\n\nIts price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it \u201cthe cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.\u201d", "title": "Facebook Falls From Grace, and Investors\u2019 Stock Holdings Tumble Too", "authors": ["James B.

They had to work with fliers and obscure radio ads, since reputable media outlets, unlike Facebook, tended to push back against racially inflammatory, untrue political advertising. Fliers and radio ads leave a public residue, too.\n\nThe election of 2016, the first after Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, was notable for a seven-percentage-point decrease in African-American turnout, from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. This was the first decline in 20 years in a presidential election and the largest ever recorded.

Days after the election, Facebook\u2019s founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said it was a \u201cpretty crazy idea\u201d to suggest that fake news had influenced the outcome. It took months for him to admit that he was wrong to so cavalierly dismiss the importance of hoaxes spread on Facebook, many of them by people working on behalf of the Russian government.\n\nIt is hard to know just how useful the profile information from Facebook was in Cambridge\u2019s effort to help elect Mr. Trump. The company has offered contradictory statements about its use of what\u2019s called \u201cpsychographic data\u201d for the campaign, which included targeting political messages to voters receptive to them. The trove contained enough details about roughly 30 million people, including where they lived, that the company was able to build detailed profiles by linking the data to other sources of information.\n\nOfficials in the United States and the European Union are investigating Cambridge Analytica, and others say they might, including members of Congress and the attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey. In Britain, regulators and lawmakers are looking at whether the company tried to illegally influence the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum of 2016.\n\nMore investigations may be on the way. On Monday, Channel 4 News in Britain released hidden-camera tapes in which Cambridge executives said that their company used bribes and prostitutes to entrap politicians. The company denies engaging in corruption and extortion. Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who is a big supporter of Mr. Trump, owns a controlling stake in Cambridge, and Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for the president, is a former company board member.\n\nLawmakers and regulators also ought to investigate Facebook\u2019s response. For starters, they need to take a close look at whether the company is in violation of a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission, which had accused it of deceiving users by telling them their information would be kept private and then allowing it to be shared and made public. They also need to force the company to quickly identify and alert the tens of millions of people whose information might have been disclosed to Cambridge.\n\nIn the longer term, Congress clearly needs to strengthen privacy laws to give people more control over private information and prevent businesses and political campaigns from harvesting personal data under false pretenses. President Barack Obama proposed a privacy bill of rights in 2012, but the idea died in Congress after technology and advertising companies claimed it would be an unfair burden.", "title": "Opinion | Facebook Leaves Its Users\u2019 Privacy Vulnerable", "authors": []}

Each employee has an annual \u201cFaceversary\u201d on his or her hire date, a ritual that within the company is seen as deeply meaningful and is usually accompanied by balloons.\n\n\u201cUntil very recently, it was taken as a given that tech equaled progress and tech equaled good and tech equaled economic strength,\u201d said Leslie Berlin, the author of Troublemakers, a history of Silicon Valley.\n\nShe said the defections she sees now are historically unique.\n\n\u201cThe Valley was founded on this notion of, \u2018We\u2019re very open,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Berlin said. \u201cBut the secrecy has always been there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been pretty much a straight line since the start of the Cold War until now,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something new.\u201d\n\nEmployees may feel the freedom to rebel because of Silicon Valley\u2019s success, both technologically and financially. The technology platforms have become more powerful \u2014 and the fortunes much bigger \u2014 than the programmers ever expected. So while the industry\u2019s power disturbs them, the wealth allows them to speak out without fear of retribution, Ms. Berlin said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the shadow of the success,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand them together.\u201d\n\nCertainly, not everyone is critical. Mr. Acton\u2019s WhatsApp co-founder, Jan Koum, is on the Facebook board of directors and remains deeply active on the platform, regularly posting pro-President Trump and anti-immigration news.\n\nAnd when former leaders have spoken out with criticisms of Facebook, the company has often responded aggressively.\n\n\u201cThey do yell,\u201d said Roger McNamee, an early investor and adviser to Mark Zuckerberg, referring to Facebook leadership\u2019s approach.\n\nBut the culture of fear that the company has fostered among employees is not working anymore, he said.\n\n\"Facebook is at one of those moments where everybody who works there has to ask which side of history do you want to be on,\u201d Mr. McNamee said. \u201cThe facts are not only indisputable, they\u2019re not even complete.

The suit comes as the social network is scrambling to deal with an international crisis over the misuse of data belonging to 50 million of its users.\n\nFacebook, an advertising behemoth with more than two billion users a month, provides advertisers with the ability to customize their messages and target who sees them by selecting from preset lists of demographics, likes, behaviors and interests, while excluding others.\n\nPet food companies, for example, could send their ads specifically to people who had indicated an interest in dogs, while excluding cat and bird fanciers.\n\nWhen it comes to housing and employment ads, Facebook, in response to criticism over the last 17 months, has repeatedly promised that it would crack down on advertisers who use those same tools to show housing or employment ads to whites only.", "title": "Facebook Vowed to End Discriminatory Housing Ads.

{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?\n\nThe data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users\u2019 identities, friend networks and \u201clikes.\u201d The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.\n\nResearchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.\n\nThe technique had been developed at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.\n\nDr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.\n\nFacebook said no passwords or \u201csensitive pieces of information\u201d had been taken, though information about a user\u2019s location was available to Cambridge.\n\nSo was Facebook hacked?\n\nFacebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes \u2014 and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred \u201cto any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.\u201d It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.\n\nDr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook\u2019s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.\n\nBut the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nWhat is Facebook doing in response?\n\nThe company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan\u2019s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan\u2019s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.\n\nFacebook also said: \u201cSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\u201d\n\nIn a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm \u201cto determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.\u201d It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie \u201cthus far has declined.\u201d\n\nWhat are others saying?\n\nFacebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u25a0The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement to keep users\u2019 data private.\n\n\u25a0 In Congress, Senators Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, have asked to hold a hearing on Facebook\u2019s links to Cambridge Analytica. Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee, led by John Thune of South Dakota, wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected.\n\n\u25a0 A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebook\u2019s ties to Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\u25a0 The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. \u201cMassachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,\u201d she said in a Twitter post.

After more than a year of extraordinary calm in the stock markets, equities have been on a roller coaster since February. The volatility has been driven in large part by fears that inflation might bubble up and prompt the central banks to hike interest rates faster than expected.\n\nSince the start of the current bull market in March 2009, technology companies have delivered total returns \u2014 including the appreciation in their share prices and the dividends they have paid \u2014 of more than 570 percent, far outpacing the broader market.

{"date": "2018-03-18 00:00:00", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facebook on Sunday faced a backlash about how it protects user data, as American and British lawmakers demanded that it explain how a political data firm with links to President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign was able to harvest private information from more than 50 million Facebook profiles without the social network\u2019s alerting users.\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, went so far as to press for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data \u201cto target political advertising and manipulate voters.\u201d\n\nThe calls for greater scrutiny followed reports on Saturday in The New York Times and The Observer of London that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, had used the Facebook data to develop methods that it claimed could identify the personalities of individual American voters and influence their behavior. The firm\u2019s so-called psychographic modeling underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned the effectiveness of its techniques.\n\nBut Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested. The lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Role in Data Misuse Sets Off Storms on Two Continents", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "This wasn\u2019t informed consent. This was the exploitation of user data and user trust.\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the sake of argument, that you had explicitly consented to turn over your Facebook data to another company. Do you keep up with the latest academic research on computational inference? Did you know that algorithms now do a pretty good job of inferring a person\u2019s personality traits, sexual orientation, political views, mental health status, substance abuse history and more just from his or her Facebook \u201clikes\u201d \u2014 and that there are new applications of this data being discovered every day?\n\nGiven this confusing and rapidly changing state of affairs about what the data may reveal and how it may be used, consent to ongoing and extensive data collection can be neither fully informed nor truly consensual \u2014 especially since it is practically irrevocable.\n\nWhat did Cambridge Analytica do with all the data? With whom else might it have shared it? In 2015, Facebook sent a stern letter to Cambridge Analytica asking that the data be deleted. Cambridge Analytica employees have said that the company merely checked a box indicating that the data was deleted, at which point Facebook decided not to inform the 50 million users who were affected by the breach, nor to make the issue public, nor to sanction Cambridge Analytica at the time.\n\nThe New York Times and The Observer of London are reporting that the data was not deleted. And Cambridge Analytica employees are claiming that the data formed the backbone of the company\u2019s operations in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIf Facebook failed to understand that this data could be used in dangerous ways, that it shouldn\u2019t have let anyone harvest data in this manner and that a third-party ticking a box on a form wouldn\u2019t free the company from responsibility, it had no business collecting anyone\u2019s data in the first place. But the vast infrastructure Facebook has built to obtain data, and its consequent half-a-trillion-dollar market capitalization, suggest that the company knows all too well the value of this kind of vast data surveillance.\n\nShould we all just leave Facebook? That may sound attractive but it is not a viable solution. In many countries, Facebook and its products simply are the internet. Some employers and landlords demand to see Facebook profiles, and there are increasingly vast swaths of public and civic life \u2014 from volunteer groups to political campaigns to marches and protests \u2014 that are accessible or organized only via Facebook.\n\nThe problem here goes beyond Cambridge Analytica and what it may have done. What other apps were allowed to siphon data from millions of Facebook users? What if one day Facebook decides to suspend from its site a presidential campaign or a politician whose platform calls for things like increased data privacy for individuals and limits on data retention and use? What if it decides to share data with one political campaign and not another? What if it gives better ad rates to candidates who align with its own interests?\n\nA business model based on vast data surveillance and charging clients to opaquely target users based on this kind of extensive profiling will inevitably be misused. The real problem is that billions of dollars are being made at the expense of the health of our public sphere and our politics, and crucial decisions are being made unilaterally, and without recourse or accountability.", "title": "Opinion | Facebook\u2019s Surveillance Machine", "authors": []}

Cline, a professor of classics and anthropology at George Washington University, who worked at the Megiddo site for two decades but was not involved in this latest study. Just as drought was among the \u201cstressors\u201d leading to famine and war during the Bronze Age, Dr. Cline said, today\u2019s droughts could amplify existing problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm: You\u2019ve got not just drought and famine but there\u2019s also earthquakes, there\u2019s also invaders, and that\u2019s what causes collapse,\u201d he said, referring to a confluence of events which some think led to the end of the Bronze Age, which included powerful earthquakes in the region, and the invasion of the Levant by a group known as the Sea Peoples. The ancient world, like our own, was interdependent and suffered a \u201cdomino\u201d fall, Dr. Cline added.\n\nGavin A. Schmidt, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, said that in some ways, modern civilization had not advanced much in its coping mechanisms for climate crises. \u201cIf the sea is rising, you either get out of the way, or you get flooded; if there\u2019s a drought, you either plant more drought-resistant crops, or you die,\u201d he said. But, he added, modern humans possess much better predictive power and are therefore \u201cthe first generation who is able to take mitigation seriously.\u201d\n\nYet many countries are still behind on goals set as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. \u201cThis is the tragedy,\u201d said John F. Haldon, a historian at Princeton University who studies how ancient civilizations coped with climatic upheaval. \u201cEveryone\u2019s aware of the problem but there\u2019s a massive stasis in the system.\u201d\n\nIf a civilization\u2019s leadership \u201chas feet of clay and isn\u2019t willing to take the challenge on in an innovative way,\u201d Dr. Haldon said, \u201cthen often the challenge will overcome them.\u201d\n\nPresent-day humanity may have the resources and tools to deal with climate change, Dr. Haldon said, but action is often stifled by those who have a vested interest in denying the reality of human-caused climate change. \u201cWe seem to have the idea that people in ancient times or people in the past generally weren\u2019t quite as clever as we are, but Homo sapiens is Homo sapiens,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s something that we are creating \u2014 and we see what happened the last time \u2014 I think we\u2019d be foolish not to take steps to stop it,\u201d Dr. Cline said. \u201cThe problem is when we have deniers,\u201d he added. \u201cThen we\u2019re no better off than the Hittites.\u201d\n\nFollow @NYTClimate on Twitter", "title": "Faced With Drought, the Pharaohs Tried (and Failed) to Adapt", "authors": []}

But instead of using presidential clout to push his party in a new direction and put lawmakers on the spot, the White House backed off and embraced more ideas more compatible with the N.R.A. while establishing a commission to explore other alternatives.\n\nOn Wednesday, as students around the country demonstrated for new gun control laws, the Republican-led House passed a measure that focused more on physical improvements to bolster school safety, and the White House said it was most pleased with the progress.\n\nDespite intense public and news media scrutiny on Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement with a pornographic film actress and payments to her by his personal attorney, top congressional Republicans have essentially ignored the subject, with Mr. Ryan saying recently that he had not \u201cput a second of thought\u201d into the topic.

Under the beige dial is a slim-line automatic with an 80-hour power reserve and a tourbillon with a platinum carriage.\n\nPhoto\n\nCHOPARD L.U.C QUATTRO\n\n$24,400\n\nChopard\u2019s tendency to create watches that look as if they\u2019ve just fallen from the wrists of well-heeled central European businessmen shows no signs of abating. The latest is a version of its L.U.C Quattro, a collection mainstay \u2014 this time, a simple rose-gold-cased piece with an in-house caliber that boasts a whopping nine-day power reserve. Its blued hands, numerals and hour markers sit on a silver-toned and vertical satin-brushed dial, complemented by a strap of blue calfskin leather with a woven effect.\n\nPhoto\n\nJAQUET DROZ GRANDE SECONDE TRIBUTE\n\n$21,400\n\nThe name of Jaquet Droz (the \u201cz\u201d is silent) might not be front-of-mind \u2014 its 280-year history is somewhat mixed. Recently, it\u2019s become a collector favorite, led by its signature Grande Seconde, with its dominant running seconds counter and figure-of-eight dial layout. The watch was revived in 2002 but this is the first time it has been presented in yellow gold. Given the brand\u2019s popularity in China, it is not, however, the first time we\u2019ve seen a Jaquet Droz model limited to 88 pieces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPhoto\n\nGRAND SEIKO HI-BEAT 36000 V.F.A.\n\n$53,000\n\nThere are two key dates in the history of Grand Seiko. The first is 1960, when the Seiko sub-brand made its debut; the second, 1998, when it introduced the 9S mechanical caliber, which has become the platform for every Grand Seiko caliber. Twenty years later, Grand Seiko comes to the table with a suite of three limited-edition anniversary styles. Prime among those is the V.F.A. model, which stands for Very Fine Adjusted, and is accurate to plus-three to minus-one seconds per day. Only 20 of the platinum-cased piece will be made.\n\nPhoto\n\nTAG HEUER CARRERA CALIBRE 16 CHRONOGRAPH\n\n$4,350\n\nTag Heuer openly admits that its best-selling model is the Carrera. The motor sport-themed watch turns 55 this year, giving the brand a moment to produce a series of anniversary pieces. One of those is this 41-millimeter steel model with a polished black ceramic bezel, a reverse panda dial (a current Tag Heuer favorite) and racy red detailing.\n\nPhoto\n\nCARL F. BUCHERER MANERO TOURBILLON DOUBLE PERIPHERAL\n\n$72,300\n\nThe most universally friendly design by the Lucerne-based house of Carl F. Bucherer is its Manero. This version carries the new CFB T3000, the brand\u2019s third in-house caliber. Like the duo that came before, the new unit has a peripheral rotor, a feature the company trades on because it brings the benefits of an automatic without the hazards of a rotor that obscures 50 percent of the movement. The watch\u2019s tourbillon is peripherally mounted, what the brand says is a world first, so the tourbillon appears to be floating.\n\nPhoto\n\nORIS DIVERS SIXTY-FIVE DATE\n\n$2,000\n\nThe Divers Sixty-Five has given Oris\u2019s design credentials a shot in the arm since its introduction three years ago. Its 1960s design cues, solid quality and honest pricing have struck a chord with critics. This year, the independent Swiss company has added some voguish bronze to the outer edge of the watch\u2019s diving bezel, marrying that with rose-gold-plated hands and hour markers, and an earthy leather strap.\n\nPhoto\n\nMEISTERSINGER LUNASCOPE\n\n$3,850\n\nMaking a watch with just the one hand has given MeisterSinger its U.S.P., the philosophy being that some people are more interested in the bigger picture than being anywhere on time. The German company\u2019s latest is its first astronomical watch. It features an uncommonly large, detailed moon that will need adjusting (assuming it\u2019s kept wound) only once every 128 years.\n\nOutside bets\n\nThe raft of brands missing at Baselworld this year include some that have fallen on hard times but also a number that are going their own way: either defecting to rival fairs or running their own shows.\n\nPhoto\n\nHERM\u00c8S SLIM D\u2019HERM\u00c8S GMT\n\n$14,700\n\nOnce a Baselworld stalwart, Herm\u00e8s crossed the divide in January to the Salon de la Haute Horlogerie. The short nine-month gap between last year\u2019s Basel and this year\u2019s S.I.H.H. no doubt curtailed its offering there, hence the arrival now of an addition to its Slim d\u2019Herm\u00e8s line of watches. The slimline case and Philippe Apeloig\u2019s bespoke numerals are joined by a gray dial, a smoked sapphire crystal and a version of Herm\u00e8s\u2019s H1950 caliber, powered up to show a second time zone with day/night indicators for both local and home time. Cased in palladium, it\u2019ll run to just 90 pieces.\n\nPhoto\n\nBREMONT ALT1-C\n\n$6,495\n\nBremont\u2019s damp, windy corner at Baselworld\u2019s Palace proved too small a home for the British brand, which bailed on Basel last year and instead took over a townhouse in London for a few days. It repeated the pop-up last month, and then took the format to New York a couple of weeks ago. At these, it announced an update to the ALT1-C, the watch that kicked off the Bremont story in 2007. It\u2019s now dressier, with baton hour markers instead of Arabic numerals, and includes a blue version inspired by the 100th anniversary of the Royal Air Force this year.", "title": "Fairground Attractions at Baselworld", "authors": ["Robin Swithinbank"]}

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Faith Beaulieu from Saco, Me., said simply:\n\nIn this case is wasn\u2019t a pressured betray of beliefs, it was a forced one.\n\nFrancesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., thinks Ms. Perry should be held accountable:\n\nI have lost any respect I might have had for Katy Perry, and I\u2019m not sure that I even had any. The whole debacle was embarrassing and inappropriate. The 19 year old Benjamin Glaze, who received the unwanted kiss, expressed that he was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the kiss as it was his first, and had expected his first kiss to be a bit more meaningful. He also said he felt that he \u201cdid not feel sexually harassed,\u201d but did Katy Perry know that he wouldn\u2019t when she planted that physical manifestation of romantic intimacy on an individual almost 15 years younger than her? No, she didn\u2019t, and the truth is that she probably didn\u2019t care to consider what he might feel when she made the decision to kiss him. Her behavior can be reflected in the sleazy Hollywood sexual offenders that we all viciously exposed and vilified (and rightfully so, I am in no way defending them), yet somehow we give Katy Perry a pass? She should be held accountable for sexual misdemeanors regardless of her gender, as should all women. She used her position of power as a reputable judge and artist to force an unsolicited romantic/sexual act on a teenager she\u2019d never even met before, which is harassment and should be treated as such.\n\nJaliyah from winnetonka said Mr. Glaze was not treated with respect:\n\nHonestly I think his gender has to do something with all this happening too. For men if something like this happened no one would care or they would just care less, because they think he is a man he should like being kissed by women especially if she\u2019s a star, and if he doesn\u2019t like it he\u2019s a cry baby or he should just defend himself. If this was a girl, and a man who kissed her without consent the world would freak out, but for guys they\u2019re told to just be a man about it so what they believe or their thoughts are ignored or joked about even by other guys. This guy\u2019s morals were disrespected because he is expected to just suck it up and be a man about it. What she did was creepy and although she meant no harm I think his morals should have been respected and that you shouldn\u2019t be kissing random people anyway.\n\nHadley Todd from Wilmington, N.C., has not ever been pressured to betray personal beliefs:\n\nI honestly cannot remember a time where I have been pressured to betray my beliefs, but I have definitely pressured another to do so unintentionally. I usually stick to the opinions I have and others often feel intimidated by this and end up agreeing with what I have to say, probably because so many people don\u2019t have a mind of their own if I\u2019m being honest. They\u2019re so afraid of being rejected by others for disagreeing with them or putting up a fight that they just cave in as if that will make them likable. I would rather somebody actually have the brain to disagree with me because it would show that they are an individual that can speak for themselves.\n\nDenislav Kasaivanov from Wilmington, N.C., thinks the media overreacted to the incident:\n\nOne measure of how strongly you believe in your opinions is how likely you are to stray away from them when pressured. Personally, I haven\u2019t betrayed my beliefs because I would like to say that my opinions are formed through what I, myself, have experienced in my so-far 16 year life. I value sticking to your word greatly, causing me to severely dislike those whom change their opinions in order to fit into the \u2018norm\u2019 or to not be \u2018singled-out\u2019 for their viewpoints. At the end of the day, I think that you shouldn\u2019t care about what other people think because you should live life the way you want to live it, and not take everything too seriously. Aside from that, I stand somewhat in the middle of the Benjamin Glaze situation. Should she have went up there and given a kiss without asking? No. Should it have been blown up to this proportion in media outlets and have all this hate directed at Katy Perry? No. At the end of the day, Mr. Glaze did say he wanted to \u2018Save his kiss for his first relationship\u2019, and Perry should have asked and acknowledged that, as a matter of respect. But what this boils down is into another public-relations catastrophe between TV media and the public; not aiding in the already construed skepticism of mainstream media.\n\nBen C. from North Carolina does not impose his will on others:\n\nI have been pressured to betray my beliefs a number of times, but I do not impose my will upon others. What Katy Perry did was unacceptable, and it probably messed with his performance in paragraph 11, as he delivered a lackluster performance because he was disappointed that his first kiss was not with someone he loved.\n\nMary Wells from Wilmington, N.C., found herself shocked:\n\nWhen hearing the news how Katy Perry abused Mr. Glaze\u2019s beliefs, I was shocked. It was not right for her to have tricked him and forced him to kiss her when he wanted to wait for the right person. The article states how he did not want to kiss her because he was raised from a conservative family and wanted his first kiss to be special. He wanted his first kiss to be with someone special and Katy Perry disrespected his religious beliefs. I admit I have been pressured to change my beliefs because of other people. I remember in elementary school my friends were different than the ones in preschool and expected more from me. I was expected to practice cheerleading and spend recess talking and sitting rather than running around, swinging from the monkey bars, which was an activity I enjoyed. One year later I realized that I did not want to be someone\u2019s personal cheerleader and I went back to playing on the playground. I do not let others tell me what to do because I have learned that pressure makes me feel guilty and overall not happy.\n\nperla elias from caruthers said feeling pressure to do something is not welcome:\n\nI have been pressured to do something and it is not a good feeling. I have been pressured when I was playing softball in middle school and I was the last one up to bat and they all counted on me. Everyone was quiet and they were all staring at me and just were telling me that I could do it but I just felt really pressured because if I didn\u2019t hit the ball we were going to lose the game. At the end of the game we had won and I had hit the ball and I brought my teammates home but I had so much pressure on me.\n\nAubrey Ella Hyldahl from Wilmington, N.C., said women and men must be held to the same standards:\n\nIn order for movements like #MeToo to be successful, it cannot be subjective. I am a huge proponent of feminism and I strive to spread awareness and equality anyway I can, but the definition of feminism, in my opinion, is that men and women are equal. It is contradictory to hold this belief and think that it is okay for Katy Perry to kiss a teenage boy, just because she is a woman. She should be held to the same standard that we would hold a 33-year old man to if he were to kiss an unwilling teenage girl. Her actions put an innocent teenager in a highly uncomfortable position, one that is common for young women: A higher powered person preying on defenseless subordinates. Of course Benjamin didn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t kiss Perry - it is hard enough to tell somebody that holds your future in their hands \u201cno\u201d when you aren\u2019t on national television. It is fair to say that Benjamin was pressured into forsaking his beliefs, but so are all of the feminist, or even semi feminists out there saying things like Benjamin was lucky, or that what Katy did was cute. This issue spreads its wings outside of this one (horrible) incident, all the way to the feminist movement as a whole. If we ever want true equality these are the times that we have to stick to our guns and make sure what we say and believe about situations outside the norm of the feminist issue column remain consistent with what we would think if the roles were reversed.\n\nKayla Renee from Pennsylvania has never felt pressure to betray her beliefs:\n\nI have never felt pressured to betray my religion. When I hear this question I start to think about Muslims feeling pressured to eat pork or Christians feeling pressured to have sex before marriage. To answer this question I would say I, as a Christian, have never felt pressured to betray my beliefs or religion.\n\nAmy Blanchard in Saco, Me., said the kiss was not consensual:\n\nI don\u2019t believe what Katy Perry did was right, specifically because if the genders were swapped, there would be massive backlash. I understand why she did it in the moment, she probably thought he had never kissed someone because he never had the opportunity or something, and Katy \u201cgave him that opportunity.\u201d But as Benjamin stated, if Katy had asked him, he would\u2019ve said no. Therefore, there was not consent, and we make a big deal about consent in society when men act without it, and women should be pressured to get consent too.\n\nLiz from Maine thinks the kiss was an assault:\n\nThis is sexual assault. It might not be as extreme as other stories, but it still stands. Guys are held to a different standard than girls when it comes to sex, think about how much outrage would surface if the roles were switched. Imagine if a 30 y/o guy kissed a 19 y/o girl, it would be madness in both real life and on social media! But, when a guy is assaulted, people are proud of him and \u201cjealous\u201d. They are told to \u201cman up\u201d and that \u201cyou are so lucky!\u201d The whole thing just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n_________", "title": "Falling Gold, Phone Manners, Bad Citizens and Great Leaders: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": []}

By evening, we were all there, all 20 of us. His emergency medical team asked us end-of-life questions: Did we want heroic measures taken? Did we want a feeding tube put in? The understanding was that once they put one in for someone his age, it rarely came out. Then one of the doctors, looking grave, assembled us outside Dad\u2019s room, out of his earshot, and explained that she thought it wise for us to consider saying our goodbyes.\n\nDad had fractured his spine in a number of places and had lots of broken ribs and fluid on the lungs.

My grandma, Dad and my dad\u2019s younger brother, who would be my Uncle Billy, were there to greet him. But when he got off, he was drunk and wobbling. Later, in the car, he got irritated with my Uncle Billy\u2019s whining and slapped him up. My granddad hung around for a while and, over the years, my dad would see him now and then, but mostly he was gone. It was the minister from the church who had to accompany my dad and Uncle Billy to father-son school functions.\n\nMy dad couldn\u2019t have been more different from his father. He was a family man. At picnics, he organized games for all us kids. He took me fishing and hunting and rarely missed one of my football games. He didn\u2019t drink and never swore except when telling a joke in which a certain well-placed word made all the difference. He was occasionally short-tempered \u2014 what father isn\u2019t sometimes \u2014 but he loved us and he let us know it.\n\nWhen I left the hospital that first night, one of the nurses assured us that if Dad showed signs of not making it, he\u2019d call us. I slept with my cellphone on my nightstand. The next day, I arrived early and the nurse took me aside and said that Dad seemed a little better. He added the word \u201cremarkably\u201d and then said he likely wouldn\u2019t need to be intubated. \u201cHe wants to live,\u201d he told me.\n\nThree days later, they moved Dad to the intensive care unit. He had nurses and doctors, a physical therapist and a respiratory therapist. The respiratory therapist\u2019s job was to help him with his breathing exercises to clear his lungs of fluid. The fluid made him a pneumonia risk, which at his age was especially dangerous. When she took off his mask, which he had been wearing 24 hours a day, he looked like someone had ground his face into a wrestling mat. When the respiratory therapist was busy, I worked with him, too, making sure he did his reps. All of us kids did, but we still couldn\u2019t get his oxygen levels up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat\u2019s when my mom struck upon an idea: She had been whistling in a store and someone told her it was good for the lungs. She wondered if music might help Dad. It was a teaching hospital, and while the team of doctors was making its morning rounds, Mom told the lead physician that Dad loved to sing, and asked if it could help him. The doctor paused and then shrugged his shoulders: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nSo for the next three weeks, we gathered in Dad\u2019s room and sang. He sang into his oxygen mask, though his voice was muffled. Often the nurses joined in. One time, a nurse, whom my dad especially liked, sang \u201cRed River Valley\u201d with us before he moved on to his next patient. \u201cWasn\u2019t that fun?\u201d I said to Dad. I had to lean in close, so that I could hear him from under the mask. \u201cNice baritone,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I could teach him to harmonize.\u201d\n\nSlowly Dad\u2019s oxygen levels rose. The X-rays showed less and less fluid on his lungs and the mask was removed permanently after a CT scan. Now, he could really belt out the songs.\n\nWhen one of the nurses came in with a big belly and told my mom that she was six months pregnant, Dad chimed in, \u201cHave you figured out what\u2019s causing it?\u201d Then, he and Mom launched into \u201cHush Little Baby\u201d with Mom on the melody and Dad singing tenor, his voice getting stronger.", "title": "Family Harmony of the Musical Kind", "authors": ["James Campbell"]}

And now, warns the United Nations, famine stalks the tortured land.\n\nA recent report by the United Nations and the South Sudan government said 150,000 people could slip into famine this year. A formal famine declaration means people have already started to starve to death. But even with food aid, humanitarian workers warn, much of South Sudan could face severe hunger by May. And the U.N. response plan has received less than 4 percent of its 2018 funding.\n\nA year ago, South Sudan declared famine in two regions, but international responses checked it. Even if that were repeated this year, famine will be a threat in the future unless the land\u2019s predatory soldiers are driven out. This is caused by the struggle for power and loot, not by nature.\n\nWith so many conflicts around the globe, it is not surprising that those like South Sudan\u2019s attract attention only when they rise to horrific levels.

An English-language version was still up on Friday, but a Chinese version had been removed, according to Charlie Vest, a graduate student in Chinese economic and political affairs. In the past, pro-Beijing students in the United States have mounted counterprotests against students or speakers, like the Dalai Lama, who openly criticize or are seen as threats to the government.\n\nHow broadly the protests were spreading at each college was unclear. Shiwei Terry Zhou, a senior at U.C. San Diego from Wuhan, said that while some posters had been placed on the campus, he did not think the campaign was having much influence. \u201cMost students are not anti-Xi as far as I know (they really just don\u2019t care),\u201d he said via a Facebook message.\n\nPerry Link, a China scholar at the University of California, Riverside, said that such activism was more common immediately after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, after which Congress passed a law letting any Chinese student who feared retribution upon return to China to apply immediately for United States residency.\n\n\u201cThis rule actually became an incentive for students to speak out, since many were hoping to get green cards in any case,\u201d Dr. Link said. \u201cBut in recent years the external incentives have been powerfully in the opposite direction,\u201d he said, making it unusual for Chinese students in the United States to protest.\n\nIn an interview Friday with Radio Free Asia, a United States-funded news service focused on Asian countries, Mr. Li, speaking in Chinese, said he believed he had an obligation to make a difference. He argued that one-party rule was not only doing harm to China, but also was threatening the free world, as China was now exporting the ideology that \u201cauthoritarianism is better than democracy.\u201d\n\nMr. Li, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Ohio State University before enrolling at N.Y.U., said later that while he had heard many Chinese students in the United States expressing their objections to the removal of term limits, only a few were willing to speak out publicly. \u201cI don\u2019t think many Chinese students are aware of this movement,\u201d he said.", "title": "Far From Home and Censors, Some Chinese Students Protest Xi\u2019s Power Move", "authors": []}

It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201d\n\nFor the company, the significance of the crash goes beyond Autopilot. Tesla is already reeling from a barrage of negative news. The value of its stock and bonds has plunged amid increasing concerns about how much cash it is using up and the repeated delays in the production of the Model 3, a battery-powered compact car that Mr. Musk is counting on to generate much-needed revenue.\n\nIt is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.\n\nDrivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.\n\nSoftware modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.\n\nThe new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.\n\nAutopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.\n\nAt least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.\n\nAn earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled.

She creates drones on the harmonium \u2014 an old, air-powered keyboard \u2014 and coaxes her bandmates into ripping them apart. Then her voice funnels that energy out in a scorching beam.

The songs, comprising a new suite she\u2019s calling \u201cYajna\u201d (or \u201critual of fire\u201d), all centered on direct phrases: \u201cThey step on those beneath in the name of progress,\u201d or, in one inspired by the life and death of Erica Garner, \u201cThe system breaks her heart.\u201d Without the tousled kinetics of the band, Ms. Kidambi worked hard to create a full context.\n\nTo a degree, the specificity and the fury felt healthy, and important. We need more of this. But the lyrics were intentionally unambiguous, leaving little room for imagination. And in the way she hurtled them straight and hard at the audience, you couldn\u2019t help feeling as if you were receiving something impervious and final. It was hard to tap into a sense of catharsis, or find your way into the sound.

In an almost pitch-black room, the pearly drapes of light descend from a high ceiling in irregular, conical shapes, making stark outlines on the black carpet. Each immaterial sculpture has a distinct allure and form, but as you walk under and through them, their effects become related. Your eyes adjust and readjust; your body enters into the light; your movement throughout the space connects the four pieces.\n\nA similar logic took hold on Feb. 2 as you listened to the music in the second of four performances titled \u201cFour Simultaneous Soloists.\u201d In the gallery, the pedal steel guitarist Susan Alcorn, the drummer Eli Keszler, the cellist Tomeka Reid and the trumpeter Nate Wooley each sat beside one of the four vertical light sculptures, improvising freely as attendees circled slowly around them or sat beneath the fallen lights. Couples found it hard not to embrace or lay down together in an unselfconscious tangle.\n\nThe \u201csoloists\u201d played quietly, matching the darkness around them, and they could only catch snatches and inklings of what the others were playing. Ms. Alcorn and Mr. Keszler were at opposite ends of the long gallery; whatever information they received from each other came almost completely through Ms. Reid and Mr. Wooley.\n\nThinking it through, you might have been drawn to wander. Why sit and hear Ms. Alcorn\u2019s simple, slowly exhaled harmonies when across the room Mr. Wooley was playing fabulous long tones, blowing into what looked like a sheet of metal and making a music of blistery reconstitution? But ultimately, your body won out.

On the album, Ms. Fort draws elliptical harmonies around the clarinet sound of Gianluigi Trovesi, a distant and ephemeral player. But at Cornelia, her sparring partner was the alto saxophonist Michael Attias, and the pair drove each other into a flintier exchange.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMidway through \u201cSong of the Phoenix,\u201d Ms. Fort took a solo in the low-middle range that had a kind of generative fury, body and fire united. Then, on a freshly composed Fort original, provisionally titled \u201cSort Of,\u201d Mr. Attias took a solo that exhibited his roughly chiseled attack, answering Ms. Fort\u2019s provocation. Even the lovely or dreamlike moments had a sense of hard-won embodiment and purpose.\n\nThat tune was followed by \u201cMurmuration,\u201d from the album. As Mr. Attias\u2019s solo neared its summit, Ms. Fort drove her rhythm section \u2014 the bassist Gary Wang and the drummer Rudy Royston \u2014 toward a splintered dissolution. Her chords had the bright payoff of internal octaves as well as the acrid carp of dissonance. Altogether, the group was finding a new cooperative language, sometimes hitting a sputtering stride, sometimes avoiding cohesion altogether.\n\nThe Anat Fort Quartet returns to the Cornelia Street Caf\u00e9 on April 13.", "title": "February in Live Jazz: 5 Standout Shows", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"]}

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Quarles took issue with many parts of the rule \u2014 inspired by Paul Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Mr. Quarles said the rule was \u201can example of a complex regulation that is not working well,\u201d and that the Fed is working on revisions to make the rule less burdensome to firms that do not have large trading desks.\n\nMr. Quarles did not give a time-frame to revise the rule but said the Fed\u2019s goal was to write something that would formally be submitted for public comment. He said regulators want to make \u201cclearer and more transparent\u201d what kind of trading is governed by the Volcker Rule \u2014 something he said has been a source of frustration for regulators and bankers.\n\nThe Volcker Rule has been credited with curtailing the ability of banks to make risky and speculative trades for their own account \u2014 which some contend contributed to some of the excesses that led up to the financial crisis of a decade ago.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Goldstein\n\nWill Quarles end the post-Volcker quiet?\n\nThe Federal Reserve is gearing up for a far-reaching overhaul of the Volcker Rule.\n\nThe rule\u2019s critics, including Randal K. Quarles, head of supervision at the Fed, say it is too burdensome on banks.\n\nBut there may be one group of people who hope that the Fed doesn\u2019t gut the rule: Investors in bank stocks. Since the Volcker Rule took effect in 2015, they\u2019ve been able to worry much less about traders saddling their institutions with overwhelming losses. In fact, there hasn\u2019t been a big trading meltdown at a large United States bank since the London Whale debacle at JPMorgan Chase, which happened prior to 2015 and arguably lit a fire under regulators to finalize the rule.\n\nContrary to some analyses of the financial crisis, proprietary trading contributed to the weakness of financial system . Who can forget Morgan Stanley\u2019s disastrous subprime wager that saddled the bank with $9 billion of losses?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd by shedding proprietary traders, banks may have dodged no end of bullets. When a star commodities trader, Andrew J. Hall, left Citigroup, there was concern that the bank lost a crucial money maker. But the hedge fund Mr. Hall ran after he left Citigroup suffered outsize losses. And the list of bank traders who later racked up big losses at hedge funds is not short.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nNordstrom rebuffs bid.\n\nThe retailer has rejected its founding family\u2019s takeover offer.\n\nA group of Nordstrom family members, which control 21 percent of the company, had offered $50 a share for the shares it does not already own.\n\nThe Special Committee has directed its advisors and management not to provide further due diligence information to the Group. Furthermore, unless the Group can promptly and substantially improve the price it is proposing to pay for the Company, the Special Committee intends to terminate discussions.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat do big foreign banks get out of the new banking bill?\n\nIt was a brash move, even by Wall Street\u2019s standards.\n\nDeutsche Bank, a giant German bank with a big trading business in the United States, took emergency loans from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis a decade ago. But later, Deutsche Bank changed the legal classification of its Wall Street operations, a step that for a time shielded it from United States banking regulations.\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s actions, and those of other large foreign banks during that period, now loom over a piece of banking deregulation legislation that the Senate may approve this week.\n\nThe bill loosens the part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 2010 overhaul of the United States financial system, that imposed stricter regulations on larger banks, including foreign ones. Specifically, the bill \u2014 sponsored by Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho \u2014 would lighten the regulation of banks that have less than $250 billion in loans, securities and other assets, a group that includes American banks like SunTrust and BB&T.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s critics are concerned that it would allow far larger foreign banks to chip away at rules designed to prevent them wriggling out of United States safeguards.\n\nThe authors of the new bill reject such fears. \u201cFolks are peddling a lot of misinformation about our bipartisan bill, but if you look at the bill text you will see that large foreign banks will be subject to the same enhanced prudential standards,\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said in a statement. \u201cOur legislation provides targeted regulatory relief for local lenders in Montana and rural America.\u201d (\u201cEnhanced prudential standards\u201d is the regulatory term for stricter rules.)\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, speaking before a Senate committee last week, said he did not think the bill would allow foreign banks to operate under a softer set of rules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Powell based his assertion on how Dodd-Frank is written. It states that banks over $50 billion in consolidated assets require stricter oversight. The new bill moves that up to $250 billion. But even though the likes of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Credit Suisse have less than $250 billion in United States assets, they have far more than that on a consolidated basis around the world. And since the new bill does not amend the part of Dodd-Frank that requires regulators to use consolidated assets, the Fed can continue to apply its enhanced regulations to foreign banks.\n\nSo, why are opponents of the bill, like Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, concerned? They point to remarks made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Congress earlier this year. When Senator Brown asked Mr. Mnuchin if he believed the new bill would reduce regulations for foreign banks, he said: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d Indeed, the Treasury, when it set out its aims in a report last year for reducing financial regulations, included relief for foreign banks.\n\n(A Treasury official on Monday sought to clarify Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s answer to Senator Brown. The official said Mr. Mnuchin was responding to the senator\u2019s remarks about the Treasury\u2019s report that came before his question about the impact of Senator Crapo\u2019s bill.)\n\nCritics also point out that the Fed in part based its post-crisis rules for foreign banks on language in Dodd-Frank that required the rules establish fair competition between foreign and domestic banks. If the bill passes, and the Fed gives foreign banks no relief from certain regulations, the foreign banks could argue in a lawsuit that they are competitively disadvantaged against American banks with assets under $250 billion that did get such relief, some opponents of the bill contend.\n\nAnd the Fed did in one place veer from using consolidated assets when applying regulations to foreign banks. The Fed in 2014 said that foreign banks with less than $50 billion in United States assets (not a global consolidated measure) would be eligible for less stringent requirements under its foreign banking rule.\n\nThat could create the grounds for raising that bar for lighter regulation from to $250 billion from $50 billion, critics of the bill argue. But supporters of the bill contend that United States laws give the Fed substantial leeway to continue applying stricter regulation to foreign banks.\n\nWhat might happen if Senator Crapo\u2019s bill passes? It seems unlikely that big foreign banks are going to get an immediate pass from stricter regulations. But the pre-crisis period shows that, over a longer period, banks and their lawyers press for changes when they see regulators relax.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nPhoto\n\nNational security throws a wrench into Broadcom\u2019s plans\n\nThe most dramatic story in M.&A. has taken another twist \u2014 one that raises questions about how assertively the Trump administration will regulate deal-making.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat happened: The U.S. government panel that reviews deals for national security concerns, known as Cfius, has asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, by 30 days so it could further review Broadcom\u2019s hostile takeover bid.\n\nBroadcom\u2019s response pulled no punches, accusing Qualcomm of covertly reaching out to regulators:\n\nThis was a blatant, desperate act by Qualcomm to entrench its incumbent board of directors and prevent its own stockholders from voting for Broadcom\u2019s independent director nominees.\n\nWhy: Members of Cfius have asked whether the takeover could put the U.S. behind China in the race for 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm\u2019s biggest rival in the space is Huawei, and Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom, a serial acquirer and noted cost-cutter, could hurt crucial 5G research and development. (And Michael noted on Friday that there\u2019s more to it than that.)\n\nWhere the vote stands: Many early votes favored Broadcom: The shareholder advisory firms I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis recommended giving it at least four seats. But a top-30 investor, Parnassus, had said it supported Qualcomm. Michael hears that both sides have been especially focused on lobbying the biggest shareholders, BlackRock and Vanguard.\n\nThe bigger picture: The White House has already blocked the sale of a U.S. tech company to a Chinese buyer on national security grounds.

{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "The announcement underscores the Fed\u2019s gathering confidence in the economy as well as its focus on the potential for inflation, which has remained persistently muted throughout the expansion. Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. They raised their estimate for growth in 2019 to 2.4 percent, up from 2.1 percent. They now expect the unemployment rate to fall to 3.8 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2019, a low level by historical standards. In December, officials said they expected unemployment to be 3.9 percent both this year and next.\n\nOfficials\u2019 growing optimism tracks with the expectations of many Wall Street analysts. \u201cWe think Fed officials will view the growth and inflation data in recent months as encouraging,\u201d analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note ahead of the meeting, \u201cparticularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year.\u201d\n\nThree Increases\n\nFed officials indicated they are likely to raise rates a total of three times in 2018, in keeping with their projections in December. But officials were divided, with slightly less than half indicating they expect to raise rates at least four times this year. By a slim margin, officials said they expect an additional rate increase to come in 2019, for a total of three increases that year.\n\nIn his news conference, Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201d\n\nSome analysts say a short-term economic stimulus from Congress \u2014 in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut and federal spending increases \u2014 could eventually push the Fed to add a fourth rate move.\n\nA portion of the voting membership of the committee rotates every year among the Fed\u2019s regional bank presidents. The new members tend to worry more about inflation than those they replaced. Even some members who have fretted more about growth than inflation appear to be shifting their calculus.\n\nLael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been less hawkish than many of her colleagues, said in a speech this month that in many ways, \u201ctoday is the mirror image of the environment we confronted a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy,\u201d she added. \u201cToday, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBullish on growth\n\nFed officials signaled in several ways that they see the economy strengthening. Along with raising their growth forecasts, they declared in a statement that \u201ceconomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate\u201d and that \u201cjob gains have been strong in recent months.\u201d In January, officials described both economic activity and job growth as \u201csolid.\u201d\n\nThe statement also declared, in a change from January, that \u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.\u201d It said officials expect the inflation rate to move up \u201cin coming months.\u201d In January, officials said they expected inflation to increase \u201cthis year.\u201d\n\nThat increased optimism appears to downplay lingering uncertainties in the recovery, including structural issues like a ballooning debt load and trade barriers that could turn the economy\u2019s tailwinds back into headwinds. Recent data suggest that economic growth is falling short of expectations for the first quarter. Wage growth appears to be improving, but the signs are mixed. Markets have been rattled in recent weeks by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff plans and embrace of a potential trade war.\n\nPowell\u2019s Big Performance\n\nMr. Powell emphasized the strength of the economy in the opening remarks of his news conference, while largely steering clear of topics such as President Trump\u2019s pending tariffs and tax cuts.\n\nThe new chairman highlighted strong recent monthly jobs gains, the low unemployment rate, improving labor-force participation and a fiscal boost from federal tax cuts and spending increases.

{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "The petition didn\u2019t make much of an impact. Fifteen years ago today, the invasion of Iraq began.\n\nThree months later, I returned to Iraq for the first time since 1991 as part of a collective to film a documentary about Iraqis in a post-Saddam Iraq. We wanted to show my countrymen as three-dimensional beings, beyond the binary of Saddam versus the United States. In American media, Iraqis had been reduced to either victims of Saddam who longed for occupation or supporters and defenders of dictatorship who opposed the war. We wanted Iraqis to speak for themselves. For two weeks, we drove around Baghdad and spoke to many of its residents. Some were still hopeful, despite being drained by years of sanctions and dictatorship. But many were furious and worried about what was to come. The signs were already there: the typical arrogance and violence of a colonial occupying power.\n\nMy short visit only confirmed my conviction and fear that the invasion would spell disaster for Iraqis. Removing Saddam was just a byproduct of another objective: dismantling the Iraqi state and its institutions. That state was replaced with a dysfunctional and corrupt semi-state. We were still filming in Baghdad when L. Paul Bremer III, the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, announced the formation of the so-called Governing Council in July 2003. The names of its members were each followed by their sect and ethnicity. Many of the Iraqis we spoke to on that day were upset with institutionalization of an ethno-sectarian quota system. Ethnic and sectarian tensions already existed, but their translation into political currency was toxic. Those unsavory characters on the governing council, most of whom were allies of the United States from the preceding decade, went on to loot the country, making it one of the most corrupt in the world.\n\nWe were fortunate to have been able to shoot our film in that brief period during which there was relative public security. Shortly after our visit, Iraq descended into violence; suicide bombings became the norm. The invasion made my country a magnet for terrorists (\u201cWe\u2019ll fight them there so we don\u2019t have to fight them here,\u201d President George W. Bush had said), and Iraq later descended into a sectarian civil war that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced hundreds of thousands more, irrevocably changing the country\u2019s demography.\n\nThe next time I returned to Baghdad was in 2013. The American tanks were gone, but the effects of the occupation were everywhere. I had low expectations, but I was still disheartened by the ugliness of the city where I had grown up and horrified by how dysfunctional, difficult and dangerous daily life had become for the great majority of Iraqis.\n\nMy last visit was in April 2017. I flew from New York, where I now live, to Kuwait, where I was giving a lecture. An Iraqi friend and I crossed the border by land. I was going to the city of Basra, in the south of Iraq. Basra was the only major Iraqi city I had not visited before. I was going to sign my books at the Friday book market of al-Farahidi Street, a weekly gathering for bibliophiles modeled after the famous Mutanabbi Street book market in Baghdad. I was driven around by friends. I didn\u2019t expect the beautiful Basra I\u2019d seen on 1970s postcards. That city had long disappeared. But the Basra I saw was so exhausted and polluted. The city had suffered a great deal during the Iran-Iraq war, and its decline accelerated after 2003. Basra was pale, dilapidated and chaotic thanks to the rampant corruption. Its rivers are polluted and ebbing. Nonetheless, I made a pilgrimage to the famous statue of Iraq\u2019s greatest poet, Badr Shakir al-Sayyab.\n\nOne of the few sources of joy for me during these short visits were the encounters with Iraqis who had read my novels and were moved by them. These were novels I had written from afar, and through them, I tried to grapple with the painful disintegration of an entire country and the destruction of its social fabric.

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Later in the week, however, he seemed to back down. Asked to respond to the Department of Education statement, Mr. Peters released a statement of his own through a spokeswoman, saying, \u201cD.O.I. agrees that the authority of the special commissioner pursuant to Executive Order 11 cannot be altered by D.O.I., has not been altered by D.O.I. and need not be altered by D.O.I.\u201d\n\nOfficials in the education department and elsewhere in city government did not suggest that Mr. Peters would do a poor job in an expanded role. But several current and former officials said the way he has sought to make changes without the proper authority has raised concerns.\n\nThe special commissioner has always reported to the investigation commissioner, but the office has essentially operated as an independent agency as a result of the substantial power and authority provided for in the executive order and board resolutions. It is funded by the education department.\n\nTaking direct control would give Mr. Peters the power to hire and fire, set salaries, promote and demote, discipline, and assign the duties and responsibilities of the investigators and other employees of the special commissioner\u2019s office. One of the legal documents prepared by the Department of Investigation sought Ms. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s approval for Mr. Peters\u2019s agency to exercise those powers, as well as the authority to assign staff \u201cconsistent with the needs of D.O.I.,\u201d according to a copy of the document.\n\nWithout her signature, those responsibilities remain with the office of the special commissioner.\n\nMr. Peters said his actions were prompted by the retirement late last year of Special Commissioner Richard J. Condon. A widely respected former New York Police Department commissioner, Mr. Condon was appointed special commissioner in 2002 and earned the respect of many at the education and investigation departments, and elsewhere in city government.\n\nMr. Peters has made additional unilateral changes that appear to run afoul of the orders and resolutions, and which, along with his other actions, would largely eliminate the autonomy that the office has had since it was created in 1990 and which has helped enable it to aggressively root out corruption.\n\nHe has changed the title of the head of the office from special commissioner of investigation to inspector general, a less prestigious position that is equivalent to more than a dozen other investigation department officials. The old executive orders provide that the special commissioner has the authority to sign subpoenas, compel testimony and publish reports. The new inspector general, Anastasia Coleman, a former senior assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, would not have those powers, and would have to seek approval from senior officials at the department.", "title": "Fight to Control Office That Roots Out Corruption in New York Schools", "authors": []}

I think that\u2019s excessive.\u201d\n\nXstat is one of several innovative products that stop bleeding. The British company Celox Medical makes granules and gauzes impregnated with chitosan, made from shells of shrimp and crabs. They form an effective emergency plug when packed or poured into a wound. They can be used for more kinds of wounds, on more places on the body, than Xstat. But they take longer to stop bleeding, the powder is hard to use anywhere there\u2019s wind, and they aren\u2019t good for treating gunshot wounds that spurt blood from a nicked artery or vein \u2014 a task Xstat can do.\n\nSpeed matters for gunshot wounds. A slow response can mean not only that victims die, but also that evidence and eyewitnesses melt away.\n\nThat is a problem. In a large majority of cases, the police never find out about shootings; researchers looking at Oakland, Calif., and Washington found that only one in eight gunshot incidents are reported. (Homicides are well reported, but fortunately, 99 percent of shootings don\u2019t kill anyone.)\n\nWhen people do make a call, it can be after precious minutes are lost to debate about whether what they heard was a gunshot. And callers often can give the police only the vaguest description of the direction the gunshot noise came from. So the police drive around the area. If they find nothing suspicious, they might sit in their car with the lights out for a while to see if anything happens. If they do happen upon a crime scene, of course, they will be going in blind, which is always dangerous.\n\nWhat could help is technology that instantly reports gunshots and their location. In fact, it already exists and is provided by a company called ShotSpotter. More than 85 American cities and Cape Town, South Africa, use it \u2014 some across the entire city, many just in high-crime areas. New York City has 57 square miles covered by ShotSpotter.\n\nCities lease the technology and services, and the company puts up acoustic sensors on buildings and lampposts. They can pinpoint the location of a shot by how fast the sound reaches different sensors. Machine algorithms and then a panel of human acoustics analysts sitting in California look at the sound patterns and determine whether it\u2019s gunfire \u2014 and if so, how many shots and whether automatic weapons are involved.

Last week, after Gov. James C. Justice, a Republican, announced a plan to increase pay by 5 percent, union leaders said classes would resume. But teachers refused, demanding that the Legislature vote to make the raise official. That finally happened on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear where the money would come from, but the governor promised there would not be cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the poor.\n\nTeachers in the state last year earned an average of about $46,000, $13,000 less than the national average. In only three states did teachers earn less: Mississippi, South Dakota and Oklahoma. In the last week, 40,000 people have joined a Facebook group calling for a walkout of Oklahoma teachers.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut some West Virginia lawmakers expressed concern about the cost of the raises. While its cost of living is in the middle of the pack, the state is poor: Its median household income of $43,385, according to Census Bureau estimates from 2016, placed it 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi.\n\nWest Virginia has the nation\u2019s fourth-highest unemployment rate and an opioid overdose death rate that is more than three times the national average.

When teachers first unionized in Chicago at the turn of the 20th century, 97 percent were women, and they were paid little more than maids.\n\nPolicymakers did not see that as a problem. Instead, they wanted to devote their extra funds to recruiting male teachers, who they thought would be tougher, and thus better able to control those huge, 60-student classes.\n\nThe female teachers got angry, launched their federation, and within several years had secured a raise. They shocked the nation\u2019s elite by marching, in petticoats, alongside Teamsters and other male unionists.\n\nPhoto\n\nMargaret Haley, a founder of the Chicago Teachers Federation, was inspired by Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists, just as today, some West Virginia teachers have come to activism through the 2017 Women\u2019s March, the #MeToo movement or Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe politics of teacher strikes shift over time, but in every generation, their leaders have forged ties to broader social movements. Many of the union leaders who led the nation\u2019s most famous \u2014 or infamous \u2014 teacher strike, in New York City in 1968, were first active in the civil rights movement, including the 1963 March on Washington and Freedom Summer in 1964. Nevertheless, when black and Latino activists pushed for community and parent control of struggling schools, including the right to remove teachers, the union went on strike to protect teachers\u2019 tenure rights.\n\nThe seven-day teacher strike in Chicago in 2012 came a year after Occupy Wall Street, and rode a wave of dissatisfaction with elite influence in public education. Teachers won a raise and successfully pushed back against Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2019s desire to evaluate teachers based on their students\u2019 test scores.\n\nToday in West Virginia, policymakers have their own ideas about how to improve schools. The State Department of Education has revamped vocational education, while the Republican-controlled Legislature has debated weakening teachers\u2019 seniority protections and providing parents with tax incentives to pay for private school tuition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the striking teachers asked that the State Legislature first consider the basics: the salaries and benefits that they say would keep them from fleeing the state. Terry Moe, a Stanford political scientist and often a critic of teachers\u2019 unions, said on Monday that West Virginia teachers were not asking for anything radical.\n\n\u201cA 5 percent raise is not much,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a good case to be made that West Virginia ought to put more priority on education, and they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has suggested one way teachers could earn more \u2014 by agreeing to become armed, in order to protect students from school shootings, like the one that killed 17 people in Parkland, Fla., last month.\n\nMs. Hilliard\u2019s school, Spring Mills High School, has had drills and lockdowns to prepare faculty and students for threats such as a potential school gunman.

When Trumpism fails, as it inevitably will, who will be the Republican Adenauer?\n\nI write this as a parallel contest is taking shape within the Democratic Party, most visibly in the rift between traditional liberals and the social-justice warriors of what used to be the far left. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s failure this week to claim her party\u2019s nomination for the Senate seat she\u2019s held since 1992 is another depressing indication that the rift is widening.\n\nOne side believes in the power of reason, the possibility of persuasion, and the values of the Enlightenment. It champions social solidarity for the sake of empowering the individual, rather than creating a society of conformists. It doesn\u2019t see compromise as a dirty word. Its belief in the benefits of civility and diversity does not override its commitment to free speech and independent thought.\n\nAs for the other side, it thinks it knows what\u2019s True. It considers compromise knavish. It views debate \u2014 beyond its own tightly set parameters \u2014 as either pointless or dangerous. And while it sees itself as the antithesis of Trumpism, it is, in its raging intolerance and smug self-satisfaction, Trumpism\u2019s mirror image.\n\nMy advice to traditional liberals is not to repeat the establishment Republican mistake of not taking the threat of populist illiberalism seriously, and of not fighting it fiercely. The fabric of an open society is more frayed than most people realize, and it is coming unraveled from more than one end. What happened to the G.O.P. in 2016 could happen to the Democrats in 2020.\n\nThe good news, as Charen courageously reminded us, is that these fights should never be abandoned even when they seem lost, and that sometimes the fights most worth having are those with our own side. William F. Buckley and Daniel Patrick Moynihan would have told you the same thing.", "title": "Opinion | Fights Worth Having", "authors": []}

We talk about it. We have a new song at the top of the second act called \u201cStop.\u201d It\u2019s sort of a comedic song about impulse control, and Nell and I are both so mindful about making sure that it\u2019s not judging just girls for the choices they make. In some ways, it makes sense that our heroine by the end of the show is living her authentic life and being her best self \u2014 that she is teaching us.\n\nThe musical feels kinder than the movie.\n\nFEY I think that partly is the form, because once you hear people sing, then you\u2019re in their hearts.

Diane Serlin, the chairwoman of the cabin committee, said that the club\u2019s president, John Judge, and a member of the board of directors met with her on March 2 in Manhattan and told her that the cabin would be sold as quickly as possible and would not be available for use this summer.\n\n\u201cIt was like getting hit on the head with a hammer,\u201d she said, adding that she was pleased by the club\u2019s decision to allow for a fuller debate.\n\nThe board was to discuss the matter during a March 15 meeting in Boston and, Mr. Judge said, could have voted then to pursue a sale. Club members in New York voiced opposition. On March 14, the club announced on its website that it would delay any vote, adding that over the next year it would \u201ccontinue evaluating the use and impact of the cabin as part of the A.M.C. mission while also engaging in further dialogue.\u201d\n\nMr. Judge said that there was no urgency to sell and that the club would conduct a \u201clistening tour\u201d on the issue. But the club also had to allocate resources carefully, he added, and weigh questions about holding onto a cabin that had room for limited visitors and could be jeopardized by powerful storms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt comes down to this idea of mission impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to pick and choose how to do the most good.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA March 9 memo sent from the club\u2019s vice president of outdoor operations, Paul Cunha, to board members said use of the cabin had gradually decreased over the past decade and that club officials had been discussing selling the property since November. Mr. Cunha added that a realtor had suggested a sale price of $1.7 million.\n\nRobert Kuhar, a licensed associate real estate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who has sold properties on Fire Island, said that the mountain club property could, subject to variables like deed restrictions, topography and zoning rules, be divided into as many as eight buildable lots that could sell for $400,000 to $600,000 apiece.\n\nSeveral club members have said that they will continue to oppose a sale of the cabin and hope to persuade the board that it is worth keeping.\n\nMr. Maier said the one-year delay meant that the cabin would be open this summer. On St. Patrick\u2019s Day he gave a tour of the property, which also includes a garden and a gazebo lined with bookshelves and chairs. He picked up a photograph taken after a hurricane in 1961 and noted that a stand of trees near the cabin had not yet existed.\n\n\u201cThis land has been able to grow because it hasn\u2019t been developed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been able to find its own way.\u201d", "title": "Fire Island Cabin Sale Incites Rebellion Over Seaside Haven", "authors": ["Colin Moynihan"]}

But in 2010, in a kind of sit-down summit, Mr. Pozzuoli Jr. visited his rival and asked him to stop using his family\u2019s trademarked name. Mr. Zarco, however, has a different version of events. He claims that Mr. Pozzuoli Jr. appeared one day, looked around and said, \u201cWith you we have no problem. Everything is O.K.\u201d\n\nLegally speaking, it was O.K. for another seven years. But according to court papers, that changed in October, when Mr. Zarco put up a sign that was, as Judge Cogan said, \u201cnearly indistinguishable\u201d from the one JP had been using since 1983.\n\nPhoto\n\nWas it really mere coincidence, the Pozzuolis asked, that Mr. Zarco had availed himself of the exact same design \u2014 the one with \u201cJoe\u2019s\u201d in a red, slanting script and \u201cPIZZA\u201d in block text set against a solid wash of white?

Mr. Zarco, he explained, had adorned the walls of JPV with photographs of Mr. Maguire and others that had actually been taken at the Manhattan pizzeria; he had also posted images on JPV\u2019s social-media accounts of \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d \u2014 Mr. Maguire\u2019s hit movie \u2014 being filmed at JP.\n\nYou might have thought that all this evidence, in a federal judge\u2019s order, would have ended the fight.

They further said that JPV had borrowed the one-of-a-kind \u201csoccer dog logo\u201d they had briefly used to promote their pies during the World Cup. As for the photograph of Mr. Maguire, it had not been taken down, they claimed. In fact, it was \u201cenlarged.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThree days later, Mr. Zarco wrote his own note to the judge saying that he had just fixed his Twitter page and that GrubHub had \u201cmigrated all the information\u201d from another food website without his knowledge. He said the Pozzuolis\u2019 accusation that his photo collection had changed \u201cfor the worse\u201d was patently false.

Across the river at JP, an older clientele stood at a counter at the rain-smeared window, savoring their crusts, blackened lightly with a char.\n\nThe air of normalcy led one to wonder how pizza wars get started in the first place.

Part of being poly is being able to realize your full potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why is your potential tied up with sex?\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between taking a pottery class because you want to try pottery and needing to sleep with the pottery teacher.\u201d\n\nWith all of those lovers and flings, life with Howard looked like being a housekeeper with benefits. We would be maintaining a partnership so that we could give the best of ourselves to other people. An introvert, I wanted to fall in love with one person so I could stop flinging myself around. I wanted to stay home with true love and plenty of time to read. What is seeking a fling when you\u2019re in a committed relationship if not the need to feed your ego with fresh meat?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI asked Howard if he minded that I sometimes slept with my ex-boyfriend, a spiky-haired, green-eyed guitarist.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier if we both want to spend time with old lovers.\u201d\n\nBut my ex-boyfriend couldn\u2019t deal with Howard, so I ended my attempt at ex-lover polyamory.\n\nHoward called polyamory \u201cconsensual non-monogamy,\u201d meaning you could have sex with other people so long as all parties agreed. It involved a lot of mature, evolved discussion about setting parameters.\n\nI\u2019m a former lawyer. This sounded like drafting a settlement agreement. And if we couldn\u2019t agree to the terms, would Howard mope around the house moaning that I never let him do anything fun?\n\nI called polyamory \u201cexposure to disease.\u201d Even in your primary relationship you always would have to practice safe sex, because your partner was seeing other people. And it always would be emotionally dangerous because he may come to like one of those people more than he liked you. If we both loved other people, wouldn\u2019t we want to spend our time with them? It sounded like a recipe for disaster. You could fall in love with your fling.\n\nAs early as 2009, Newsweek asked whether polyamory was the next sexual revolution. But back then it wasn\u2019t on my radar because I had George. Polyamory has been classified as both a sexual orientation and a lifestyle choice. It seems some people are wired to be in simultaneous relationships and aren\u2019t jealous when their partners are too. But many of the questions on sites providing advice about polyamory are from secondary partners who are jealous of their lover\u2019s primary relationship.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m committed to someone,\u201d I said to Howard, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see other people. And I don\u2019t want to hear that you do.\u201d\n\nIn my post-George dating years, I had developed a protective shell over my heart. Allowing myself to love again would mean letting that shell crack and fall away, not maintaining it because my partner invited strangers to trample through our relationship. The whole thing seemed so avoidable. At some point, we would have to agree to become exclusive. If either of us were attracted to someone else, we would suffer our lust in silence like decent people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen there was my own weakness. If I settled for a man who slept with other people, I would be tempted to do it, too, if for no other reason than to quell my insecurity that I wasn\u2019t enough. We could both return home the next morning with smiles on our faces. But I wouldn\u2019t be smiling; I\u2019d be in pain.\n\nHoward used the word \u201cand\u201d to replace \u201cbut\u201d in conversation. He said \u201cbut\u201d indicated an either/or situation, whereas \u201cand\u201d suggested coexistence. When I first met him, I tried using \u201cand\u201d too, hoping to see more possibilities. \u201cI want to fall in love and still sleep around.\u201d \u201cI want to fall in love but still sleep around.\u201d\n\nOver time I returned to \u201cbut,\u201d seeing only a linguistic conceit.\n\nWhen I first met Howard, I had wanted to be open to a different kind of life than when I was married, one that wasn\u2019t necessarily monogamous. But that\u2019s not me. Maybe I was limiting myself by being so traditional. Or maybe I was finding myself, because years after losing George I was again open to love. I just needed to stop sleeping with my ex-boyfriend and dating men with no long-term potential.\n\n\u201cStop wasting your love energy on guys you have no future with,\u201d one of my girlfriends said, quoting her therapist. But she too was still online looking for Mr. Forever while sleeping with Mr. Temporary as a palliative.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my fling,\u201d I told Howard. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll meet someone like me and this will end.\u201d\n\nA month later I did meet someone like me, another culturally Jewish lawyer who lived in the suburbs. We even had attended the same synagogue. We agreed that making love meant that we wouldn\u2019t see other people. But neither of us wanted to see other people anyway now that we had found each other.\n\nEnding my relationship with Howard wasn\u2019t hard. It wasn\u2019t even bittersweet. It was more like walking out of a really good movie. I knew it was going to end. I could relate to the characters, but I couldn\u2019t be any of them.\n\nHoward\u2019s version of polyamory, for all of its openness, was too constrained. He\u2019d had all those years of accumulating experiences, but I\u2019d had George. And I knew that when you find love, you jump in, almost involuntarily. You don\u2019t sit on the edge negotiating how to keep your options open.", "title": "First Try the Pastrami, Then the Polyamory", "authors": ["Debbie Weiss", "Modern Love"]}

My son simply wants his younger sister\u2019s night light to go away.\n\nBut here\u2019s the monkey wrench to their plans: I do not want to be banished to the basement, the natural resting place for all things that have no place to go.\n\nSo we have come to another phase of the endless reshuffling equation: Does the space we have still work? Or is it time for an upheaval?

With most New Yorkers living in smaller apartments, children clearly double up. The same survey also found that 8 percent of households with children under 18 were considered crowded, with more than two people per bedroom. But still, if there\u2019s an alternative to sharing, you start to wonder if you should indulge it.\n\nExperts, surprisingly, say maybe not.\n\n\u201cWhen kids share a space, there is going to be conflict, but that is not something that we have to seek to avoid,\u201d said Joanna Faber, who, with Julie King, wrote \u201cHow to Talk So Little Kids Will Listen.\u201d \u201cLeaving aside all the wonderful things about sharing a room, of which I think there are a mountain, conflict is an opportunity to practice skills.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the bickering is good and so are all those late-night bedside chats.

You made a difference. You should be proud.\u201d\n\nOutside of Tallahassee, the law might not look that groundbreaking: It does not go as far as laws enacted by other more Democratic-leaning states after deadly shootings. Connecticut expanded a ban on assault weapons, prohibited the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines and imposed stricter background checks on gun purchases after 20 children and six educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in 2012. Colorado required background checks for private gun sales and limited magazines after 12 people were killed at a movie theater in 2012.\n\nBut this is Florida, a laboratory for the N.R.A. and a state that has become recognized for its consistent efforts under legislative Republican control since 1996 to expand gun rights. For example, residents only have to comply with a simple protocol to obtain permits to carry concealed weapons. And Florida has embraced \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d laws that protect the use of deadly force in public.\n\nThat such a gun-friendly state adopted any firearm restrictions represents a sea change, even more so as the restrictions were drafted and approved in a matter of three weeks, after a bipartisan vote and the signature of a Republican governor likely to be on the ballot later this year as a Senate candidate.\n\n\u201cIf you would have had this conversation with me before session, I would\u2019ve said it\u2019s just not going to happen,\u201d said Senator Ren\u00e9 Garc\u00eda, a moderate Republican from the Miami area who has served 16 years in the Legislature. \u201cNot only did we get this bill passed, but the fact that we had debate on these amendments on the floor was huge. I don\u2019t remember having these debates on the floor ever before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe N.R.A. has had to contend with other states also considering action since the Parkland shooting. In Illinois, lawmakers passed a bill last week that would require gun dealers to be licensed by the state, but it was not clear whether the Republican governor would sign it into law. In Vermont, lawmakers advanced legislation that would raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21 and allow for judges to seize guns from people deemed dangerous.\n\nElsewhere, legislators took steps toward expanding the legal use of firearms. In Mississippi, state senators approved a bill on Wednesday that would allow trained school employees to carry concealed weapons. And in Missouri, a House committee last week advanced a bill that would allow people with concealed-carry permits to have a weapon in so-called gun-free zones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The governor mentioned both crimes on Friday.\n\nLawmakers like Representative Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat from Orlando, voted against the bill because it did not include a ban on assault weapons or other broad measures sought by survivors of all the shootings.\n\n\u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t deal with the real problem at all: The problem is guns,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other side of the debate, lawmakers from the most conservative rural districts and Republicans seeking statewide office in contested primaries opposed the new law, saying it trampled on Second Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine that Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime and then, as a result, we tell potentially a 20-year-old single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to protect herself,\u201d Representative Jay Fant of Jacksonville, a Republican running for attorney general, said on the House floor.\n\nMr. Scott can afford to break with the gun lobby now because he is unlikely to face a Republican primary in his expected Senate campaign against Bill Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, in the midterms in November. In signing the bill, Mr. Scott offered a glimpse at how he might use the legislation in the coming campaign to paint Congress as ineffective.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the federal government, nothing seems to happen there,\u201d Mr. Scott said, noting he was enacting legislation just three weeks and two days after the rampage. \u201cThat\u2019s how government should work.\u201d\n\nMr. Scott remains opposed to the provision in the law that the N.R.A. has been seeking for years: Allowing for certain teachers and school staff to be armed on campus. But he called the legislation a compromise and noted that the so-called guardian program is voluntary: \u201cIf counties do not want to do this, they simply can say no.\u201d The state\u2019s largest and most urban school districts are expected to do just that.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Tallahassee, the families who joined Mr. Scott chose Tony Montalto, whose daughter, Gina, was killed in the Parkland shooting, to deliver a statement calling the legislation \u201can important first step to enhance the safety of our schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to preventing future acts of horrific school violence, this is the beginning of the journey,\u201d Mr. Montalto said. \u201cWe have paid a terrible price for this progress.\u201d\n\nRebecca Schneid, 16, the editor of The Eagle Eye, the Stoneman Douglas High student newspaper, also applauded the bill, even while admitting it was \u201cnot perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never really expected to get something done so fast,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been calling them out, and that really scared them.

{"date": "2018-03-08 00:00:00", "text": "\u2022 Ban bump stocks. Bump stocks are devices that can be attached to rifles to enable them to fire faster, and they will no longer be legal in Florida if the bill is signed. (You can learn more about them here.) They came to public attention in October, after a gunman in Las Vegas used them to kill 58 people and wound hundreds; with the devices, his semiautomatic weapons were able to fire almost as fast as fully automatic machine guns. After that massacre, the N.R.A. said it supported a national ban on bump stocks, an extremely rare gun control endorsement by the group. But the proposal languished in Congress, and while President Trump told the Justice Department last month to issue new regulations, thus far it has not.\n\n\u2022 Arm school employees. Perhaps the most controversial provision of the bill is one that would allow superintendents and sheriffs to arm school personnel \u2014 a measure not requested by the Parkland students but long desired by the N.R.A., which argues that gun-free zones prevent people from defending themselves in an attack. Specifically, the bill would create a $67 million \u201cmarshal\u201d program under which certain employees \u2014 including counselors, coaches and librarians, but not full-time classroom teachers \u2014 could be trained and armed. (The program would be voluntary.) Under an amendment successfully proposed by State Senator Randolph Bracy, a Democrat, these employees would first have to undergo 12 hours of diversity training.\n\n\u2022 Fund school security. The bill allocates millions of dollars to make buildings more secure and to hire more school-based police officers. However, when the Parkland shooting happened, an armed school resource officer was present, standing by the door to the building, and did not enter. (The officer, Scot Peterson, resigned from the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office after his actions were called into question; Sheriff Scott Israel said at a news conference last month that he should have gone into the building and confronted the gunman. Mr. Peterson later said he acted the way he did because he thought the gunfire was coming from outside.)\n\n\u2022 Expand mental health services and regulations. Florida school districts would receive state funding to provide mental health care to students. Additionally, the bill would allow the police to temporarily confiscate guns from anyone subject to involuntary psychiatric evaluation under Florida\u2019s Baker Act. It would also prohibit gun sales to Floridians who were committed to mental institutions or deemed mentally incompetent by a judge, and would allow the police \u2014 with judicial approval \u2014 to bar a person deemed dangerous from owning guns for up to a year.\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t do\n\n\u2022 Ban assault weapons. One of the biggest demands of the Parkland students \u2014 as well as many lawmakers, including some Republicans generally sympathetic to the N.R.A. \u2014 was a ban on assault weapons. The term is ambiguous and would have needed to be defined in any such legislation; a federal ban that was in place from 1994 to 2004 applied to semiautomatic weapons with two or more of a list of specific features (for example, a telescoping stock and a pistol grip). The wounds caused by these weapons can be far more devastating than a handgun injury, and in polls, majorities support banning them.", "title": "Florida Gun Bill: What\u2019s in It, and What Isn\u2019t", "authors": []}

The bipartisan vote came three weeks after a gunman killed 17 people in a rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\nThe legislation, which passed the State Senate on Monday and now heads to the governor, would raise the minimum age to purchase any firearm to 21 from 18; impose a three-day waiting period on gun purchases; fund school police officers and mental health counselors; and allow local school districts and sheriffs to arm certain school personnel. It would also ban so-called bump stocks, which make guns fire faster, and give law enforcement more power to commit people deemed a threat.\n\nWhile the gun bill was the first to pass in the state in years, it fell short of the demands of many of the students and educators who have in recent weeks led a national call for stronger firearm restrictions.\n\n(Read our article about exactly what\u2019s in the bill, and what\u2019s not, here.)\n\nThe emotional debate in the House, which lasted eight hours, culminated with powerful remarks from Representative Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High and told of attending the funerals of the dead.

I started with ESCAPE ROOM \u2014 a fun entry that was still unpublished at the time, but has appeared twice since my puzzle was accepted in August. As a computer programmer, it was natural for me to take the theme in the direction I did. Once I struck on the KEY WEST revealer I was sure it could work. Little did I know how much effort there is between settling on theme entries and completing a puzzle. I never could have succeeded without the help of an expert mentor. Huge thanks to Craig Kasper for his patience with countless revisions. Craig also deserves credit for suggesting ENTER SANDMAN and teaching me a lot about grid design and evaluating fill. My first revision of the puzzle was rejected for poor fill, but Will and Joel kindly encouraged me to try again. My second submission still had some unacceptable entries, but primarily concentrated in a single corner. Will had a colleague take a crack at fixing that corner and sent me the result. It was an improvement in every way, so thanks, unnamed colleague!

Lawyers for Mr. Cruz, who have repeatedly said that he would plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole, are not expected to contest his guilt at what is certain to be an agonizing and emotional trial. They will instead focus on proving mitigating circumstances, such as extreme mental duress, that could persuade a single juror to block a death sentence.\n\nBut in a filing in Circuit Court in Broward County, Mr. Satz cited seven aggravating factors that he said prosecutors would prove and that would make Mr. Cruz eligible for execution.

We had those magnetic ribbons for every cause known to man, and now I feel like this kind of ornamentation has gotten a lot less common on our cars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n88A: There is a beautiful pale jade color that signifies early spring and delicate Asian pottery, called \u201cceladon,\u201d but that didn\u2019t fit here. The answer that did is less satisfying, somehow; TEA GREEN seems like a gotcha to me, since \u201cgreen tea\u201d is so common in paint company palettes and the like.\n\n113A: I misentered \u201cVersion\u201d for this one word clue, \u201cDraft.\u201d It clogged up that bottom foot for a few minutes. This is one of those words with a lot of options: soldier\u2019s call up, order at a pub, annual sporting event, kind of horse, or a chilly breeze, as in this case, indicating AIR FLOW. After the last few weeks, in our area at least, this probably should have been the first definition to come to mind.\n\n122A: Another botanical reference, TANSIES are in the aster family. They\u2019re the little yellow button flowers that you see growing on the side of the road or in meadows, cute but considered a toxic menace in the United States and not grown in gardens (on purpose).\n\n5D: Who would have thought that SAMSUNG a) \u201cmeans \u2018three stars\u2019\u201d and b) is a Times crossword debut? Turns out this ol\u2019 technology giant dates back to 1938, as a company exporting produce and fish to Manchuria and Beijing. The three stars represent prosperity, status and longevity \u2014 that last attribute seems facetious, when you\u2019re talking about smartphones.\n\n33D: The answer here, TIN HATS, meaning \u201cparanoid sorts, in slang,\u201d seemed to be missing its foil. The slang term refers to people who haberdash themselves with aluminum to prevent some sort of invasive invisible waves from penetrating their skulls and scrambling up their brains. I really hope that we won\u2019t learn one day that Wi-Fi does this, don\u2019t you?\n\n44D: The term ACID TEST, meaning an irrefutable evaluation, reoccurs in the puzzle from time to time. This usage stems from old-time metallurgy, when the quality of gold was verified using the touchstone method; nowadays, I think more of Ken Kesey\u2019s parties. Those go back 50 years now too, pretty old-timey. Nostalgia!\n\n75D: We\u2019ve been seeing these SpaceX rocket liftoffs lately, and I think they do use T MINUS ZERO at the end of the countdown; T equals time in this phrase. This clue made me think of a wonderful old radio show, \u201cX Minus One,\u201d that\u2019s available now in podcast form. A quick Google search didn\u2019t elucidate what these two terms have in common, in case anyone knows.\n\nConstructor Notes\n\nThe seed for this puzzle (and its original title) was \u201cSunrise, Sunset\u201d \u2014 with the eastern theme entires featuring a rising S-U-N, and the western ones featuring a setting S-U-N. It was important to me that none of these entries \u2014 whether the across ones or the down answers containing SUN \u2014 use that letter string to mean the word \u201csun.\u201d This was a bit harder than expected! You may notice that I broke a fairly rigid crossword rule in that the theme entries are not symmetrically placed, but it would have been near impossible to do so, given that they each span several rows. I did try to put them in approximately symmetrical locations, for consistency\u2019s sake. Because the themers take up a lot of real estate in both across and down directions, filling this grid was a beast. This is the third draft I submitted, and while I wish there were a bit more room for the grid to breathe, I think it\u2019s free of dreck (REE being the only real gross entry, IMO). Phrases like SUNK COST, PROM DATES, REAL TALK, NERF WAR, and MIC DROP are fun bonus fill. I tried for way too long to get YASQUEEN at 11D (it really almost worked for a long time) but finally let it go when it came at the expense of too much bad fill. I\u2019m quite happy that my original clue on I SEE IT made it through; it feels much more in-the-language than previous methods of cluing that entry (variations of [Response to \u201cLook over there!\u201d]). In general, I like to make my puzzles contemporary and conversational, which I think I\u2019ve accomplished here. Lastly, I\u2019m honored to have a puzzle run on the Sunday of ACPT for the second time! It\u2019s a pretty cool thing to see 600+ of the most avid crossword solvers in the world digging into your puzzle.

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "Most of the disputes over football are occurring in states where football remains very popular, like Texas, Oklahoma and Ohio, places Mr. Cordell described as \u201cheavy football states.\u201d In states where football appears to be on the wane, including those in the Northeast, disputes are less common because both parents have already decided that the game is too dangerous for their child to play.\n\nOne of those football-heavy states is Pennsylvania, where Mr. Orsini, a musician and former lawyer, went to court last summer to prevent his youngest son from playing tackle football. The case will likely result in a trial.\n\nLike many fathers of his generation, Mr. Orsini, 66, was for years an enthusiastic supporter of football. He played the game in grade school and rooted for the hometown Steelers. He enrolled his sons in youth tackle football leagues when they were as young as 5 years old, including his youngest son. Mr. Orsini said he attended their practices and games, including in the years after he and his ex-wife, Janice, divorced in 2004. Their oldest son, Giuseppe, who is now 21, plays football at Case Western University in Cleveland.\n\nMr. Orsini\u2019s view of the game changed when his youngest son, 17, sustained three sports-related concussions. The first was in 2013, when he was hit in the head with a metal baseball bat while not wearing a helmet. He took a battery of tests at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and, after several weeks, was allowed to resume playing sports.\n\nThe second and third concussions were in 2015 and 2016 during football games. Orsini said that afterward, his son was sensitive to light and noise, experienced headaches and was lethargic. His son, he recalled, sat slumped at the table during meals. Again, within a few weeks, doctors cleared him to return to play. Orsini said that when he asked the doctor whether his son should stop playing football, he was told there was no medical evidence that he should cease playing.\n\n\u201cThe moment for me started when he repeatedly got diagnosed with concussions and the doctors kept telling me there was no reason for him to not keep going,\u201d Mr. Orsini said. Having worked as a plaintiff\u2019s attorney, he was alarmed. \u201cHis mother didn\u2019t question the doctors, but in my profession it is an impossibility.\u201d\n\nMr. Orsini said he was surprised that his son\u2019s doctors appeared to be sanguine about the dangers of the sport. So he began doing his own research and found, among other things, studies by researchers at Boston University that said that boys who began playing tackle football before the age of 12 had more behavioral and cognitive problems later in life than those who began playing the sport in their teenage years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Orsini said he tried unsuccessfully to discuss these findings with his ex-wife.\n\nMrs. Orsini declined to be interviewed. But her lawyer, John N. Demas, said she considered her son, now a junior in high school, mature enough to understand the risks of the game and to make up his own mind. She also felt reassured that her son\u2019s coaches were well-trained at spotting and caring for concussed players, and that doctors had declared him free of symptoms from the concussions.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, this young man loves to play football and understands the dangers, and based on the science now, his mom thinks the benefits are worth the risks,\u201d Mr. Demas said on behalf of Mrs. Orsini.\n\nMr. Demas added: \u201cWhere we are with the science of it, I don\u2019t know if there is enough evidence to say it\u2019s inherently dangerous.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMr. Demas said that the Orsinis have joint legal custody of their son, and that Mr. Orsini\u2019s attempts to block their son from playing football amounted to one parent acting unilaterally. In seeking to alter their custody agreement, Mr. Demas said, Mrs. Orsini was only trying maintain the status quo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for carte blanche,\u201d Mr. Demas said, \u201cwe\u2019re only asking for authority on this decision of whether he can play.\u201d\n\nIn late July, just before his son was to start practicing for his junior season, Mr. Orsini told his school that he did not want his son playing. He had joint legal custody, so the school complied.\n\n\u201cI cannot speak to an individual student\u2019s circumstance, but generally in custody disputes, the terms are spelled out and we follow them,\u201d said Patrick O\u2019Toole, the superintendent of the Upper St. Clair School District, about 10 miles south of Pittsburgh. \u201cIf there\u2019s a dispute, the parents tell us what to do.\u201d\n\nThe case then moved to family court. In early August, Mrs. Orsini filed an emergency request to let her son play, as he had for more than a decade. Mr. Orsini argued that while he had supported his son\u2019s right to play for years, he was now aware of new, worrying research about the safety of the game.\n\n\u201cPlaying football cannot be considered status quo when the Child has now suffered three concussions,\u201d Mr. Orsini\u2019s lawyer wrote in a court filing. Common sense dictates that \u201cthe best interest and general health welfare of the Child is protected by not permitting Child to participate in football.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe judge allowed the ban to stand. But two weeks later, Mrs. Orsini filed a petition to gain \u201csole legal custody\u201d related to \u201cthe child\u2019s participation in extracurricular activities.\u201d The judge agreed to let the boy resume playing football while she decided on whether to approve the change to the custody order.\n\nDespite a flurry of motions over the next few months, Mr. Orsini was unable to persuade the judge to stop his son from playing, and the boy completed his junior season without any concussions. The court case has strained Mr. Orsini\u2019s already contentious relationship with his ex-wife, and his sons now rarely speak with him.\n\nThe growing number of disputes over the long-term consequences of football has put family court judges in the awkward position of having to pick sides on a hotly debated issue. In most states, judges are charged with ruling in the best interests of a child\u2019s health. In the case of sports like hang gliding or rock climbing, the dangers may be self-evident.\n\nBut the science around the long-term cognitive and neurological damage caused by football is still emerging. Judges who side with parents trying to prevent their sons from playing tackle football end up endorsing the view that the sport is too risky, a stance that might be unpopular with voters who elect them. Judges who side with parents who want their son to play, on the other hand, risk being accused of not being prudent enough if the boy is injured.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had custody officers say they won\u2019t touch the issue,\u201d said Mark R. Ashton, a family law attorney at Fox Rothschild in Exton, Penn. \u201cIf a kid is seriously injured playing sports, the court gets blamed.\u201d\n\nThe Orsinis have entered a court-mandated mediation program, but the two sides are no closer. Their next mediation, which will be in front of the judge, is later this month. If neither side budges, Mr. Orsini said he is prepared to go to trial, an expensive and time-consuming process that will likely require, among other things, that the boy be deposed.\n\nHis fear, though, is that the case will drag on until November, when his son will turn 18, and Mr. Orsini will be powerless to stop him from finishing his senior season, or from playing in college.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t stop him now, he\u2019s on track to have a lot more damage done,\u201d he said.", "title": "Football\u2019s Brain Injury Crisis Lands in Family Court", "authors": ["Ken Belson"]}

The study, in JAMA, used 11-point pain and function scales to measure the effect of treatment, with higher scores indicating poorer results. This is, the authors write, the first randomized trial of opioid therapy to report long-term pain and function outcomes.\n\nAt the end of 12 months, the opioid group scored an average 3.4 on the function scale, and the nonopioid group 3.3, an insignificant difference.

Wolff, the top elected official in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio. \u201cYou\u2019ve got somebody out there, or possibly more than one person, that\u2019s obviously got a system going, and that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be changed from one town to the other.\u201d\n\nThe explosions \u2014 the fifth was at a FedEx center near San Antonio early Tuesday morning \u2014 do not destroy evidence of the bombs\u2019 origins so much as blast it into many bits and pieces. DNA and other more technical fingerprints can remain. Switches, relays and homemade circuit boards often survive. If the explosive was contained in a pipe, then the inside walls of that pipe, even in tiny fragments, will be smudged with residue from the explosive it held, experts say.\n\nWhile investigators have been tight-lipped about the details of the case, bomb experts and federal agents described an intense detective drama unfolding throughout Central Texas.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe F.B.I. confirmed Tuesday night that the two latest packages located at FedEx facilities near San Antonio and the Austin airport were connected to the earlier explosions. With six devices now tied to the case and no arrests yet, panicky residents have flooded 911 with more than 1,200 suspicious-package calls since March 12. Still, with every new bomb discovered, the evidence grows and, investigators hope, the space between the hunter and the hunted narrows ever so slightly.\n\nSpecialists from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who are working the case have honed their skills, and their eyes, for years. The A.T.F. has long run a five-day \u201cpost-blast investigator\u201d course for law enforcement around the country. Typically, once the classroom portion of the course has ended, the agency will blow up a car on a demolition range using a real car bomb, and the students will comb the range afterward for parts and pieces of the device that exploded.\n\nAt the scene of the first package explosion in Austin, a red brick house on Haverford Drive in northeast Austin where the first victim, Anthony Stephan House, 39, was killed, a large chunk of the white-painted wall next to the plywood-covered front door has been removed, probably by investigators who want to recover minuscule bomb fragments from it.\n\n\u201cThe Unabomber put \u2018FC,\u2019 which stood for Freedom Club, on his bombs, so the investigators will be looking for any signatures that could give them some investigatory leads,\u201d said Clinton R. Van Zandt, a former profiler with the F.B.I. who worked on the case. The bomber, Theodore Kaczynski, was a mathematics professor turned recluse whose crudely fashioned bombs killed three people and injured 24 others over a 17-year period beginning in 1978.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne new potential block of evidence emerged on Tuesday from the Austin bomber\u2019s use of FedEx.\n\nThe package that exploded shortly after midnight Tuesday at the FedEx center in Schertz, outside San Antonio, was shipped from the Austin area and was bound for Austin as well. Another suspicious package discovered on Tuesday also was shipped via FedEx, and it, too, contained explosive material, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBoth packages were mailed from a FedEx store in Sunset Valley, a small city within Austin, and a statement from FedEx suggested that they were sent by the same person.\n\nThe second package was turned over intact to law enforcement, marking the first time investigators will get their hands on one of the serial bomber\u2019s unexploded devices. They may also be able to get video images of the person who shipped it.\n\n\u201cWe have provided law enforcement responsible for this investigation extensive evidence related to these packages, and the individual that shipped them, collected from our advanced technology security systems,\u201d FedEx said in a statement.\n\nExplosions in Texas\n\nTuesday illustrated the shifting, fast-paced tempo of the case. Austin police called in a bomb squad at the FedEx center near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, where the unexploded package was found. The facility remained sealed off hours later as police and federal agents continued hunting for clues.\n\n\u201cWe are still investigating,\u201d Austin police spokeswoman Destiny Winston told reporters at the scene.\n\nIn the span of 18 days this month, the case has unfolded at five explosion sites in two cities, and prompted neighborhood lockdowns in Austin and operational disruptions at three FedEx facilities.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fifth was the first to have been shipped. Investigators have said the bomber had to possess some level of skill to build and transport devices without them blowing up prematurely. It appeared that the blast on Tuesday represented, for the bomber, a premature detonation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHomemade package bombs delivered to homes and offices have become surprisingly common. Since 1990, dozens of men, women and children have been wounded or killed in package bombings around the country, in explosions that were not connected to the Unabomber case. The culprit, in many of those cases, was an ex-husband, an ex-boyfriend, a stalker or a relative seeking revenge or an inheritance.\n\nThe frequency of the attacks illustrates just how easy it has become for a person with no explosives training to make and deliver a package bomb. According to A.T.F.\u2019s most recent public report on bomb incidents, there were 439 bombings in 2016, up from 400 the year before.\n\nIn January 2000, in the Boston suburb of Everett, Sandra Berfield, a 32-year-old waitress, was killed after she opened a package containing a pipe bomb that was left on her doorstep. A handyman who had stalked her for years, Steven S. Caruso, was convicted in her murder. The authorities said he used a readily available toy rocket-launcher component in his bomb. He had put her sister\u2019s return address on the package to make sure his target opened it.\n\nIn Austin, investigators may have more clues to work with than the bomb-maker might expect.\n\n\u201cA bomber often believes that the device itself is consumed in the thermal effect of the blast, and that he is giving himself distance from the criminal act,\u201d said a federal agent and explosives expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. \u201cThey think they have autonomy, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nInvestigators now are going so far as to reconstruct the bombs that exploded, using similar materials. \u201cEach one of these devices is being rebuilt to help investigators figure out what they are looking for,\u201d the federal agent explained. \u201cIt is like putting a puzzle together.\u201d\n\nEd Davis, the former Boston police chief, who has been involved in investigating several bombings including the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, said rebuilding the bombs was critical in that case.\n\n\u201cIt helps them determine the sophistication of the device and the level of expertise involved in building it,\u201d Mr. Davis said. \u201cThen it limits the number of people you are looking at. It provides a certain class of possible suspects.\u201d\n\nBomb experts and those who study serial killers said the search for clues is time-consuming and complex, but far from impossible. Some said it was clear that the Austin bomber had already built the devices in advance before launching the first attack, because the use of different triggering mechanisms takes time. Others said the suspect or suspects had shown a major vulnerability: By dropping off the packages themselves or shipping them at FedEx, they exposed themselves or their vehicles to being captured on surveillance video or seen by witnesses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen there is the shrapnel. The first four devices that exploded in Austin contained shrapnel \u2014 small metal pieces like nails that are included in a bomb to make it wreak more havoc on people who are nearby when it goes off.\n\n\u201cShrapnel is critical to this analysis,\u201d said Mr. Van Zandt, the former F.B.I. profiler. \u201cIf investigators look at the shrapnel from all five devices and see the same kind of nails or ball bearings, for instance, that would connect the devices to the same bomb builder. Investigators could then canvass hardware stores in Austin, or all over Texas for that matter, looking for someone who bought quantities of these things.\u201d\n\nThe locations of the explosions is also significant. All of the four bombings in Austin occurred in residential neighborhoods near highways and major thoroughfares, suggesting to investigators that the suspect may be doing significant getaway planning and may not even live in Austin. Investigators have sought home security camera footage that could help solve the case.\n\nLaw enforcement officials have taken the unusual step of speaking directly to the suspect or suspects at news conferences, asking them to call 911 to talk to the police and explain the message behind the attacks. Mr. Van Zandt said that for some serial bombers, such an invitation may be hard to resist. But he added that there was another benefit to such communication between the hunters and the hunted.\n\n\u201cIf we give them an opportunity to talk, they are not bombing,\u201d he said.", "title": "For Austin Bomb Investigators, Each New Blast Offers New Clues", "authors": ["Manny Fernandez", "Serge F.

Mr. Cuomo has appeared at black churches during past budget seasons.\n\nMr. Miller, the pastor of Brown Memorial Baptist Church, said that after he hung up with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team, he sent text messages to another 30 black pastors across New York City to ask that they not reflexively acquiesce. \u201cI requested that they think carefully about hosting the governor until he becomes responsive to our concerns,\u201d Mr. Miller said.\n\nMr. Cuomo has had a complex relationship with black leadership in the state dating back to his first failed run for governor, in 2002, when he challenged H. Carl McCall, then the state comptroller who was seeking to become New York\u2019s first black governor, for the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut in recent years, black voters have provided him a bulwark of support.

Cox, chairman of the state Republican Party, had asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law. He also requested an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr.\n\nThe verdict also reinforced a contention from good-government groups that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s ethics record, despite some new measures, has been mostly a disappointment, from his disbanding of the Moreland Commission on public corruption to his aggressive use of campaign-finance loopholes.\n\nNational Republican groups weighed in, too, trying to tie Democratic congressional challengers in New York to the conviction and what they called \u201cAndrew Cuomo\u2019s record of scandal.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Cuomo, the Percoco trial was only the first this year linked to his administration. Another ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, has been charged with corruption in a case that revolves around bid-rigging in one of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s key upstate economic initiatives.\n\nThat case goes to trial in June, the same month Mr. Percoco is scheduled to be sentenced and typically around the same time the Democratic primary for governor is getting into full swing.", "title": "For Cuomo, a \u2018Personally Painful\u2019 Conviction Also Hurts Politically", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Jesse Mckinley"]}

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "Although the road to success has not always been a smooth one \u2014 there have been some legal disputes with employees \u2014 the Cherng\u2019s overall approach seems to have worked. Since 2005, the chain has more than doubled in size, with roughly 150 stores opening each year, Mr. Cherng said. And the company has had consecutive same-store-sales growth for 21 of the last 22 years.\n\nIts best-selling dish: orange chicken. This year, customers will buy an estimated 90 million pounds of the lightly sweetened fried chicken. And last year, Panda Express purchased 22 million pounds of broccoli.\n\nThe Cherngs have routinely shunned opportunities to grow even faster by franchising locations, or to reap the reward for their achievement by selling shares of their company to the public. They choose to own and operate all their restaurants with the exception of a few select locations.\n\n\u201cThe motivation of going public is really a financial play,\u201d Mr. Cherng said. \u201cMaybe you need to raise money to open more stores, or sometimes people go public because they want to have a little bit more money. We have always been able to grow anyway.\u201d\n\nThe family-owned and operated company has richly provided for the Cherngs, who have a net worth of $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe beauty of not being franchised, or not being public is you have control,\u201d said Bonnie Riggs, a restaurant industry analyst for The NPD Group\u2019s food-service division. \u201cYou have consistency. When you have a franchise operation, even though rules are put in place, the franchisees don\u2019t always play along. And if you are public, then you are constantly having to answer to Wall Street, and it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd holding on to what you\u2019ve built over decades has a psychological appeal. \u201cIt is a business, but it is also tied to their personal identity,\u201d said Rob Lachenauer, a partner and chief executive officer at BanyanGlobal Family Business Advisors in Boston, Mass. \u201cOne, you are not going to sell your identity. Two, it is hard to step away from the business because you are stepping away from who you are.\u201d\n\nMany family-owned businesses are creating a multigenerational business, Mr. Lachenauer said. \u201cThey are not a Silicon Valley start-up trying to pop something in five years and then go to the beach. That speaks to trust because of the stability of a long-term investment that most families have in their businesses. It builds loyalty with their employees.\u201d\n\nAnother upside: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a satisfied employee, you\u2019re going to provide your customers good service,\u201d Ms. Riggs said. \u201cIf you enjoy what you are doing, and you like management, and you are not a disgruntled employee, that is going to come across in spades to the consumer. In our industry, today, it is sorely lacking.\u201d\n\nThe Cherngs repay that trust to their employees by allowing them to run the individual restaurants, even if they do not have the full responsibility that a franchisee would have, and to hold prominent roles on the top management team.\n\nOne of their three daughters, Andrea, 40, is the chief marketing officer, but there are nonfamily members in the senior ranks of the company, including the general counsel and senior vice president for international development, and the senior vice president of operations and licensing.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven with their command and control approach, however, the Cherngs\u2019 have encountered some rough spots in employee relations.\n\nIn recent years, a number of lawsuits have been filed. One, for example, was on behalf of a group of general managers who claimed that their positions were wrongfully classified as exempt from overtime; a settlement was reached in that case. In another, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged that the company was treating its Latino employees differently from Asian workers at one restaurant. In California, a suit claimed cashiers and workers did not have seating while they were on duty. And last June, Panda Express settled a claim that it discriminated against workers who weren\u2019t American citizens.\n\nThe company did not comment directly on the suits.\n\nIn a statement, Ms. Cherng said, \u201cPeople are the foundation for what we do and what we believe in. We practice continuous learning to understand how we can be an employer of choice, which includes additional training and systems to reinforce our core values. Our hope is to foster a relationship of mutual trust and love with our associates.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Store associates are eligible for bonuses. General managers can make $100,000 or more with bonuses. The firm also offers a stock option program that includes dividends. The company provides subsidized health care coverage to all its employees, including part-time workers who work over 30 hours, after six months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Cherngs attribute much of their success to their core beliefs. \u201cLife is more than just for yourself,\u201d Mr. Cherng said. \u201cYou want to do well for family, to take care of other people, other causes \u2014 that is where happinesses are.\u201d\n\nThat leads to another aspect of the Cherngs\u2019 business strategy: philanthropy. The Cherngs giving over the years between all their philanthropic efforts is in excess of $83 million.\n\nPhoto\n\nThrough their giving organizations \u2014 Panda Cares, the philanthropic arm of the Panda Restaurant Group, and Panda Charitable Foundation \u2014 the Cherngs give chiefly within the areas of education, youth leadership development, and health.\n\nThe motivation for giving is part of their back story. \u201cWe are first generation immigrants here, and we were educated in the United States,\u201d Ms. Cherng said. \u201cThe giving back and paying forward is very important to us.\u201d\n\nThe Cherngs came to the United States from China in the mid-1960s to attend Baker University in Baldwin City, Kan., where they met as freshmen. Mr. Cherng then earned a master\u2019s degree in applied mathematics at the University of Missouri, and Ms. Cherng received a master\u2019s degree in computer science and a doctorate in electrical engineering.\n\nThe restaurant business, though, was in Mr. Cherng\u2019s blood. In 1973, with the help of his father, Ming-Tsai Cherng, a chef, he opened his first restaurant, The Panda Inn in Pasadena, Calif.\n\n\u201cFor me, my biggest business challenge was going from zero to one store and surviving that,\u201d Mr. Cherng said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have any money, and you aren\u2019t making any money, whether I was going to survive or not to me was the challenge.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, when the real estate developer of the Glendale Galleria, a customer of the Panda Inn, proposed opening a quick-serve location in his mall, the Cherngs leapt on the chance. And Ms. Cherng \u2014 who had worked on the software development team for organizations such as McDonnell Douglas and Comtal-3M \u2014 went to work for the family business.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018LOVE\u2019 sculpture makes me remember my personal change,\u201d Mr. Cherng said. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was probably much more task-oriented, much more demanding. As I get older, I connect with people. I am more patient.

And they were able to get a unit with a decent-sized kitchen on a high floor \u2014 not necessarily an easy thing to find in historically low-rise Queens.\n\nNames: Ryan Currie and Kailey Gonzalez Ages: 29 and 29Occupations: Commercial airline pilots for Envoy Air, a regional carrier operated by American Airlines.Rent: $1,900 a month Ms. Gonzalez: Has a father who does aircraft maintenance for UPS. \u201cSo I was always around airplanes,\u201d she said. Upon moving in, they were pleasantly surprised to discover: A trash chute in the hall and Rosie, the security robot. Moving in: Was difficult. \u201cI had to reverse park a trailer in the middle of Junction Boulevard,\u201d said Ms. Gonzalez, adding that flight skills do not necessarily translate to terrestrial parking skills. They left their cars in Phoenix: And use Uber or UberPool to get to work. There\u2019s also a bus, but it takes about 45 minutes to get to the airport.Phoenix: Is where they\u2019re getting married next year and where they\u2019d like to return eventually.

Ms. Gonzalez was slated to replace Mr. Currie at the school so he could take a job in Phoenix. \u201cBut after we met, I ended up staying for another six months,\u201d Mr. Currie said.\n\nIt\u2019s nice, both of us being in the industry,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are a lot of strained marriages \u2014 spouses don\u2019t always understand why someone can\u2019t come home when they\u2019re supposed to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother advantage, Ms. Gonzalez pointed out, is that Mr. Currie doesn\u2019t get sick of all her plane paraphernalia, like the model of a large C-17 in the middle of their coffee table or the propeller mounted on the wall above the TV.

He was a teacher at the same middle school he had attended, which I found adorable. We lived on opposite sides of Los Angeles, which made it a long-distance relationship. I saw him once a week.\n\nOur first date was brunch at a place halfway between us in Culver City. As we looked over the menu, he mentioned that he didn\u2019t know what a poached egg was.

His government also paid people to vote.\n\nA spokesman for the Sisi campaign did not respond to queries about its electoral tactics. But the ease with which Mr. Sisi has steamrollered Egypt\u2019s fractured opposition is a product of even harsher repression.\n\nMr. Sisi has outlawed the opposition Muslim Brotherhood, jailed thousands of opponents, and in the early stage of the election jailed or sidelined any candidate who might have posed a significant electoral threat. Journalists have been arrested, and a British reporter was expelled last month.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo Mr. Sisi\u2019s supporters, though, he is a bulwark of stability in a region buffeted by violent chaos and political turmoil.

In the last presidential election, in 2014, Mr. Sisi won 97 percent of the vote, although that was a time when he enjoyed broad public support.

A few days after Stanton\u2019s rejection, they dealt for one of his Miami teammates, Ozuna, who cannot be a free agent for two more seasons. Ozuna, 27, brings less sizzle than Stanton but similar production: a .312 average, 37 homers and 124 runs batted in last season.\n\nNo Heyward, no Stanton \u2014 and no David Price, either. Price, the former Cy Young Award winner, turned down the Cardinals\u2019 nine-figure offer in free agency to sign with Boston before the 2016 season. The wisdom of those deals is beside the point; the Cardinals, known for winning, kept coming in second.\n\n\u201cYou get beat up for that,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cI think in our case, we\u2019re going to continue to try. Obviously we won\u2019t bat a thousand. There\u2019s going to be people that tell us no. But we still think this is a very exciting place to play, and we still think this team\u2019s going to be very competitive.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals usually are. Only 12 major league teams had winning records last season: the 10 playoff teams, plus the Milwaukee Brewers (86-76) and the Cardinals (83-79). It was the Cardinals\u2019 10th consecutive season with a winning record, an active streak exceeded only by the Yankees, who have 25.\n\nAs usual, there is a wide gulf between the Yankees and everyone else. But, also as usual, the Cardinals are next in line. The Yankees have the most championships, with 27; the Cardinals are next, with 11. The Yankees have the longest active American League streak of drawing at least three million fans, at 19 seasons; the Cardinals have the longest N.L. streak, at 14.\n\nAnd then there is this: Only two clubs in this century have never finished low enough to gain a top-10 pick in the draft \u2014 the Yankees and the Cardinals, of course.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that other teams don\u2019t expect to win, I\u2019m not saying that at all,\u201d said reliever Jason Motte, who has returned to St. Louis after bouncing to three other teams the last three seasons. \u201cBut whether it\u2019s our first meeting, our first game or the last game we have, we\u2019re here to win.

I was happy to see it come full circle for the city of Houston and the fan base, but it didn\u2019t come without a lot of pain beforehand.\u201d\n\nEach of the Cardinals\u2019 N.L. Central rivals has had at least three consecutive losing seasons at some point in this decade. The Cardinals\u2019 last such streak ended in 1920, the year Stan Musial was born. They always \u2014 always \u2014 go for it.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine being on the opposite,\u201d said Matt Carpenter, the veteran first baseman. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the philosophy. Why do this if you don\u2019t want to win? I understand some organizations get put in situations where they think that\u2019s the best route. But for me, this game\u2019s too hard, it\u2019s too long, there\u2019s too much sacrifice to go out there and not try to win.\u201d\n\nSo that is what Mozeliak and his general manager, Michael Girsch, have tried to do. The difference now is that after decades of futility, their divisional rivals in Chicago are thriving. The Cubs won the World Series in 2016, and they continue to improve and monetize Wrigley Field, annually fielding a deep roster of young players and expensive imports.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said they were the sleeping giant in our division, because for the most part, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, we all kind of look the same in terms of our economics and the type of city we\u2019re from,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cWe\u2019re not from a major city like Chicago. Now that Chicago has sort of gotten it right, they\u2019re obviously going to be a very competitive team for a long, long time \u2014 and we know it.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs will easily outspend the Cardinals for the third year in a row, and have three players (Heyward plus starters Jon Lester and Yu Darvish) who signed as free agents for a combined $465 million. But the Cardinals are hardly poor \u2014 they are starting a 15-year cable deal worth more than $1 billion this year \u2014 and they are unconvinced that a tear-down would work, anyway.\n\nOzuna was their major winter move, but the Cardinals also took a two-year, $15.5 million gamble on Miles Mikolas, who struggled as a starter for Texas in 2014 (earned run average: 6.44) before starring in Japan. They have invested heavily in Latin America. They hired a star pitching coach, Mike Maddux, to modernize their approach on the mound, and have high hopes for Alex Reyes, Luke Weaver and Jack Flaherty \u2014 homegrown starters like their ace, Carlos Martinez, who is only 26.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Cubs are the clear division favorite. But winning 90 games, as the Cardinals did in their last championship season, seems well within reach. Stripping their roster to build for the future is never an option.\n\n\u201cThe problem with that strategy is we have 3.4 million come through our gates, and we have a lot of expectations,\u201d Mozeliak said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just a St. Louis team, we\u2019re a regional team, and based on that, we\u2019ve always had to keep our foot on the gas, because it\u2019s a demanding place for baseball.\n\n\u201cPeople always think of St. Louis as that sleepy little Midwest town, but they\u2019re passionate about the game.

Plus, dog love is simple; they instinctively understand when people are suffering.\n\nThe dog in Sigrid Nunez\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Friend,\u201d is an almost mystically grand beast named Apollo, a 180-pound Harlequin Great Dane. His size corresponds to the grief Nunez\u2019s narrator is living with as the story opens. Her much-loved friend and literary mentor has committed suicide; within about 30 pages, and reluctantly at first, the narrator is living not only with her grief for this man but with his equally bereft dog.\n\nThe dog\u2019s arrival is the central story, but the novel moves artfully through the narrator\u2019s memories and her present sorrow. Anger, too. The character best developed in this haze of grief is the one who dies before we ever meet him \u2014 and to whom the narrator directs a kind of epistolary monologue. The book, written in second person, addresses the dead friend, and sometimes his dog; the distinction is not always important. (\u201cHis hazel eyes are strikingly human,\u201d she tells her friend; \u201cthey remind me of yours.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the narrator\u2019s contemplation, we learn the mentor-author was also a thrice-married womanizer for whom sex was a creative force: \u201cYou yourself never wrote better than during those periods when you were having lots of good sex,\u201d she recalls him saying. His promiscuity is a character flaw that makes him especially vulnerable to physical decline. One day, inevitably, a mirror tells an ugly truth: The writer\u2019s aging body has lost its genius. \u201cA power has been taken away, it can never be given back again,\u201d the narrator thinks.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s evidence of a far deeper loss. The gulf between the friend\u2019s worldview, particularly his devotion to writing, and that of his students has grown wide; young writers are hostile to his values. The students find the whole idea of the writer as a gifted truth-teller \u2014 as a kind of god \u2014 contemptible. They sneer at the idea of art as a high calling with the same disdain they have for men who call female students \u201cdear.\u201d", "title": "For the Love of a Dog", "authors": ["Lori Soderlind", "Sigrid Nunez"]}
{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "In the books, the first of which was published in 1972, George (often wearing a fedora) and Martha (rose behind a tiny hippo-ear) are great friends \u2014 such great friends that there are no other characters in their world aside from silent, supporting players like the crocodile bookseller, the hippopotamus dentist. They value each other and they value their friendship. In the middle of several stories, one or the other remarks on the other\u2019s kindness and the other says: That\u2019s what friends are for. The stories don\u2019t usually end on that note. They end with someone getting, briefly, the upper hand. They end with someone having learned a concrete lesson (like: Don\u2019t snoop! Don\u2019t be selfish!). They end with Martha scaring the bejesus out of George (who had it coming). They end with George sharing his cookies. They end with the two of them telling stories at dusk, having banished loneliness and its irritating expression, fidgeting while your friend reads.\n\nPhoto\n\nGeorge and Martha are truly intimate: They see each other and love each other, still. George is softly kindhearted and a little slow on the uptake (he tends to be outsmarted by Martha). No one could be more encouraging or more supportive, except when he goofs and accidentally punctures your self-confidence while you\u2019re trying to walk on a tightrope. He is filled with joie de vivre and guilelessness (which doesn\u2019t necessarily mean dopey, even though he is that, too) which balance his faults: snoopiness, voyeurism and an inclination toward pranks. Martha is clever. She is a diva, a dirty fighter, a fury when provoked and a surprisingly good sport. (Martha, I see now, certainly could have been modeled on the actual Elizabeth Taylor.)\n\nHere\u2019s all I know about James Marshall, and it\u2019s not for lack of trying: He was born in San Antonio, where his father worked for the railroad and had a dance band. He hated Texas. He studied to play the viola and intended to have a musical career. Following conservatory training in New England, he suffered nerve damage in his hand and his musical career ended. He went back to Texas for a while and later taught Spanish in a Catholic school near Boston after college.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his adult life, Marshall divided his time between an apartment in Manhattan and a home in Connecticut. He died in October 1992 at 50, of causes unknown to me and difficult to discern.\n\n\u201cThe Collected Stories of George and Martha: Two Best Friends\u201d is all 35 George and Martha stories. I would recommend buying the book, with its glorious bright yellow-with-pink-flowers cover, and enjoying Sendak\u2019s foreword. I would display it right where guests would see it even before they take off their coats. And I would hope that their exposure to George and Martha would act as lemon juice on scurvy, derailing some of the more predictable and dispiriting dinner party conversations of 2018.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cGEORGE AND MARTHA\u201d: A STARTER KIT\n\nGeorge and Martha: Five Stories About Two Great Friends. In a consistently wonderful debut collection, the first story stands out. \u201cSplit Pea Soup\u201d introduces us to the friendship, to George\u2019s wish to never hurt Martha\u2019s feelings, to Martha\u2019s passion for making (but not eating) split pea soup and to George\u2019s gorgeous pink loafers, which make their first appearance. (I think they are suede. They might be velvet. Scholars will have to weigh in.) The absurd and the warmhearted go hand in hand, just like you know who.\n\nGeorge and Martha: One Fine Day. Of these five stories, I love the one-two punch of \u201cThe Big Scare\u201d and \u201cThe Amusement Park\u201d which capitalize on the reader\u2019s love-hate of suspense, the unutterable delight of seeing George in the shower, hiding behind the midcentury daisy-bedecked shower curtain and an ending in which, this time, all is understood and all is forgiven.\n\nGeorge and Martha: Tons of Fun. These five stories balance the sweet and the ridiculous, the sharp and the tender, like all of these books. My favorite story in this collection is \u201cThe Misunderstanding,\u201d in which we get to see an insulted Martha (ignored by George, who wished to work on his headstand) soothing her hurt feelings by playing the saxophone in bed (sheet music by Bach nearby). She has such a good time, she doesn\u2019t answer her phone and George worries and concludes that his friend is really mad \u2014 but she\u2019s not. She had cheered herself up and forgotten her hurt feelings. An ode to friendship and an acknowledgment that other people are a mystery.\n\nGeorge and Martha: Back in Town. My favorite of a fab five? \u201cThe Box.\u201d Will Martha give in to her curiosity? Will she be punished for it? This is as good as Henry James\u2019s novel \u201cThe Wings of the Dove\u201d but much shorter and much funnier.", "title": "For the Love of \u2018George and Martha\u2019", "authors": ["Amy Bloom", "The Enthusiast"]}

Last year, Ford built more than one million F-Series trucks, and United States sales topped 896,000 \u2014 both the highest totals since 2005.

We forgot that the revolution worked in the opposite direction as well: that for every Google executive fighting for political liberalization in Cairo, there might also be an alienated young Islamist in the West learning how to build a bomb by reading Inspire, Al Qaeda\u2019s slick online magazine.\n\nKaplan never loses sight of this fluidity: \u201cThe smaller the world actually becomes because of the advance of technology,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe more permeable, complicated and overwhelming it seems, with its numberless, seemingly intractable crises that are all entwined.\u201d\n\nThat is the world\u2019s reality \u2014 crooked, unexpected, ironic and often tragic \u2014 and it leads Kaplan to his capital-R Realist foreign-policy inclinations. It\u2019s a subject he explores in chapter-length profiles of Henry Kissinger, Huntington and the University of Chicago\u2019s John J. Mearsheimer (whose 2001 magnum opus, \u201cThe Tragedy of Great Power Politics,\u201d was later overshadowed by his tendentious and bigoted screed, \u201cThe Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy,\u201d written with Stephen M. Walt).\n\nKaplan makes clear that, at its best, Realism provides American statesmen with a middle path between what Kissinger once called \u201cthe disastrous oscillations between overcommitment and isolation.\u201d This is what guided the Nixon administration as it sought to get out of Vietnam in a way that preserved America\u2019s reputation as a reliable ally, while also securing a balance of power (through the opening with China) that would help see the United States through the Cold War.\n\nThat Kissinger was willing to do this in ways that scandalized moralistic American liberals is more than fine by Kaplan. \u201cEnsuring a nation\u2019s survival sometimes leaves tragically little room for private morality,\u201d he argues. \u201cThe rare individuals who have recognized the necessity of violating such morality, acted accordingly and taken responsibility for their actions are among the most necessary leaders for their countries, even as they have caused great unease among generations of well-meaning intellectuals who, free of the burden of real-world bureaucratic responsibility, make choices in the abstract and treat morality as an inflexible absolute.\u201d\n\nThere is much truth in that observation: Foreign policy is not merely a subset of ethics. Yet Realism also has limits that its practitioners can fail to appreciate. If it offers a powerful caution against overdosing on the kind of idealism that led us into nation-building exercises in Vietnam and Iraq, it can also keep statesmen from grasping their opportunities. Many Realists were scandalized by Ronald Reagan\u2019s belief that the Cold War could be won. He proved to be right, in part because he understood the moral dimensions of the struggle against Communism better than they did; and in part, too, because sometimes there really is a good case for optimism.\n\nRealists can also fail to grasp the power of ideology to shape the behavior of states, often in ways that deform or disregard their own interests. Iran, for instance, has no rational reason to threaten Israel, with which it shares ancient cultural bonds and current enemies. Yet Tehran threatens Israel as a matter of theological conviction, Realpolitik be damned.

Given the government\u2019s sensitivity to that criticism, and the intense worldwide attention on the Skripal case, a thorough investigation is probably unavoidable, they say, and if Russian involvement is found, an aggressive response may be inevitable, too.\n\nThe resources and expertise involved in producing and using a nerve agent suggest the involvement of a military or intelligence agency, as in two highly publicized episodes last year: Syrian government forces used sarin gas, a nerve agent, against a rebel-held village, and the North Korean government is believed to have been behind the assassination of the half brother of the country\u2019s leader using another nerve agent, VX.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say for sure right now, but the more sophisticated and the rarer the poison, the more likely it is to come from the Russian state or elements within it,\u201d said Ben Judah, a biographer of Mr. Putin who has also researched the lives of Russian expatriates in Britain.\n\nBut the evidence of state sponsorship is not conclusive, security and political analysts said. In 1995, a religious cult killed 12 people in the Tokyo subway by releasing sarin, made by some of its adherents who were also scientists.\n\nExperts also cautioned that even when evidence points to Moscow, it is hard to determine whether the attacks were ordered by Russian oligarchs or organized crime bosses whose interests are aligned with the Putin government\u2019s, elements within Russian intelligence acting on their own, or the Kremlin itself.\n\n\u201cCertainly, a nerve agent is not something an ordinary person can get their hands on,\u201d said Vladimir Ashurkov, a Russian dissident living in Britain who is allied with the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut whether it\u2019s sanctioned by the state,\u201d he said, is still unproved. \u201cIt may have been a decision from Mr. Skripal\u2019s colleagues who he betrayed rather than from the highest circles of Russian power.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2006, a Russian court convicted Mr. Skripal, a former colonel in Russia\u2019s military intelligence, of selling secrets to the British. In 2010, he was released from prison and sent to Britain as part of an exchange of imprisoned spies.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, he and his daughter became severely ill in the quiet cathedral town of Salisbury, England. They lost consciousness and remain in critical condition.\n\nSome of the emergency workers who went to the scene also became ill, and one police officer has been hospitalized in serious condition, Mr. Rowley said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But in the past two years, his brother and his son have died in what family members have called mysterious circumstances.\n\n\u201cThis one is very hard to read,\u201d said John Lough, a Russia specialist at Chatham House. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how that guy would have represented a threat. If someone bore him a grudge, why did it take so long to deal with him? What would he have done of late to provoke it?\u201d\n\nAnother Putin critic living in Britain \u2014 Alexander Y. Perepilichny, an apparently healthy 44-year-old \u2014 went for a run in 2012 and suffered a fatal heart attack. British authorities at first ruled out foul play; only later, when an insurance company ordered new tests, was a rare plant toxin found in his system.\n\nIn 2013, Boris A. Berezovsky, a wealthy Russian and prominent Putin foe, was found dead in his home near London. The authorities said the evidence was consistent with suicide by hanging; his family disagreed and noted that Mr. Berezovsky believed he had been the target of earlier murder plots.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn some cases, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t sufficient effort made to get to the bottom of what happened,\u201d said Misha Glenny, a British journalist who has written books on Eastern Europe and global organized crime.\n\nLast year, Parliament published a 72-page report on relations with Russia. It mentioned Mr. Litvinenko\u2019s death once, briefly, and the others not at all.\n\nAnalysts cite several reasons successive British governments have reacted cautiously to Russian conduct, not least among them being money. London is a favorite place for wealthy Russians to live, buy homes and invest.\n\n\u201cThe British government does not investigate Russian money coming in, at all,\u201d Mr. Glenny said, and has not wanted rocky relations to threaten that flow.\n\nExperts say the government has shielded what it knows about some suspicious deaths to protect its intelligence methods and sources. They say that Britain, like its Western European allies, has also feared the consequences of intensified conflict with Moscow, including cyberwarfare.\n\nMr. Nixey, of Chatham House, said many government officials believed that Britain was too small to act alone against Russia, and could do things like imposing sanctions or seizing assets only in coordination with the rest of Europe or with the United States.", "title": "Former Russian Spy Poisoned by Nerve Agent, British Police Say", "authors": ["Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a"]}

It portrays the ancient court of Judea as a repressed Addams family, with goth touches, but avoids any conspicuous moralizing or whiff of Christian salvation.\n\nPhoto\n\nIf you do want salvation, you need to head to the Deutsche Oper for a rare outing of Erich Wolfgang Korngold\u2019s \u201cDas Wunder der Heliane,\u201d from 1927. The logical end point of the decadence of \u201cTristan\u201d and \u201cSalome,\u201d it travels even further down the road of chromaticism and sensationalism, with much of the sweeping drama of Korngold\u2019s later film music (\u201cAnthony Adverse,\u201d \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood\u201d).\n\nThe plot concerns a messianic Stranger who arrives and brings what the libretto euphemistically terms \u201clove\u201d to a tyrannical Ruler\u2019s oppressive land. The Ruler\u2019s wife, Heliane (the smoky-voiced soprano Sara Jakubiak), falls for the Stranger, first stripping for him and then eventually resurrecting him from the dead (the \u201cmiracle\u201d of the title) to prove her own purity.\n\nThe opera is a kitschy, exploitative sanctification of monogamy cloaked in gorgeous music, and Marc Albrecht conducted the Deutsche Oper orchestra with lush colors and outstanding sensitivity to the singers, even in the thickest passages. But the director, Christof Loy, stages this luridness with his typical restraint. Johannes Leiacker\u2019s set is a plain courtroom; the dystopia seems to have doomed everyone to identical suits and cocktail dresses.\n\nAs with Mr. Tcherniakov\u2019s \u201cTristan,\u201d Mr. Loy\u2019s austerity stands in sharp contrast to a ripe score. The eventual return of joy, love and happiness doesn\u2019t get so much as a special lighting cue. The staging is so vague as to be toothless; this opera demands a stronger interpretive hand. It is tasteful in a way the opera is not.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Komische Oper offered a tart dessert to all this richness in the form of Offenbach\u2019s operetta \u201cBlaubart,\u201d a comic take on the old tale of Duke Bluebeard and his serial marriages that parodies Wagnerian seriousness. While rarely produced, it is a signature piece for the Komische Oper, whose founder, Walter Felsenstein, directed a production that was popular in the 1960s and \u201970s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe director Stefan Herheim has produced a kind of intellectual \u201cSpamalot.\u201d The show alternates cancan dances with interpolated allegorical figures of love and death arguing about the meaning of life and theater; numerous tributes to the Felsenstein production; and an aggressively updated libretto full of topical humor at the expense of Berlin\u2019s perpetually disastrous construction projects. At its best, it\u2019s anarchic fun, but at three and a half hours it tends to drag, particularly when the music stops. (The performance is streaming on the website Operavision.)\n\nOne of the operetta\u2019s greatest assets is its heroine, Boulotte, a lusty peasant who is a welcome antidote to the eternal feminine embodied by Isolde and Heliane. In this version, she and her fellow wives haven\u2019t been killed but are in hiding. They go on a crusade for revenge against Bluebeard \u2014 singing, in the updated titles, \u201ccrush his balls\u201d \u2014 but the operetta lets Bluebeard off easy, demanding only repentance before forgiving him.\n\nI wanted a more robust treatment of gender \u2014 in 2018, especially \u2014 from a production whose staging of corruption and power is quite sharp.

But now that she is fine, everything comes crashing down.\n\nHale is as doe-eyed an appealing as ever, and the show has a perky earnestness, buoyant enough to float over the genuine agonies of cancer while still acknowledging some of the emotional fallout. I\u2019ve seen the first three episodes, and I like the show a lot.

According to Martha Kauffman, a managing director and scientist at the World Wildlife Fund, the United States has an abundance of opportunities for memorable wildlife encounters. \u201cThe U.S. is home to thousands of species of wildlife, and it\u2019s possible to see lots of these animals up close in their natural habitats,\u201d she said.\n\nWildlife tours are springing up around the country. Here are four options for this winter and spring.\n\nSandhill Cranes in Nebraska\n\nMs. Kauffman said that one of the most spectacular wildlife viewing experiences she\u2019s ever had was in March in Nebraska\u2019s Platte River valley, when more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s sandhill cranes, more than 550,000 in all, congregate in the area. They roost in the river by night and forage in the surrounding fields by day, and it\u2019s a sight to behold. The birds are on their way to Canada and Alaska, and come from Mexico, Texas and New Mexico.\n\nOne way to see the cranes is on the overnight photography tour from the Crane Trust. Visitors spend the night in a photo-video blind: a 20 foot by 8 foot plywood structure that can accommodate two people. The blind is stationed near the roosting birds on the river, and it\u2019s possible to photograph them in both the morning and evening. Prices start at $250 a blind, and tours run from March 4 to 31.

This is the same method that underlies the Air Quality-Life Index that can be explored here. These studies are based on data from China, so they don\u2019t require extrapolation from the United States or some other country with relatively low concentrations of pollution.\n\nThe results suggest that China\u2019s fight against pollution has already laid the foundation for extraordinary gains in life expectancy. Applying this method to the available data from 204 prefectures, residents nationally could expect to live 2.4 years longer on average if the declines in air pollution persisted.\n\nThe roughly 20 million residents in Beijing would live an estimated 3.3 years longer, while those in Shijiazhuang would add 5.3 years, and those in Baoding 4.5 years. Notably, my research suggests that these improvements in life expectancy would be experienced by people of all ages, not just the young and old.\n\nTo put the astounding scale and speed of China\u2019s recent progress in context, it\u2019s useful to think back to the severe pollution levels in many American cities in the 1950s and 1960s, especially in the Rust Belt.\n\nThe U.S. Clean Air Act is widely regarded as having produced large reductions in air pollution. In the four years after its 1970 enactment, American air pollution declined by 20 percent on average. But it took about a dozen years and the 1981-1982 recession for the United States to achieve the 32 percent reduction China has achieved in just four years.\n\nOf course, air pollution levels still exceed China\u2019s own standards and far surpass World Health Organization recommendations for what is considered safe. Bringing all of China into compliance with its own standards would increase average life expectancies by an additional 1.7 years (as measured in the areas where data is available). Complying with the stricter World Health Organization standards instead would yield 4.1 years.\n\nWhether Chinese citizens can expect to capture these additional improvements \u2014 and even sustain the existing gains \u2014 comes back to the balance between economic growth and environmental quality. China\u2019s early reductions in air pollution have been achieved through an engineering-style fiat that dictates specific actions, rather than relying on markets to find the least expensive methods to reduce pollution.", "title": "Four Years After Declaring War on Pollution, China Is Winning", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "The report said the program should be expanded beyond terminal illness cases and used more frequently as a low-risk way to reduce overcrowding and health care spending. The Bureau of Prisons widened the criteria to explicitly include inmates over 65 and those who are the sole possible caregiver for a family member. Then Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. promoted the changes as part of his \u201cSmart on Crime\u201d initiative to \u201cuse our limited resources to house those who pose the greatest threat.\u201d\n\nBut the bureau, which is part of the Justice Department, has yet to fully embrace those changes. Of those inmates who have applied for nonmedical reasons, 2 percent (50 cases) have been approved since 2013, according to an analysis of federal prison data. And although overall approval numbers increased slightly between 2013 and 2015, they have since fallen.\n\nAt a 2016 sentencing commission hearing, Bureau of Prisons officials said they believed the program should not be used to reduce overcrowding. And even the principal deputy assistant to Mr. Holder, Jonathan Wroblewski, said the program was not an \u201cappropriate vehicle for a broad reduction\u201d in the prison population. \u201cEvery administration has taken the position that part of our responsibility is to ensure that public safety is not undermined,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAfter the hearing, the commission released new guidelines encouraging prison officials to determine only whether inmates fit the criteria for release \u2014 that is, if they are old enough, sick or disabled enough, or if they are the sole possible caregiver for someone on the outside. Whether the prisoner poses a risk to the public should be left to a judge to decide, the commission said.\n\nMark Inch, who was appointed director of the Bureau of Prisons by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last August, has made no public statements about the program. The bureau declined to make Mr. Inch available for an interview and did not respond to emailed questions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDying in Shackles\n\nThe inmates who meet the criteria for compassionate release tend to be among the oldest and frailest in the federal prison system, whose population is getting older and more expensive. The Bureau of Prisons spent $1.3 billion on health care in fiscal year 2016. Roughly 12 percent of prisoners are 55 or older, and of those, many will spend their final years behind bars. Some are dying in shackles.\n\nWhen Andrew Schiff arrived at a medical facility for inmates to say his goodbyes, his dying 87-year-old father was unconscious and on a respirator. Yet he was cuffed to his hospital bed and under 24-hour watch by an armed guard, according to Mr. Schiff. \u201cThere\u2019s no humanity in there,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis father, Irwin Schiff, had less than two years left on his sentence for tax fraud. He had tried and failed for two years to win compassionate release.\n\nTo win approval, an inmate must get the blessing of the prison warden, and must have an acceptable home waiting. Doctors at the facility assess whether the applicant meets the medical criteria, such as being completely disabled or having fewer than 18 months to live.\n\nIf the warden signs off, the application gets passed on to the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 central office, which has its own medical director review the records. Even after the central office approves, the deputy attorney general may object. If approved, the request is passed on to a judge, who makes the ultimate decision. An analysis of federal prison data shows that it takes over six months on average for an inmate to receive an answer from the bureau. Almost 400 of the applications the bureau received between 2013 and 2017 are still awaiting a decision.\n\nPushing for Change\n\nMost state prison systems have some version of compassionate release, sometimes known as medical parole. Nationally, prisons are facing an explosion in elderly inmates, but officials can still be wary of the idea of letting them out early. Recently, a Senate committee in South Dakota turned down the prison system\u2019s request to establish a similar program, citing concern over releasing violent offenders.\n\nIn recent months, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have called on the Bureau of Prisons to speed up the federal process and grant more requests. Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, a Republican, pressed the bureau for details on how it was improving the process in a report he submitted with the 2018 appropriations bill. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Mr. Schatz of Hawaii, wrote a letter last August saying they were \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the bureau was failing to carry out its duties under the program.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legislative Affairs issued a response in January, citing approval rates that were slightly higher than those reflected in the data provided by the Bureau of Prisons to The Marshall Project and The New York Times. The bureau did not explain this discrepancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe January letter stated that cases were most commonly denied because inmates did not meet the criteria or lacked a stable place to live if they were released. But in 2016, officials turned down one of the oldest federal prisoners, 94-year-old Carlos Tapia-Ponce, on the grounds that his crime, a role in a large-scale cocaine trafficking operation, was too serious. He died the following month.\n\nTommy Leftwich died in prison last September. He had been serving 12 years for making meth when he was diagnosed with advanced liver cancer. The bureau said in October 2016 that his early release would \u201cminimize the severity of his offense and pose a risk to the community,\u201d noting a history of drug offenses and impaired driving.\n\nWayne \u201cAkbar\u201d Pray, 69, who has served nearly 30 years of a life sentence for running a New Jersey cocaine operation in the 1980s, first applied for compassionate release under the elderly inmate provision in 2013. His supporters included his warden, the current and former mayors of Newark, the local N.A.A.C.P., and several former members of Newark law enforcement.\n\nIn January, the bureau denied his request, pointing to the severity of his crime and his conduct in prison.\n\nAccording to his disciplinary history, Mr. Pray\u2019s last violation was 20 years ago, for \u201cimproperly storing property and failure to follow sanitation procedures.\u201d", "title": "Frail, Old and Dying, but Their Only Way Out of Prison Is a Coffin", "authors": ["Christie Thompson"]}

The group\u2019s members are compromised figures whose blind spots are often akin to Francis\u2019s own. But it is a significant step that such a body exists at all.\n\nThe 2015 synod on marriage and the family, judged a debacle by many, is better understood as an instance of soft power in action. By calling the synod, Francis signaled that the issues surrounding Catholic teaching on marriage are not closed to further Vatican discussion \u2014 in sharp contrast to the \u201cRome has spoken\u201d approach of his predecessors. Then Francis set out to point the synod discussions in a progressive direction on the issue of whether divorced-and-remarried Catholics in certain countries may receive communion at Mass. Traditionalists accused Francis of flirting with heresy.\n\nOf necessity, the process was unruly. But discussions were had, and cardinals who opposed Francis were heard \u2014 because Francis let them be heard. He gave a closing speech thick with exasperation, replaced some resistant curial officials and demoted the hostile American Cardinal Raymond Burke \u2014 but he set aside the most far-reaching proposals about marriage and family for a future time, meanwhile keeping the discussion open.\n\nFrancis has acted on his conviction that Catholic faith is less about the use of power to shape the social order \u2014 the stuff of present strongmen and past popes \u2014 than about straightforward efforts of kindness and generosity.\n\nWhile John Paul forged a relationship with Opus Dei \u2014 the strict and secretive movement with roots in the postwar Spain of Francisco Franco \u2014 Francis is at ease with the Community of Sant\u2019Egidio, founded in Rome during the student uprisings of 1968 and now present in 70 countries, working with the poor, migrants, the elderly and people with AIDS. With its members, Francis has acted like a 21st-century Christian who happens to be pope: washing the feet of Muslim men and women on Holy Thursday, airlifting Syrians out of the Lesbos refugee camp on the papal plane and instituting a shelter for homeless people inside the Vatican.\n\nFrancis could serve as pope for another year, or five or 10. The test of his soft power in the coming years will be its encounter with hard power. Will he issue an encyclical on migration and the demonizing of the immigrant \u201cother\u201d? As he seeks openings for the church in seething Russia and rising China, will he address those countries\u2019 human rights violations, opposing authoritarianism with the authority of the Gospel? Possibly \u2014 but not certainly. Traditionalists in the Vatican are insisting that Francis would do better not to engage with intransigent leaders and intractable problems at all. And Francis\u2019s record is frankly poor in some areas. On priestly sexual abuse, for example, he has acted like a highhanded cleric of old instead of taking firm, clear action.\n\nSymbolically, the papacy is meant to be a \u201ccontrast structure\u201d to worldly forms of authority. Too often, it has been such a structure in the wrong ways: crabbed, self-protecting, aloof and denunciatory. Five years into his pontificate, Francis is no small-d democrat, no faultless leader \u2014 and no perfect pope. And yet in this pope, our upside-down age has a leader whose approach and example stand as reminders of what the sensitive exercise of power can look like.", "title": "Opinion | Francis, the Anti-Strongman", "authors": []}

And despite the name he suggested, the restaurant served what he called \u201cordinary K-Town food\u201d like the bibimbap found all over West 32nd Street. Now, a new group runs the hotel, and he was approached again. \u201cThey asked if I believed in fate,\u201d said the veteran chef, who is 47. \u201cAnd they gave me a chance to do my brainchild, my dream.\u201d His menu features French techniques with Korean ingredients, reflecting his background and his years in the kitchens of chefs like Wayne Nish, Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Laurent Tourondel. His kimchi bouillabaisse is based on a South Korean fish stew, and his Korean beef bourguignon is similar to the long, slow French braise. Cod comes crusted with fermented black beans, and several dishes are fueled with his homemade kimchi. The spacious dining room is centered on the bar and has a profusion of greenery.

And there was no indication, he said, \u201cthat they crossed paths at any time.\u201d\n\nHe thought that Mr. Conditt had chosen the neighborhood randomly. He noted that it had few security cameras and was close to two major freeways, allowing an intruder to \u201cvery quickly\u201d enter the neighborhood, commit an act of destruction and then flee, he said. \u201cThey could be up to 60 miles per hour in two minutes,\u201d Mr. Napp said.\n\nIn East Austin Saturday, Jesse E.

They cite the breadth of his delegate support in Bridgeport, a gritty coastal city of 150,000 where he has earned praise for attracting development, stabilizing finances and bolstering the police.\n\nEven if Mr. Ganim does not win the party\u2019s nomination, which requires more than 50 percent of the delegate vote, he could garner the 15 percent needed for a spot on the primary ballot. Failing that, he would have to obtain thousands of petition signatures, something he pledges to do.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are saying, \u2018Holy cow, this can\u2019t happen,\u2019 \u201d said Peter Spain, a Democratic member of Bridgeport\u2019s City Council and a longtime critic of Mr. Ganim. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong for someone who totally betrayed the public trust to come back and shrug it off and act like the people of Bridgeport forgave him.\u201d\n\nMany in Bridgeport did forgive him, however.

The value of Bridgeport\u2019s taxable property had fallen by a staggering $1 billion, to $6 billion. That \u2014 coupled with a $20 million budget deficit left by the previous administration \u2014 prompted the city to raise the effective tax rate on properties by nearly 29 percent.\n\nAs he has traveled the state in recent months, Mr. Ganim said he found that residents do not necessarily share his critics\u2019 view that his message only plays in the state\u2019s urban centers. \u201cThey have a viewpoint that my candidacy may sell in Bridgeport, but it won\u2019t in Mayberry,\u201d he said, referring to the 1960s sitcom \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Ganim said he has been welcomed by many in the state\u2019s more affluent sections, noting that he, too, is a product of the suburbs, hailing from a well-to-do family that moved to Easton from Bridgeport when he was a young teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m an alien to the suburbs, and my children live there,\u201d said Mr. Ganim, who is divorced.\n\nIn a field of candidates short on household names, Mr. Ganim\u2019s name recognition could, in some strange way, actually help him.

His wife, Christine, is a photographer who had volunteered for the Petit Family Foundation. The couple have a young son, also named William. The foundation has raised more than $2.2 million to address chronic illness and violence and to encourage women in the sciences. (Before her death, his 17-year-old daughter, Hayley, was headed to Dartmouth, his alma mater, and planned to be a doctor.)\n\nMr. Petit gave up his diabetes practice immediately after the killings to focus on the foundation. But he has deployed his medical expertise in the legislature, where he serves on the public health committee. At a recent \u201cpizza and politics\u201d event for constituents, he sounded as much the doctor as the politician when asked about legalizing marijuana.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAt the moment, given the data, it\u2019s hard for me to be in favor of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s good data that shows that when younger people, and even adults, use marijuana on a regular basis, there are long-lasting impacts on I.Q., decision making and executive function.\u201d\n\nQuiet and low-key, Mr. Petit is not the first victim of a horrific tragedy to enter politics in the New York region. In the 1990s, Carolyn McCarthy won a seat in Congress after her husband was among six passengers killed when a mentally ill man opened fire on a Long Island commuter train. Ms. McCarthy became a tenacious advocate for gun control in Congress.\n\nMr. Petit declined to be interviewed for this article; his office said that Mr. Petit wanted \u201cto decrease his personal publicity, choosing instead to focus on his family and legislative work.\u201d\n\nFriends and colleagues said that it made sense that Mr. Petit would seek a life in public service, pointing to his family\u2019s longstanding involvement in politics in Plainville, where he grew up. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he entered politics at all,\u201d said Ms. Tompkins, noting that both Mr. Petit\u2019s father and sister served on the town council. \u201cThe Petit family is a big deal in Plainville.\u201d\n\nEvery year since the home invasion, Bob Heslin, a former high school classmate of Mr. Petit\u2019s, and Mr. Heslin\u2019s brother, Gary, have organized a road race to benefit the foundation. In the early years turnout was especially large, and Mr. Petit found himself speaking to crowds of up to 3,000 people. As Mr. Heslin sees it, Mr. Petit needed a new calling; politics was a natural outgrowth of his foundation work and criminal-justice advocacy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Through the court process, I think he realized that he could be effective and have a positive influence on the politics here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Petit\u2019s colleagues said that while the tragedy was certainly a factor in his public service, he has balanced his own history with broader objectives. He has backed legislation that would impose tougher penalties on career criminals, but also pressed for fiscal restraint, joining a bipartisan effort to impose caps on state spending.\n\nThere was a time, according to interviews Mr. Petit has given, when he seemed doomed to endlessly replay his family\u2019s suffering. He himself was beaten with a baseball bat and lost several pints of blood, managing to escape moments before the house went up in flames.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the early months of the foundation\u2019s existence, Mr. Petit struggled to make it through meetings without crying. He attended every day of each of the two trials, fighting off nausea as he neared the courthouse. He considered suicide.\n\nA former neighbor in Cheshire, Bob Picozzi, remembers emailing Mr. Petit at Christmas, five months after the attack. \u201cHe said, \u2018I am putting on my best face, but I wish we could just cancel it this year,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview with the Hartford Courant last summer, Mr. Petit credited his gradual healing to family and friends. \u201cIf you suffered a significant loss, significant injury \u2014 psychological, physical \u2014 it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly wasn\u2019t jumping out of bed in 2007 and 2008. I had a vast circle of support, and I realize that a lot of people don\u2019t have the support that I had.\u201d\n\nMr. Petit considered running for Congress in 2014, but chose to spend more time with his new wife and baby, friends said. In early 2016, Helen Bergenty, then the Plainville town Republican chairwoman, telephoned him in Florida where he was vacationing to urge him to run for the State Legislature. \u201cI said, \u2018You need to get some experience in Hartford before you run for governor,\u2019\u201d Ms. Bergenty recalled.\n\nDuring the campaign against Betty Boukus, an 11-term Democrat, Mr. Petit did his best to focus on the issues. Right before the election, however, a labor-financed political action committee unveiled an advertisement trying to tie Mr. Petit to Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cattack on women and families.\u201d Amid denunciations from Republicans and Democrats, the union official behind the ad resigned.\n\nIn his first year in office, Mr. Petit has attended Polish festivals \u2014 his sliver of the town of New Britain is heavily Polish \u2014 and learned the intricacies of bill-making. But Ms. Bergenty has not forgotten the governorship, especially in a year when the incumbent, Dannel P. Malloy, has decided not to seek re-election.\n\n\u201cHe would be a terrific governor,\u201d she said of Mr. Petit. \u201cBut he\u2019s not ready.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "Last year, on Oct. 26, the house broke the record again when it took the $17.8 million winning bid for Paul Newman\u2019s Rolex Daytona. That watch was the star lot of the New York watch department\u2019s inaugural auction. Over all, the evening took in almost $29 million in sales, said to be the highest total for a watch auction in the United States.\n\nWhile it was Mr. Bacs on the podium that evening, it was Mr. Boutros who brought the story of Mr. Newman\u2019s watch to the world\u2019s attention. The timepiece was already a legend among watch enthusiasts, but he was responsible for the marketing strategy that meant all eyes, whether they belonged to a watch geek or not, were on the sale by the time it took place.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile it\u2019s not possible to quantify the coverage the event received, the Newman sale \u201cwas the most well-attended watch auction in history,\u201d Mr. Boutros said, with almost 700 people in Phillips's Park Avenue gallery when Mr. Bacs brought down his gavel.\n\nAnd the Newman bid might seem like small beer compared with Christie\u2019s $450.3 million sale of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cSalvator Mundi\u201d in November in New York, but the Newman sale did cause a stir in the watch market and impress the value of vintage timepieces on a much broader audience, part of Phillips\u2019s overall vision. \u201cWe hope to get more people into this world, and we hope to see it thrive,\u201d Mr. Boutros said. \u201cWe want people to look through their drawers and get others to discover the world of fine watches.\u201d\n\nWilliam Massena, managing director of the online watch forum TimeZone, said Mr. Boutros\u2019s role as the auction\u2019s organizer reflected his skills. \u201cPaul combines both a passion for watchmaking and a talent for running an auction department,\u201d Mr. Massena said. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely rare combination that brought great results very fast.\u201d\n\nAfter the Newman sale, scores of people contacted Phillips about their own Daytonas, many of which had been sitting in drawers for decades. The best of them are to be featured in the Daytona Ultimatum auction, scheduled for May 12 in Geneva \u2014 a follow-up to Mr. Bacs\u2019s Daytona sale in 2013, when he headed Christie\u2019s watch department.\n\nThe timing is right for another thematic sale, Mr. Boutros said, because a Daytona remains a holy grail among collectors. \u201cThere are very passionate Daytona collectors in the world, but any watch collector wants a Daytona in their collection,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd last week Phillips announced that the sale would include a Daytona so rare that its nickname is the Unicorn. The Rolex Cosmograph Daytona Ref. 6265, Mr. Bacs said in a news release, is the only known white-gold manual-winding Daytona. The sale estimate is more than 3 million Swiss francs ($3.16 million), with the proceeds going to charity.\n\nThe Newman sale also helped lead the auction house to its latest celebrity coup: a white-gold, diamond-set Omega wristwatch given to Elvis Presley in 1961 by RCA, his record company, to commemorate his sale of 75 million records. The current owner, the nephew of the person who got the watch from Elvis in a trade, contacted Phillips after the record-setting auction.\n\nThe wristwatch, which has a sales estimate of 50,000 to 100,000 Swiss francs, will be one of the highlights at Phillips\u2019s Geneva Watch Auction: Seven, scheduled to begin the evening of May 12, after the Daytona sale ends, and continue on May 13.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother highlight is to be a unique stainless-steel timepiece by A. Lange & S\u00f6hne, the German watchmaker, called the 1815 Homage to Walter Lange in memory of its founder, who died last year at 92.\n\nWhile a timepiece that once belonged to the king of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll is guaranteed to be a high-profile crowd pleaser, whether you love watches or not, the other is an insider\u2019s watch: a steel timepiece that is appealing because the prestigious but lower-profile maker that created it does not usually use steel. (Proceeds from the Lange sale will go to Children Action, a Swiss charitable foundation.)\n\nSuch diversity is intentional, Mr. Boutros said, because Phillips wants to offer something for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to us to feature watches for all types of collectors \u2014 whether they\u2019re experienced or just starting out, technically oriented or aesthetically motivated,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The son of Egyptian immigrants to New York, he was 10 years old when he became mesmerized by the timepieces in the windows of Wempe Jewelers, on Fifth Avenue. A saleswoman invited him in and said she would show him anything he liked.\n\nHe chose an IWC Portofino pocket watch with a Moonphase dial, priced at $23,000.\n\n\u201cUnder the gleaming lights of the boutique, I saw the ticking balance wheel, gold-finished bridges and the sparkling jewels, and it was love at first sight,\u201d Mr. Boutros said, clearly recalling a childhood obsession with watches that endures today.\n\nThe collection he built with his father eventually was superseded by his studies. It was only after his father\u2019s death in 2002, when he got the safe deposit box that contained their collection, that he fell head over heels in love with watches again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMemories of being a na\u00efve young collector are why, he said, he believes in Phillips\u2019s strategy of quality over quantity and efforts to counter the counterfeiting and doctoring perils of the vintage market.\n\n\u201cWe at Phillips take this very seriously and very carefully vet every watch that comes in to us,\u201d Mr. Boutros said, noting the house rejects 70 percent to 80 percent of the watches offered to it. (He also noted that Phillips is the only house with a board of external advisers, including Jean-Claude Biver, president of the LVMH Watch Division and chief executive of TAG Heuer, and Auro Montanari, a scholar and collector, to provide their expertise.)\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a billionaire to afford our watches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to offer the entire community the opportunity to get great watches no matter the size of their bank account.\u201d", "title": "From Paul Newman\u2019s Rolex Daytona to the Elvis Omega", "authors": ["Rachel Garrahan"]}

The 2016 version directed by Timur Bekmambetov and starring Jack Huston can be viewed on demand from Amazon Prime and other platforms. My preference is the 1959 picture but all three have amazing chariot-race sequences.\n\nOther pictures in the FilmStruck package include the 1961 remake of \u201cKing of Kings,\u201d directed by Nicholas Ray, the creator of \u201cRebel Without a Cause.\u201d While Ray was, in many respects, DeMille\u2019s antithesis, his \u201cKing\u201d is not quite as idiosyncratic a vision as a curious cinephile might hope for. Still, any movie that casts Robert Ryan as John the Baptist has to be doing something right. Pier Paolo Pasolini\u2019s wonderful \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew\u201d (1964) and Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s 1977 mini-series, \u201cJesus of Nazareth,\u201d round out the package\n\nThen there are the more controversial items. Mel Gibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d from 2004, which depicts Christ\u2019s persecution and crucifixion in grueling detail and veers into horror-movie territory once Judas reckons with his betrayal, is on demand. Though the movie was subjected to a good deal of critical disapprobation, it was wildly popular. Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d (1988), adapted from a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, was condemned as blasphemous by many pundits (a good number of whom didn\u2019t bother to actually see it) and the target of protests and angry rallies. It is a sensitive, thoughtful, but hardly staid consideration of the dual nature of Christ and can be seen on the Criterion Channel of FilmStruck. (Mr. Scorsese\u2019s most recent film, \u201cSilence,\u201d also about the Christian faith, was considerably less provocative \u2014 it even screened at the Vatican.)\n\n\n\nMoving from sacred subject matter to profane comedy: Adam Sandler is not the only comedic Adam staking cinematic territory on Netflix. There\u2019s also Adam Devine, the sketch comedian who is a co-creator of the Comedy Central series \u201cWorkaholics,\u201d which started in 2011. Two pictures starring Mr. Devine recently had their premieres on Netflix.

Mr. Broidy, in turn, appears to have helped Mr. Nader get his photograph taken with Mr. Trump at a fund-raiser, over the unspecified objections of the Secret Service. Mr. Nader has been convicted on charges related to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors.\n\nHundreds of pages of Mr. Broidy\u2019s emails, proposals and contracts were provided to The Times by an anonymous group critical of Mr. Broidy\u2019s advocacy of American foreign policies in the Middle East.

The Qataris dismiss this charge.\n\nThe documents reveal that Mr. Broidy, a vice chairman of the finance committee for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, arranged invitations to parties celebrating the event for foreign leaders with whom Circinus worked to sign contracts that could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Broidy in some cases presented the invitations in a manner that suggested they were linked to their countries\u2019 willingness to do business with Circinus.\n\nFor instance, Mr. Broidy invited Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime president of the Republic of Congo, to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight dinner featuring Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their wives. \u201cYour name has been submitted and approved,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso in a note on Broidy Capital Management letterhead.

Mr. Blankenship, you see, spent a year in prison on charges of conspiring to violate mine safety standards, after an inquiry into a mine collapse that killed 29 men.\n\nOne can see how these pols might be afraid they will be saddled with a convicted criminal as a Republican nominee. Mr. Blankenship has a lot of money to spend on the campaign, and is spending it, so he could beat his two mainstream opponents in the May 8 primary. In deeply conservative West Virginia, he\u2019s attacked one opponent for being a former Democrat and another for his wife\u2019s ties to Planned Parenthood. Party leaders fear that the broader electorate would be less forgiving of Mr. Blankenship and vote for the otherwise beatable Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin.\n\nIf that happens, it would be karma for the G.O.P.\n\nOne of the powerful cons that helped the party win the 2016 election was Donald Trump\u2019s promise that he would restore coal miners\u2019 jobs. Since coming to office, though, he has done little to increase employment in an increasingly mechanized industry losing the competition against cheaper natural gas.\n\nBut Mr. Trump has done a world of good for coal mine owners, like those of Massey Energy, the company Mr. Blankenship used to run, by gutting regulations on environmental protection and worker safety and health.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "In truth it\u2019s difficult, even na\u00efve, to summarize the book\u2019s organization, because as we travel deeper and deeper into these remarkable and learned sections, there is an increasing sense of the structure breaking down, of demarcations dissolving, their lack of necessity. This is due largely to the strange and beautiful way in which Raulff handles the problem of historicity and narrative. Through looping, meandering and backtracking discourse, he addresses hundreds of subjects, including philosophy, etymology, anti-Semitism, breeding, the Polish cavalry, lost sound and scent histories, theater. He unpacks 19th-century novels, paintings and monuments, as well as dozens of bleak photographs placed within the text in a manner that recalls the dreaminess of Sebald. He layers fact over myth over military anecdote over personal memory over Darwin over Napoleon over Tolstoy over Gehlen until the book resembles an oil painting of outrageous complexity, so thickly laden with paint that it would take years to scrape down to its blank canvas.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s a bold play, a kind of intellectual onslaught. Accordingly, this technique occasionally lacks elegance, so the knowledge presented can appear an aggregation of Raulff\u2019s own erudition. But this is a stingy critique; Raulff mostly succeeds and succeeds remarkably. If thinking is the ability to get from point a to a distant point b, he has within this book proved himself a remarkably nimble, creative thinker a thousand times over. He uses a flair for web-thinking to connect seemingly disparate facts into fresh epiphanies on subjects that we might otherwise find overly familiar, presenting himself less as an authority than as an embodiment of intellectual curiosity. At his best, Raulff constructs not just painterly layers of complementary information but wreaths of interconnected facts. In short order, he is capable of braiding together Degas, the thoroughbred, Cromwell, Francis Galton (Darwin\u2019s cousin), George Stubbs, anatomical theaters and Muybridge, all before securing the wreath to itself with Degas again. Every few pages, he works this magic. Along these circuitous routes, his prose takes air, floating on the sheer joy of investigation and rumination. (His stirring examination of Kafka\u2019s short story \u201cLonging to Be a Red Indian\u201d is alone worth the price of the book.)\n\nThe source of this digressive, wending approach and his unwillingness to play by the rules seems, to this reviewer at least, a resistance born of integrity. Humans are obsessive storytellers and mythmakers. Commenting on historical narratives, Raulff writes, \u201cHistory is written in the indicative mood, but lived and remembered in the optative \u2014 the grammatical mood of wishful thinking.\u201d One could even say the optative is the source of the indicative nature of normative histories. As a savvy historian, Raulff refuses to capitulate to simplistic chronological organization and instead relays events without forcing them into artificial sequence. His approach feels unusual on the page, but deeply familiar, even natural, because it mimics the discursive gymnastics of the mind rather than slavishly linear modes that attempt to organize history into overly patterned or logical systems.\n\nThe result of this technique is that Raulff\u2019s text is somehow dreamy but not sentimental; labyrinthine but not frustrating. Interestingly, it produces a portrait of pathos without being overtly elegiac, an intention he makes clear at the outset. That difficult work \u2014 the work of co-suffering \u2014 rightfully belongs to the reader and requires no didacticism or manipulation to aid it along, only the facts: eight million horses dead in World War I, 1.8 million German horses alone in World War II and then the countless dead that litter the trail of human progress, which has slaughtered animal life in impossible numbers, both impossible to tally and almost impossible to feel. But capsule portraits of the dead help unlock our stalled emotions: When Raulff recounts the historian Reinhart Koselleck\u2019s wartime experience of witnessing a horse galloping with half its head blown away, a vision of \u201cfatal despair,\u201d the reader is wrenched out of any possible complacency. The writer\u2019s mind and the reader\u2019s heart meet on the written page, and here is exactly where so much of the power of literature lies. The reader and writer both self-transcend; a seemingly private act, reading counteracts solipsism.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat may be quite obvious now is that though this book is about horses, it is just as much about thinking as a devotional act. It\u2019s a powerful display of one writer\u2019s willingness to train his mind with unusual care on our coexistence with an animal that has unduly borne both our \u201cphysical and metaphorical burdens.\u201d Our world needs more writers willing to do work of this kind, work that often produces little hope of money or fame, the reward for which must be the satisfaction of fastening together rich new connections before they are lost forever.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "In an administration filled with people with dubious ideas, limited experience and loads of ethical baggage, Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who became the top economics official in the Trump White House, was supposed to be among the sensible adults in the room. Now, he is leaving after failing repeatedly to be the stabilizing influence that the Trump administration sorely needed.\n\nMany critics of President Trump are already cheering Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure. Indeed, he has done an awful job. His chief accomplishment was helping pass a tax cut that will benefit wealthy people like himself while adding $1.5 trillion to the national debt for future generations to pay off. Mr. Cohn\u2019s other pet project \u2014 to develop a plan to rebuild American infrastructure \u2014 produced a shambolic proposal that is going nowhere in Congress. Last summer, Mr. Cohn displayed moral poverty by refusing to quit the administration while simultaneously alerting friends and the media that he was very upset when Mr. Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d after neo-Nazis and white supremacists clashed with protesters, leaving a young woman dead, in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nAnd then there is the proximate cause for his actual departure: his failure to keep President Trump from imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will hurt American allies and domestic industries that use those metals.\n\nYet, for all his flaws, Mr. Cohn most likely represents the high-water mark for economic thinking in this administration. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, another former Goldman banker, sent currency markets reeling recently when he talked flippantly about weakening the dollar. Kevin Hassett, who is the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has peddled nonsense about how the corporate tax cut will increase wages for working families when in fact most credible experts rightly predicted that it would principally benefit investors.

Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.\n\nEven the mere threat, last August, that Mr. Cohn might leave sent the financial markets tumbling. On Tuesday, Mr. Cohn\u2019s announcement rattled markets, and trading in futures pointed to a decline in the United States stock market when it opened on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Mr. Cohn said he had been pleased to work on \u201cpro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular the passage of historic tax reform.\u201d White House officials said that Mr. Cohn was leaving on cordial terms with the president and that they planned to discuss policy even after his departure.\n\nMr. Cohn\u2019s departure comes as the White House has been buffeted by turnover, uncertainty and internal divisions and as the president lashes out at the special counsel investigation that seems to be bearing down on his team.\n\nA host of top aides have been streaming out the White House door or are considering a departure. Rob Porter, the White House staff secretary and a member of the inner circle, resigned after spousal abuse allegations. Hope Hicks, the president\u2019s communications director and confidante, announced that she would leave soon. In recent days, the president has lost a speechwriter, an associate attorney general and the North Korea negotiator.\n\nOthers are perpetually seen as on the way out. John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, at one point broached resigning over the handling of Mr. Porter\u2019s case. Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, has been reported to be preparing to leave. And many officials wonder if Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, will stay now that he has lost his top-secret security clearance; the departure of Mr. Cohn further shrinks the number of allies Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have in the White House.\n\nMore than one in three top White House officials left by the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s first year and fewer than half of the 12 positions closest to the president are still occupied by the same people as when he came into office, according to a Brookings Institution study.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cohn\u2019s departure will bring the turnover number to 43 percent, according to updated figures compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas of the Brookings Institution.\n\nFor all the swings of the West Wing revolving door over the last year, Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to leave struck a different chord for people. He is among the most senior officials to resign to date.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s announcement last week that he would levy tariffs on aluminum and steel imports was the most immediate catalyst for Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure, according to people familiar with his thinking. A longtime proponent of free trade, Mr. Cohn believed the decision could jeopardize economic growth. The president, urged to consider the risks of losing Mr. Cohn by several advisers, appeared unconcerned, insisting that he could live without his economic adviser as he makes a more aggressive return to the nationalist policies that helped sweep him into office as the 2018 midterm elections approach.\n\nMr. Cohn was familiar with Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist stance on trade, and the president repeatedly asked aides, \u201cWhere are my steel tariffs?\u201d over the last eight months. Since last summer, a process for debate and information flow to the president had been in place as he made decisions. But that process has been in tatters since Mr. Porter left the White House, several aides said on Tuesday.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, people close to the president said, Mr. Cohn had harmed his own ability to negotiate by telling Mr. Kelly last week that if the tariffs went forward, he might have to resign. The president was told by Cohn critics that Mr. Cohn had made the issue about himself, as opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s policies. That led to Mr. Trump souring on Mr. Cohn by the time his resignation was submitted on Tuesday. But the president was still infuriated by Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision, according to multiple people who discussed it with the president after it was announced. In several conversations that Mr. Trump had with people on Tuesday, he denounced Mr. Cohn as a \u201cglobalist.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The president never formally offered Mr. Cohn the job, those people insisted, but Mr. Trump had discussions with him about whether he would be interested.\n\nOn Tuesday, before Mr. Cohn\u2019s announcement, Mr. Trump dismissed talk of chaos in his White House while acknowledging that he deliberately fostered a fractious atmosphere. \u201cI like conflict,\u201d he said at a news conference with the visiting prime minister of Sweden. \u201cI like having two people with different points of view. And I certainly have that. And then I make a decision. But I like watching it. I like seeing it.

They want a piece of the West Wing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPeople close to Mr. Cohn said that he had planned to stay for roughly a year, and that he had accomplished a number of things he cared about, including the $1.5 trillion tax cut.\n\nA onetime silver trader who eventually became the president of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Cohn was an unlikely addition to the administration. A lifelong Democrat known for having progressive social views, he had no political expertise and barely knew Mr. Trump. But during an unconventional job interview, Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Cohn\u2019s knowledge of economics and the markets, say people who were briefed on the discussion.\n\nAs his chief economic adviser, Mr. Cohn quickly ingratiated himself to the president. He gave blunt, practical advice, say people familiar with their interactions, and built a team of experts on issues like infrastructure and taxes. At one point, he was part of a moderate-minded coalition of staff members \u2014 including Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump, also an adviser \u2014 who pushed for the preservation of workplace rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. He also pushed Mr. Trump to remain in the Paris climate accord, a battle he ultimately lost.\n\nHe argued frequently over Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to trade, jousting most recently with the White House aide Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the harm he believed nationalist economic policies would generate.\n\nShortly after his inauguration, Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an Obama-era trade agreement with a number of Asian nations. Then, on at least three occasions last year, Mr. Cohn rebuffed Mr. Navarro\u2019s attempts to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Cohn was also part of a group of White House aides who effectively blocked the metal tariffs on several occasions.\n\nSome of Mr. Cohn\u2019s struggles on the job were painfully public. During an interview with CNBC, he once described working for Mr. Trump as a \u201cdream come true.\u201d Yet as the top economic adviser to a president who is often contradictory on matters of policy, he sometimes had to finesse Mr. Trump\u2019s errors, a role that critics regarded as damaging to Mr. Cohn\u2019s reputation.\n\nMr. Cohn\u2019s rapport with Mr. Trump has been tenuous at times.\n\nIn August, after violent nationalist protests in Charlottesville, Va., that led to a woman\u2019s death, Mr. Cohn was so troubled by the president\u2019s response that he wrote a resignation letter, according to people briefed on the document. That time, Mr. Trump persuaded him to stay. But, loath to hide his feelings on the matter, he publicly criticized his boss, saying in a Financial Times interview that the administration \u201ccan and must do better\u201d to condemn hate groups.\n\nLate last year, Mr. Navarro was placed under Mr. Cohn\u2019s supervision and asked to copy him on emails, effectively neutering his effect on policy for a time. But a tumultuous period in the White House in February resulted in Mr. Navarro\u2019s re-ascendance, and with that, his protectionist policy agenda.\n\nMr. Cohn, who officials said has not set a firm departure date, will probably take a month or so to regroup after leaving, according to someone familiar with his thinking. Possibilities he has considered for a next step, said this person, include opening up his own investment firm or, according to two people familiar with his thinking, a more senior job in the Trump administration.", "title": "Gary Cohn Says He Will Resign as Trump\u2019s Top Economic Adviser", "authors": ["Kate Kelly", "Maggie Haberman"]}

He never believed there was such a thing as a stupid question.\u201d\n\nGary Henry Lincoff was born on Oct. 3, 1942, in Pittsburgh to Leonard Lincoff, an optometrist, and the former Bette Forman. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1963 with a bachelor\u2019s in philosophy, a passion for Thoreau and an unfulfilled sense of purpose.\n\nHe left law school at George Washington University because \u201che didn\u2019t admire his professors,\u201d his wife, Irene Liberman, said. She met him in 1967, when he was doing graduate work in English literature in Pittsburgh.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn addition to Ms. Liberman, a graphic designer, Mr. Lincoff is survived by their son, Noah, and a younger brother, Bennett.\n\nThe couple moved to New York in 1968, and Mr. Lincoff set out to write a novel about a draft dodger who waits out the Vietnam War living in Central Park. In his research he got hung up on a question: What would the protagonist eat?\n\n\u201cI took six months off to learn everything there was to know about survival in the city \u2014 wild foodwise,\u201d Mr. Lincoff told The New York Times in 1978. \u201cI began to see that every tree, every weed, wasn\u2019t alike.

In 1971, the couple went on their first walk with the New York Mycological Society. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s promise not to eat anything,\u2019 and we ate nine wild mushrooms that day,\u201d Ms. Liberman recalled. Mr. Lincoff had found his calling.\n\nHe steeped himself in mushroom studies and eventually persuaded the New York Botanical Garden to let him teach despite his lack of formal credentials. In 1978, he published a book on toxic and hallucinogenic mushroom poisoning and was soon recruited to write the National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, which was published in 1981 and is in its 31st printing. He served for nine years as president of the North American Mycological Association.\n\n(Mr. Lincoff had never tried hallucinogenic mushrooms when he wrote the poisoning book, Ms. Liberman said, but when he finally did, in the 1980s, \u201cHe was delighted.\u201d At least once, he found the hallucinogen Gymnopilus junonius, known as \u201claughing gym,\u201d in his beloved Central Park. \u201cI came out of the park with a big cluster of it and I walked smack into three cops,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is it.\u2019 But they just said, \u2018You better be careful if you don\u2019t know those.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to take these back and study them.\u2019 \u201d)\n\nMr. Lincoff helped found the Telluride Mushroom Festival in 1981.

No one ever got sick, Dr. Weil said, though the pioneers discovered that one species tasted like old tires.\n\nMr. Lincoff was in demand as a tour leader and headed expeditions to more than 30 countries, on every continent except Antarctica. When he was back in New York, he served as lecture coordinator and animating presence of the New York Mycological Society.

That\u2019s the reason I work so hard \u2014 I want to be a well-rounded baseball player.\u201d\n\nSanchez, 25, made receiving and blocking baseballs the focus of his off-season workouts in his native Dominican Republic. And the Yankees have poured considerable resources into helping assure that Sanchez is not only working harder, but also working smarter this season.\n\nData from the analytics department and sports science staff have been used to tailor a new workout regimen that the Yankees hope will improve the flexibility in his hips, lower back and quadriceps, allowing Sanchez, who is 6 feet 2 inches and 230 pounds, to move better behind the plate.\n\n\u201cEverything we do as catchers starts from that stance, that setup, whether it\u2019s the receiving, the blocking, the throwing,\u201d said Jason Brown, the Yankees\u2019 new catching coach. \u201cThat\u2019s the foundation. It\u2019s more natural for smaller guys. For Gary, it\u2019s something that he\u2019s been working on.\u201d\n\nThough Sanchez earned criticism last season \u2014 and a brief benching \u2014 for lacking discipline and concentration at times, there is a more forgiving view now.\n\nOne of the first things the Yankees mention about Sanchez\u2019s work behind the plate is how difficult it is catching balls from the team\u2019s pitchers. Aroldis Chapman and Luis Severino each throw fastballs that exceed 100 miles per hour. Jordan Montgomery and Dellin Betances regularly bury curveballs in the dirt. Masahiro Tanaka owns one of baseball\u2019s most devastating split-fingered fastballs, and Sonny Gray\u2019s array of pitches dip and dart in different directions.\n\nGeneral Manager Brian Cashman cited two other factors as well. Sanchez sprained his left thumb early last season, an injury that lingered for months and that Cashman said had not been publicly disclosed. He also said Sanchez was uncomfortable with the pregame workout routine that last year\u2019s catching coach, Tony Pena, and manager, Joe Girardi, had implemented.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the second half of the season, Sanchez returned to the pregame regimen he had used in the minor leagues.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think all of it affected the ultimate outcome,\u201d Cashman said.\n\nStill, Sanchez said, his job is to catch pitches no matter how hard they are thrown or how much movement they have. He said the thumb injury had not been a significant factor, and he played down the difference in the workout routines.\n\n\u201cEverybody goes through a little slump, defensively or offensively,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s because of this routine or that injury. It\u2019s just a matter of being sharp at what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOn Wednesday, while Sanchez finished catching Gray for six innings at the minor league complex, about 20 minor league catchers were going through peculiar drills in a nearby cage. Some were catching balls from a pitching machine while squatting on a board affixed atop an exercise half ball. Another group was crab walking, while other players repeatedly hopped forward like frogs, then dropped to their knees.\n\nAlthough Sanchez has graduated to the major league camp, he has spent much of spring training doing similar exercises out of sight, in the bowels of Steinbrenner Field, with the strength and conditioning coach, Matt Krause.\n\nKrause said that Sanchez was less pliable than he had been at 18 \u2014 a natural development \u2014 and that he was tighter in his lower back and hips than most catchers. Sanchez has spent three days a week during spring training working on gaining flexibility in those areas. The program will be reduced to one day a week with fewer reps during the season.\n\nKrause said because Sanchez had gained more mobility in his hips, he should be better able to collapse his torso when he drops to his knees to block pitches, leaving the ball to drop in front of him as if it had hit a pillow rather than bouncing away as if it had smacked a brick wall.\n\nAnd to help Sanchez better handle throws to the plate, like the one he could not grasp last October, Brown short hops his last five or six throws to the catcher when they warm up before a game.\n\nAnother skill that could improve with increased flexibility is pitch framing, the art of making a borderline pitch look like a strike to an umpire \u2014 something the Yankees\u2019 analytics staff has long valued. Getting low allows catchers to make a better presentation of the pitch to the umpire.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo that end, Sanchez began dropping down to one knee late last season, mostly when no runners were on base.\n\nWhile Sanchez\u2019s pitch-framing skills were not bottom of the barrel \u2014 he was credited with saving 4.6 runs over the course of the season, ranking 21st in the majors \u2014 he was less able to steal strikes for Yankees pitchers than his backup, Austin Romine, who saved 6.5 runs in far less playing time.\n\n\u201cAny time we start losing our lower half, we\u2019re creating movement, and the umpire sees the movement and it can work against us,\u201d said J.D. Closser, the Yankees\u2019 catching coordinator.\n\nSanchez is also working on becoming a more engaged presence behind the plate. It is not just his quiet nature that he is trying to shake, but a reputation: Sanchez was twice suspended by the Yankees in the minor leagues \u2014 once for refusing to warm up a pitcher \u2014 and his body language has occasionally suggested a lack of hustle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely important to communicate energy to your pitchers,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cI\u2019ve told many of my coaches, \u2018If there are times when you see me a little slow, let me know so I can pick up the pace and so I can communicate positive body language to the pitchers.\u2019\u201d\n\nThus far, Sanchez seems to have made a favorable impression.\n\n\u201cAny of those potential perceptions, in my eyes, have been shattered,\u201d Aaron Boone, the new Yankees manager, said recently.\n\nSoon, with the Yankees\u2019 season opener less than a week away, Sanchez will have the opportunity to alter others\u2019 assessments, and ensure that the title of best catcher in baseball does not come with a catch.", "title": "Gary Sanchez Is One of Baseball\u2019s Best Catchers, but There\u2019s a Catch", "authors": ["Billy Witz"]}

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nGeoff Dyer writes books that are easy to enjoy but hard to pin down. Early on in his new volume about the photography of Garry Winogrand, he offers a characteristic bit of self-reflection. \u201cIn my notes, for reasons I can no longer fathom, I kept reminding myself that this should not be a book about photography,\u201d he writes. \u201cWell it is about photography, obviously, but I hope it\u2019s about more than photography.\u201d\n\nThis refusal to be hemmed in (not to mention the cheerful indifference to his own best-laid plans) is what makes Dyer the ideal partner for Winogrand, who hated the term \u201cstreet photography\u201d even as his name became synonymous with it. \u201cI photograph to find out what something will look like photographed,\u201d Winogrand once said. But even that (minimal) explanation puts too much emphasis on the end result, when what he seemed to love most was the process that got him there: being on the street, looking through his viewfinder and releasing the shutter. \u201cAnyone who can print can print my pictures\u201d was another thing he liked to say, and upon his death in 1984, as if to prove his point, he left behind 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt first glance, \u201cThe Street Philosophy of Garry Winogrand\u201d looks like yet another monograph on the artist\u2019s work (including 18 color photographs previously unpublished): physically imposing and visually sumptuous, with a hefty list price to match. But since this is a Dyer book too, it can\u2019t just be about the subject at hand.\n\nIn the introduction, Dyer says he was inspired by the curator John Szarkowski\u2019s 2000 book on Eug\u00e8ne Atget, in which each of 100 photographs was matched with a miniature essay revealing a pertinent bit about the artist and the changing times through which he lived. Atget, whose life straddled the 19th and 20th centuries, documented France\u2019s shift from a rural economy to an urban one. Winogrand, who was born in 1928, a year after Atget died, captured the fallout from the midcentury American moment \u2014 those few decades, from the 1950s on, when placid middle-class prosperity started to give way to something less affluent, more fragmented and harder to define.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe resulting volume is therefore enormously ambitious \u2014 though I suspect \u201cambitious\u201d is a word that makes Dyer, the author of \u201cYoga for People Who Can\u2019t Be Bothered to Do It,\u201d groan. For someone whose books contain frequent allusions to how lazy he is, Dyer is relentlessly productive; he is constantly undertaking something new, whether it\u2019s writing about a film by Andrei Tarkovsky or about life on an aircraft carrier. Even though he didn\u2019t own a camera, Dyer still embarked on \u201cThe Ongoing Moment,\u201d a 2005 book organized around common photographic obsessions: benches, barber shops, blind accordionists. For \u201cStreet Philosophy,\u201d Dyer has taken a hundred of Winogrand\u2019s photographs, arranged them \u201croughly chronologically\u201d and provided illuminating context \u2014 biographical and historical \u2014 for each.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s a certain tenuousness to Winogrand\u2019s photos; the compositions hold together, but just barely. He was conveying not the coherent myth of the American century, but its unruly shadow. Dyer\u2019s accompanying texts wear their erudition lightly. He makes ample and appreciative use of Very Serious Ideas from the likes of Erich Fromm, Marshall Berman and Richard Sennett, but it\u2019s the specifics in the pictures themselves that most excite his imagination.", "title": "Geoff Dyer Takes to the Streets With Garry Winogrand", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}

Seeing the past as unbroken progress breeds a foolish and false optimism, not the skeptical and realistic optimism that we need.\n\nImage\n\nLife expectancy indeed shows upward trends worldwide. But it is not true that the trends \u201care smooth and almost uninterrupted: Graphs look like an escalator rising at a 45-degree angle.\u201d Easterbrook mentions H.I.V./AIDS only to say that life expectancy did not \u201cdecline much during wars or health alarms such as the AIDS spread.\u201d AIDS has been responsible so far for the deaths of around 35 million people, and it brought life expectancy down in around 20 African countries, including South Africa (10 years), Botswana and Swaziland (14 years each). Temporary, true (life expectancy has recently been going up), yet there is nothing temporary about 35 million deaths. Fears of SARS and Ebola can be (and were) exaggerated, but H.I.V./AIDS should remind us that the danger from modern plagues is real enough.\n\nAs to rising living standards, again the long-term case is right, but many of those left behind in today\u2019s America have good reason to challenge Easterbrook\u2019s rosy account of contemporary middle-class prosperity. I found it difficult to accept much of what I read, and several claims are not supported by citations. One surprising assertion is that \u201crecent Census Bureau statistics show if lower taxes, higher benefits and consumer prices are taken into account, since 2000, middle-class buying power was rising at about the postwar average of about 3 percent per year.\u201d But the census publication referred to says no such thing; median family income in 2015 was lower than in 2000. The Census Bureau adjusts for prices, but for neither taxes nor benefits. The latest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office, which does so adjust, show only a modest increase in middle incomes from 2000 to 2013. I can only hope that Easterbrook did not use the formula given in the book, according to which people are better off when prices go up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Better Than It Looks\u201d makes many good arguments about inequality. It correctly emphasizes that Exhibit 1 for the Macmillan view is that 750 million people have been removed from destitution in China in 30 years, one of the greatest human achievements ever, and that this achievement is impossible to separate from rising inequality in China \u2014 that those who board private jets wearing vicuna overcoats are \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of the same phenomenon. But it is not at all persuasive to relate this to what is happening in the United States today, because ordinary people here, unlike the Chinese poor, are not doing better.", "title": "Getting Better All the Time?", "authors": []}

But the W.H.O. has put many women in the top positions, and for the first time recently, the majority of its assistant directors general are women. The gender distribution \u201cwill impact the tone around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many young women emerging into leadership in the field, and I can\u2019t wait to see what they do.\u201d\n\nOne of the greatest pleasures in her current job, she said, is working with young doctors whose paths crossed when they were students, interns and residents, and who are now leaders of emergency care programs in their respective countries. \u201cThey are really impressive,\u201d Dr. Reynolds said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to see them across the table, sent to represent national programs at meetings where I represent W.H.O.\u201d", "title": "Getting Care to Those Who Need It, and Fast", "authors": []}

The French are not the enemy; the enemy is war. At one point the Germans are trapped in the trenches that are being shelled by their own army. Those at home are preoccupied with their own shortages and privation. One of the soldiers gets a brief leave, returning to find his wife in bed with the butcher\u2019s assistant (who supplements her rations and has himself just been drafted). Hopelessly demoralized, the soldier returns to his comrades on the front and volunteers for a hazardous mission.\n\nFor an early talkie (and Pabst\u2019s first), \u201cWestfront\u201d is notably fluid. The camera is highly mobile and the director makes skillful use of long takes \u2014 although portions of the brilliantly extended, existential battle sequences are filmed with a fixed camera. \u201cWestfront\u201d is also notable for its creative sound editing, expanding space through offscreen sound, creating sound bridges using artillery fire that extends from one shot to another and even devising audio match cuts, between cries and whizzing shells.\n\nMuch of \u201cWestfront\u201d is played out in the scarred and denuded buffer zone between the trenches \u2014 filmed by Pabst in highly defined sharp focus. A meeting between two German soldiers in this cratered deathscape has been singled out as the essence of Germany\u2019s fatalistic mood, trapped between one war and another that is yet to come. Nobody in the film really gets out alive. The most gung-ho character goes mad, screaming all the way to the field hospital that has been set up in a bombed-out church.\n\nThe powerful final image has a blinded French soldier reaching out to grab the hand of the German lying next to him without realizing that he has sought comfort from a corpse. In his next film, \u201cKameradschaft\u201d (1931), also newly out from Criterion, Pabst made an even more impassioned plea for solidarity \u2014 having German rescue teams aid the trapped French miners when a coal mine collapses on the border between the two countries.\n\nThe Korean War film \u201cCease Fire\u201d (1953), recently released on disc from Kino, strove for another kind of battlefield authenticity being a sort of neorealist experiment in 3-D.", "title": "Getting Real: When War Films Went to the Trenches", "authors": []}

Now, scientists from the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles have completed an analysis \u2014 determining that the spots are not alive and not a threat to any of the tomb\u2019s illustrious attractions.\n\nThis study was part of larger, multimillion-dollar, nine-year-long collaboration between the Getty and Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Antiquities designed to assess the condition of the tomb and help prevent further deterioration.

She will probably have to answer whether she would agree to reinstate waterboarding as the president has suggested and whether she believes that torture is an effective way to extract information from terrorism suspects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t envy her trying to get through confirmation,\u201d said Robert Eatinger, the former top lawyer in the C.I.A.\u2019s Counterterrorism Center. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the first chance for senators to have someone intimately involved in the program in front of them to answer questions. I think they\u2019ll take full advantage of that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSenators who were deeply critical of the interrogation program could stand in Ms. Haspel\u2019s way. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, oversaw its investigation into the program. The resulting 2014 report found that the program was deeply flawed and those involved portrayed it as more effective than it was, misleading policymakers. The extent of Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in the program is not known; only the report\u2019s executive summary was released, and it obscured the identities of agency operatives.\n\nMs. Feinstein has remained silent on whether she would block Ms. Haspel\u2019s nomination but told reporters on Tuesday that the two women had worked together since Ms. Haspel ascended to the C.I.A.\u2019s No. 2 post in February 2017.\n\n\u201cSince my concerns were raised over the torture situation, I have met with her extensively, talked with her,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said. \u201cShe has been, I believe, a good deputy director. She seems to have the confidence of the agency, which is good.\u201d\n\nSenator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was held prisoner during the Vietnam War and tortured for five and a half years, demanded that Ms. Haspel publicly explain her role in the interrogation program.\n\n\u201cThe torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe Senate must do its job in scrutinizing the record & involvement of Gina Haspel in this disgraceful program.\u201d\n\nMs. Haspel was also embroiled in another dark episode in the C.I.A.\u2019s interrogation program.\n\nIn 2005, Jose Rodriguez, then the head of the agency\u2019s clandestine service, ordered the destruction of videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. Ms. Haspel, serving as Mr. Rodriguez\u2019s chief of staff, was a strong advocate for getting rid of the tapes, former C.I.A. officers said.\n\nYears later, when the C.I.A. wanted to name Ms. Haspel to run clandestine operations, Ms. Feinstein blocked the promotion over Ms. Haspel\u2019s role in the interrogation program and the destruction of the tapes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmy Jeffress, a national security aide to former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. who served in London for the Justice Department while Ms. Haspel was C.I.A. station chief there, defended her.\n\n\u201cShe will be criticized for her role in the interrogation program, but my experience from working with her is that she has learned from those mistakes and will be a thoughtful and conscientious leader of the C.I.A.,\u201d Ms. Jeffress said.\n\nMs. Haspel was described former agency operatives and F.B.I. agents who worked with her as apolitical, a tough intelligence professional and direct but collegial. She has successfully managed sometimes difficult relationships with foreign intelligence services and the occasional grumpy F.B.I. agent.\n\nShe has succeeded in an agency traditionally dominated by men. After joining the C.I.A. in 1985, she was assigned to the Central European Division. She spent long stretches overseas, including in Turkey and Central Asia, before ascending to station chief in New York, where she was posted when Osama bin Laden was killed and worked closely with the F.B.I. as the agencies combed through files taken from his compound.\n\nShe has held two of the top three jobs in the clandestine service and twice ran the C.I.A.\u2019s station in London, a post made all the more important by the agency\u2019s relationship with MI6, the British intelligence service.\n\nBut her role in fighting terrorism is certain to draw the most scrutiny as her confirmation hearing looms.\n\nAfter the Sept. 11 attacks, the C.I.A. launched a desperate hunt around the globe to find those responsible. In 2002, agency operatives working with Pakistani authorities captured a Qaeda suspect, Abu Zubaydah, and ferried him to the C.I.A. prison in Thailand. He was harshly interrogated and waterboarded at least 83 times in one month, sent to the brink of death, revived and questioned over and over.\n\nMs. Haspel arrived to run the prison in late October 2002, after the harsh interrogation of Mr. Zubaydah, a former senior C.I.A. official said. In mid-November, another Qaeda suspect, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri arrived. Mr. Nashiri, accused of bombing the U.S.S. Cole, was the man who was waterboarded three times.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter the prison closed in early December 2002, former officials said, Ms. Haspel returned to the Counterterrorism Center outside Washington as an operations officer.\n\nOf the many difficult jobs she has held her career, former agency officials said, running the C.I.A. and managing the president would likely prove to be the hardest.\n\nMs. Feinstein said her support would hinge on the outcome of a meeting with Ms. Haspel, who contacted Ms. Feinstein on Tuesday morning to request one. Ms. Feinstein declined to detail what she would ask and what assurances she might seek in exchange for her support of Ms. Haspel\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference,\u201d Ms. Feinstein said, \u201cbetween the second spot and the top spot.\u201d", "title": "Gina Haspel, Trump\u2019s Choice for C.I.A., Played Role in Torture Program", "authors": ["Adam Goldman"]}

As an Egyptian, I am shamefully aware that my country\u2019s government was among the most diligent.\n\nEgypt, Morocco, Jordan and Syria were among the most common destinations for rendered suspects. Ms. Haspel and others who ran the program could count on Egypt to do the dirty job the C.I.A. required. Annual reports issued by the State Department and human rights organizations have long documented the systematic use of torture by successive Egyptian governments.\n\nThat dirty job done so well by the regime of President Hosni Mubarak \u2014 who was supported by five successive United States administrations \u2014 was instrumental in providing bogus information used by President George W. Bush\u2019s administration to invade Iraq. After Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, a Libyan captured in Afghanistan, was rendered by the United States to Egypt in 2002, Egyptian interrogators beat him and subjected him to a \u201cmock burial\u201d by putting him in a cramped box for 17 hours. He fabricated information that Iraq had provided training in chemical and biological weapons to operatives of Al Qaeda. In 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell cited that information in his speech to the United Nations that made the ultimately debunked \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d case for war against Iraq.\n\nMr. Libi recanted the story after being returned to C.I.A. custody in 2004 as the war raged. He was sent back to Libya from American custody in late 2005 or early 2006 and detained there at the Abu Salim prison, where in 2009, at age 46, the former preacher who once ran a training camp for armed militants in Afghanistan apparently died of a suicide. His friends were suspicious of his cause of death.\n\nThe dozens of such \u201cghost prisoners\u201d who were in American custody overseas were just among many of the shameful examples of collusion between my country and the C.I.A.\u2019s rendition program.\n\nHow, when it has so readily relied on Egypt to take torture further than its own operatives would or could, can any American administration ever seriously hold our government accountable for its torture against us, the Egyptian people? The answer: It can\u2019t, and it doesn\u2019t. And successive Egyptian governments count on that. It is less likely to do so if Ms. Haspel, whose career is so tainted by torture, is at the helm. Furthermore, though previous United States administrations provided at least lip service to condemning torture in Egypt, President Trump has said that he believes torture \u201cabsolutely\u201d works, and on the campaign trail in 2015, he said that he would approve waterboarding \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Gina Haspel\u2019s Rise Is No Victory for Feminism", "authors": []}

He made not just the white dress she wore to win her Best Actress Oscar in 1954 (for \u201cRoman Holiday\u201d) but her wedding dress (for her second marriage, to Andrea Dotti). And so many betwixt and beyond that, in 2016, the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague had an entire retrospective devoted to his work for the actress, called \u201cTo Audrey With Love.\u201d\n\nIn the show, Ms. Hepburn was quoted as saying of the relationship: \u201cGivenchy\u2019s clothes are the only ones I feel myself in. He is more than a designer, he is a creator of personality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as good a description of the role that clothes can play in building an image as any I have ever heard.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn return, she made him synonymous with a certain kind of elegance that could be both gamin and languid, encapsulated by the idea of the little black dress. Other designers made them, but when she wore them onscreen, as she did in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d and \u201cSabrina,\u201d she amplified the effect to such an extent that it echoed not just around the world at the moment the film debuted but over time.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Mr. Givenchy introduced his perfume, L\u2019Interdit, in 1957, she was its face because he made it for her, not because she was paid.\n\nAnd that is part of why the relationship worked so well: It was so mutually beneficial not just as a friendship, but as a professional signifier. When women bought Givenchy, they were also buying into a belief in long-term investment in elegance. That is why, as Hubert\u2019s peers became known for their symbols \u2014 the pearls and camellias of Chanel; the New Look and Bar jacket of Dior \u2014 he was forever known for his muse.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe did more than dress Ms. Hepburn, of course. He dressed other famous women, including Jackie Kennedy, Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor. He was one of the first designers to create high-end ready-to-wear, and a signature scent \u2014 and to see the future coming to fashion, and sell his brand to LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 1988, when it had barely achieved conglomerate status. And he was an exacting tailor. But his relationship with Ms. Hepburn loomed over it all, so much so that you\u2019d think he might have chafed against it, though he never did.\n\nThat came later, as other designers took his place and tried to assert a new identity for the house, and celebrities (or their agents and managers) began to realize that what had once been a mind-meld of taste between designer and muse could become a significant source of supplemental income.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough other brands have hewed close to the celebrity route, stacking the front rows of their shows and their ad campaigns with famous names, many of whom are also contracted to wear their clothes during public appearances a certain amount of times a year, it\u2019s hard to think of any brand that has become so synonymous with a single artist. Indeed, in 2013 the headlines about a Givenchy perfume campaign read: \u201cAmanda Seyfried Is Givenchy\u2019s New Face, Liv Tyler Out,\u201d which pretty much says it all.\n\nThis was during the period Riccardo Tisci was creative director, which also happened to be a time Kim Kardashian was often referred to as his muse (but she also was called a \u201cmuse\u201d for Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing, and her husband, Kanye West).\n\nWhen Mr. Tisci left early last year and was replaced with Clare Waight Keller, Givenchy\u2019s first female creative director, speculation was rife that she might be her own Hepburn (due in part to her personal aesthetic and charm). But she dismissed the idea, saying what interested her most about the relationship was the connection between a man and a woman \u2014 which she recreated by combining her men\u2019s and women\u2019s shows \u2014 and that it was reductionist to stick to closely to the Hepburn idea. Thus far she has largely stayed away from any overt celebrity connection.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s impossible to recreate what Mr. Givenchy and Ms. Hepburn had. The digital world moves too fast; people\u2019s attention spans are too short; we know too much about celebrity behavior for it to have the same mystique and allure; no individual or brand wants to be so dependent on the other.

The idea was to do an archaeological deep dive through Styles sections from five, 10, even 20 years ago, and select one article each week that seemed either prescient or revealing, summarize it in a punchy manner, then use it as a yardstick to measure cultural progress or lack thereof. It\u2019s a little bit nostalgia, a little bit chest-puffery and a little bit self-flagellation.\n\nEvery week, the Styles desk churns out dozens of stories, and some merit re-examination more than others. For example, no one probably needs to look back on the Calvin Klein runway show from 1989. (Or if someone does, it isn\u2019t me.)\n\nInstead, along with my editor, Anya Strzemien, and our visual editor, Tracy Ma, we have tried to focus on those social topics where attitudes have changed the quickest. Consider gay marriage. In 1999, the idea of a legal same-sex union was still so hard to imagine that Bob Morris, the Styles columnist, wrote an article about the acute brand of alienation that some gay people felt when they were forced to attend straight weddings. \u201cDoes cynicism die with inclusion?\u201d Mr. Morris said, looking back on the article. (He married his own partner in 2008.) \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nAnd what about self-branding? Today, it seems as though every actor, athlete, politician, YouTube influencer and Starbucks barista bills himself or herself as a \u201cbrand.\u201d But it was not always so. The notion almost seemed the stuff of satire in 1997, when Alex Kuczynski documented the trend of average Joes and Janes adopting the Martha Stewart ethos and presenting themselves to the world as a \u201cbrand\u201d in order to boost their professional or even romantic standing.

Cross-border financial flows peaked in 2007 at 22 percent of world G.D.P., but were down to 6 percent in 2016, about the same as the 1996 level.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about tariffs on steel or other goods is that it\u2019s fighting the last battle, not the future one,\u201d said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey who has researched these global flows. \u201cGlobal manufacturing has already reconfigured itself. That change happened, and the horse is out of the barn. We don\u2019t think globalization is over, but it has taken a new form.\u201d\n\nThat form consists of greater connectivity and communication, which may not show up in traditional data on trade or capital flows. That includes more people using social media platforms to connect with people in other countries, companies relying on freelance labor located around the globe, and small enterprises doing business with partners around the world through the internet.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not a form of globalization that endangers factory jobs, but one that could have big consequences in other areas \u2014 leading to more competition for technologically advanced white-collar jobs, while also creating enormous new opportunities for American and Western European firms. That, in turn, helps explain why much of the trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal that the Trump administration withdrew from, focused on intellectual property rights, data security and privacy.\n\nThe M.I.T. economist David Autor and colleagues have done extensive work showing that the \u201cChina shock\u201d that ensued with that country\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization caused lasting pain to communities in the United States that competed with Chinese companies in making a range of manufactured goods.\n\nEven as those effects linger, he sees the risks involved in commerce with China as shifting elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe China shock on large-scale manufacturing and its mass employment effects, that part is largely behind us,\u201d Mr. Autor said. Now, the challenge is Chinese competition on more technologically complex products, like automobiles, airplanes or microprocessors. The manufacturing of more labor-intensive, less technologically complex products like apparel is migrating to lower-wage countries like Bangladesh and Ethiopia.", "title": "Globalization\u2019s Backlash Is Here, at Just the Wrong Time", "authors": []}

Kids don\u2019t have money and can\u2019t vote, and until now burying a few dozen a year has apparently been a price that lots of Americans were willing to pay to hold onto the props of their pathetic role-playing fantasies. But they forgot what adults always forget: that our children grow up, and remember everything, and forgive nothing.\n\nThose kids have suddenly understood how little their lives were ever worth to the people in power. And they\u2019ll soon begin to realize how efficient and endless are the mechanisms of governance intended to deflect their appeals, exhaust their energy, deplete their passion and defeat them. But anyone who has ever tried to argue with adolescents knows that in the end they will have a thousand times more energy for that fight than you and a bottomless reservoir of moral rage that you burned out long ago.\n\nLike most people in middle age, I regard young people with suspicion. The young \u2014 and the young at mind \u2014 tend to be uncompromising absolutists. They haven\u2019t yet faced life\u2019s heartless compromises and forfeitures, its countless trials by boredom and ethical Kobayashi Marus, or glumly watched themselves do everything they ever disapproved of.\n\nI am creeped out by the increasing dogmatism and intolerance of millennials on the left; I felt a generational divide open up under me last year when everyone under 40 seemed to agree that Dana Schutz\u2019s painting of Emmett Till in his coffin should be removed from the Whitney Biennial.

But that raises an interesting question for our own society: What happens to this pattern if historic Christianity decays or transforms into something else? Does a religious gender gap diminish, or does it widen? Does our emerging post-Christian or quasi-Christian model of religiosity \u2014 the therapeutic style of Oprah, the individualized mix of prayer and meditation and self-help \u2014 potentially reconcile the sexes, or push them further apart?\n\nThese Easter thoughts are occasioned, in part, by reading some of the countless think-pieces about the rise of Jordan Peterson, the Canadian psychology professor turned moral-philosophical guru for a large and grateful cohort of young men.\n\nInevitably, Peterson has been subsumed into our political debates, attacked as a fascist or hailed as an anti-P.C. warrior. But the clearest takes on his appeal so far have recognized his role as a tacitly religious figure, a would-be prophet for lost boys.\n\nIn complementary essays, Micah Meadowcroft and Scott Alexander have both described him a figure much like C. S. Lewis, the intellectual popularizer of Christianity \u2014 except, as Alexander says, where Lewis believed in the \u201cOld Religion,\u201d Peterson is \u201ca believer in the New Religion, the one where God is the force for good inside each of us, and all religions are paths to wisdom, and the Bible stories are just guides on how to live our lives.\u201d\n\nThis New Religion has many prophets already, of course; the most prominent, her Oprahness, can currently be seen playing an angelic being in the de-Christianized, New Age-ified adaptation of \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d But the example of Oprah points to an interesting truth: When you think about the New Religion\u2019s various cultural and (in the case of yoga) liturgical expressions, they generally skew female. Oprah\u2019s roadshow of spiritual gurus includes men as well as women, but the intended audience for her revivals, as for the \u201cThe Secret\u201d or \u201cEat Pray Love\u201d or the collected works of Paulo Coelho, is very obviously feminine.", "title": "Opinion | God and Men and Jordan Peterson", "authors": []}

As the first days of January passed, I never bothered to go to an A.T.M. and withdraw a wad of cash. I didn\u2019t need to.\n\nHere in New York City, as well as just about everywhere these days, it\u2019s possible to pay for nearly everything with a card or a phone.\n\nI paid for my morning coffee using the Starbucks app on my iPhone, picked up lunches with a credit card and ordered-in the occasional dinner using Seamless. One day I went to get some vegetarian tacos at Dos Toros and happily discovered that the fast casual chain was one of those restaurants that have stopped accepting cash altogether.\n\nGrocery shopping was similarly easy, our kitchen restocked using a mix of Amazon.com, Fresh Direct and trips to my local market, where I paid with a credit card. And so it went. Before I knew it, February had arrived and my wallet was still empty.\n\nPhoto\n\nI vividly remember the first time I heard someone describe a world without cash. It was 2012, and I was at an event in London, listening to Ajay Banga, the chief executive of Mastercard, extol the virtues of digital currencies and the problems with paper money.\n\nCash, he argued, enabled all sorts of bad behavior. Drug dealers, illicit arms traders, tax evaders and sex traffickers all rely on cash, he said. Make cash obsolete and those nefarious activities get much more difficult. Plus, cash is dirty, a vector for germs and disease.\n\nIt was a compelling argument, but at the time, my wallet stuffed with colorful plasticy pounds, I thought he was crazy. Old habits die hard, and humans have been using cash, in one form or another, for roughly 7,000 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPlus, forsaking cash can be more difficult for the bankless, many of whom have been through economic crises and are ineligible for credit cards and bank accounts.

Chief among them: Tipping isn\u2019t easy.\n\nAs I checked out of a hotel in Charleston, S.C., I didn\u2019t have anything to offer the valet, which made me look \u2014 and feel \u2014 cheap. The next week I got a haircut. I paid for the trim with my card, but my barber accepted tips only in cash. Again I felt miserly.\n\nAnd when I got an overpriced drink with some New York Times colleagues at the steakhouse below our newsroom, I had to add my tip to the credit card bill, a decidedly less satisfying experience than leaving a few singles on the bar.\n\nThere were other instances when I missed cash, too. When panhandlers asked me for spare change, I had nothing to offer and felt a pang of guilt. One day, I was late to pick up my toddlers from day care, and the school demanded $50 in cash. Rather than consent, I fought the charge and got away with a warning, but it was a close call.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother time, I took the kids to a carousel only to discover it was cash only. Luckily my cousin was with us and lent me $4, narrowly averting a very public temper tantrum.\n\nMy wife saved the day more than once, tipping hotel cleaners and paying the occasional babysitter and cleaning lady with cash. And some studies show that using credit cards encourages people to spend more than they otherwise would.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the most part, however, I realized I\u2019d be totally fine if cash went the way of the fax machine.\n\nRecently, I got back in touch with Mr. Banga of Mastercard, wanting to compare notes. He said that while he didn\u2019t see cash disappearing entirely anytime soon, he \u2014 no surprise \u2014 had mostly let it go.\n\n\u201cI use very little cash in the course of a month,\u201d he said. \u201cMostly just for tipping.\u201d\n\nLike Mr. Banga, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll never use cash again. I will give it out to the homeless and tip hardworking service employees. But if the day comes when cash disappears altogether, you won\u2019t hear me complaining.\n\nIn February, I set out on a trip to Southern California, my wallet still empty. I Ubered to the airport in New York, Ubered to the hotel in Los Angeles and used the usual variety of digital payments to get around, eat and shop. Cash didn\u2019t just seem nonessential; it was practically invisible.\n\nThen one night in Ojai, Calif., my own cashless streak came to an end. I was out for dinner with my family and some old friends, and I picked up the bill, putting it on my Sapphire Reserve card. I was planning to treat the table, but before I noticed what was happening, my friend tossed two $20 bills on top of my wallet and said thanks.\n\nThat was that. I picked up the bills, briefly enjoying their familiar crinkle, and slipped them in my wallet.\n\nThe next morning, I dropped by a coffee shop in downtown Ojai and ordered a black coffee and blueberry bran muffin. The bill was $7.38.\n\nI paid in cash and put $1 in the tip jar.", "title": "Going Cashless: My Journey Into the Future", "authors": ["David Gelles"]}

Leslie Salmon-Jones, an Alvin Ailey-trained dancer, and her husband, Jeff Jones, an engineer and drummer, created the class in 2008 after spending two years in West Africa, Haiti and Jamaica.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I decided to take a trip to learn more about our ancestry,\u201d Ms. Salmon-Jones said. The couple visited Ghana, Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. They visited slave dungeons, Ms. Salmon-Jones said, and throughout the trip learned about all kinds of healing rituals, including ones related to dance.\n\nPhoto\n\nUpon their return, Ms. Salmon-Jones was invited to teach yoga and Afro-Caribbean dance in Sedona, Ariz. That was where she had the idea to bring the two disciplines together with live music. \u201cEven the name came through,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI taught the first Afro Flow Yoga at this festival on the vortexes in the mountain on a full moon.\u201d\n\nWhile researching the class, Ms. Salmon-Jones discovered that yoga had been practiced in ancient Egypt. \u201cYou see in the hieroglyphics all the yoga poses,\u201d she said.\n\nThe more she developed her idea, the more Ms. Salmon-Jones seemed able to merge the worlds of yoga and African dance into a cohesive class. \u201cThe movements come out of the connection to the earth, to the sky, to the heart,\u201d she said of African dance. (The same, arguably, could be said of yoga.) \u201cWe do a lot of heart-opening movements and combination of dances of the African diaspora \u2014 harvest dances in West Africa, planting the seeds, warrior movements.\u201d She demonstrated, thrusting her hands and legs in a stylish, rhythmic manner.\n\n\u201cA lot of the dances and rhythms survived the slave trade, so all throughout the diaspora there\u2019s a connection,\u201d she said. Dance was \u201cpart of the healing.\u201d\n\nAfro Flow Yoga is two parts yoga with one part African dance wedged in between. After finishing the first part \u2014 a vinyasa portion of hip rolls, downward dogs, cobras and slow roll-ups \u2014 participants transition to a feisty m\u00e9lange of concentrated African dances before ending the workout with more yoga.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It takes place every other Sunday and costs $20.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Anice said that she appreciates how the class gathers its strength from its emphasis on spherical formations.\n\n\u201cThe circle is really good medicine,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s rooted in love and compassion.\u201d It\u2019s also what Africans traditionally practiced, Ms. Anice added. \u201cThey\u2019d come into a circle. Whatever they needed, it\u2019s like their movement was a prayer. Not just dance for dance sake.\u201d\n\nThe live music for Afro Flow Yoga blends peaceful vocals with percussion. \u201cIt\u2019s all in a flow, particularly when people are breathing together,\u201d said Dana Gae Hanchard, the vocalist for the class. \u201cYou just stay focused on what\u2019s happening \u2014 inhalation, exhalation, how people are coming out of a pose, how far they\u2019re going,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel my role is to help them in that.\u201d\n\nThe conga drumming is both intense and introspective. \u201cCongas come out of the tradition of central Africa,\u201d said Ron McBee, the class drummer. \u201cThey\u2019re melodic.\u201d Mr. McBee also plays the mbira, a traditional thumb piano native to Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really inspiring, the connection to your ancestors,\u201d said a 44-year-old student known as Anouska. \u201cMy family is from Guyana, so feeling that strong connection with slavery and my family coming over as indentured servants\u201d is energizing, she said.\n\n\u201cThe energy is amazing,\u201d said Michelle Kilic, 47, who has been taking Afro Flow for more than four years. \u201cThe endorphins are going through you and you just feel alive. And afterward, you just go out and conquer stuff. You just feel so blessed and grateful.\u201d\n\nOthers find the class to be healing. Weeks after recovering from surgery to remove a cyst that caused an ectopic pregnancy, Andrea Smith, 35, longed for an activity that would alleviate her emotional and physical pain. \u201cI was a dancer in the past and I was looking for something that had rhythm and the healing structure of yoga,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that could help me meditate while also stretching my limbs and wringing out my organs so that I could start the healing process.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe found what she was looking for.\n\n\u201cThe yoga did what it needed to do,\u201d said Ms. Smith. \u201cBut you realize that African dance is the conversation between you and the ancestors and the earth and God.\u201d", "title": "Going With the Flow (and the Drumbeat, Too)", "authors": ["Tiffany Martinbrough", "Fit City"]}

Chicago has one of the highest principal retention rates of any large urban system, 85 percent. Principals are given support, training and independence. If you manage your school well for a couple of years in a row, you are freed from daily oversight from the central office.\n\nBut the big thing is transforming the role. Principals used to be administrators and middle managers, overseeing budgets, discipline, schedules. The goal was to be strong and decisive.\n\nToday\u2019s successful principals are greeting parents and students outside the front door in the morning. That Minnesota-Toronto study found successful principals made 20 to 60 spontaneous classroom visits and observations per week.\n\nIn other words, they are high-energy types constantly circulating through the building, offering feedback, setting standards, applying social glue. In some schools, teachers see themselves as martyrs in a hopeless cause. Principals raise expectations and alter norms. At Independence Middle School in Cleveland, principal Kevin Jakub pushes a stand-up desk on wheels around the school all day.\n\nResearch also suggests a collaborative power structure is the key. A lot of teachers want to be left alone and a lot of principals don\u2019t want to give away power, but successful schools are truly collaborative.\n\nThe Wallace Foundation website recently described the exemplary activism of former Kentucky principal Dewey Hensley. In his first week he drew a picture of a school on a poster board and asked the faculty members to annotate it together. \u201cLet\u2019s create a vision of a school that\u2019s perfect. When we get there, then we\u2019ll rest,\u201d he told them. School governance was led by a simple structure of three committees, populated and headed by teachers. Hensley also visited the homes of the 25 most disruptive students.\n\nWhen you learn about successful principals, you keep coming back to the character traits they embody and spread: energy, trustworthiness, honesty, optimism, determination. We went through a period when we believed you could change institutions without first changing the character of the people in them. But we were wrong.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cMy impression is that Google is not sure what to do,\u201d said Michelle Miller, a co-executive director at Coworker.org, a workers\u2019 rights organization that has been working with some Google employees. \u201cIt prevents the ability of a company to function when one group of workers is obstinately focused on defeating their co-workers with whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nThe division within Google spilled into the open last year when James Damore, a software engineer, wrote a memo critical of its diversity programs. He argued that biological differences and not a lack of opportunity explained the shortage of women in leadership and technical positions.\n\nGoogle fired Mr. Damore. He filed a lawsuit in January with another former employee, claiming that the company discriminates against white men with conservative views. In a separate lawsuit, a former recruiter for YouTube sued Google because, he said, he was fired for resisting a mandate to hire only diverse \u2014 female or black and Latino \u2014 candidates.\n\nGoogle\u2019s handling of the issue was also upsetting to Mr. Damore\u2019s critics. In another lawsuit filed last month, a former Google employee said he was fired because he was too outspoken in advocating diversity and for spending too much time on \u201csocial activism.\u201d\n\nInside Google, vocal diversity proponents say they are the targets of a small group of employees who are sympathetic to Mr. Damore. In some cases, screenshots of comments made on an internal social network were leaked to online forums frequented by right-wing groups, which searched for and published personal information like home addresses and phone numbers of the Google employees, they said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2015, Google started an internal program called Respect@, which includes a way for employees to anonymously report complaints of inappropriate behavior by co-workers. Some diversity supporters say other employees are taking advantage of this program to accuse them of harassment for out-of-context statements.\n\n\u201cSome people feel threatened by movements that promote diversity and inclusion. They think it means people are going to come for their jobs,\u201d said Liz Fong-Jones, a Google engineer who is a vocal supporter of diversity.\n\nMany big tech companies are struggling with the challenge of creating a more diverse work force. In 2015, Facebook adopted the so-called Rooney Rule. Originally used by the National Football League to prod teams to consider coaching prospects who are black, the rule requires managers to interview candidates from underrepresented backgrounds for open positions. But last year, Facebook\u2019s female engineers said that gender bias was still a problem and that their work received more scrutiny than men\u2019s work.\n\nEven executives tasked with promoting diversity have had difficulties. In October, Denise Young Smith, who was Apple\u2019s vice president of inclusion and diversity, came under fire when she said that there was diversity even among 12 white, blue-eyed, blond men because they had different backgrounds and experiences. She later apologized, saying she did not intend to play down the importance of a non-homogenous work force. She left Apple in December.\n\nThe tension is elevated at Google, at least in part, by its workplace culture. Google has encouraged employees to express themselves and challenge one another. It provides many communication systems for people to discuss work and nonwork related issues. Even topics considered out of bounds at other workplaces \u2014 like sharp criticism of its own products \u2014 are discussed openly and celebrated.\n\nIn January, on one of Google\u2019s 90,000 \u201cgroups\u201d \u2014 internal email lists around a discussion topic \u2014 an employee urged colleagues to donate money to help pay Mr. Damore\u2019s legal fees from his lawsuit against Google to promote \u201cviewpoint diversity,\u201d according to a person who saw the posting but is not permitted to share the information publicly.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He said he had meant that being a Republican did not exempt Google employees from following the company\u2019s code of conduct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA Google spokeswoman said in a statement that the company encouraged lively debate. But there are limits.\n\n\u201cCreating a more diverse workplace is a big challenge and a priority we\u2019ve been working to address. Some people won\u2019t agree with our approach, and they\u2019re free to express their disagreement,\u201d said the spokeswoman, Gina Scigliano. \u201cBut some conduct and discussion in the workplace crosses a line, and we don\u2019t tolerate it. We enforce strong policies, and work with affected employees, to ensure everyone can do their work free of harassment, discrimination and bullying.\u201d\n\nIn the past, discussions about diversity in Google\u2019s online chat groups would encounter skeptical but subtle comments or questions. The debate turned openly antagonistic after Mr. Damore\u2019s memo, which was titled \u201cGoogle\u2019s Ideological Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe James Damore thing brought everything to a head,\u201d said Vicki Holland, a linguist who has worked at Google for seven years. \u201cIt brought everything to the surface where everyone could see it.\u201d\n\nMr. Damore said he began to question Google\u2019s diversity policies at a weekly company meeting last March. At the meeting, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, and Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice president of people operations, \u201cpointed out and shamed\u201d departments in which women accounted for less than half the staff, according to Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nThe two female executives \u2014 who are among the company\u2019s highest-ranking women \u2014 said Google\u2019s \u201cracial and gender preferences were not up for debate,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Mr. Damore subsequently attended a \u201cDiversity and Inclusion Summit,\u201d where it reinforced his view that Google was \u201celevating political correctness over merit\u201d with its diversity measures.\n\nMr. Damore said he had written his memo afterward in response.\n\nMs. Scigliano, the Google spokeswoman, said the company looked forward to fighting Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit in court. Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said in an August blog post that he had fired Mr. Damore because his memo advanced \u201charmful gender stereotypes\u201d but that \u201cmuch of the memo is fair to debate.\u201d\n\nSome employees said they were abstaining from internal debate on sensitive issues because they worried that their comments might be misconstrued or used against them. Like the broader internet, the conversations tend to be dominated by the loudest voices, they said.\n\nGoogle\u2019s diversity advocates said they would like to see more moderation on internal forums with officials stepping in to defuse tensions before conversations get out of hand.

Greatness remained beyond his reach and some of his paintings and drawings are truly awful, steeped in pious nostalgia and American nativism.\n\nDespite its deafening popularity, \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d is among Wood\u2019s worst efforts. This fastidious portrayal of a wizened farmer and his deflated-looking female companion (wife or daughter?) standing before a white board and batten house with a Gothic-style, second-story window, was hailed as a truly, purely American art. It quickly placed Wood, with the painters Thomas Hart Benton and John Steuart Curry, at the forefront of the retrograde phenomenon of Regionalism.\n\nThere was some debate about whether the portraits were satirical or sincere. Wood acceded to both at different times. (They look like comedians on \u201cHee Haw,\u201d who have finished their lines and are waiting for their laughs.) The three spinsterish, ghostlike women in his \u201cDaughters of Revolution,\u201d from 1932, were more vehemently criticized as satirical, especially by the Daughters of the American Revolution, but with an all-female cast, those claims stuck more readily.", "title": "Grant Wood at the Whitney Both Thrills and Disappoints", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-02 00:00:00", "text": "Herm\u00e8s\u2019s Rendition of an Egyptian Garden\n\nI have long used Herm\u00e8s\u2019s Jardin Sur Le Nil ($138). I first learned about it in 2005 when I read a New Yorker story by Chandler Burr about its creation. The scent was engineered \u2014 like a perfectly genetically modified tomato \u2014 by a French perfumer named Jean-Claude Ellena (Burr describes him as having \u201cthe confidence of a man who is conscious of being handsome\u201d) who wonders what an Egyptian garden truly smells like. (The answer? Green mangoes.) I wasn\u2019t even out of college, and the nicest thing I owned was my Apple laptop, but I went to a department store and bought it anyway. The story had captured my imagination. I think, deep down, I so badly wanted to be the elegant woman Ellena considers wearing his scent as he roams through Egypt recording smells (lotus root, nasturtium) in his notebook. In recent years, I\u2019ve diversified what scents I wear, but I always return to Jardin Sur Le Nil. Perhaps because if it once made me think I was luxurious, now it reminds me of a younger, more impressionable version of myself. \u2014 THESSALY LA FORCE\n\nSubtle, Soap-Forward Elegance\n\nI\u2019ve gotten over self-induced pressure to have a signature scent (of all the things to feel anxiety about!), and am now polyamorous when it comes to perfume, but my favorite is Prada Infusion D\u2019Iris ($230). I tend to like iris in general, but favor the Prada formulation for its clean, almost soapy quality. It\u2019s a little grandma and very understated \u2014 not the sort of scent people are likely to compliment when you walk in the room. But it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s never given me a headache, and I come back to it again and again. \u2014 KATE GUADAGNINO\n\nA Unisex Morroccan-Inspired Scent\n\nI have been wearing Aesop\u2019s Marrakech Intense ($85), which a friend gave me, for three years or so but I use it so sporadically that one bottle could last me a lifetime. It\u2019s a delicately natural scent that has some mystery. When I wear it, it makes me feel like a young Sam Shepard. \u2014 KELLY HARRIS\n\nAll the Fragrances of the Mediterranean\n\nNo matter how hard I try to branch out and experiment with new scents, I keep coming back to Lys Mediterranee by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle ($192). It\u2019s musky, a little salty, with the scent of lily. Yet it doesn\u2019t feel dainty. When I was young, I coveted YSL\u2019s Opium ($122) \u2014 it was all the rage, and the cool kids wore it. Though I never owned it, wearing Opium made me feel a bit exotic and mysterious \u2014 if that was possible for a suburban teenager. I think the same goes for Lys Mediterranee. Every morning when I spray it on, I momentarily feel transported somewhere exotic \u2014 perhaps to an al fresco dinner party with lots of twinkling lights in the South of France. Or maybe Greece. Then I get dressed, get the kids to school and hop on a train to work. \u2014 BETSY HORAN\n\nA Fruity Scent That\u2019s Not Too Sweet\n\nI have the sweetest memories of my father taking me out shopping and to lunch when I was younger. He loved perfume, and the first scent he bought me (I was around 12 years old) was Ana\u00efs Ana\u00efs by Cacharel ($62). It\u2019s such a beautifully floral and simple scent. As I grew older, he would buy me perfume for holidays, and it was because of him that I got hooked on Jo Malone\u2019s Nectarine Blossom & Honey ($135). He introduced me to the brand when I was living in London during graduate school, and I\u2019ve been wearing it ever since. \u2014 JENNIFER CONTOGEORGOS\n\nA Floral Blend With Soft Peony Notes\n\nThe perfume line ALTAIA, short for A Long Time Ago In Argentina, is inspired by its creators\u2019 South American heritage. When I wear the scent By Any Other Name ($210), it makes a statement, like a simple long black dress. The fragrance is soft and elegant, with rose notes and hints of peony and osmanthus. It\u2019s just enough to convert a perfume-opposed individual. \u2014 CATHLEEN O\u2019NEIL\n\nSomething Quirky and Enigmatic\n\nWhen I moved to New York a year and a half ago, I wanted a new signature scent, and a love for smaller brands and a little research led me to Viridescent by Carlen Parfums ($190). Viridescent blurs the line between feminine and masculine, evoking a flirtatious yet peculiar mood. The scent\u2019s blend of hay, oud and sandalwood suits my style, which is androgynous and versatile \u2014 think button-downs, pussy bows and quirky earrings. Every time I wear it, I receive compliments \u2014 from men and women alike. \u2014 GAGE DAUGHDRILL", "title": "Great Perfumes, Recommended by T Editors", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "Anyone hit with a ransomware attack must reckon with the dollars and cents: Will it cost more to pay up, or to try to eradicate the malware and restore the data without giving in? But government victims must also grapple with the dubious propriety \u2014 and dubious legality \u2014 of rewarding crime with taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nThe episodes are at once familiar and frightening. Hackers with no apparent motive other than curiosity and avarice indiscriminately scan the web for vulnerable servers and networks, and all too often find them.\n\nCybersecurity experts say local government agencies and universities tend to be at a particular disadvantage because they manage many public-facing web services and servers and employ many people who must have access.\n\nAntivirus software tools can ward off some kinds of malicious attacks, but they often fail to stop ransomware because cybercriminals have found too many ways around them \u2014 whether by exploiting a security hole in a vulnerable server or tricking a na\u00efve employee into opening a malicious email attachment.\n\n\u201cIn cybersecurity, the more places you have where your door is sort of open \u2014 which it has to be in local government \u2014 the higher your risk is,\u201d said Scott Smith, a former mayor of Mesa, Ariz.\n\nIn 2013, the year Mr. Smith became president of the United States Conference of Mayors, the group adopted a resolution identifying cybersecurity as \u201ca critical public safety issue of concern to mayors and cities.\u201d\n\nBut local governments are often working with antiquated systems, tight budgets and short-handed I.T. staffs. According to a 2016 survey of chief information officers for jurisdictions across the country, 38 percent of local governments were relying on technology that was at least one generation out of date, and fewer than half had bought cybersecurity insurance, which can help cover the costs of responding to a major attack.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe survey, by the International City/County Management Association and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, found that extorting ransom was the most common purpose of cyberattacks on city or county governments, accounting for nearly one-third of all attacks. (Mischief and theft of private information were the next most common.)\n\nLocal governments were not always high on the ransom target list. In recent years, security experts say, criminal groups like SamSam, the shadowy hacking crew implicated in the Atlanta episode, had been zeroing in on health care providers, particularly hospitals, which they knew could ill afford to lose patient records or wait for weeks to restore normal operations. More than seven-eighths of all recorded ransomware attacks in the United States in 2016 were aimed at the health care industry, according to NTT Security.\n\nThat onslaught, experts say, prompted many in the industry to shore up their digital defenses \u2014 and the hackers to turn to new targets. \u201cAs health care has spent more on their security, we\u2019ve seen attackers moving to local governments,\u201d said Allan Liska, a senior intelligence analyst at Recorded Future, a security firm.\n\nThe past 16 months have seen high-profile ransomware attacks at public agencies ranging from a fire department in Ohio to a transit system in Northern California, which offered free rides after attackers took down their ticketing systems. Recently, Mr. Liska said, cybercriminals who call themselves \u201cThe Dark Overlord\u201d have said in an underground web forum that they had begun to attack state and local governments because their security is so poor.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Atlanta, the attack apparently mounted by the SamSam group brought down many (though not all) city systems on the morning of March 22. Among other effects, residents have not been able to pay water bills or traffic tickets online, the court schedule has been upended, and police officers have had to file reports on paper. For days, city workers were not allowed even to turn on their computers.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta declined to be interviewed about the ransom demanded by SamSam to end the attack: the Bitcoin equivalent of about $51,000.\n\nBut Atlanta\u2019s leaders are likely to have weighed a host of concerns, including whether the SamSam hackers would keep their end of the bargain. Security experts said the city also had to decide whether it was willing, in effect, to finance a criminal enterprise, and whether it could stomach a reputation as an easy mark.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 2012, by one estimate, only 2.9 percent of victims paid. But these days, the rate is as high as 48 percent, according the Ponemon Institute, a privacy research group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThose who pay \u2014 from a Massachusetts town and police department to the Hancock Health hospital group \u2014 generally calculate that it is the cheapest way out. Mr. Rebholz estimated that the total cost for Atlanta to rebuild all its affected systems could run from \u201cseveral hundred thousand dollars easily into millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThough many of their concerns are the same, business leaders hit by cyberattacks are often able to respond more nimbly than politicians can.\n\nCorporate executives \u201ccan compare and contrast different options in a much freer way,\u201d said Mike Rawlings, the mayor of Dallas and a former president of Pizza Hut.\n\nIn the public sector, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as cost-benefit analysis \u2014 you are gambling the trust and the perception of what the city stands for at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Ponemon Institute found that the decision often turns on whether the victim has access to a full and accurate backup for the seized data. The hackers know it: Victims are finding that the first thing intruders like SamSam do is to search the compromised system for \u201cback up\u201d or the names of popular backup services, and delete those files.\n\n\u201cThey now go out of their way to force you to pay,\u201d Mr. Rebholz said. \u201cIt\u2019s increasingly rare that victims can fully recover.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado Department of Transportation awoke late last month to discover that SamSam had locked its employees out of their computers, email and timecard systems; encrypted the agency\u2019s most important databases; and renamed files with the words \u201ci\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nDeborah Blyth, the state\u2019s chief information security officer, said in an interview Wednesday that it was an easy decision not to pay. For one thing, the state has a policy forbidding ransom payments. For another, the data had been backed up offline, out of the attackers\u2019 reach, making the department better prepared than most targets.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe department had everything back to normal in a little over a week \u2014 but the story was not over. SamSam\u2019s attackers had planted some undetected digital footholds during the first attack that opened the door for a second attack with improved ransomware as soon as the systems came back online.\n\nThree weeks later, Ms. Blyth said, the second restoration job is about 80 percent complete. She is scheduled to brief other state and local governments on Friday about the double whammy.\n\n\u201cI feel terrible for Atlanta,\u201d she said. \u201cI know exactly where they\u2019re at. We need to give other local governments information on SamSam so it doesn\u2019t happen to them. I\u2019m really worried that other state agencies are at risk.\u201d\n\nOfficials have been slow to awaken to that danger. After the mayors\u2019 conference adopted its warning resolution in 2013, it tried to hold a cybersecurity forum in Washington for city officials. It was canceled for lack of interest.\n\n\u201cIf you had a cybersecurity summit now,\u201d Mr. Smith said this week, \u201cit would be oversubscribed.\u201d", "title": "Hard Choice for Cities Under Cyberattack: Whether to Pay Ransom", "authors": ["Alan Blinder", "Nicole Perlroth"]}

They financed their acquisitions by borrowing large sums, posing a challenge for China\u2019s pledge to tackle rapidly growing debt in its financial system.\n\nMr. Xi has sent a strong message to China\u2019s billionaires and entrepreneurs that such unrestrained deal making will no longer be tolerated. In February, the government seized Anbang Insurance, the owner of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan and the buyer of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of other properties around the world. Wu Xiaohui, Anbang\u2019s chairman, who had been detained in July, was charged with economic crimes.\n\nLike Anbang, CEFC appears to have taken on significant debt. Two Chinese ratings firms, China Chengxin and United Credit Ratings, have downgraded their outlook on the company\u2019s finances, citing mounting debt. United Credit also cited the report of the investigation of Mr. Ye.\n\nThis week, an employee in the Hong Kong office of CEFC\u2019s nonprofit arm said that the office was closing and that other employees had resigned.\n\nBut much of CEFC\u2019s rise, and the reasons behind its latest stumbles, remain murky. \u201cI had never heard this company being talked about before the Rosneft deal,\u201d said Xizhou Zhou, head of power, gas, coal and renewables at IHS Markit, an information provider. Rosneft is Russia\u2019s state oil company.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on people\u2019s radar at all,\u201d he said.\n\nCEFC also faces a legal challenge in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmerican officials arrested a top executive of its nonprofit arm in November and charged him with offering bribes to officials in Uganda and Chad in exchange for oil rights. While court documents do not mention CEFC, the details of the case show prosecutors have evidence that Mr. Ye and other executives were apprised of the executive\u2019s activities.\n\nIn a rare interview in 2016 with Fortune, which ranked him on its list of top business executives under 40 years old, Mr. Ye said he had gotten his start buying oil assets that once belonged to Lai Changxing, a Chinese businessman who fled to Canada to avoid charges of running a smuggling ring. To get the funding, Mr. Ye said, he sold investors on a business that would find opportunities where China\u2019s state oil companies could not compete. He was in his mid-20s at the time.\n\nIn the fallout of the 2008 financial crisis, CEFC scooped up European oil assets and built up a network of oil storage facilities and transport services through Central Asia and Europe.\n\nEventually, CEFC was able to secure highly coveted licenses to import oil as the government began to open up the oil sector. In Hainan Province, CEFC\u2019s oil storage facilities are used as part of the country\u2019s strategic reserves.\n\nBy 2015, it had posted nearly $40 billion in revenue.\n\nWhile not state run, CEFC showed it knew how to navigate politics. Mr. Ye, for example, has said in his official biography that he was once deputy secretary of an organization called the China Association for International Friendly Contact. That group is part of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, according to researchers for the United States Congress and Mark Stokes, a former United States military attach\u00e9 in China and the executive director of a defense research group, the Project 2049 Institute.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt also has direct ties to the ruling Communist Party, through an internal party committee and the Communist Youth League, a training ground for many officials, according to its website.\n\nMr. Ye also cultivated the image of someone with political connections. A framed calligraphy of Mr. Xi\u2019s hung on the wall in Mr. Ye\u2019s Shanghai office, according to the Fortune article. On his desk sat a red phone made to look like the famous \u201cred machines\u201d that the Communist Party\u2019s most important members would use to tap into a secure line of communication.\n\nThe company also played to China\u2019s geopolitical ambitions with investments spanning Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Its deals have promoted China\u2019s \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative, Mr. Xi\u2019s push to spread China\u2019s influence abroad.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the Czech Republic, where CEFC bought a majority stake in a bank, a brewery, a publishing house and one of the two national soccer teams, Mr. Ye is an economic adviser to President Milos Zeman. Weeks after CEFC said it would acquire the Rosneft stake, the president of CEFC, Chan Chauto, met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Moscow.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Hong Kong, Mr. Ye is a political adviser to Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. Ms. Ip said Mr. Ye was appointed in 2015 because of his support of the Belt and Road initiative. Mr. Ye \u201cnever attended any activities of our party, and never gave advice on our political development,\u201d Ms. Ip said in an email.\n\nThe Rosneft deal gave CEFC a global profile. It agreed in September to buy a 14.2 percent stake in Rosneft from the oil trader Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. Rosneft needed the support after Western governments grew increasingly critical of Mr. Putin and issued sanctions against Rosneft and other Russian companies. The deal broke a mold for Russian-Chinese energy deals, which had been tightly limited to state companies in both countries.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is not clear how CEFC\u2019s troubles will affect the Rosneft deal. In January, the head of Russia\u2019s second-largest bank, VTB, said it would lend CEFC about $5 billion to help with the acquisition. Two Rosneft spokesmen did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nCEFC is facing financial pressures. In a September filing, it disclosed debts of about $20 billion, an increase of 20 percent from the previous year. Last week, China Chengxin and United Credit downgraded CEFC on concerns about its mounting debt, saying that it faced \u201chigh pressure to pay back in the short term\u201d and that if the Rosneft deal fell through, \u201cthe company will bear a huge loss.\u201d\n\nThe arrest in the United States of Patrick Ho, the top executive at CEFC\u2019s nonprofit arm, has extended its troubles beyond China. A former civil servant, Mr. Ho has been accused of offering millions of dollars in bribes to President Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad and Uganda\u2019s foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, in exchange for oil rights in the two countries, according to United States government. Mr. D\u00e9by and Mr. Kutesa have denied the allegations.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said that Mr. Ho was using the charity as a scheme to hide the passing of bribes on behalf of CEFC, the company. The nonprofit hosted networking events that featured former American military officials and Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army generals.\n\nMr. Ho, a former home affairs secretary in Hong Kong, has denied the charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and awaits trial in New York.\n\nThe American government\u2019s complaint against Mr. Ho, 68, includes references to CEFC executives as well as the chairman, without naming Mr. Ye. The complaint also describes emails between Mr. Ho and CEFC\u2019s chairman about the suspected bribes.\n\nIn court hearings, prosecutors have said the company and Mr. Ye are not targets. But, they have added, the investigation proceeds. To add to the mystery, the court in New York recently appointed a special officer to deal with documents that are expected to be classified.", "title": "Hard-Charging Chinese Energy Tycoon Falls From Xi Government\u2019s Graces", "authors": ["Alexandra Stevenson"]}

She received $100,000 for the production rights, as well as what Broadway experts described as a generous portion of the box office revenue and any net profit.\n\nThe dispute erupted last fall when Ms. Carter saw a draft of the script, and was alarmed by what she viewed as liberties taken with the source material. The suit cites an interview Mr. Sorkin did last fall where he described how Atticus evolves over the course of the play, in part through his interactions with the Finch family\u2019s black maid, Calpurnia, who has a much larger role in the drama. Ms. Carter was also troubled by the addition of two characters who do not appear in the book, and by what the complaint describes as changes to the characters of Atticus\u2019s children, Jem and Scout.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the interview Mr. Sorkin gave New York Magazine about his adaptation, he described his reinterpretation of Atticus\u2019s moral evolution. \u201cAs far as Atticus and his virtue goes, this is a different take on \u2018Mockingbird\u2019 than Harper Lee\u2019s or Horton Foote\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cHe becomes Atticus Finch by the end of the play.\u201d\n\nThe move to assert more control over the play is perhaps a sign of how Ms. Carter views her role as a guardian of Ms. Lee\u2019s legacy. In her final years, Ms. Lee went to court to protect her intellectual property, and sued a museum in her hometown, Monroeville, in 2013, arguing that it had infringed on Ms. Lee\u2019s trademark by selling \u201cMockingbird\u201d themed T-shirts and trinkets (the suit was settled in 2014).\n\nMr. Rudin alluded to that lawsuit in a statement that said the \u201cestate has an unfortunate history of litigious behavior and of both filing and being the recipient of numerous lawsuits, and has been the subject of considerable controversy based on the perceptions surrounding its handling of the work of Harper Lee both before and after her death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is, unfortunately,\u201d the statement continued, \u201csimply another such lawsuit, the latest of many, and we believe that it is without merit. While we hope this gets resolved, if it does not, the suit will be vigorously defended.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMockingbird\u201d lawsuit was preceded by a series of letters between the parties as they debated the script. In one letter, dated March 5 and released by Mr. Rudin\u2019s office, Ms. Carter expressed concern that Atticus in the play is depicted as \u201crude and selfish\u201d as well as \u201cmore confrontational and far less dignified.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis Atticus,\u201d she wrote, \u201cis more like an edgy sitcom dad in the 21st Century than the iconic Atticus of the novel.\u201d\n\nShe also objected to what she described as \u201cmassive alteration\u201d to the characters of Calpurnia and Tom Robinson, to plot elements that she says vary from those in the book, and to the depiction of small-town Alabama in the 1930s.\n\nMr. Rudin\u2019s lawyer, Jonathan Zavin, responded four days later, defending the play, acknowledging that while it is \u201cdifferent from the novel,\u201d it \u201cdoes not derogate or depart from the spirit of the novel, nor alter the fundamental natures of the characters in the novel.\u201d He noted that Ms. Lee herself had \u201cadded to the novel and its characters\u201d with the publication of \u201cWatchman.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he argued: \u201cAaron Sorkin is one of the leading writers in America. He would hardly be needed to write the play if the intent was to merely do a transcription of the novel on the stage. Presumably Ms. Lee was well aware that Mr. Sorkin would be bringing his perspective and talent to the play, and that the play would not be identical in all respects to the novel.\u201d", "title": "Harper Lee\u2019s Estate Sues Over Broadway Version of \u2018Mockingbird\u2019", "authors": ["Alexandra Alter", "Michael Paulson"]}

You might be familiar with this uncanny sensation of kidlessness, as if you are getting away with something reckless and potentially illegal. More than once, I felt as if we had discovered a cheat code that had opened a portal into a parallel universe. Suddenly, we were allowed to get a drink. We were allowed to sip this drink. We could read more than a single page in a book at one time. We could enjoy a meal without cleaning yogurt off the ceiling.\n\nYet this odd feeling of defeating space and time came as much from our destination as anything. Cuba, that elusive island unfurling across the Caribbean like a tangled flag, sits barely 100 miles south of Key West. 100 miles! And yet, in some respects, it might as well be 10,000 miles. The country\u2019s complex identity is inherently bound up in the duality of this proximity, in its ability to feel both so close and yet so far away at the same time.\n\nOur visit came at a strange time for Cuban-American relations, as the country languishes in a period of post-Fidel, post-Obama uncertainty. Many Cubans we talked to cited President Obama\u2019s 2016 visit as a watershed moment, a critical first step in normalizing relations between the two countries. But such optimism has given way to a kind of stagnant waiting game, filled with more questions than answers: Is the sudden explosion of private businesses (like Airbnb) on the island a sign of things to come or merely window dressing on what remains a totalitarian regime?

According to Feeding America 12.9 million children in the United States lived in food-insecure households in 2016.\n\nHave you, or anyone close to you, ever experienced food insecurity, or worried about where your next meal would come from? If so, how did it affect your studies, your health or your social life?\n\nWhere did you turn for help, if you did? Were there any supports in place at your school? Why or why not?\n\nIn \u201cIt\u2019s Hard to Be Hungry on Spring Break,\u201d Anthony Abraham Jack writes:\n\nThe phrase \u201cspring break\u201d conjures up images of college students lounging on beaches by day and hitting the clubs at night. Many students do, in fact, travel from campus to far-flung places. On the assumption that most students leave, schools generally shut down. But this assumption is outdated, especially as colleges enroll a greater number of academically talented students from poor families. I met Valeria, an engaging sociology major from the Midwest, while conducting a study on social class at elite colleges that included white, black, Latino and Asian students. (Valeria is not her real name; the terms of my research protocol require that I use pseudonyms for all students.) In our conversations, she described one aspect of how it felt to be a poor student on a rich campus: \u201cThere\u2019s always famine during spring break.\u201d This problem is more complicated and widespread than people realize. Data I collected in 2016 on colleges that have adopted no-loan financial aid policies, which is one way of measuring a school\u2019s commitment to lower-income students, reveal that roughly one in four kept their cafeterias open during spring break the same way they do when classes are in session. At Harvard, where I teach, it was not until 2015 that the administration opened the dining halls during the break (a project I was involved in). Some colleges, like Smith and Carleton, charge students additional fees to stay on campus during this period. Now, a daily rate of $10 or $15 might not seem like much to some. But to many lower-income students, it is substantial. Spring break is a luxury that many students can\u2019t afford. In a sense, though, it is one that many colleges make them buy anyway. I faced this reality as a student at Amherst in the mid-2000s. Valentine Hall, our only cafeteria, closed. I could not afford to go home to Miami, the choice destination for many of my peers. Instead, I foraged through campus job postings to pick up extra shifts to pay off meals I put on my credit card. Today\u2019s students face a similar fate. With no access to a kitchen in which to cook or store food, Michael, a slim, reserved first-generation college student, told me, \u201cI just go to Family Dollar to buy things that I can microwave.\u201d Many students I spoke to rationed food they took from the cafeteria, oftentimes with the help of sympathetic cafeteria workers. Spencer, the daughter of refugees, recounted how she \u201cstole food the day before they closed everything \u2014 I took a bunch of bread and things that are not perishable.\u201d Michelle, reflective and thoughtful, imported a strategy she used when she and her family were homeless in New York: She found a soup kitchen near campus. With comedic seriousness, Arianna, who has a Southern California vibe, told me, \u201cSpring break is the real \u2018Hunger Games.\u2019\u201d\n\nStudents: Read the entire Sunday Review piece, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 What is your overall reaction to Mr. Jack\u2019s Opinion piece, and the information in it?

History, he once said, is all we have, but it was not only the history of historians.\u201d\n\nDr. White was born on July 12, 1928, in Martin, in northwest Tennessee, to Virgil and Alda White. As a boy he lived in Tennessee and in Detroit, where his father had gone to work in automobile factories, alternating frequently between the two places.\n\nHe enlisted in the Navy near the end of World War II and then attended Wayne State University in Detroit under the G.I. Bill, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in history in 1951. He earned a master\u2019s degree at the University of Michigan in 1952 and, after spending two years in Rome on a Fulbright fellowship researching church reform in the Middle Ages, was awarded a doctorate at Michigan in 1956.\n\nDr. White taught at a number of universities, including Wayne State, the University of Rochester, Wesleyan, Stanford and several campuses of the University of California system.\n\nIn 1972, while he was a history professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, his career acquired an unusual footnote: He sued Edward M. Davis, the Los Angeles police chief, over the department\u2019s practice of enrolling undercover officers as U.C.L.A. students so they could monitor the goings-on in classrooms and student organizations. He argued that the practice violated the rights to freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and privacy.\n\nThe California Supreme Court, in 1975, ruled for Dr. White, reversing a lower court decision.\n\n\u201cGiven the delicate nature of academic freedom, we visualize a substantial probability that this alleged covert police surveillance will chill the exercise of First Amendment rights,\u201d the court said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. White\u2019s other scholarly works included, most recently, \u201cThe Practical Past\u201d (2014). A collection, \u201cThe Fiction of Narrative: Essays on History, Literature and Theory 1957-2007,\u201d was published in 2010.\n\n\u201cPerhaps White\u2019s most controversial idea, and one for which he was so often shunned by his fellow historians, is that \u2018all stories are fictions,\u2019 \u201d Robert Doran, a professor at the University of Rochester who edited that volume, said by email. \u201cWhite held that while historical facts are scientifically verifiable, stories are not. Stories are made, not found in the historical data; historical meaning is imposed on historical facts by means of the choice of plot-type, and this choice is inevitably ethical and political at bottom.\n\n\u201cThis is what White called \u2018emplotment,\u2019 a term he coined,\u201d Dr. Doran continued. \u201cEven the most basic beginning-middle-end structure of a story represents an imposition: The historian chooses where to begin, where to end, and what points are important in the middle. There is no scientific test for \u2018historical significance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe literary critic Gary Day, reviewing the collection in the British publication The Times Higher Education supplement, found Dr. White\u2019s views invigorating and sobering.\n\n\u201cHis closely argued, wide-ranging essays are an antidote to the philistine and sinister demands that we forget the past,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn history, we don\u2019t just remember the dead, we do their remembering for them. And that\u2019s an awesome responsibility, but a necessary one.\u201d\n\nDr. White\u2019s assorted theories and writings all examined, in various ways, how history is a living, breathing entity shaped by those who write it, not merely a dry examination of dusty artifacts.\n\n\u201cThe accessibility of the historical object lies in the fact that it\u2019s supposed to be over and done with,\u201d he said in a video interview at Wesleyan\u2019s Center for the Humanities. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer developing. When in reality our own relationship to the past is that it\u2019s constantly intruding upon it.\u201d\n\nDr. Kellner said that Dr. White\u2019s insights were valid across disciplines.\n\n\u201cWhite was trained as a medievalist and chaired a major history department before he was 40, but his work was enthusiastically embraced by scholars in many fields, notably literature, art history, and philosophy,\u201d Dr. Kellner said. \u201cTo all of these he offered a way of appealing to the past that was open to their different styles of thought. The enormous variety of topics he addressed was remarkable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition to his wife, whom he married in the early 1970s, Dr. White is survived by a daughter, Juliana Sarah Brose White; two sons, Adam and David; and a grandson.\n\nIn 2014, Dr. White returned to Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn., where he had directed the Center for the Humanities in the 1970s, to receive an honorary degree.\n\n\u201cWhen he made brief remarks to the Class of 2014 at commencement, he didn\u2019t tell them to go discover their pasts, to go find out who they really were and then express that,\u201d Michael S. Roth, Wesleyan\u2019s president, wrote on Tuesday in a commemorative blog post. \u201cNo, Hayden told us all that we weren\u2019t rooted in some authentic past and that we could make out of ourselves something new, something not beholden to someone else\u2019s idea of who we really were and where we had really come from.

Such ventures are seen as strategic assets in a desert kingdom keenly aware of its agricultural limitations. While Saudi Star has had a tough time getting going, it is said to be a particular focus of the new government\u2019s interest.\n\nSaudi officials have declined to comment on the charges against individual detainees as well as their status, citing privacy laws.\n\nThe Saudi government has said its dragnet followed an extensive investigation by a newly formed anti-corruption committee headed by the country\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The prince, who has fashioned himself as a reformer, is in the midst of a charm offensive to bolster diplomatic and financial ties to the West and is scheduled to visit Washington this month.\n\nThe detentions, however, have been almost entirely opaque. There have been no signs of collaboration with Western law enforcement and no charges made public, leading some critics to view it as a power and money grab rather than a bona fide anti-corruption effort. Saudi officials have denied that anyone has been mistreated, but people with knowledge of the detentions have said that as many as 17 of the detainees required medical attention because of abuse, and one later died in custody.\n\nGiven the insular nature of the country and the crackdown, Saudi officials are likely to make the most headway seizing assets within their own borders. Within Sheikh Amoudi\u2019s empire, there is much to sort through.\n\nHe moved to the kingdom as a teenager. Although there are few firm details about how a commoner came to vast wealth, he managed to forge influential connections. The most important was Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz, who served as defense minister and crown prince before his death in 2011. Sheikh Amoudi ran businesses that depended on the prince\u2019s money and position, associates said. Another of his allies was Khalid bin Mahfouz, a billionaire who later became enmeshed in the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991, at the time one of the largest private banks in the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the 1980s, Sheikh Amoudi set up Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Companies, a conglomerate known as Midroc. Early on, his biggest deal was a multibillion-dollar project to build the kingdom\u2019s underground oil storage capacity. Engineering and construction became core businesses for Midroc, but it operates everything from pharmaceutical to furniture factories in the region, according to its website. Sheikh Amoudi also owns half of a steel company called Yanbu, and a large chain of gas stations called Naft.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike another detainee, Sheikh Alwaleed, Sheikh Amoudi extended his reach to the United States. He donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and offered his private plane to fly Bill Clinton to Ethiopia in 2011.

Three years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a lawsuit by the owner of the World Trade Center described Sheikh Amoudi as a \u201cmaterial sponsor of international terrorism\u201d because of his funding of controversial Islamic charities.

In an interview Friday, Begay said it seemed to him as if fans were hungry to show Woods their appreciation for how he changed the game while he was still around to soak it in.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEveryone loves a comeback story, and the underdog, and Tiger became the underdog,\u201d Begay said. \u201cJust two months ago he was ranked outside the top 1,000 and was overcoming multiple back surgeries and sort of was the punch line on late-night comedy because of everything that had gone on.

Snedeker has been in the same group for five of the 14 official rounds that Woods has logged. From what Snedeker has seen, the renewed appreciation being shown Woods by the fans is being reciprocated in kind. Woods is making more eye contact, signing more autographs, smiling more.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s more at peace with his role in golf,\u201d Snedeker said. \u201cI think there was a time he was so focused on winning, he lost out on the relationships.\u201d\n\nDuring the Wednesday pro-am here, Woods stopped when he came upon a group of military personnel stationed at one hole. He thanked them for their service and added, \u201cAppreciate it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of Woods\u2019s comeback is that his performance has everybody looking ahead, not back. \u201cThe excitement going into the Masters is going to be massive,\u201d said Adam Scott, the 2013 champion at Augusta National, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know if any of us were really thinking Tiger was a true favorite in there, and he might be.\u201d", "title": "He Stuck to Golf: Tiger Woods, Roaring Back, Ties for 2nd", "authors": ["Karen Crouse", "On Golf"]}

The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have long relied on informants to build cases against mob bosses, crooked Wall Street traders and drug dealers, and current and former law enforcement officials questioned whether potential cooperators would decline to help the government without a guarantee of safety in return.\n\n\u201cHow often do you get an American who went into Al Qaeda?\u201d asked Jack Cloonan, a former F.B.I. agent who investigated the group. \u201cI would think you would want to do everything you could for him. If I were the agent, I would be hard-pressed to accept this.\u201d\n\nIn a series of interviews, his first since being freed, Mr. Vinas gave an unusually revealing look at life inside Al Qaeda. He spoke of a training camp, where he slept in flea-ridden sleeping bags but befriended other young men from around the world, and gained access to Qaeda leaders, who discussed with him the most effective ways to cause mass destruction inside the United States. He suggested blowing up the Long Island Rail Road, or a Walmart.\n\nMr. Vinas became interested in Islam before the Sept. 11 attacks after meeting a Muslim woman at a mall. He converted in 2004 at a mosque in Queens, did odd jobs in New York and eventually fell under the spell of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and Qaeda recruiter in Yemen whose YouTube videos were popular among Islamic extremists.\n\nMr. Vinas had few prospects and even less money, and had grown distant from his family. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on, he grew to hate American foreign policy and thought he had a moral and religious obligation to defend Muslims.\n\nFighting in Afghanistan, he thought, would give him a purpose.\n\n\u201cIf I had had a future, it would have been different,\u201d he said.\n\nHe traveled to Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007 and eventually linked up with militants who provided training and took him to Afghanistan.

The living arrangements were primitive; trainees had to share the flea-infested sleeping bags. The food \u2014 rice, potato stew and boiled roots \u2014 gave him diarrhea and dysentery.\n\nHe met many Qaeda leaders, including Saleh al-Somali, the chief of external operations, who planned an attack on New York\u2019s subways that the F.B.I. thwarted.\n\nIn a conversation with Younis al-Mauritani, a senior Qaeda member, Mr. Vinas suggested bombing the Long Island Rail Road as a way to hurt the New York economy.\n\n\u201cIt was just an idea that was talked about,\u201d Mr. Vinas recalled. He also advised attacking a Walmart, but the idea was dismissed.\n\nMr. Vinas made friends easily, like a Pakistani who had lived in Texas and loved barbecue and the Grateful Dead. Mr. Vinas\u2019s closest friend was a gregarious 6-foot-5, 300-pound Kuwaiti who enjoyed American fast food and spoke excellent English.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

He said Mr. Somali raved about McDonald\u2019s and Hardee\u2019s.\n\nMany of the people he met died in drone strikes.\n\nThe Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Vinas in October 2008 in the Hayatabad neighborhood of Peshawar, where he had traveled to find a wife. The Pakistanis interrogated him, he said, and notified the American government that he had been caught. Mr. Vinas recalled thinking that he would be sent to the United States military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, he was flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and then to New York to be prosecuted. \u201cIt was a long trip,\u201d Mr. Vinas said, and members of the F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Force took him to Katz\u2019s after his arrest.\n\n\u201cA pastrami sandwich can really soften a hard heart,\u201d Mr. Vinas said.\n\nHe immediately started providing information to the F.B.I. and pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal terrorism charges.\n\nHe was later transferred to a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., and put in the witness security program inside its walls, according to former law enforcement officials. He had company: gang members, mobsters and another valuable F.B.I. informant, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali terrorist captured in international waters near Yemen in 2011.\n\nMr. Vinas spent eight years at Otisville.\n\nIn all, he took part in 100 interviews, reviewed 1,000 photographs and helped in more than 30 law enforcement investigations, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have said he was the \u201csingle most valuable cooperating witness\u201d about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nLast year, a federal judge sentenced Mr. Vinas to just three more months in prison based on the belief that he was headed to witness protection. The judge was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that Mr. Vinas, who he agreed was a \u201ccomplex individual,\u201d would stay out of trouble. Mr. Vinas thought he was going to \u201cfade into oblivion somewhere\u201d in witness protection.\n\nFederal prosecutors as well as the F.B.I. agents who handled the case pushed hard for witness protection, said Steve Zissou, Mr. Vinas\u2019s lawyer, who believes that Mr. Vinas remains in danger.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we do to people who help the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cVinas paid his dues. At the minimum, he should be given an opportunity to rebuild his life and be safe and secure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never hurt anybody,\u201d Mr. Zissou continued.\n\nThe information that cooperators provide on people and places beyond the F.B.I.\u2019s reach helps the bureau make cases it likely could not otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCooperators are critical because you need an insider\u2019s view,\u201d said Christopher LaVigne, a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s almost essential at terrorism trials.

The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Enforcement Operations, which approves or denies program applications, conducted a review and turned down Mr. Vinas, the senior government official said. A psychologist who examined Mr. Vinas during his final days in prison said he could be a possible threat to the people protecting him. The psychological evaluation caught everyone off guard, including the judge and Mr. Zissou.\n\nMr. Zissou dismissed the assessment. \u201cHe\u2019s not a threat to anybody,\u201d Mr. Zissou said. Another psychologist evaluated Mr. Vinas after his release and said he was not a danger, but the Office of Enforcement Operations did not change its decision.\n\nThe F.B.I. put him in an extended-stay hotel in New York. Farbod Azad, the F.B.I. agent on his case, once brought him Fruity Pebbles and milk. Mr. Vinas thought that was a nice gesture, but then Mr. Azad said the F.B.I. was done paying for the room.\n\nAnother government agency paid for another month, Mr. Zissou said, and then Mr. Vinas was sent to what is known as a three-quarters house in New York. He wears an ankle monitor and has a curfew.\n\nMr. Vinas is now on food stamps and Medicaid. He does odd jobs for his lawyer and has had little luck finding a job. He applied to Uber Eats but never heard back. He considered washing windows, but the union said it was not accepting applications.\n\nMr. Vinas realizes he cannot escape what he did. He is still hopeful about his future, but he knows he will not be living anonymously.

Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re got at that backstage at Louis Vuitton when he talked about fashion as time travel. To a certain extent, he said, the job is all about navigating between the past and what you expect for the future, and the clash of the two. The place they conflict is the present.\n\nAnd there were hints of new ideas, certainly, in the 3-D body-scanning and fabric fusion that went into creating the jackets at Balenciaga, which looked familiar, but weren\u2019t; in the now-you-see-a-tux-now-you-realize-its-sweats at Undercover (one of the worst pieces of news to come out of the last season is that Jun Takahashi, who regularly challenges convention and conventional expectations, is abandoning women\u2019s wear shows for men\u2019s); in the leap from shoulder pads to etched-out shoulder mantles at Fendi and Vuitton, which was the same idea, but abstracted into its essence, as opposed to the glaringly obvious.\n\nIf it is true that we are renegotiating our world, our clothes, to be really effective, need to do the same.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "Last week, Massachusetts settled a lawsuit by agreeing to give all prisoners in advanced stages of the disease access to drugs.\n\nIn November, a federal district judge in Florida was the first to order a state prison to begin treating sick inmates. The state must now provide drugs to all inmates with severe liver damage by the end of this year and those with significant damage in 2019.\n\n\u201cThis Court will not tolerate further foot dragging,\u201d Judge Mark E. Walker wrote. \u201cOne can only wonder how long Defendant would have kicked the can down the road had Plaintiffs not filed this case.\u201d\n\nDr. Anne Spaulding, an associate professor of public health at Emory University and the former medical director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, called the order an unfunded mandate. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible situation that the prison administrators are put in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy something you don\u2019t have any money for.\u201d\n\nPrisons would be a logical linchpin in a campaign to eliminate hepatitis C: some studies suggest that one in three Americans with the disease pass through a correctional facility in any given year.\n\nDelaying treatment has grave consequences. A leading cause of cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease, hepatitis C wreaks irreversible but invisible damage for years; when symptoms become apparent, it is too late to treat. The disease is blood-borne and usually acquired from unsafe transfusions or injection drug use, but perhaps only half of those infected know they have it. It can also be transmitted through tattooing using nonsterile equipment.\n\nEarly therapies for hepatitis C induced fatigue and depression in many patients and cleared the infection in less than half of them. But four years ago drugmakers began to introduce new medicines that do not have the same debilitating side effects and cure nearly all patients, revolutionizing treatment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn return, the companies demanded high prices \u2014 Gilead Science debuted the first of the new class of hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi, at $84,000 per course of therapy \u2014 and private insurers proved willing to pay.\n\nCompetitors have driven down the price. The latest entrant, AbbVie\u2019s Mavyret, was introduced in August 2017 at $26,400. But the treatments remain highly profitable. Manufactured for just dollars per course of treatment, Gilead\u2019s hepatitis C drugs have brought in more than $55 billion in revenue since 2014.\n\nPhoto\n\nDrugmakers have long defended their high prices, arguing that their business model for developing new drugs depends on being able to reap a profit from existing ones. In the case of hepatitis C, this system has yielded drugs that the most affected populations have no way to afford.\n\n\u201cWe are harming millions of people because of allegiance to a model of innovation that constrains delivering that innovation,\u201d said Peter Bach, a drug pricing expert who directs the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \u201cThat model \u2014 the central dogma of pharmaceutical development \u2014 is broken.\u201d\n\nAs people with private insurance gained access to hepatitis C treatment, it became less defensible to withhold it from prisoners. Florida had treated just 13 inmates when the federal court intervened. More than 5,000 inmates there have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, but the corrections department does not conduct proactive screening, so officials concede there are likely closer to 20,000.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

State Senator Jeff Brandes, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice, believes that amount will be sufficient to satisfy the court\u2019s order to treat the sickest inmates, but it will leave thousands of others infected.\n\n\u201cYou kind of feel like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill,\u201d he said.\n\nLeft untreated, prisoners will suffer irreparable liver damage and may transmit the infection to others. While state prisons that withhold drugs may protect their own budgets, the cost will likely still fall on taxpayers once the prisoners are released and seek care through Medicaid or other avenues, said Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist who oversees care for prisoners in New York State.\n\n\u201cYou may take a short-term view, whether you are a governor or a state legislature or whatever budget authority you are, but there is a price to be paid for that,\u201d Dr. Moorjani said.\n\nNew York has taken a longer view, approving 2,009 inmates for treatment between 2014 and 2017 at a cost of about $140 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome states have tried to obtain drugs at lower prices by banding together for greater bargaining power and by enrolling prisoners as patients in hospitals that already get discounted drugs. These tactics have moderately reduced prices, but corrections officials say they would need to be vastly cheaper to even consider treating all eligible prisoners.\n\nLower prices are available \u2014 in Egypt. Once the country with the highest rate of hepatitis C in the world, it may become the first to eliminate it. Gilead allows manufacturers there to license its drugs, and the price of treatment is just $80 per patient. The country has already cured 1.6 million cases.\n\nGregg Alton, an executive vice president at Gilead, defended the prices the company charges in the United States. Like other drugmakers, Gilead promises its best price to state Medicaid programs, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and certain hospitals. If the company lowered the price for prisons, Mr. Alton said, it would have to further reduce it for these other entities. Giving prison health systems access to the same discounted price would require an act of Congress.\n\n\u201cI would love to see all the poor people in the United States have unlimited access to hepatitis C medication,\u201d Mr. Alton said. But, he argued, states must pay for it. \u201cThey have to be accountable for providing a reasonable budget.\u201d\n\nSome experts worry that drug companies will become even more reluctant to reduce their prices as courts order states to treat their inmates, since it effectively prevents them from leaving the negotiating table.\n\nIn an attempt to break the impasse, the National Governors Association recently convened representatives from states and drugmakers. Louisiana brought up a little-used section of patent law that would allow the federal government to manufacture the drugs for the public interest, paying only reasonable compensation.\n\nParticipants also broached the idea of a Netflix-type model, in which states would license bulk use of drugs rather than pay per patient. They reason that drug companies might vie for the large, untapped market of state prison inmates.\n\nWhether the idea becomes a reality is up to the drugmakers. Asked about the company\u2019s position, a Gilead spokesman wrote in an email, \u201cWe\u2019re open to discussing all innovative access solutions that can help patients access important therapies.\u201d", "title": "Hepatitis C Drugs Save Lives, but Sick Prisoners Aren\u2019t Getting Them", "authors": ["Ted Alcorn"]}

The recent revelations that a British political data firm, Cambridge Analytica, improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users has only added to the public\u2019s wariness over the collection and use of personal information.\n\nFacebook, in fact, had planned to unveil its new internet-connected home products at a developer conference in May, according to Bloomberg News, which reported that the company had scuttled that idea partly in response to the recent fallout.\n\nBoth Amazon and Google have emphasized that devices with Alexa and Google Assistant store voice recordings from users only after they are intentionally triggered. Amazon\u2019s Echo and its newer smart speakers with screens use lights to show when they are streaming audio to the cloud, and consumers can view and delete their recordings on the Alexa smartphone app or on Amazon\u2019s website (though they are warned online that \u201cmay degrade\u201d their experience). Google Home also has a light that indicates when it is recording, and users can similarly see and delete that audio online.\n\nAmazon says voice recordings may help fulfill requests and improve its services, while Google says the data helps it learn over time to provide better, more personalized responses.\n\nBut the ecosystem around voice data is still evolving.\n\nTake the thousands of third-party apps developed for Alexa called \u201cskills,\u201d which can be used to play games, dim lights or provide cleaning advice. While Amazon said it didn\u2019t share users\u2019 actual recordings with third parties, its terms of use for Alexa say it may share the content of their requests or information like their ZIP codes. Google says it will \u201cgenerally\u201d not provide audio recordings to third-party service providers, but may send transcriptions of what people say.\n\nAnd some devices have already shown that they are capable of recording more than what users expect. Google faced some embarrassment last fall when a batch of Google Home Minis that it distributed at company events and to journalists were almost constantly recording.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a starker example, detectives investigating a death at an Arkansas home sought access to audio on an Echo device in 2016. Amazon resisted, but the recordings were ultimately shared with the permission of the defendant, James Bates. (A judge later dismissed Mr. Bates\u2019s first-degree murder charge based on separate evidence.)\n\nKathleen Zellner, his lawyer, said in an interview that the Echo had been recording more than it was supposed to. Mr. Bates told her that it had been regularly lighting up without being prompted, and had logged conversations that were unrelated to Alexa commands, including a conversation about football in a separate room, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was just extremely sloppy the way the activation occurred,\u201d Ms. Zellner said.\n\nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center has recommended more robust disclosure rules for internet-connected devices, including an \u201calgorithmic transparency requirement\u201d that would help people understand how their data was being used and what automated decisions were then being made about them.\n\nSam Lester, the center\u2019s consumer privacy fellow, said he believed that the abilities of new smart home devices highlighted the need for United States regulators to get more involved with how consumer data was collected and used.\n\n\u201cA lot of these technological innovations can be very good for consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the responsibility of consumers to protect themselves from these products any more than it\u2019s their responsibility to protect themselves from the safety risks in food and drugs.

It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos. Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.\u201d\n\nMs. Clark and Ms. Aziz, like many Muslims, observe their faith by keeping their head and hair covered in the presence of anyone but family. They are joined in the suit by Turning Point for Women and Families, a nonprofit based in Queens concerned about the impact of police policies on victims of domestic violence who wind up arrested.\n\nMr. Cahn and lawyers from the firm Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady, who represent the plaintiffs, contend that the police practices are unreasonable and violate the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom under both the First Amendment and federal law.\n\nThe issue highlights the gulf between criminal justice policy, as it has evolved over time, and the cultural and religious obligations of those in custody. As it stands now, the city\u2019s policy explicitly says \u201cthe arrestee\u2019s head covering must be removed\u201d for the department\u2019s official photograph.

Yet critics say the policy is confounding.\n\nFor one, it only deals with the treatment of civilians in those brief moments when their photographs are being snapped. The accommodations the policy calls for are not consistently practiced, critics say. And when they are, they are often conveyed as a warning by officers who tell arrestees that asking for a private photograph could lengthen the arrest processing time and lead to longer detention, said Mr. Cahn. He said Ms. Aziz took such warnings as a threat.\n\nEven more significantly, Mr. Cahn said, the photograph policy does not address the fact that photos exist, possibly to be cataloged and disseminated in the future.\n\n\u201cEach time someone sees a photo of them uncovered, it feels like a new betrayal of their fundamental rights,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, when the city last month settled three separate cases brought by Muslims who said that removing their hijabs for photos violated their religious rights, it had the effect of papering over important nuances in the department\u2019s ongoing treatment of arrestees while staying silent on whether the policy would be altered. The city gave $60,000 to each woman, but said only that doing so was \u201cin the best interest\u201d of all sides without elaborating.\n\nAlso, the settlements are \u201climited to only those people who have already come forward,\u201d said O. Andrew F. Wilson, another lawyer for the plaintiffs. \u201cAnd it does nothing to help those women and men who are forced to remove head coverings in the future, or even in the past who haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cahn added that for New Yorkers of different religions, the undercutting of their faith values offers government only slight benefit since many law enforcement experts believe that effective identification is not reliant on the removal of head coverings.\n\nFor driver\u2019s licenses issued in New York, those sitting for a photo can wear hats, scarves or head coverings as long as their entire face is visible and the covering does not cast a shadow. Likewise, the State Police in New York are unaware of any case where a state trooper made an arrestee remove a hijab if their face was visible, said officials of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nFederally, the State Department has no requirement that such religious headwear be removed for passport photos. Several police departments around the country, too, see the removal of religious headwear as unnecessary.\n\nThe lawsuit says the city\u2019s policy only \u201calienates and oppresses faith communities.\u201d In interviews, Ms. Clark and Ms. Aziz said their encounters with officers had eroded their trust in the police.\n\nRobina Niaz, the executive director of Turning Point for Women and Families, said fear among Muslim women of the police was deterring them from stepping forward to report episodes of child abuse and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s post-9/11 climate, New York City is beset with widespread hostility toward and baseless fear of Muslim-Americans,\u201d the suit says. \u201cIn the context of this increasingly polarized setting, it is incumbent on this city\u2019s law enforcement to increase awareness of and sensitivity toward the Muslim-American community.\u201d\n\nFor Ms. Aziz, a daughter of Palestinian immigrants who is married and has two adult children, her encounter with police has fed residual pain. \u201cI just felt like I was broken,\u201d she said. \u201cIt broke me.\u201d", "title": "Hijab Removal by New York Police Prompts Lawsuit", "authors": ["Al Baker"]}

Audiences are built using social media and YouTube videos: Versatile get as many as a million views for theirs. But like the Irish rock bands in the 1970s, rappers in search of a record deal are forced to look to Britain or the United States. Rejjie Snow, who lives in Brooklyn, is signed to the influential New York label 300 Entertainment. His latest album was mainly recorded in London and Paris.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cCompared to two years ago it\u2019s so much better,\u201d Celaviedmai, a 25-year-old rapper from Galway whose given name is Maimouna Salif, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s seen as a real career, it\u2019s not seen as a hobby or a pastime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCelaviedmai is one of a handful of female rappers in Ireland, in what is still a male-dominated scene. \u201cIreland is so small that it\u2019s so difficult to do things on your own,\u201d she said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough resources, or they\u2019re too expensive.\u201d\n\nThe positive side-effect of limited resources is artistic ingenuity. Irish rap abounds in different styles. Rejjie Snow\u2019s songs are dreamy and off-center. Socially conscious rap is common; its criminal-minded flip side, street rap, does exist, but to a lesser degree. Grime, a vibrant Britain-based offshoot of rap, is beginning to make its presence felt. Other acts fuse hip-hop with Afrobeats, R&B and dance music.\n\nThe free-for-all mirrors wider rap trends. The last decade has seen a breakdown of the importance of region to hip-hop, its reliance on place as a marker of a particular sound. The internet has collapsed distances between scenes. But Irish rap\u2019s lack of definition also points to a fluidity within Irish identity.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThought I had to be American, thought I had to be English, everything else but Irish,\u201d the Rusangano Family, a trio from Limerick, rap on one of their tracks.

Rejjie Snow, who left Dublin at 17 to live in Florida, is an example, though he described his own rapping voice as \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\nMr. Fogarty has his own views about how an Irish M.C. should sound. He said there was \u201ca quite significant part of our hip-hop history where artists were using fake accents. Slowly but surely, there has been a shift away from that.\u201d\n\nLilo Blues, 21, a member of the Dublin rap trio the Hare Squead, groaned when the issue was raised. He grew up in southern Dublin listening to American hip-hop and R&B. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything in Ireland to grasp onto in terms of urban culture or sound,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even conscious. It\u2019s not like, \u2018I\u2019ll put this phrase in so they can tell I\u2019m from Ireland.\u2019 No, it\u2019s natural.\u201d\n\nAt Rejjie Snow\u2019s gig at the Olympia, issues of accent and music industry infrastructure faded into the background. Here was Irish rap\u2019s acceleration in its distilled form, a propulsive release of energy. Thinking about the destination could wait for another day. \u201cYo Dublin, are you ready for Rejjie Snow?\u201d the D.J. shouted.

At the same time, business leaders are worried about the country\u2019s long-term demographic decline. Mr. Putin seeks to bolster his domestic popularity by looking powerful as he sows discord with the West.\n\nAnd Britain has made itself an easy target for Russian intrigue. To be fair, this is not a problem of Mrs. May\u2019s making. The government is reaping the dubious rewards of having opened the City of London since the late 1990s to foreign capital with no questions asked about its origin. The initial aim of this permissive approach was to persuade investors that London \u2014 rather than New York \u2014 was best suited to be the world\u2019s financial capital. Among the many to take advantage of the light-touch regulations were oligarchs, spies and gangsters.\n\nBritain needs to make a concerted effort to ascertain where all of this fabulous wealth comes from. Russian oligarchs have made an indelible mark on London. Some own newspapers, others our most successful soccer clubs, while many more own huge chunks of high-end property in the most fashionable parts of the capital.\n\nAnd some of those characters are close collaborators and friends of President Putin. British newspapers have been full of articles about Russian oligarchs and their relatives buying luxury London houses through anonymous companies. Reports say that this is now an ever more popular trick \u2014 squirreling away corrupt money by passing it on to relatives in the hope that it will evade scrutiny.\n\nIf Mrs. May is convinced that Russia is behind this attack, then she needs to devise a way of getting to President Putin\u2019s friends and collaborators. And that means great transparency. She should reintroduce the stalled proposal to force anonymous companies to reveal the sources of their cash. If any members of Parliament or the cabinet tried to oppose a move now, their motives would immediately look suspicious. Now is the moment to confound her critics by acting decisively.\n\nIf Britain knows where the money is coming from, it can develop smarter sanctions against Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle. But that information has the added advantage of making it easier to spot criminal money from across the world being laundered through London\u2019s real estate and financial industries.\n\nIf Moscow is indeed responsible for the poisoning of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, then the attempted murders look like another tactic in a strategy that seeks to exploit the political vulnerabilities of our democracies.

And the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico last fall, adversely affecting the housing market in nearby Jojutla and other areas of the state of Morelos, didn\u2019t seem to have much effect on the luxury market in Cuernavaca, which Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey defined as homes priced upward of $1.5 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven so, Cuernavaca is still \u201cdefinitely a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said Andrea Dolch Espinosa de los Monteros, an owner of the real estate agency Mexico Luxury Estates.\n\n\u201cThe American dollar goes a long way,\u201d she said, and prices are negotiable. And inventory will continue to increase in the future, she added, as \u201cthere is more development and more construction happening.\u201d\n\nAt the low end, three-bedroom homes with two to three bathrooms, a small garden and a pool start at around $200,000, Ms. Espinosa de los Monteros said.

Some are year-round residents, while others are snowbirds.\n\nBUYING BASICS\n\nThough most foreign buyers pay cash, mortgages and cross-border loans are available.\n\nForeigners are allowed to buy inland property, in cities like Cuernavaca, with a permit from the Mexico\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Trump at times has appeared to side with the Arab monarchies against his own cabinet secretaries \u2014 including in the bitter regional dispute against neighboring Qatar.

A person close to Mr. Broidy said the money was passed through the Canadian company at Mr. Nader\u2019s request, and the reason for its circuitous path could not be determined.\n\nDocuments also appear to show that lawyers for Mr. Broidy discussed with him a possible agreement to share with Mr. Nader a portion of the profits from the first round of business his company did with the Saudis and Emiratis \u2014 an apparent reflection of his integral role in helping the company, Circinus, negotiate for the lucrative security contracts.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Broidy said Mr. Nader \u201cis not a shareholder, officer, director or employee of any of my companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has not been paid any origination fee or any other fees in connection with these matters,\u201d he said.\n\nInfluential Links\n\nMonths later, as Mr. Broidy was preparing for an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Nader pressed him to try to line up a private meeting outside the White House between Mr. Trump and the leader of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, whom he referred to as \u201cFriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him that Friend would like to come ASAP to meet you SOONEST out of official site, in New Jersey\u201d or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, Mr. Nader wrote to Mr. Broidy on Oct. 1.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAgain, Again and Again, please try to be the ONE to fix a date for Friend while you are there if at all possible,\u201d he added.\n\nSix days later, Mr. Broidy did just that, repeatedly pressing Mr. Trump to meet with the crown prince in a \u201cquiet\u201d setting outside the White House \u2014 perhaps in New York or New Jersey \u2014 according to a detailed report on the meeting that Mr. Broidy sent to Mr. Nader shortly after. Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, blocked the request, Mr. Broidy reported.\n\nIn a memorandum to Mr. Nader about the Oval Office meeting on Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy reported that he personally urged Mr. Trump to fire Mr. Tillerson, whom the Saudis and Emiratis saw as insufficiently tough on Iran and Qatar.\n\nPhoto\n\nLater in the fall, Mr. Nader complained that the Secret Service had stopped him from getting his picture taken with Mr. Trump at a fund-raiser. Although the reasons he was kept at bay from the president are unclear, Mr. Nader pleaded guilty in 1991 to a federal child pornography charge and served six months at a halfway house after videotapes were found in his luggage when he arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport from a trip to Germany, according to court records released last week. In 2003, he received a one-year prison sentence in the Czech Republic after he was convicted there of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors, The Associated Press reported, citing a court spokeswoman.\n\nMr. Broidy was puzzled by the Secret Service\u2019s objections. Mr. Nader, in his capacity as an adviser to the ruler of United Arab Emirates, had met several times with senior administration officials in the White House during Mr. Trump\u2019s first weeks in office.\n\nMr. Broidy was apparently able to deliver: On Dec. 14, he emailed Mr. Nader his photograph grinning next to Mr. Trump.\n\nDespite the close relations between the White House and the two gulf nations, there have been occasional hiccups, and in January, Mr. Nader twice emailed his friend with another delicate request: The leader of the U.A.E. asked that Mr. Trump call the crown prince of Saudi Arabia to try to smooth over potential bad feelings created by the book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d by Michael Wolff. It portrayed the president\u2019s views of the Saudi prince in an unflattering light, Mr. Nader wrote.\n\n\u201cSee what you can trigger and do and we can discuss more in person,\u201d Mr. Nader wrote, reiterating once again the \u201cgenuine desire\u201d of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates to meet alone with Mr. Trump.\n\nDays later, Mr. Nader wrote to his friend that he was looking forward to an upcoming trip to the United States. Mr. Broidy was arranging for him to attend a gala dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Florida estate, to celebrate the anniversary of Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the two men were considering a trip to Saudi Arabia to try to sell the kingdom\u2019s young and powerful crown prince on a $650 million contract with Mr. Broidy\u2019s security company.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut those grand plans were interrupted.

Instead of making deals with a partner or set of partners, people could use a legal fiction that they were an entity, a societas publicanorum. This new institution was owned and controlled by investors, but legally separate from them. The privilege to act as a societas publicanorum was rare, and required a decree by the Roman Senate or the emperor.\n\nNearly 2,000 years later, versions of this legal innovation came to be used by English businesses, churches, guilds and cities, and by the investors behind the Virginia Company in colonial America. They were known as corporations. Like the societas publicanorum, corporations required a special charter from the king, giving its owners powerful but limited rights: the right to collectively hold property, form contracts and have access to the courts. Corporations were quasi-public, and each corporate charter was unique, comprising highly detailed rules including how much the corporation could charge for its products. Eventually, corporate investors gained a special prize: the privilege of limited liability, which allowed them to avoid personal legal responsibility for the corporation\u2019s actions.\n\nThese corporations did not merely come to America; according to Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, arguably they founded it. From 1607, when the Virginia Company established the Jamestown colony, corporations have been inextricably embedded in American life, Winkler maintains in his excellent and timely new book, \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d The corporation of the British East India Company inspired the colonists in a different way. The bailout of the company by England \u2014 including the Tea Act of 1773, which lowered the price of tea in the colonies while preserving the tax colonists paid on it \u2014 infringed the colonial charters and led to the protests that were instrumental in sparking the Revolutionary War.\n\nPhoto\n\nWinkler\u2019s chief contribution is to show how corporations have been some of the most important innovators in American law, shaping it for good and often ill. Since the early days of the Republic, corporations have invested substantial capital in some of the country\u2019s most talented and charismatic lawyers, pushed risky lawsuits and been on the \u201ccutting edge\u201d of rights-making. They have not been passive recipients of legal change but, rather, among its most significant architects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWinkler frames this history provocatively, as an ongoing \u201ccivil rights\u201d movement for corporations, which \u201chave pursued a longstanding, strategic effort to establish and expand\u201d their rights in American constitutional law. He proves his thesis by recounting two dozen critical moments when corporations pushed the limits of existing law and mostly won new rights. While the corporation of early America was an \u201cartificial person\u201d \u2014 Blackstone\u2019s term \u2014 for purposes of property ownership, contracts and lawsuits alone, Winkler shows how \u201ctoday corporations have nearly all the same rights as individuals: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, religious liberty, due process, equal protection, freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to counsel, the right against double jeopardy and the right to trial by jury.\u201d", "title": "How Businesses Became People", "authors": ["Zephyr Teachout", "Adam Winkler"]}

It is not Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s fault that our society has given him a free pass (and a net worth of $67 billion) for inventing his platform first and asking only later what its social consequences might be. It is all of our faults. Thus, however successful Mr. Zuckerberg will be in making amends, he will assuredly do almost nothing to prevent the next wunderkind from coming along and building the next killer app that will unleash who knows what before anybody even has a chance to notice.\n\nThe challenge of designing ethics into data technologies is formidable. This is in part because it requires overcoming a century-long ethos of data science: Develop first, question later. Datafication first, regulation afterward. A glimpse at the history of data science shows as much.\n\nThe techniques that Cambridge Analytica uses to produce its psychometric profiles are the cutting edge of data-driven methodologies first devised 100 years ago. The science of personality research was born in 1917. That year, in the midst of America\u2019s fevered entry into war, Robert Sessions Woodworth of Columbia University created the Personal Data Sheet, a questionnaire that promised to assess the personalities of Army recruits. The war ended before Woodworth\u2019s psychological instrument was ready for deployment, but the Army had envisioned its use according to the precedent set by the intelligence tests it had been administering to new recruits under the direction of Robert Yerkes, a professor of psychology at Harvard at the time. The data these tests could produce would help decide who should go to the fronts, who was fit to lead and who should stay well behind the lines.\n\nThe stakes of those wartime decisions were particularly stark, but the aftermath of those psychometric instruments is even more unsettling. As the century progressed, such tests \u2014 I.Q. tests, college placement exams, predictive behavioral assessments \u2014 would affect the lives of millions of Americans. Schoolchildren who may have once or twice acted out in such a way as to prompt a psychometric evaluation could find themselves labeled, setting them on an inescapable track through the education system.\n\nResearchers like Woodworth and Yerkes (or their Stanford colleague Lewis Terman, who formalized the first SAT) did not anticipate the deep consequences of their work; they were too busy pursuing the great intellectual challenges of their day, much like Mr. Zuckerberg in his pursuit of the next great social media platform. Or like Cambridge Analytica\u2019s Christopher Wylie, the twentysomething data scientist who helped build psychometric profiles of two-thirds of all Americans by leveraging personal information gained through uninformed consent. All of these researchers were, quite understandably, obsessed with the great data science challenges of their generation. Their failure to consider the consequences of their pursuits, however, is not so much their fault as it is our collective failing.\n\nFor the past 100 years we have been chasing visions of data with a singular passion. Many of the best minds of each new generation have devoted themselves to delivering on the inspired data science promises of their day: intelligence testing, building the computer, cracking the genetic code, creating the internet, and now this. We have in the course of a single century built an entire society, economy and culture that runs on information. Yet we have hardly begun to engineer data ethics appropriate for our extraordinary information carnival.

No man can understand how it feels to grow up female in this culture, especially not an affluent white man like myself. We are largely ignorant of what it\u2019s like to be economically, socially, professionally and sexually bullied. Having said that, your essential beef here really isn\u2019t with men, individually or as a population. It\u2019s with patriarchal thought and behavior, those monstrous forms of privilege by which men control women. The deeper question we need to reckon with is why boys and men are socialized to derive their self-worth from the denigration and domination of women. The symptoms of this mindset \u2014 discrimination, abusive behavior, rape \u2014 are infuriating. But beneath this rage lurks a deep sorrow that belongs to all of us.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCheryl Strayed: Your rage is justified, Angry Feminist. I won\u2019t list all the reasons why because you already did that quite well. We both know the list of injustices goes on. It stretches around the globe and dates back through all time. Strangely, it helps me to remember that. Perhaps remembering that will be solace for you too. Here\u2019s why: There\u2019s no way to make an accounting of that infuriating list without seeing also that progress has been made. I know your most immediate fury is rooted in the specific problem you have in your own life \u2014 the question of how you can love (or even find) a man when so many have wronged or disappointed you. But sometimes our most particular sorrows are eased ever so slightly when we take a broader view. The fact that your anger can even be expressed in the terms that you\u2019ve expressed it is evidence, to me, that change is afoot. The reasons you cite for your anger \u2014 the high incidence of sexual assault, the misogyny of our president and the nation that elected him, the sexism that even enlightened men (and women) enact \u2014 aren\u2019t topics being discussed on the margins anymore. They\u2019re being addressed far and wide, loud and clear. And many of our most powerful institutions and assumptions about men and woman are being rocked, if not yet toppled, by that discussion. Take heart in that.\n\nDear Sugars Listen to \u2018Dear Sugars\u2019 What exactly constitutes sexual consent? The Sugars advise. Audio\n\nSA: Abusive men are beginning to be held to account, which is to say: Women are being believed. But there\u2019s still a vast segment of our population that refuses to confront the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault. They\u2019ve chosen, instead, to normalize and even lionize cruel and predatory behavior. In my view, this moral regression \u2014 like the resurgence of overt bigotry in our political discourse \u2014 marks the panicky response of a dominant culture feeling the tremors Cheryl alludes to above. But this style of thought is also nourished by a consumer culture that profits from sowing doubt. Men are indoctrinated to associate power with predation, and women with seduction and submission. This paradigm, epitomized in the simulated pleasure of hetero-normative pornography, will only begin to diminish in force as we reject the dishonesty of a sexual discourse founded on misogynistic myths.\n\nCS: I can\u2019t predict if you\u2019ll ever find a man who treats you like an equal, but I can say you\u2019re more likely to find one if you seek love from a place of personal power rather than desolation. We change our lives (and sometimes the world) by deciding to do things differently than we\u2019ve done them before. Perhaps for you, Angry Feminist, that means reframing your justified anger. Right now, your rage is a simmering pot of despair that can do nothing but sink you. If instead you can direct it down channels that empower you, it will serve a powerfully important purpose in your life. This could be as small as speaking up rather than remaining silent when you observe sexism or as big as getting involved with an organization or cause whose mission is gender equity (and you might even meet some good guys there). It\u2019s incredibly difficult not to feel burned by the patriarchy. We have indeed been burned.

His parents and three siblings are kind and fun to be around. The problem is my creepy brother-in-law, who is married to my husband\u2019s sister.\n\nFrom the beginning, he took an uncomfortable interest in me. He looks me up and down, makes unnecessary comments about my body and clothing, touches me often and for inappropriate amounts of time, and goes out of his way to sit next to me at family gatherings. Each touch, look and comment can be explained away when taken individually, but together, they tell me he\u2019s a creep. In my gut, I know: It\u2019s not me, it\u2019s him. My obvious discomfort only seems to encourage him. I\u2019ve been consistently rude, and when I must speak to him, I do so curtly. He hasn\u2019t retreated.\n\nRecently, he put his hand on my hip/buttocks area. I pulled away and said sharply, \u201cDo not touch me there.\u201d Less than an hour later, he reached for my knee.

My husband was upset and he told me he felt terrible that I\u2019m regularly subjected to this behavior. While it was nice to have validation, I also wonder why my own story isn\u2019t enough for him to make it real. His family is unbelievably nonconfrontational. They avoid all topics for fear of offending someone. While my husband and I are not so nonconfrontational in our relationship, he clings to it hard within the context of his family, and he continues to have polite conversations with our brother-in-law. Why isn\u2019t he squashing this behavior? Why isn\u2019t he on my side?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

You\u2019ve already communicated this to him in ways that are both subtle and quietly direct. That hasn\u2019t worked. So now you need to be louder and more explicit. I suggest you tell him about your new rules of being in his presence before your next family gathering, either in person or via email. Very likely, he\u2019ll say that you\u2019re being silly, that his intentions are innocent, that when he makes comments that make you uncomfortable, he\u2019s only joking, but these explanations have no bearing on the matter. You\u2019re not having a discussion or negotiation with him. You\u2019re telling him how he is permitted to interact with you from now on by setting clear boundaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSteve Almond: I second Cheryl\u2019s wise counsel. I urge you to talk to your brother-in-law in person, if you can bear it. Not just because tone often gets muddied in emails, but because you need to gently but firmly confront this man with the fact that you no longer consent to his behaviors. I stress this because guys like your brother-in-law are adept at converting our natural tendency to avoid conflict into a license to bully. The fact that your brother-in-law seems encouraged by your \u201cobvious discomfort\u201d tells me that he knows you don\u2019t want his attention, that he\u2019s shamed by your rejection and he deals with this shame by resorting to sadism. Not only does your brother-in-law need to be put on notice, but your husband does, too. He needs to understand that his attempts to keep the peace are, in this case, enabling predatory behavior directed at his wife. You certainly don\u2019t need your husband to fight your battles for you, but he should, at the very least, serve as an ally. The fact that you feel \u201cAlone\u201d with this creep, even with your husband present, suggests the depth of his negligence. That is something else you need to confront.\n\nDear Sugars Listen to \u2018Dear Sugars\u2019 How do you account for a crime that isn\u2019t legally a crime? Audio\n\nCS: I understand why you feel betrayed by your husband, Alone. I suggest you set a boundary with him too: If he won\u2019t stop being complicit in your brother-in-law\u2019s behavior by acting as if it isn\u2019t happening, then you won\u2019t accompany him to family gatherings where your brother-in-law will be present. My hunch is it won\u2019t come to that, because his loyalty to you will ultimately trump his fear of conflict, but it appears that you\u2019re going to have to demand it. Openly addressing your brother-in-law\u2019s actions and your husband\u2019s passivity in the face of them are not easy things to do, but they must be done if you are to feel safe with your husband and his family. I like Steve\u2019s suggestion that you confront your brother-in-law in person, and I urge you to bring your husband along to that meeting. His presence will establish the fact that he is indeed your ally rather than your brother-in-law\u2019s enabler. And, perhaps more importantly, witnessing your courage in dealing with this issue might help him gain some as well. It will also put him on notice that you\u2019re no longer willing to choose his family\u2019s comfort over your own.\n\nSA: Cheryl and I recognize that what we\u2019re asking you to do here is difficult. You\u2019re not calling out a stranger, but a relative. In the process, you\u2019re having to shatter a code of silence that governs this entire family. But you need to remind yourself that demanding common decency is not a radical act. You experience this man\u2019s behavior as predatory. You want it to stop. Period. This isn\u2019t rocket science, or a complicated legal case. It\u2019s not \u201cHe said, she said.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cLeave me alone, creep.\u201d In calling out his creepdom, you\u2019re not just defending your own rights, but those of other women who might feel harassed by this guy. And you\u2019re sending a clear message to your husband and his family: that you don\u2019t want to spend time around people who are emotionally abusive to you, or those who defend them.

Squirrels have evolved with several anatomical adaptations that help them with their acrobatics. While some estimates of their achievements seem exaggerated, like the reported ability to jump 20 feet, they are obviously equipped to make vertical and horizontal leaps that would be superhuman.\n\nFirst, they have very powerful hind legs, much larger than their front limbs, giving them strong propulsion, especially in proportion to their relatively small and light bodies. Second, the \u201cwrists\u201d of their hind legs are double-jointed and hyper-extend a ble , so that they can reverse paw directions and run down a tree as easily as they run up. Cats, for one example, lack this kind of hypermobility and tend to get at least temporarily stuck after climbing a tree.\n\nSquirrels also have small and very sharp claws, and combined with their reversible hind legs, this means they can hang upside down when they want.\n\nThe sharp claws also let them find a secure mooring on small irregularities on a tree trunk\u2019s bark or even on a seemingly smooth telephone pole. This gives squirrels a firm jumping-off place from which to start a vertical leap.", "title": "How Do Squirrels Jump So High?", "authors": ["C. Claiborne Ray", "Q A"]}

She also likes lying under trees. \u201cAs a tomboy in Ohio and then Texas, I was always outdoors,\u201d she recalled recently, while giving a tour of her current show at the Leila Heller gallery in Chelsea. \u201cI would make mud pies, climb trees and go fishing and camping all the time.\u201d Not doing much of anything in nature, she believes, especially in a time of pervasive smartphone and tech entertainment addiction, can be good for the imagination. And that explains why her new exhibition has an \u201cNDD Immersion Room,\u201d and why visitors are asked to give up their phones and have them locked up by staff members in glass boxes on the wall before entering. NDD stands for nature deficit disorder, a phrase coined by the writer Richard Louv in a 2005 book, \u201cLast Child in the Woods.\u201d Ms. Hovnanian first saw the term used on a psychology website called Positive Prescription, and it resonated with her own ideas about humans needing some contact with nature to be healthy, whether that means seeing mountains on the horizon or touching mud. The artist\u2019s Immersion Room is an elaborate indoor installation that meticulously recreates a forest at night. You enter with lanterns, one or two at a time through mirrored swinging doors, to walk on leaves and a wood stump path under towering, fragrant fir trees. The sound of crickets and rushing water fills the darkness. A fake campfire flickers under an artificial sky full of stars where there\u2019s a log to sit on or a camping cot for anyone who cares to lie down.

For decades, he famously declined invitations to the event; he attended exactly once, the year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But even if Mr. Allen wants to go this year, he would hardly be welcome.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince the #MeToo movement, his once celebrated film \u201cManhattan\u201d has emerged as the archetypal work of male-chauvinist art, a byword, for some, for everything that\u2019s wrong with Hollywood and the patriarchy. \u201cThe grown women in \u2018Manhattan\u2019 are brittle and all too aware of death,\u201d Ms. Dederer wrote in her essay. The piece was titled: \u201cWhat Do We Do With the Art of Monstrous Men?\u201d\n\nEven when the film hasn\u2019t been directly under fire, it has been collateral damage, as when \u201cManhattan\u201d was cited as inspiration for \u201cI Love You, Daddy,\u201d the film by Louis C.K. that was shelved by its distributor in the wake of the comedian\u2019s serial-masturbation scandal.\n\n\u201cManhattan\u201d practically seems pre-engineered to provoke debate in the post-Weinstein world.\n\nMost glaring is its portrayal of a sexual relationship between a divorced 42-year-old TV writer named Isaac (Mr. Allen) and a 17-year-old high school student named Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). No characters in the movie seem very troubled by the ethics of the affair, nor did many critics at the time. But the 25-year age gap, and the obvious power imbalance, may make modern viewers feel \u201ca little urpy,\u201d as Ms. Dederer put it, using a term for being on the verge of vomiting.\n\nFor women who are reviewing their own sexual histories and recalling inappropriate attention from much older men, Isaac and Tracy are the poster couple for exploitive relationships. (That group includes Ms. Hemingway: In her 2015 memoir, she wrote that Mr. Allen developed a real-life crush on her after filming and wanted to take her to Paris. She told him she wouldn\u2019t go after she realized they wouldn\u2019t have separate bedrooms.)\n\nPhoto\n\nBut as Lisa Schwarzbaum, the former movie critic for Entertainment Weekly, pointed out in an email interview, \u201c\u2018Manhattan\u2019 was always about a middle-aged man with a high school girlfriend. Back then, \u2018Manhattan\u2019 was made by Woody the Lovable Neurotic Nebbish, and now it has been made by Allen the Monster. And it\u2019s the same movie.\u201d\n\nIf the Isaac-Tracy relationship is so troubling, why wasn\u2019t it troubling two years ago, when the New York Philharmonic put on a screening of the film with live musical accompaniment, to a packed house at David Geffen Hall? Why was \u201cManhattan\u201d for decades a movie that men and women enjoyed watching together?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAmy Arndt, who works for a software company in Austin, Tex., and who was once such a fan of Mr. Allen that she saw his jazz band play at a local theater and hung an autographed poster in her house, is struggling with such questions.

For years, quoting lines from \u201cManhattan\u201d or another film by Mr. Allen on a date could be a romantic litmus test, a way to find out if a potential partner also loved E. E. Cummings, Paris, 1930s jazz and the sophisticated, cultured world the films often came to represent.\n\nPerhaps because there\u2019s a 14-year age difference between Ms. Arndt and her husband (she was 26 and he was 42 when they met 18 years ago), they didn\u2019t bristle at the director\u2019s notorious casting of much younger leading ladies. They also didn\u2019t completely turn away from the director\u2019s films over his marriage to Soon-Yi Previn, the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow, Mr. Allen\u2019s longtime partner. She wasn\u2019t much older than Tracy when their relationship became tabloid fodder, in 1992.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut now that the #MeToo movement is so prominent, Ms. Arndt said, \u201cI\u2019m rethinking my decisions about which artists to support and whether watching Allen\u2019s films is something we want to do anymore.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cManhattan\u201d is lately one of Mr. Allen\u2019s most disparaged films, for decades it was among his most beloved, selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, playing to adoring fans in revival houses, serving as a glorious advertisement for New York. Writing about romantic comedies in The New Yorker, in 2007, the critic David Denby said that \u201cManhattan,\u201d along with \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d took the form \u201cto a level of rueful sophistication never seen before or since.\u201d Roger Ebert included the film in his list of the \u201cGreat Movies.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just men who admired the work, either. In 2011, on the style blog Design Sponge, the writer Amy Merrick showed readers how to get the \u201cManhattan\u201d look in their apartments, swooning over the black-and-white opening montage of New York landmarks set to George Gershwin\u2019s \u201cRhapsody in Blue.\u201d Ms. Dederer even admitted to being \u201cswept away\u201d by that opening, before nausea set in.\n\nMs. Gerwig has also, in the past, celebrated \u201cManhattan,\u201d as has her boyfriend and writing partner, the director Noah Baumbach, who once called the film \u201cepic.\u201d Until recently, the couple\u2019s relationship has played like a meta-tribute to Mr. Allen, with a marked age difference (she is 34, he is 48), an eyebrow-raising beginning (Mr. Baumbach was only recently separated from the actress Jennifer Jason-Leigh when they started dating) and their own black-and-white tribute to New York, \u201cFrances Ha.\u201d\n\nGiven her recent comments, one presumes Ms. Gerwig would not view \u201cManhattan\u201d so rhapsodically these days. In this regard, she would have another thing in common with Mr. Allen.

Yet, in the #MeToo landscape, many 30-and-under women and men \u2014 including me \u2014 are finding it harder to untease the two as we navigate dating and fledgling relationships. In a surprising twist, what began as a very public airing of powerful men\u2019s sexual misconduct has come to cast a certain sinister pall over private intimacies that once seemed perfectly O.K. to enjoy.\n\n\u201cAfter being exposed to so many accounts of different women\u2019s sexual abuse or harassment, I was hyper-aware and hyper-sensitive about it,\u201d said Jessica Tallarico, 30, of Toronto, a newly engaged friend of mine. \u201cSo on one occasion, playing around affectionately in bed, my fianc\u00e9 got the tiniest bit rough and I had such an adverse reaction to what would normally be playful.

It\u2019s an important, albeit privileged, conversation, but it\u2019s also one that tends to ignore certain messy truths about sex \u2014 the fickleness and wide variability of female desire, for instance, or the inconvenient fact that good sex often defies logic, political values and social mores.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Ms. Rand recalled one recent sexual encounter in which her partner asked for verbal consent \u201cevery step of the way.\u201d\n\nA rape survivor, Ms. Rand is well versed in feminist theory; she understands just how important and vital a shift such behavior from a young man is when it comes to casual sex. Yet, in practice, she had mixed feelings. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult because on the one hand you\u2019re like, \u2018Dude, if I didn\u2019t want it, I would stop you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, that can be used against you if it was assault.\u201d\n\nMs. Rand is not the only one conflicted by the new standard of consent; men are, too. Miles Mobley, a 24-year-old college student in Fresno, Calif., remembered an experience with a close female friend last year. They were both naked and fooling around, he said, but when he went to initiate sex, she told him to stop.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe did so immediately but was confused because \u201cit seemed we were going one way, and then all of a sudden we were not.\u201d He asked her if she was sure she didn\u2019t want to. \u201cAnd then she said, \u2018No, it\u2019s O.K.,\u2019\u201d he said. They had sex. Now Mr. Mobley is plagued with a sense of uncertainty and guilt over the incident: \u201cWas it wrong of me, to ask a clarifying question? Was that coercion? That wasn\u2019t what I meant at all. I was just legitimately confused.\u201d\n\nMr. Mobley said that post-#MeToo he and many of his male friends have sworn off making the first move. \u201cNow, I just sit back and wait for the girl to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI know there\u2019s been a lot of sexual situations that have not come to fruition because of it, and I\u2019ve even had girls be like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you kiss me?\u2019 But I just really don\u2019t want to overstep my boundaries.\u201d\n\nWe tend to expect sexually liberated women to act the same as sexually liberated men (or at least the idea of them \u2014 promiscuous, assertive and self-centered in their pleasure seeking). It makes sense: For most of history, we only had the male model as an example. However, in practice, women may choose to enjoy sexual liberation in significantly different ways than their male counterparts.\n\n\u201cThe sooner we acknowledge that our sexuality is distinct and different, the more we can express ourselves in an empowered way,\u201d Dr. Boehm said. \u201cWomen\u2019s pleasure and arousal unfolds differently than men\u2019s and by being educated and aware of this we claim our birthright, which is full-bodied pleasure.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a submissive role is not equivalent to meekness. \u201cThere is absolutely power in it,\u201d said Dr. Boehm, who is also an expert in tantra. Lying back and surrendering to your partner, as the tantric tradition encourages, she said, can be enormously liberating.\n\nUltimately, Dr. Boehm said, the most empowering thing a woman can do is take control of her own sexual experiences \u2014 the good and the bad. \u201cIf we want the same freedoms as men, we have to take on the same duties,\u201d she said.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has upended a number of old so-called rules that allowed powerful men to force their desire on women whose silence they could count on. Now we have new rules, and, when it comes to sexual harassment or workplace gender discrimination, this can only be a good thing.\n\nHowever, the concept of prescriptive, universal guidelines is anathema to truly mind-bending sex. So is codifying it into a moral or political act. Doing so turns the bedroom into a court of public opinion \u2014 one in which, as our inscrutable desires inevitably lure us into untested territory, both parties will leave feeling shamed. We don\u2019t need different rules; we need two empowered individuals liberated and secure enough to explore each other\u2019s impulses, to listen to each other, and ask for what they want \u2014 even if that includes permission to not ask for what comes next.", "title": "How Does Submissive Sex Work in the Age of #MeToo?", "authors": ["Hayley Phelan"]}

Spencer Green/Associated Press\n\nIn the 1950s, \u201960s and early \u201970s, Dr. Dixon said, the focus in pediatric training was much more on organic disease and metabolic processes. Parents had concerns about their children\u2019s behavior and worries about their own strategies, but they didn\u2019t think of those as questions for the pediatrician, or expect to hear that there was medical research to address their worries. Dr. Dixon, a former editor of the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, said that now everyone who cares for children understands the importance of developmental screening and of offering parents help and resources to deal with behavioral issues.\n\n\u201cHe really caused a Copernican revolution, an entire paradigm shift in our understanding of child development,\u201d said Barry Lester, a psychologist who is director of the Brown Center for the Study of Children at Risk at the Alpert Medical School and Women & Infants Hospital, and who came to study with Dr. Brazelton in the 1970s, and worked with him in Boston for a decade as director of research for the child development unit. \u201cHe put the infant and the infant-mother relationship at the center of the universe, and everything he has done stems from that change.\u201d\n\nHis research on newborns led to the development of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, which was first published in the 1970s (and is often referred to in pediatrics as \u201cthe Brazelton\u201d) and has been used in about 1,000 research studies. It\u2019s the gold standard for observing and documenting newborn behavior, Dr. Sparrow said.\n\nIt was a revolutionary idea, Dr. Lester said, that \u201cthe baby actually contributes to shaping his or her own environment, that development is not based on passive exposure.\u201d Instead, he said, Dr. Brazelton\u2019s work helped doctors and psychologists understand that \u201cthere\u2019s a built in reciprocity; infant behavior is modified by the mother, mother\u2019s behavior is modified by the infant in a mutually reciprocal relationship.\u201d\n\nI remember being a little awed when it came my turn in residency to spend time with Dr. Brazelton in a small group because he was a celebrity. But it was such a joy to watch him with patients, and after all, he was still a practicing pediatrician, so he astonished us by concentrating on a topic important to parents that had otherwise been neglected in our residency, which was rich in rare and obscure diseases. He asked us what we knew about toilet training, and its problems, and he told us about his patients and what he had learned from them.\n\n\u201cParents really told me what I should be thinking about these things,\u201d Dr. Brazelton said in his 1997 interview. \u201cAnd so the research became a window into how to think for me as a provider, but also into how they were thinking.\u201d\n\nWhen I watched Dr. Brazelton speak to an audience of parents, it was clear that they connected immediately with his concern for their babies, but also with his understanding of the insecurities that plague parents in their daily interaction with their children, as well as the larger stresses that complicate families\u2019 lives.", "title": "How Dr. T.

By most estimates, only about 10 percent of people past the age of 65 work out regularly.\n\nSo, our expectations about what is normal during aging are based on how growing older affects sedentary people.\n\nBut the British scientists, many of them recreational athletes, suspected that exercise might have an impact on the trajectory of physical aging and, if so, alter our beliefs about what \u201cnormal\u201d aging means.\n\nTo test that possibility, they decided to seek out a group of older men and women who had remained physically active as they aged and found them among local recreational cyclists. The dozens of male and female riders they eventually recruited were between the ages of 55 and 79, had been cycling for decades, and still pedaled about 400 miles per month. None were competitive athletes.\n\nFor their inaugural study of the riders, which was published in 2014, the scientists measured a broad range of the cyclists\u2019 physical and cognitive abilities and compared them to those of sedentary older people and much younger men and women. The cyclists proved to have reflexes, memories, balance and metabolic profiles that more closely resembled those of 30-year-olds than of the sedentary older group.\n\nThat analysis had left many questions about exercise and physical activity unanswered, however. So for the two new studies, which were both published in Aging Cell this month, the researchers decided to refocus their inquiries and look closely at muscles and T cells, a key infection-fighting component of our immune system.\n\nIn most people, muscle health and immune response worsen after we arrive at middle age, with the effects accelerating decade by decade. But there had been hints in the first study\u2019s data that the cyclists might be unusual in these regards.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They wanted to compare various markers of muscle health and function across the riders\u2019 age span. If the muscles of riders in their 70s resembled those of riders in their 50s, the scientists reasoned, then their physical activity most likely had altered and slowed the supposedly \u201cnormal\u201d arc of muscular decline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, other scientists delved into the riders\u2019 immune systems, drawing blood from them, as well as from a group of sedentary older people and another of healthy young adults.\n\nThe two sets of scientists then dove into their data and both concluded that older cyclists are not like most of the rest of us. They are healthier. They are, biologically, younger.\n\nTheir muscles generally retained their size, fiber composition and other markers of good health across the decades, with those riders who covered the most mileage each month displaying the healthiest muscles, whatever their age.\n\nThe impacts on riders\u2019 immune system also were marked. In the older sedentary people, the output of new T cells from the thymus glands was low. The inactive older peoples\u2019 thymus glands also were atrophied, compared to those of the younger group.\n\nThe aging cyclists, on the other hand, had almost as many new T cells in their blood as did the young people. Those who exercised also showed high levels of other immune cells that help to prevent autoimmune reactions and of a hormone that protects the thymus against shrinkage.\n\nThe researchers theorize that the results of the two studies are interrelated. Muscles are one of the sources of the hormone that protects the thymus.\n\n\u201cSo more muscle means more of that hormone,\u201d says Janet Lord, the director of the Institute of Inflammation and Aging at the University of Birmingham, who was a co-author of both studies.\n\nThe older cyclists\u2019 immune systems were not impervious to aging, of course. Many of their existing T cells showed signs of senescence, which means that they had grown feeble and were unlikely to fight infections well anymore.\n\nThe results also are limited to recreational British cyclists.

But they seemed convenient and harmless, and, really, what could go wrong?\n\nToday, more than a decade later, the consequences of Facebook\u2019s laissez-faire approach are becoming clear. Over the weekend, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm, improperly acquired the private data of about roughly 50 million Facebook users, and used it to target voters on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhat happened with Cambridge Analytica wasn\u2019t technically a data breach, since this trove of personal information wasn\u2019t stolen from Facebook\u2019s servers. Rather, it was given away freely to the maker of a Facebook personality quiz app called \u201cthisisyourdigitallife.\u201d\n\nThat app, which was developed by a University of Cambridge professor, collected data about the 270,000 people who installed it, along with data about their Facebook friends, totaling 50 million people in all. The professor, Aleksandr Kogan, then gave the data he had harvested to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nTechnically, only this last step violated Facebook\u2019s rules, which prohibit selling or giving away data collected by a third-party app. The rest was business as usual. Third-party apps collect vast amounts of detailed personal information about Facebook users every day, including their ages, location, pages they\u2019ve liked and groups they belong to. Users can opt out of sharing specific pieces of information, but it\u2019s unclear how many do.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Permissiveness is a feature, as they say, not a bug.\n\nBut in the wake of incidents like the data leak to Cambridge Analytica, some are questioning the costs of such loose policies on an influential platform with 2.2 billion registered users.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt seems insane that you can make haphazard decisions about so many people\u2019s data,\u201d said Can Duruk, a technology consultant and software engineer. Facebook, he said, was \u201cextremely lax with what kind of data they allowed people to get.\u201d\n\nIn a Facebook post on Monday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook vice president, admitted that that thinking may have been a mistake.\n\n\u201cWe thought that every app could be social,\u201d Mr. Bosworth wrote. \u201cYour calendar should have your events and your friends birthdays, your maps should know where your friends live, your address book should show their pictures. It was a reasonable vision but it didn\u2019t materialize the way we had hoped.\u201d\n\nAn early clue about the potential for misuse of Facebook\u2019s third-party developer tools came in 2010 when my colleague Emily Steel, then at The Wall Street Journal, reported that an online tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had gathered from third-party Facebook apps to marketing firms and political consultants. In response, Facebook cut off RapLeaf\u2019s data access and said it would \u201cdramatically limit\u201d the misuse of its users\u2019 personal information by outside parties.\n\nBut preventing data-hungry developers from exploiting Facebook\u2019s treasure trove of personal information remained challenging. In 2015, Facebook removed the ability of third-party developers to collect detailed information about the friends of users who had installed an app, citing privacy concerns. (Cambridge Analytica\u2019s data trove, which included this type of information, was gathered in 2014, before the change.) Facebook has also taken away tools used by developers to create games and quizzes that barraged users with annoying notifications.\n\nBut the core functions of Facebook\u2019s open platform tool are still intact. There are still many third-party apps like \u201cthisisyourdigitallife\u201d out there, vacuuming up intimate data about Facebook users. That data doesn\u2019t disappear, and Facebook has no real recourse to stop it from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nNot all open data access is used irresponsibly. Researchers and nongovernmental organizations have used Facebook\u2019s third-party development tools to respond to natural disasters. And many of the functions that internet users depend on \u2014 for example, the ability to import their digital address books into a new messaging app \u2014 are possible thanks only to the tools that allow for third-party development known as application programming interfaces, or A.P.I.s.\n\n\u201cEverything we depend on uses A.P.I.s,\u201d said Kin Lane, a software engineer who maintains a website called API Evangelist. \u201cThey\u2019re in your home, in your business, in your car. It\u2019s how these platforms innovate and do cool, interesting things.\u201d\n\nIn Facebook\u2019s case, permissive data policies were also good for business. Third-party developers built millions of apps on top of Facebook\u2019s platform, giving Facebook users more reasons to spend time on the site and generating more ad revenue for the company. Restricting access to data would limit Facebook\u2019s usefulness to developers and could drive them to build on a rival platform instead, making those products better.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s even less surprising that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica were able to use a silly personality quiz to collect information about millions of Americans.

As Qualcomm puts it:\n\n\u201cChina revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.\u201d\n\nAccording to Broadcom\u2019s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. \u201cOther\u201d markets made up nearly 38 percent.\n\nAs a point of comparison, 2 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s revenues come from the United States. Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China, including Hong Kong, according to its most recent annual report.\n\nEmployees\n\nRoughly 55 percent of Broadcom\u2019s employees are based in North America, according to the annual report. About 38 percent are in Asia, and the remainder work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. About 52 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s employees are based in the United States.\n\nBroadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties, both owned and leased, are in the United States.

Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war.\n\nPotential replacements, according to Axios: Peter Navarro, the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs; Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor; Shahira Knight, a deputy of Mr. Cohn\u2019s; and the pro-free-trade economist Larry Kudlow. But Axios says that there\u2019s no official succession plan, and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave (We can rule out Austan Goolsbee.)\n\nThe timing: CNBC notes that Mr. Cohn\u2019s announcement came hours after Mr. Trump said that \u201ceveryone wants to work in the White House.\u201d It also came after Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cThere is no Chaos, only great Energy!\u201d\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: Even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism.\n\nCritics\u2019 corner: The WSJ editorial board said Mr. Cohn\u2019s departure was \u201ca significant blow\u201d to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. The NYT editorial board said Mr. Cohn had done \u201can awful job,\u201d which still probably represented \u201cthe high-water mark for economic thinking\u201d for this White House. And his former boss, Lloyd Blankfein, said he had served his country \u201cin a first class way.\u201d\n\nWill the Fed be able to soften the blow of a trade war?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event \u2013 fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines \u2014 threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMaybe not.\n\nThe Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg.\n\nOne outcome: The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate. That would give the Fed more room to maneuver, perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly.\n\nBut it could get messy. Trade tariffs, applied broadly, could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted.\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nFed officials increasing seem to believe inflation will pick up.\n\nFederal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent this year.\n\n\u201cMounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.\u201d\n\nWhat are those tailwinds?\n\n\u201cThe most notable tailwind is the shift in America\u2019s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.\u201d\n\nMs. Brainard\u2019s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy.\n\nHow is Wall Street reacting to Mr. Cohn\u2019s decision to leave?\n\nMajor stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke.\n\nDespite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here\u2019s a look at some reactions:\n\nJoe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote:\n\n\u201cThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.\u201d\n\nBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote:\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether Mr. Cohn\u2019s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump\u2019s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the \u201cadult in the room\u201d in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta.\n\nCharlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote:\n\n\u201cIt still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump\u2019s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.\u201d\n\nBut he adds:\n\n\u201cIt does \u201cpull forward\u201d risk of the \u201cBad Trump\u201d scenario which that market had largely \u201cpriced-out\u201d into the \u201cnow.\u201d\n\nCarl Icahn responds to critics of his Manitowoc stock sale.\n\nBetween Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, the billionaire investor sold about $31 million of the crane maker's stock.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo some, that seemed like good timing.\n\nSince the day before he started selling, the stock is down 20 percent. The catalyst? The Trump administration\u2019s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Manitowoc stock fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel. The company\u2019s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s plans when he moved to reduce his holding. In a statement on his website, Mr. Icahn said:\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nEurope unveils its Trump tariffs response\n\nThe political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack, including taxing American goods like Harley-Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization.\n\nMeanwhile, allies continued to fret.

And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House.\n\nThe aluminum industry doesn\u2019t want tariffs either\n\nIn a letter to the White House yesterday, the Aluminum Association (which represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers) said that the move would be a bad idea.\n\nComplaints can be heard around the sector. The C.E.O. of Novelis, a big aluminum producer, criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were \u201chysteria.\u201d And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U.S.\n\nBayer may sell its seeds unit for the sake of the Monsanto deal\n\nBayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational, seeks to win approval for its $56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators.\n\nEuropean antitrust regulators opened an in-depth investigation into Bayer\u2019s planned acquisition of Monsanto, its American agribusiness rival, in August.

{"date": "2018-03-23 00:00:00", "text": "But whether we like it or not, that line has already been crossed. A recent study led by the economist Daniel Benjamin compiled information on the number of years of education from more than 400,000 people, almost all of whom were of European ancestry. After controlling for differences in socioeconomic background, he and his colleagues identified 74 genetic variations that are over-represented in genes known to be important in neurological development, each of which is incontrovertibly more common in Europeans with more years of education than in Europeans with fewer years of education.\n\nIt is not yet clear how these genetic variations operate. A follow-up study of Icelanders led by the geneticist Augustine Kong showed that these genetic variations also nudge people who carry them to delay having children. So these variations may be explaining longer times at school by affecting a behavior that has nothing to do with intelligence.\n\nThis study has been joined by others finding genetic predictors of behavior. One of these, led by the geneticist Danielle Posthuma, studied more than 70,000 people and found genetic variations in more than 20 genes that were predictive of performance on intelligence tests.\n\nIs performance on an intelligence test or the number of years of school a person attends shaped by the way a person is brought up? Of course. But does it measure something having to do with some aspect of behavior or cognition? Almost certainly. And since all traits influenced by genetics are expected to differ across populations (because the frequencies of genetic variations are rarely exactly the same across populations), the genetic influences on behavior and cognition will differ across populations, too.\n\nYou will sometimes hear that any biological differences among populations are likely to be small, because humans have diverged too recently from common ancestors for substantial differences to have arisen under the pressure of natural selection. This is not true. The ancestors of East Asians, Europeans, West Africans and Australians were, until recently, almost completely isolated from one another for 40,000 years or longer, which is more than sufficient time for the forces of evolution to work. Indeed, the study led by Dr. Kong showed that in Iceland, there has been measurable genetic selection against the genetic variations that predict more years of education in that population just within the last century.\n\nTo understand why it is so dangerous for geneticists and anthropologists to simply repeat the old consensus about human population differences, consider what kinds of voices are filling the void that our silence is creating. Nicholas Wade, a longtime science journalist for The New York Times, rightly notes in his 2014 book, \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History,\u201d that modern research is challenging our thinking about the nature of human population differences. But he goes on to make the unfounded and irresponsible claim that this research is suggesting that genetic factors explain traditional stereotypes.\n\nOne of Mr. Wade\u2019s key sources, for example, is the anthropologist Henry Harpending, who has asserted that people of sub-Saharan African ancestry have no propensity to work when they don\u2019t have to because, he claims, they did not go through the type of natural selection for hard work in the last thousands of years that some Eurasians did. There is simply no scientific evidence to support this statement. Indeed, as 139 geneticists (including myself) pointed out in a letter to The New York Times about Mr. Wade\u2019s book, there is no genetic evidence to back up any of the racist stereotypes he promotes.", "title": "Opinion | How Genetics Is Changing Our Understanding of \u2018Race\u2019", "authors": []}

So Coach Greg Kampe and the other assistants watched film and came up with adjustments in how they defended such situations; by last season, Oakland had become one of the nation\u2019s best teams in that category, and ended up winning the Horizon League regular-season title.\n\n\u201cThe analytics are very important,\u201d Varlan said. \u201cIt starts conversations is what it really does.

A few years later, he created his own website, Basketball Value, while working as a management consultant in Princeton, N.J.\n\n\n\nThat website\u2019s examination of adjusted plus-minus data caught the attention of N.B.A. front offices and led to paid consulting jobs with the 76ers and the Memphis Grizzlies over the next few years. In 2012, the 76ers hired him as their director of basketball analytics, a role he held for the next three years.

Then he watched his late friend\u2019s legacy crumble as the South\u2019s last two presidents, both conservatives, worked with Washington to isolate Pyongyang with sanctions and pressure.\n\nThe nation\u2019s progressives have long been skeptical of that hard-line approach, arguing that sanctions alone would never persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and would increase the risk of war. They looked forward to a new approach when Mr. Moon returned them to power last year.\n\nUnlike conservatives whose overriding concern is the alliance with Washington, \u201cthe progressives see peace on the Korean Peninsula, dialogue and reconciliation with the North as their top priority,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Moon\u2019s election came as Mr. Kim was accelerating his weapons program and building missiles that could reach the United States. Mr. Trump stepped up pressure on the North and escalated tensions with belligerent rhetoric, leaving Mr. Moon increasingly out of step with Washington.\n\nEven as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s tough talk, Mr. Moon repeatedly spoke out against a military strike \u2014 in effect, undermining the credibility of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats.\n\n\u201cNo one shall take a military action on the Korean Peninsula without South Korean consent,\u201d he said in August, arguing that attacking the North would trigger a catastrophic war in Korea. \u201cWe will prevent war whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nLeft-wing governments in South Korea have been in conflict with the United States before. Mr. Roh, for example, said the South would no longer be a junior partner in a \u201clopsided\u201d alliance with Washington and sought to improve relations with China, the nation\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\nBut Mr. Moon has proved more pragmatic and politically adroit than Mr. Roh. He quickly decided to keep an American missile-defense battery whose deployment his supporters had vehemently opposed. And he has gone to great lengths to play to Mr. Trump\u2019s ego, repeatedly thanking the American president for his support and crediting his policies for bringing Mr. Kim to the negotiating table.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven after Mr. Trump accused South Korea of \u201cappeasement\u201d in September, a remarkable charge against an ally and one that damaged Mr. Moon politically, the South Korean leader was careful to avoid exacerbating the rift.\n\nThen, on New Year\u2019s Day, when Mr. Kim suddenly accepted Mr. Moon\u2019s invitation to send North Korean athletes to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Mr. Moon moved quickly to embrace the overture, setting off a diplomatic flurry that at times has left the Trump administration struggling to catch up.\n\n\u201cHe has learned lessons from the Roh Moo-hyun era \u2014 that it does no good to his country to provoke the United States,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cIf Roh was blunt and in-your-face, Moon is much more cautious and sophisticated.

Mr. Kim also withdrew his threat to resume weapons tests if the United States and South Korea went ahead with joint military exercises in April, and pledged a freeze on such tests while talks were ongoing.\n\nThe South Korean envoys said Mr. Kim even joked about how he is depicted in foreign news media, and passed on an apology to Mr. Moon for conducting early-morning missile tests that caused him to lose sleep.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nConservatives have attacked Mr. Moon as dangerously na\u00efve.

And at Monday\u2019s meeting, he arranged to meet Mr. Kim on the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone between their two nations rather than fly to Pyongyang as two of his predecessors have.\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s office said that an impressive array of senior American officials gathered in the White House to hear his envoys\u2019 briefing on Thursday, including Vice President Mike Pence, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and others.

The eventual goal is to translate their gains into parliamentary seats, ministerial posts and formalized control over state institutions.\n\nThe transformation of wartime militias into prominent political actors is exemplified by the evolution of Shiite militias in Iraq into versions of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. The Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, which gained notoriety for sectarian atrocities and attacks on Western and Iraqi personnel, was established by Iran after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Today it runs extensive social and religious activities, including medical centers and clinics, independently of the Iraqi government.\n\nIran\u2019s proxies in Iraq dominate the Popular Mobilization Forces, a volunteer organization of 100,000 fighters established in 2014 after the Islamic State seized Mosul and the Iraqi military collapsed. Iranian pressure pushed the Shiite-dominated Iraqi state to legalize the force in 2016, providing it with substantial financial resources and heavy weaponry.\n\nThe Shiite proxies of Iran in Syria are motivated by the fear that the overthrow of the Assad regime would be an existential threat to the Shiite faith, a fear that Tehran encourages. Iran builds social and religious networks centered on the Shiite faith and support for Iran\u2019s theocracy. Through technical support and sophisticated use of propaganda, Iran amplifies the voice of its proxies. Collectively, these allow Tehran to circumvent local and national authorities and ultimately shape governments, settle disputes and, consequently, decide policies.\n\nIt dismays local political actors but in countries devastated by war, Iran\u2019s rivals are often too weak to counter its narrative and its networks on the ground.\n\nUnlike the rotating cast of American officials and military leaders, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 elite Quds Force, and his men have great autonomy and long engagement in the region. General Soleimani has run the Quds Force since 1998 and, along with his deputies, has invested decades of time and energy into developing relations with armed groups and political parties of all stripes across the region.\n\nFor militias, the corps is a desirable patron or partner, with its record of enforcing red lines and standing by its allies.

Of course, as in every human affair, motivations for losing faith in Islam are complex and vary from individual to individual. But suffering from the oppression or violence perpetrated in the name of religion is cited very often.\n\nTake, for example, the words of Azam Kamguian, an Iranian former Muslim, in \u201cLeaving Islam: Apostates Speak Out,\u201d a collection of memoirs. \u201cI have lived thousands of days in Iran when Islam has shed blood,\u201d he wrote, referring to the violence of the Islamic Revolution. \u201cIslam ruined the lives, dreams, hopes and aspirations of three consecutive generations.\u201d The perpetrator of the mass killings or jailings he talks about was, of course, not \u201cIslam\u201d; it was the Islamic Republic of Iran. But apparently it is easy to conflate the two, extending a resentment of a theocratic regime to the theology it claims to represent.\n\nThis trend is certainly not limited to Iran. Authoritarianism, violence, bigotry and patriarchy in the name of Islam are alienating people in almost every Muslim-majority nation. On Twitter, a campaign titled #ExMuslimBecause lists plenty of such reasons \u2014 for example, the despotism of the Saudi religion police, the attacks on secular bloggers in Bangladesh, the demonization of gay people in Malaysia.\n\nEven in officially secular Turkey, my country, the growing assertiveness of religious conservatives pushes the young generation toward deism \u2014 belief in a god, but no religion \u2014 as one concerned Turkish theologian and commentator on religion, Mustafa Ozturk, has written in the newspaper Karar.", "title": "Opinion | How Islamism Drives Muslims to Convert", "authors": []}

How much time did the \u201cdoffing and donning\u201d actually take? Ten to 15 minutes, as the workers claimed, or only two or three minutes, as the employer insisted? The record was bare on this question; the case reached the appeals court on summary judgment, meaning that there had not been a trial.\n\nTaking matters into his own hands, Judge Posner \u201cdecided to experiment with a novel approach,\u201d as he described his action in the opinion. He bought a set of the safety clothing from the plant\u2019s supplier (\u201cIt is inexpensive,\u201d he noted). He then had three \u201cmembers of the court\u2019s staff\u201d put the clothing on and take it off while being videotaped. The process took an average of 110 seconds.\n\n\u201cThis was not evidence,\u201d Judge Posner wrote, adding that \u201cthe intention was to satisfy curiosity rather than to engage in appellate fact-finding.\u201d His tone, for once, was a bit defensive, no doubt because of a pushback from a member of his three-judge panel, Chief Judge Diane P. Wood. Judge Posner\u2019s majority opinion found for the company. Judge Wood dissented, objecting that the majority had both \u201cerred as a matter of law\u201d and \u201cgone beyond the proper appellate role.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether California could constitutionally ban the sale of violent video games to minors. (The case, Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association has gained new attention recently, now that President Trump has decided that video games are the cause of school massacres.) By a vote of 7 to 2, the court held that California\u2019s law violated the First Amendment. Four years later, Justice Elena Kagan returned to Harvard Law School, where she had served as dean, and told a story in an onstage conversation with her successor as dean, Martha Minow.", "title": "Opinion | How Judges Know What They Know", "authors": []}

A chapter toward the end explores the complications of swearing in a second language, endorsing the intriguing idea that you don\u2019t truly know a foreign tongue unless you understand how to curse in it. Swearing suggests that you\u2019ve absorbed a culture, including its taboos, a trickier accomplishment than it may seem. Consider, for example, the poor souls who translated \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d into Spanish, a language in which there is no word quite as offensive and as adaptable as our beloved English F-word. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily encouraging people to swear more,\u201d Byrne writes, \u201cbut I do hope you might give it the respect it [expletive] deserves.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nHOW WE TALK\n\nThe Inner Workings of Conversation\n\nBy N. J. Enfield\n\n257 pp. Basic Books. $27.\n\nHere\u2019s a fun fact: Did you know that in conversation, people tend to respond to each other within one-fifth of a second \u2014 about as fast as it takes to blink an eye? Or did you know that men use words like \u201cum\u201d and \u201cuh\u201d more often than women do? And were you aware that people take about 35 milliseconds to answer \u201cyes\u201d to questions, whereas \u201cno\u201d answers take nearly twice that long?\n\nEnfield is a linguist at the University of Sydney, whose research uncovers meaning in the minutiae of everyday chatter. The slight pauses and the little words we think of as filler \u2014 our ums, our mm-hmms, our huhs \u2014 are in truth examples of the tacit rules of human conversation. Huh allows the listener to catch up with the speaker, while mm-hmm can function as a conversational turn pass: I\u2019m with you, keep going. And um turns out to be an extraordinary word when you think about it as deeply as Enfield has. Among its many uses is to say that you know you\u2019re obligated to answer a question within the customary one-second window, but you\u2019re having trouble saying whatever it is you want to say. Um communicates all of this, while at the same time signaling that you\u2019re not done speaking yet, thank you. (This floor-holding usage may also help illuminate the um-uh gender gap.)\n\nSome passages will be hazy for the sociolinguistic novice, at times feeling like a string of fun facts divorced from a coherent point. I, for one, am not sure I am knowledgeable enough to appreciate the difference between 600 milliseconds and 100 milliseconds in a conversational pause. Yet Enfield\u2019s overall understanding of conversation is unexpectedly moving. You might have heard of his work: In 2013, he co-wrote an exceedingly media-friendly study claiming that \u201cHuh?\u201d may be a universal word, appearing in 10 languages across five continents. To Enfield\u2019s annoyance, many journalists misunderstood that study\u2019s point, writing that the word \u201csignals total confusion\u201d no matter what language you speak. \u201cBut \u2018huh?\u2019 does not stand for universal confusion,\u201d Enfield writes. \u201cIt stands for universal cooperation.\u201d It\u2019s the unseen evidence of the ways we help one another out, with the goal of mutual understanding. Mm-hmm.\n\nImage\n\nHOW LANGUAGE BEGAN\n\nThe Story of Humanity\u2019s Greatest Invention\n\nBy Daniel L. Everett\n\n330 pp. Liveright. $28.95.\n\nConsider the simple command, \u201cStop the car at the stop sign!\u201d Many people reading this will be part of the American driving culture, and so will know what this means: \u201cBring the vehicle to a complete stop roughly one to five feet before the front of the car passes the stop sign.\u201d But to someone unfamiliar with our traffic customs, the order might appear rather vague. Should you stop 200 yards in front of it? Ten feet in front of it?

{"date": "2018-03-03 00:00:00", "text": "To effect this transformation is one of the great political challenges of our age. It requires principled resistance to right-wing nationalism, but it can succeed only if those who are most open to diversity abandon their hostility to other forms of nationalism.\n\nOne common reaction to the dangerous excesses of nationalism has been to forgo the need for any form of collective identity, exhorting people to transcend tribal allegiances completely. But for better or probably worse, it\u2019s easier to be moved by the suffering of people with whom we have some form of kinship. That is why nationalism remains one of the most powerful vehicles for expanding our circle of sympathy.\n\nAnother common reaction to the resurgence of nationalism has been to celebrate more narrow forms of collective identity, such as race or religion. At a time when many minority groups are under attack, it is, of course, crucial to defend them against discrimination. But it is also important to remember that such groups, too, are capable of oppressing their own members, for example by enforcing restrictive moral codes. That\u2019s why the only way to allow individuals true freedom to lead their lives is to preserve some form of political identity independent of the interests of particular cultural groups.\n\nConvinced that they would be unable to redirect nationalism toward their own ends, many of the most open-minded segments of society long ago gave up on the fight to determine its meaning. In countries like Germany and the United States, advocacy for the victims of prejudice has increasingly bled into a belief that the dark chapters of those countries\u2019 history make any form of nationalism deeply suspect. Instead of exhorting their fellow citizens to live up to their nations\u2019 highest ideals, many activists seem content with denouncing past and present injustices. This has allowed the bigots and racists to bend the meaning of the nation to their own sinister ends.\n\nIt\u2019s time to fight back. Nationalism can, and should, be reclaimed for liberals.\n\nA few political leaders have made a valiant start. Barack Obama has been an especially persuasive advocate of the idea that Americans should focus on what unites rather than what divides us and that the symbolism of the nation can inspire hope, even as we reckon with the injustices of American history. \u201cWhat greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this,\u201d Mr. Obama marveled as he stood on the spot in Selma, Ala. where civil rights protesters were beaten in 1965. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals?\u201d\n\nCampaigning for France\u2019s presidency last year, Emmanuel Macron expressed inclusive patriotism in an even more explicit form. \u201cI see Armenians, Italians, Algerians, Moroccans, Tunisians,\u201d he said at a rally in Marseille, a diverse city in southern France, \u201cBut what do I see? I see the people of Marseille! What do I see? I see the people of France!\u201d This, he added in an explicit repudiation of the exclusive nationalism propagated by the far-right National Front party, \u201cis what it means to be proud to be French!\u201d\n\nAmerican \u2014 and to a lesser degree European \u2014 political culture is pregnant with the symbols of inclusive patriotism. But while we have plenty of history to build on, we must also recognize that we are fighting to establish a kind of society for which there is no clear precedent.\n\nIn the United States, the model had once been a melting pot. But asking individuals to conform to one unified culture puts the price of admission to the nation too high. In Canada, the model is often said to be that of a salad bowl, in which the overall dish is enriched by the great variety of individual ingredients. But we can now see that this may be an overly idealized image of a society in which people feel that they have little in common across ethnic and religious divides.", "title": "Opinion | How Liberals Can Reclaim Nationalism", "authors": []}

Falsehoods were 70 percent more likely to be retweeted, even when controlling for the age of the original tweeter\u2019s account, its activity level, the number of its followers and followees, and whether Twitter had verified the account as genuine. These effects were more pronounced for false political stories than for any other type of false news.\n\nSurprisingly, Twitter users who spread false stories had, on average, significantly fewer followers, followed significantly fewer people, were significantly less active on Twitter, were verified as genuine by Twitter significantly less often and had been on Twitter for significantly less time than were Twitter users who spread true stories. Falsehood diffused farther and faster despite these seeming shortcomings.\n\nAnd despite concerns about the role of web robots in spreading false stories, we found that human behavior contributed more to the differential spread of truth and falsity than bots did. Using established bot-detection algorithms, we found that bots accelerated the spread of true stories at approximately the same rate as they accelerated the spread of false stories, implying that false stories spread more than true ones as a result of human activity.\n\nWhy would that be?

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Forty-four percent of local governments report that they regularly face cyberattacks, on either an hourly or daily basis. More troubling is the high percentage of governments that do not know how often they are attacked (28 percent) or breached (41 percent). Further, a majority of local governments do not catalog or count attacks (54 percent).\n\nThis is not just an American problem. Last month, at a conference in Tel Aviv, Tamir Pardo, the former head of Mossad, Israel\u2019s national intelligence agency, said that most local government leaders around the world do not fully understand how serious a threat cyberattacks are and have not imaginatively assessed the consequences of inaction. He described cyberthreats as \u201csoft nuclear weapons\u201d that one day may be used to start and finish a war without firing a shot.\n\nSo what should local governments do to improve their cybersecurity apparatus to help prevent or mitigate damage from future attacks like the one experienced in Atlanta, or from those contemplated by Mr. Pardo?\n\nFirst, local leaders must create a culture of cybersecurity that imagines worst-case scenarios and explores a range of solutions to mitigate threats to the ecosystem of local government technology. This should involve prioritizing funding for cybersecurity, establishing stronger cybersecurity policies and training employees in cybersecurity protocols. Success will require collaboration with local elected officials, internet-technology and cybersecurity staff members, department managers and end users.\n\nCybersecurity is more than just the I.T. department\u2019s problem. It must now also be a top priority along the entire chain of elected and appointed officials in and around local governments. Preventing and mitigating the effects of future attacks will require intergovernmental cooperation, because localities work together across state lines and collaborate with the federal government on crucial tasks like running elections, managing transportation and sharing intelligence.\n\nMost technological advances are transforming local governments for the better, moving them from inefficient and costly paper systems to digital systems that allow for better analysis and understanding of policy decisions. The science of analytics and big data promises even greater leaps for local governments in evidence-based policymaking. These exciting developments may one day radically alter the ways that traditional local government services are financed, operated and managed.", "title": "Opinion | How Local Governments Can Prevent Cyberattacks", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-03 00:00:00", "text": "Even New York\u2019s prestigious Winter Antiques Show has changed its rules. Founded in 1955, the show once required that exhibited pieces be at least 100 years old. In 2009, the organizers and dealer committee changed the cutoff date to 1969 to include midcentury objects. In 2016, they removed the date restriction entirely, paving the way for contemporary design.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBy expanding the datelines we were registering changes in the antiques world,\u201d said Michael Diaz-Griffith, the fair\u2019s associate executive director. \u201cWe\u2019re just allowing it to happen instead of being so rule-bound that we create an artificial zone where those market shifts, and shifts in taste, can\u2019t be seen.\u201d\n\nOne exhibitor to take advantage of that change is Jason Jacques Gallery, which was once known primarily as a dealer of late 19th and early 20th century European ceramics but is increasingly focused on contemporary design.\n\nAt the 2018 Winter Antiques Show in January, its presentation included a pair of black plywood benches sprouting moose antlers by the fashion designer Rick Owens (about $5,500) and a new seven-foot-tall Rococo-inspired porcelain wall piece resembling a medallion by Katsuyo Aoki and Shinichiro Kitaura ($250,000).\n\nThe medallion \u201cwas probably one of the most Instagrammed pieces in the entire fair,\u201d said the gallery\u2019s director Jason T. Busch, noting that he expects contemporary design to become an even larger part of his business in the coming years. \u201cWe\u2019re going to always have work from our historic program, but I think it will be integrated within the contemporary.\u201d\n\nThe online antiques marketplace 1stdibs (to whose magazine this reporter occasionally contributes) has also been looking to capitalize on the trend. It began a contemporary category in November 2016. One year later, contemporary design represented 15 percent of the company\u2019s furniture sales, and the offering had expanded to include about 30,000 products by more than 500 artisans and small manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our fastest growing category,\u201d said Cristina Miller, the company\u2019s chief commercial officer.\n\nPhoto\n\nIndeed, a recent survey 1stdibs commissioned found that professional interior designers used about 65 percent contemporary products in their projects last year, and only 35 percent vintage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Declining Value of Antiques\n\nCompared with the heyday of antiques collecting, prices for average pieces are now \u201c80 percent off,\u201d said Colin Stair, the owner of Stair Galleries auction house in Hudson, N.Y. \u201cYour typical Georgian 18th century furniture, chests of drawers, tripod tables, Pembroke tables,\u201d he noted, can all be had for a fraction of what they cost 15 to 20 years ago.\n\nIn 2002, Mr. Stair sold a set of eight George III-style carved mahogany chairs for $8,000; in 2016, he sold a similar set of eight chairs for $350.\n\nIn 2003, he dispatched a Regency breakfront bookcase for $9,500; in 2016, the sales price of an equivalent piece had plummeted to $1,300.\n\nThere are exceptions. Some designers and homeowners still mix antiques with contemporary furniture to create eclectic interiors, and particularly stylish pieces can bring high prices. Dealers of Asian antiques, like Betsy Nathan, the owner of Chicago-based Pagoda Red, report strong sales to overseas buyers (\u201cWe\u2019re shipping back to Asia now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a million years, I never would have imagined it.\u201d) Some passionate collectors also are willing to pay for pure historical value.\n\nMr. Stair\u2019s highlights from the past year include a George I cut-gesso and giltwood table that sold for $31,000 and a Louis XVI mahogany desk that sold for $13,000.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut antiques that move for more than $10,000 in his auction house are rare, he noted, and the market for midcentury modern furniture without a recognizable name attached \u2013 popular just a few years ago \u2013 is also flagging.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just as fickle,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless it\u2019s special, has a name brand or is sexy, it\u2019ll die just as hard as a piece of brown Georgian furniture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChanging Tastes\n\nDealers, auctioneers and designers point to a number of reasons for the declining interest in antiques and rapid rise of contemporary design. More homes have open-concept, casual living spaces rather than formal dining rooms and studies, which reduces the need for stately mahogany dining tables, chairs and cabinets.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many designers say that antiques will rise again but, after nearly two decades of decline, few are willing to predict when.\n\n\u201cThe pendulum is going to swing just like it does in politics,\u201d said Mr. Hayes. \u201cIt always does. But I don\u2019t see it coming anytime soon.\u201d\n\nJamie Drake, the New York interior designer, also views the current dismissal of antiques as a trend, \u201cjust as color trends have moved from neutrals to vibrants, back to neutrals, back to vibrants,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his own home, most of the furniture and art is contemporary and modern, \u201cbut I do still have some antiques,\u201d he said.\n\nA home without them, he added, \u201cwould be like a sentence without punctuation.\u201d", "title": "How Low Will Market for Antiques Actually Go?", "authors": ["Tim Mckeough"]}

It sounds like a pitch that would make Hollywood producers screw up their faces and scream, \u201cNext!\u201d But the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro not only procured a $19.5 million budget for \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d but also made it into a commercial and critical success, in the running for 13 prizes at the Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday.\n\nIf Mr. del Toro wins the best director award at the Oscars, it will be the fourth time a filmmaker from Mexico has taken the prize in five years, all with unconventional films. Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu won in 2015 for \u201cBirdman,\u201d the bizarrely hilarious tale of an aging superhero actor trying to get serious on Broadway, and he did it again in 2016 with \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d a radically different western focused on a quest for revenge in subzero temperatures. Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n triumphed in 2014 with \u201cGravity,\u201d a sci-fi story that many said was impossible to make, before it made over $723 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nReferred to as \u201cThe Three Amigos,\u201d the title of a book about their transnational cinema, these directors are not the only Mexican filmmakers who have won recent accolades in Hollywood. There is also the cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who has three Oscars; Rodrigo Prieto, who shot \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u201d \u201cArgo\u201d and \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d; and another Oscar winner, the production designer Eugenio Caballero.\n\nThe Amigos\u2019 success shows the strength of an artistic circle; they are longtime friends who have encouraged one another to take risks. They began making their films when the Mexican industry was at a low in the 1980s, dominated by raunchy movies about escort bars and overshadowed by telenovela soaps.

In most states, voters are confined to one party in the primary but may vote for whoever they like in the general. So the primary vote is an imperfect measure of partisan preference, not a measure of how voters feel about a particular race.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s useless. Presidential vote choice, the most common indicator of a district\u2019s partisanship, is also a deeply imperfect measure, so there\u2019s value in adding the primaries to the mix.\n\nThere are places like West Virginia, where Republicans dominate in presidential elections but where the right kind of Democrat can take advantage of the state\u2019s latent Democratic tradition. Conor Lamb might be doing so in the special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District, which adjoins West Virginia and still has a Democratic registration advantage. And there are places like Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Atlanta where one could wonder whether a strongly Republican tradition will cut against Democratic chances in places where Mr. Trump struggled.\n\nThe primary vote is another good measure of the partisan makeup of a state.\n\nTake one of this year\u2019s first primary states: Illinois. Based on recent presidential election results, it might appear that a Republican incumbent, Mike Bost, should be well positioned to hold a district that Mr. Trump won by 15 points. But this district has a strong Democratic tradition; Senator Tammy Duckworth actually carried Mr. Bost\u2019s district by more than a 10-point margin against an incumbent Republican last November.\n\nPrimary votes there reveal the district\u2019s Democratic tradition: Even in 2016, Democratic primary voters outnumbered Republicans in the presidential primary. This suggests that Mr. Bost might be much more vulnerable than the typical Republican in a district that voted for Mr. Trump by so much.", "title": "How Much Can Primaries Predict the General Election?", "authors": []}

They conclude that the mutation arose roughly 7,300 years ago in West Africa.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater, migrants spread the mutation across much of Africa and then to other parts of the world. Wherever people suffered from malaria, the protective gene thrived \u2014 but brought sickle cell anemia with it.\n\nToday, sickle cell anemia remains a heavy burden on public health. In many poor countries, most children with the disease still die young. In the United States, the average life span of sufferers has been extended into the early 40s.\n\nDr. Rotimi said that an improved understanding of the history of sickle cell anemia could lead to better medical care. It might allow researchers to predict who will suffer severe symptoms and who will only experience mild ones.\n\n\u201cIt would definitely help physicians to treat patients at a global level,\u201d he said.\n\nDoctors in the United States first noticed sickle cell anemia in the early 1900s. The disease got its name from the way it changed the shape of red blood cells from healthy disks to abnormal curves.\n\nMost cases turned up in African-Americans, doctors found. But 8 percent of African-Americans had at least some sickle-shaped blood cells, even though the vast majority had no symptoms at all.\n\nBy 1950, researchers had resolved this paradox, discovering the difference between carrying one mutated copy of the hemoglobin gene and carrying two copies. By then it had also become clear that sickle cell anemia was not unique to the United States.\n\nIn Africa, researchers found sickle-shaped red blood cells in people across a broad belt, from Nigeria in West Africa to Tanzania in the east. The cells also turned up at high rates in people in parts of the Near East and India, and in southern European countries such as Greece.\n\nGenetically speaking, this made no sense. Because inheriting two copies of the gene is so deadly, the mutation should have become rarer with passing generations, not more common.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1954, a South African-born geneticist named Anthony C. Allison observed that people in Uganda who carried a copy of the sickle cell mutation suffered fewer malaria infections than people with normal hemoglobin.\n\nLater research confirmed Dr. Allison\u2019s finding. The sickle cell mutation seemed to defend against malaria by starving the single-celled parasite that causes the disease. The parasite feeds on hemoglobin, and so it\u2019s possible that it can\u2019t grow on the sickle cell version of the molecule.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These are named for the places where they were most common: Arabian/Indian, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic and Senegal.\n\nThese haplotypes became important for diagnosing sickle cell anemia, because some appeared to cause more severe disease than others. But the haplotypes also gave scientists a chance to explore the history of the mutation.\n\n\u201cIt has been an open question as to whether the actual sickle cell mutation itself emerged several times or just once,\u201d said Dr. Penman.\n\nSome researchers saw the five haplotypes as evidence that the mutation arose on five separate occasions in five different places. Other researchers thought it unlikely that genetic lightning could strike so many times.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018How do we jump into this forty-year debate?\u2019\u201d said Dr. Rotimi.\n\nHe and Dr. Shriner examined the genomes of 2,932 people from around the world. They found that 156 of the subjects \u2014 mostly from Africa, but also from Barbados, the United States, Colombia and Qatar \u2014 carried a copy of the sickle cell mutation.\n\nThe researchers scanned the DNA surrounding the mutation in those people. While most of it was identical from person to person, in some spots it differed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCombining their findings, the researchers concluded that all 156 people inherited the same mutation from a single person who lived roughly 7,300 years ago. \u201cThis alone is a big contribution to our understanding,\u201d said Dr. Penman.\n\nThe new study also offers hints as to how the mutation spread to millions of descendants.\n\nThe oldest version of the sickle cell mutation is found in people from western and central Africa. They may have inherited it from an ancestor in the green Sahara.\n\nThe mutation might have spread to other parts of Africa with the expansion of a people called the Bantu. Arising about 5,000 years ago around what is now Cameroon and Nigeria, they converted woodlands to farm fields on a massive scale.\n\nAs they cleared land for agriculture, they may have promoted the spread of malaria by mosquitoes. The insects thrived by laying eggs in standing water around the farms and feeding on the growing population of farmers. The intensification of malaria in human populations may also have accelerated the spread of the protective sickle cell mutation.\n\nOver the next few thousand years, the Bantu carried the mutation across much of eastern, central and southern Africa, Dr. Shriner and Dr. Rotimi conclude. In places where malaria was prevalent, the mutation offered protection. But malaria is rarer in southern Africa, and there the sickle cell mutation became rarer, too.\n\nLater, the study suggests, Africans carried the mutation to other parts of the world. Waves of migrants made their way to the Near East. As people from different ancestries interbred, the mutation made its way further afield, into Europe and India.\n\nSome West Africans captured in the slave trade brought the sickle cell mutation to the Americas. But in places like the United States, where malaria was uncommon or nonexistent, the mutation offered less of an evolutionary advantage. As a result, African-Americans have a lower rate of sickle cell anemia than Africans today.\n\nFrederick B. Piel, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said he looked forward to bigger genome-based studies on the sickle cell mutation. It remains to be seen if these patterns can be found in thousands of carriers, instead of just 156, he said.\n\nDr. Penman said that scientists also should study the different genetic variations identified in the new research. These may help explain why the sickle cell mutation leads to deadly symptoms in some people and only mild ones in others \u2014 something that scientists still can\u2019t explain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis knowledge might inspire treatments in itself,\u201d she said.", "title": "How One Child\u2019s Sickle Cell Mutation Helped Protect the World From Malaria", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

I started this latest round of the debate with the presumption that supporters of moderate gun restrictions are popularly strong but legislatively weak. Since Sandy Hook in 2012, more than two dozen states have passed gun laws and almost all of those laws have LOOSENED gun restrictions. Roughly 360 gun bills have been introduced in Congress, and they have all failed but one, which also loosened gun use.\n\nThe blunt fact is that Republicans control most legislatures. To get anything passed, I thought, it would be necessary to separate some Republicans from the absolutist N.R.A. position. To do that you have to depolarize the issue: show gun owners some respect, put red state figures at the head and make the gun discussion look more like the opioid discussion. The tribalists in this country have little interest in the opioid issue. As a result, a lot of pragmatic things are being done across partisan lines.\n\nThe people pushing for gun restrictions have basically done the exact opposite of what I thought was wise. Instead of depolarizing the issue they have massively polarized it. The students from Parkland are being assisted by all the usual hyper-polarizing left-wing groups: Planned Parenthood, Move On and the Women\u2019s March. The rhetoric has been extreme. Marco Rubio has been likened to a mass murderer while the N.R.A. has been called a terrorist organization.\n\nThe early results would seem to completely vindicate my position. The Florida Legislature turned aside gun restrictions. New gun measures in Congress have been quickly shelved. Democrats are more likely to lose House and Senate seats in the key 2018 pro-gun states.

Plus: Five designers create original furniture, exclusively for T.\n\nWHEN WE TALK about artists making furniture, an old debate over whether design counts as art (and vice versa) rises once again to the surface, like a shark baited with chum. Furniture designers aren\u2019t, by the logic of the category, really artists, and artists, by that same logic, must normally be engaged in a higher pursuit than furniture. Only on occasion \u2014 thanks to a creative block, a desire to make (more) money, or a temporary absence of mind \u2014 do artists descend from the empyrean to sanctify the grimy world of designer-makers. Furniture, lovely though it sometimes may be, is functional and commercial; art is timeless and to be contemplated.\n\nThat few artists or designers today would accept the terms of this debate is in part because of the 1970s and \u201980s rise of postmodernism in both art and design. Postmodernists made an infamous show of confusing distinctions, and the idea that an artist\u2019s work could also include chairs and tables became commonplace.

One of the many big-name showrunners who got their start on \u201cRoseanne,\u201d she helped write this episode when she was still Amy Sherman. As in \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d Sherman-Palladino\u2019s first hit, the mother-daughter bonding quotient here is high. When 17-year-old Becky asks her mom for help getting birth control, Roseanne struggles to reconcile her feminist beliefs with an instinct to protect her kid.\n\n\u201cDarlene Fades to Black\u201d\n\nTV has made great strides in representing mental illness in the past few years, but it wasn\u2019t always so sensitive to those issues. In that respect, as in many others, \u201cRoseanne\u201d was ahead of its time with this 1991 episode about Darlene\u2019s depression. Without getting too dark, the show paints a realistic portrait of a teen who suddenly loses her enthusiasm for school, family, sports and her social life \u2014 and two parents who desperately want to help her but don\u2019t know how.\n\n0\n\n\u201cAliens\u201d\n\nWhen \u201cRoseanne\u201d ended its fourth season, in May of 1992, the United States was recovering from a recession, and the unemployment rate was higher than it had been since the early \u201980s. The show addressed that crisis with a wrenching finale that illustrates the real impact of economic flux on a family that\u2019s trying to live the American dream while surviving from paycheck to paycheck. First, Roseanne loses her job as a diner waitress as Dan\u2019s bike shop hemorrhages money. Then the Conners realize they don\u2019t have the money to send Becky to college.\n\nRoseanne Barr, left, and Laurie Metcalf in the \u201cRoseanne\u201d episode \u201cCrime and Punishment.\u201d ABC\n\nSeason 5\n\n\u201cTerms of Estrangement: Parts 1 and 2\u201d\n\nThis two-part season premiere takes place in the aftermath of the episode \u201cAliens,\u201d as Dan is forced to close his business, Roseanne combs the obituaries for job leads and Becky blows up at her father for leaving her boyfriend and his former mechanic, Mark (Glenn Quinn), unemployed. In their unflinching refusal to offer easy solutions to the Conners\u2019 plight, these episodes use searing gallows humor to convey the pain of feeling responsible for your children\u2019s broken dreams.\n\n\u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d and \u201cWar and Peace\u201d\n\nIn another great two-part story, the Conners reckon with violence against women \u2014 and the destructive cycles it can perpetuate. When Darlene discovers that Jackie\u2019s boyfriend has been hitting her, a family-wide reckoning ensues. As Roseanne pressures Jackie to leave him, the sisters are forced to confront their very different responses to having grown up with an abusive dad.\n\n\u201cWait Till Your Father Gets Home\u201d\n\nRoseanne\u2019s and Jackie\u2019s complicated feelings toward their father resurface in this emotional episode, which takes place in the aftermath of his death. After Jackie bristles at her sister\u2019s lingering contempt for him, Roseanne searches for some sign that he regretted hitting his kids. What she learns raises poignant questions about how we mourn the people who hurt us.\n\nJohn Goodman and Roseanne Barr in the \u201cRoseanne\u201d episode \u201cA Stash From the Past.\u201d ABC, via Everett Collection\n\nSeason 6\n\n\u201cA Stash From the Past\u201d\n\nMany \u201cRoseanne\u201d highlights veer into \u201cVery Special Episode\u201d territory, so the show\u2019s take on marijuana is refreshing. When Roseanne finds a bag of weed in the house, she assumes it belongs to Darlene\u2019s boyfriend, David (Johnny Galecki), and gives him the standard sitcom \u201cYou\u2019re ruining your life\u201d lecture. Then Dan realizes that the bag is actually Roseanne\u2019s from way back when, and \u2026 they relive their youth by getting high with Jackie. The scene in which Barr, Goodman and Metcalf are stoned in the bathroom is among the funniest moments in TV history.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d\n\n\u201cRoseanne\u201d helped break ground for L.G.B.T. representation with this episode from 1994, which was so provocative at the time that ABC almost didn\u2019t air it. Roseanne and Jackie spend a night at the gay bar with their friend Nancy (Sandra Bernhard) and her girlfriend, Sharon (Mariel Hemingway, in a charming guest appearance). While Jackie worries people will think she\u2019s a lesbian, Roseanne has a ball \u2014 until Sharon kisses her. Roseanne\u2019s subsequent reckoning with her own internalized homophobia is years ahead of its time.\n\n\u201cLies My Father Told Me\u201d\n\nLike Roseanne, Dan carries around plenty of baggage from childhood. So, when his beloved mother checks into a mental institution, he immediately blames the father who neglected, then left them when Dan was a kid. The story that develops from there is a remarkably generous meditation on how family narratives are shaped and whether it\u2019s possible to repair a relationship that has been broken for decades.\n\nFrom left, Fred Willard, Roseanne Barr and Martin Mull in the \u201cRoseanne\u201d episode \u201cDecember Bride.\u201d ABC, via Getty Images\n\nSeasons 7-9\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that \u201cRoseanne\u201d exceeded its natural life span by approximately three seasons. But even though they\u2019re pretty wacky, Seasons 7 through 9 feature their share of fun episodes.

It isn\u2019t just overt sexism, Chang explains. Rather, it\u2019s the kind of subtleties \u2014 the microaggressions \u2014 that are hard to pinpoint and often even harder to call out. The lack of role models; or the perception of socially awkward \u201cnerds\u201d as the ideal tech entrepreneurs. The fact that women\u2019s ideas are more harshly scrutinized, or that female engineers face 35 percent more rejections, as one data set found, of their code.

In an article last summer for the website of NRK, the national broadcaster, one survivor accused Mr. Poppe of \u201cturning my life\u2019s nightmare into popular entertainment\u201d and argued that Norwegians should instead be discussing the spread of Mr. Breivik\u2019s ideology.\n\nMr. Poppe said that he could not argue with survivors\u2019 personal feelings but that he believed that in an era of rising right-wing populism across Europe and in the rest of the Western world, he felt it was especially important to show the consequences of extremist ideology.\n\nIn preparing the film, Mr. Poppe and his team conducted interviews with over 40 survivors and incorporated their experiences into the script. One scene in which Kaja sings Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u201cTrue Colors\u201d to calm down other hiding youths, for instance, replicates a real moment on the island, even down to the song.\n\nMr. Poppe and his team filmed with a cast of amateur actors over five days in September last year, using loudspeakers to replicate the exact number of shots fired by Mr. Breivik. The speakers, he said, were turned away from the shoreline to avoid traumatizing neighbors, and several survivors were on set to ensure the film\u2019s accuracy. Mr. Poppe, who has previously worked as a war photographer, also partly drew on his experience working in conflict areas like Afghanistan.\n\nTo get the role of Kaja, Ms. Berntzen \u2014 a 20-year-old whose only previous acting experience had been in high school theatrical revues \u2014 had to undergo eight auditions and a psychiatric evaluation. And to maintain secrecy, she was only told midway through the process what the film was actually about. \u201cI remember thinking I should be happy if I don\u2019t get a role,\u201d she said in an interview, referring to the unusual approach.

But running through it was a theme: I know who I am, and that\u2019s exactly why you should believe me.\n\nMr. Cooper made the case that the story was worth covering, at double length, on CBS\u2019s flagship newsmagazine. He recognized the story was about sex, asking for details up front and pressing Ms. Clifford on her motives \u2014 whether she might get a book deal, for instance. But he moved on to look, at some length, at the possibility that a $130,000 payment for Ms. Clifford\u2019s silence might be an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nEven more, as the subject turned to threats, payoffs and nondisclosure agreements, the interview became about power, the ability of wealthy men to pay, pressure or coerce women into silence. (The alleged parking lot encounter aside, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers have openly threatened Ms. Clifford with financial ruin.) It\u2019s about who gets to decide when their stories get told and under what terms.\n\nMs. Clifford made a point of emphasizing that she was \u201cnot a victim\u201d in having sex with Mr. Trump, even though she described an encounter she was, at best, unenthusiastic about. \u201cYou put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this,\u201d she said.\n\nA few days earlier, Mr. Cooper sat down on CNN with Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who says she had an extended affair with Mr. Trump at around the same time as Ms. Clifford. Ms. McDougal described having been in love with Mr. Trump, then guilty and apologetic for having a relationship with a married man with a newborn child.\n\nMs. Clifford, on the other hand, represented herself as having no illusions about herself or Mr. Trump.

Members of Congress and economists are expressing concern that a trade war \u2014 which the president is unabashedly encouraging \u2014 could have a great impact on American consumers.\n\nIf the president is convinced that this country is victimized by unfair trade practices, he should be pursuing negotiation. Instead, as in the case of the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, he has chosen confrontation over reason.\n\nROGER HIRSCHBERG\n\nBONDVILLE, VT.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nThere is a real irony here. President Barack Obama helped save the American auto industry with a bailout. Like his method or not, it worked.

There are tequilas that could be compared to the most fine cognacs and scotches in the world.\u201d\n\nCasa Noble, which ages its agave distillate in French white oak, has found fans in millennial and Generation X urban dwellers. \u201cA lot of them didn\u2019t have a bad experience with tequilas, like the baby boomers,\u201d said Jose Hermosillo, known as Pepe, the C.E.O. of Casa Noble. \u201cThey\u2019re more willing to experiment.\u201d\n\nBefore a recent talk on female empowerment, entrepreneurship and tequila that Ms. Gonzalez gave at Neuehouse, a members-only club in Hollywood, waiters passed out flutes of Casa Dragones grassier blanco tequila, which guests regarded with curiosity.\n\n\u201cThe first sip was a little strong, the second was really smooth,\u201d said Jennifer Floyd, 44, a film producer. \u201cI think the key is getting past that first sip.\u201d\n\nJenae Owen, 27, a founder of In Flow Style, an online shop selling active wear, was more practiced. \u201cTequila is my go-to drink,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been sipping it since I was legal.

Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm\u2019s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.\n\nCambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.\n\nDuring a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.\n\n\u201cThis was a scam \u2014 and a fraud,\u201d Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday.

But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook\u2019s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.\n\nIn Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the \u201cBrexit\u201d campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was \u201cillegally acquired and used.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Mr. Mercer\u2019s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.\n\nPhoto\n\nCongressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company\u2019s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.\n\nWhile the substance of Mr. Mueller\u2019s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm\u2019s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news.

He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama\u2019s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters\u2019 behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.\n\nThe group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.\n\nThen a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? Do you have the next big story? Want to share it with The New York Times? We offer several ways to get in touch with and provide materials to our journalists.\n\nMr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America\u2019s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.\n\nMr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.\n\nThe Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.\n\nWhen Mr. Wylie\u2019s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.\n\n\u201cITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each).

Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University\u2019s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew \u2014 a claim that has been disputed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs \u2014 more than $800,000 \u2014 and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.\n\nAll he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was \u201ca very standard vanilla Facebook app.\u201d\n\nHe ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million \u2014 a number previously reported by The Intercept \u2014 contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users \u2014 those who participated in the survey \u2014 had consented to having their data harvested.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Wylie said the Facebook data was \u201cthe saving grace\u201d that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted as much as we could get,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cWhere it came from, who said we could have it \u2014 we weren\u2019t really asking.\u201d\n\nMr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan\u2019s contributions as \u201cfruitless.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn International Effort\n\nJust as Dr. Kogan\u2019s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL\u2019s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie\u2019s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.\n\nBut in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.\n\nIn a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself \u201cfrom substantive management\u201d of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, \u201cto manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.\u201d\n\nIn summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all \u201cpersonnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.\u201d Mr. Nix \u201cnever had any strategic or operational role\u201d in an American election campaign, the company said.\n\nWhether the company\u2019s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees\u2019 roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.\n\nCambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.\n\nPhoto\n\nCambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm\u2019s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy \u2014 statements disputed by other campaign officials \u2014 but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.\n\nIn a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on \u201clegacy psychographics\u201d built for the Cruz campaign.\n\nAfter the Leak\n\nBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.\n\nCambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former \u201ccontractors\u201d as engaging in \u201cwhat is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.\u201d\n\nNear the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was \u201ccarefully investigating this situation\u201d and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.\n\nFacebook verified the leak and \u2014 without publicly acknowledging it \u2014 sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. \u201cThis data was obtained and used without permission,\u201d said a letter that was obtained by the Times. \u201cIt cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.\u201d\n\nMr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and \u201cSCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook\u2019s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.\n\n\n\nToday, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.\n\nAll the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica\u2019s political business. No American campaigns or \u201csuper PACs\u201d have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age \u2014 a \u201cMath Man,\u201d he puts it.

Mr. Kim has driven the pace of this diplomatic effort so far, and American officials have conceded surprise at his boldness. And if Mr. Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, Mr. Kim may well wonder why he should negotiate with the United States if a subsequent president can simply pull the plug on any agreement.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy statute, Mr. Trump must decide by May 12 whether to make good on his threat to exit the Iran deal. American officials have said Mr. Trump could pull back if European allies agree to unilaterally crack down on Iran\u2019s missile development \u2014 which is not covered by the nuclear deal \u2014 and begin a process to make the limits on Iran\u2019s ability to produce nuclear material permanent.\n\nThe British and the French are reluctantly going along, though they say they fear that unilateral demands would blow up an arrangement that is working. German officials are balking, saying that extending the duration of the deal would require new negotiations, and new concessions.\n\nYet if Mr. Trump sticks with the agreement \u2014 as his top aides have quietly urged him to do \u2014 he faces a different challenge. While he will have to negotiate a deal with the North Koreans that is even stricter than the Iranian one that he has denounced as na\u00efve, insufficient and dangerous, that task will be made all the harder by the fact that Pyongyang, unlike Tehran, actually possesses nuclear weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNorth Korea has at least 20 by some estimates, or upward of 60 by the count of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Iran has never produced one.\n\nNorth Korea produces both plutonium and uranium, and the C.I.A. suspects that some of it is produced at hidden sites. Iran gave up about 97 percent of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, the material that the world feared it would use to \u201cbreak out\u201d of any agreement and build a bomb.\n\nEven with the most rigorous inspection regime, it will be hard to assure that the North Korean program is really dead. Faced with similar suspicions, Iran agreed to let inspectors roam the country. North Korea never has: Before international inspectors were thrown out of the country, they were limited to living and working at one site, the main nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So far, none of those conditions exist in dealing with North Korea.\n\n\u201cIf the president gets the North Koreans just to stop what they are doing, and perhaps get a timetable for future action, that would be a huge step in slowing the North Koreans\u2019 program,\u201d said Christopher Hill, who negotiated the last major deal that the United States had with North Korea, under the George W. Bush administration. \u201cBut it still wouldn\u2019t be close to what Iran agreed to do.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem is that North Korea\u2019s experience with its nuclear program is long and deep, which has left it adept at reversing even concessions that seemed large at the time.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen a 1994 agreement during the Clinton administration barred it from one pathway to the bomb, it struck a secret deal with the head of Pakistan\u2019s nuclear program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, and learned another.\n\nWhen Mr. Hill, now at the University of Denver, negotiated an accord at the end of the Bush administration, the North blew up its cooling tower at the Yongbyon reactor as evidence of its seriousness. It made for great television. But it did little to slow the nuclear program \u2014 the reactor has been back up and running for years.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s problem goes deeper. His two major complaints about the Iran deal are that it is not permanent and that it is not broad enough \u2014 it does not deal with Iran\u2019s weapons shipments to Hezbollah, its support of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, or its human rights abuses. Matching those requirements in a North Korea deal would make it all the harder to reach.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIn the North Korea case,\u201d Mr. Litwak said, \u201cno one has yet said what the scope of a deal would be, but if you look at the Iran deal critique, presumably it would have to solve a lot more than just our nuclear problems.\u201d\n\nThat could include stopping the North\u2019s export of chemical weapons to Syria, and its nuclear and missile exports. It might also include eliminating the thousands of conventional artillery weapons along the demilitarized zone that are aimed at Seoul.\n\nAnd then there is the problem of North Korea\u2019s gulags: At the State of the Union address this year, Mr. Trump invited a North Korean who had escaped to the South, suffering horrific injuries along the way.\n\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who was caught by surprise when Mr. Trump agreed to sit down with Mr. Kim, has warned that any negotiation will be long and drawn out. This first meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, if it happens, would simply be to build trust and set broad directions.\n\nSo far, Mr. Trump is talking only about what the North Koreans would give up in any negotiation. The North Koreans are bound to demand that the United States withdraw American troops from South Korea, and perhaps that it agree to a peace treaty and an end to decades of economic sanctions.\n\n\u201cThe promise is they wouldn\u2019t be shooting off missiles in the meantime, and they\u2019re looking to de-nuke,\u201d Mr. Trump shouted to reporters on the way to a rally in the Pittsburgh area on Saturday.\n\nThe \u201cpromise\u201d he referred to was conveyed by South Korea\u2019s national security adviser; so far Mr. Kim has made no such commitment in public, nor agreed that American military exercises with the South can proceed, another of the conditions that the White House says the North has volunteered.", "title": "How Trump\u2019s Disdain for the Iran Deal Makes a North Korea Pact Even Harder", "authors": ["David E.

Shares of Bluescope Steel jumped last week after Mr. Trump vowed to impose tariffs because it has operations in the United States. Investors saw the possibility that the company\u2019s American arm could charge more for what it makes.\n\nThe bigger hazard for the Australian steel industry is that American tariffs will force steel makers in other countries to send more of what they make to Australia. That could result in leaner profits, price wars and local layoffs.\n\n\u201cIf the exports get the tariffs whacked on them, we\u2019re going to have surplus of steel and aluminum in the marketplace \u2014 and at the same time as the rest of the world is,\u201d said Daniel Walton, national secretary for the Australian Works\u2019 Union, one of the country\u2019s largest blue-collar unions.\n\nCould It Get Worse?\n\nIt could, if steel and aluminum tariffs lead to something more drastic.\n\nCanadian and European officials have already publicly discussed ways they could retaliate. United States trading partners could specifically target products made in parts of the country that support Mr. Trump, such as soybeans from the Midwest and bourbon from Kentucky.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just steel and aluminum, but it can very easily become much more,\u201d said John Tang, a senior lecturer at the Australian National University\u2019s school of economics. \u201cThis would threaten the stability of global markets.\u201d\n\nCascading tariffs could hurt Australia. Exports of goods and services account for roughly one-fifth of its economic output. Australia\u2019s economy is particularly sensitive to the economic scene in China, its largest trading partner and a major buyer of Australian food and minerals. If broader tariffs hurt Chinese growth, Australia will feel the impact.\n\nWhy Isn\u2019t Australia Exempt?\n\nIt was supposed to be, at least according to Australian officials.\n\nLocal media has widely reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull reached a handshake deal with President Trump at the Group of 20 summit last year to exempt Australia from steel tariffs. While Mr. Trump has kept the details to himself, he has said no country will be exempt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo many Australian officials, it feels like a betrayal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a variety of reasons why Australia should be exempt, not least of which was the understanding reached at the G-20,\u201d said Steven Ciobo, Australia\u2019s trade minister, in an interview with local news media earlier this week.\n\nThe country has long been a central ally for the United States, but relations have sometimes been tested since President Trump came to office. Last year, the two leaders shared a contentious phone call. The two have taken pains since to put up a united front \u2014 at least until the tariff announcement.\n\n\u201cIt appears now that a confidence guarantee, given verbally, counts for nothing,\u201d said John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies at Australian National University. \u201cIn a relationship that has been about \u2018shared values,\u2019 it\u2019s damaging. It\u2019s deeply damaging.\u201d\n\nWhat Can Australia Do Now?\n\nFor now, officials and business leaders are publicly pushing the Trump administration to reconsider. But one option appears to be off the table for now: retaliation.\n\n\u201cThere is no prosperity at all that flows from putting up trade walls or higher taxes on traded goods,\u201d Mr. Ciobo told local media earlier this week.\n\nAustralia\u2019s political posture is likely to remain measured.\n\n\u201cMy sense in Australia is that most people are seeing President Trump as unbalanced and unduly influenced by emotional ups and downs: in how he responds to a phone call from Malcolm Turnbull, a comment from Kim Jong-un, or anyone across the spectrum in between,\u201d said Prof. Blaxland.", "title": "How Trump\u2019s Tariffs Would Affect Australia", "authors": ["Adam Baidawi"]}

In June 1961, following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, he told James Reston of The New York Times that \u201cwe have a problem in making our power credible\u201d and \u201cVietnam is the place.\u201d By November 1963, Kennedy had dispatched 16,300 military advisers to South Vietnam. As late as the morning of Nov. 22, he said, \u201cWithout the United States, South Vietnam would collapse overnight.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAssuming the presidency when Kennedy was assassinated a few hours later, Lyndon B. Johnson felt bound to continue his predecessor\u2019s course. Less confident about Vietnam than he was about domestic matters, Johnson regularly asked the foreign policy advisers he inherited from Kennedy \u2014 chiefly Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, and his national security adviser, McGeorge Bundy \u2014 what Kennedy would have done, and then he did it. Their confident recommendation was that the American commitment to victory in Vietnam must be maintained.\n\nAfter Johnson was elected in 1964 to a term in his own right, hawkish pressures from the administration\u2019s Kennedy alumni intensified. In February 1965 Bundy returned from South Vietnam and said that the war was lost unless the United States launched a sustained bombing campaign against the North. Johnson quickly approved Operation Rolling Thunder, which lasted, with brief pauses, for three years, the largest sustained air campaign in the history of warfare. With repeated reassurance from his advisers that eventually a \u201ccrossover point\u201d would be reached at which the Communists decided they couldn\u2019t win, Johnson steadily increased the American troop presence in Vietnam, which rose above a half-million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo raise the manpower needed, Johnson saw conscription as a less politically risky approach than calling up the reserves or National Guard, which would have forced many married, middle-class men to leave their jobs and families. College students, whose numbers had swelled to 7.5 million from 2.1 million in 1952, became increasingly alarmed that the draft soon would extend to them. \u201cThe draft was the best organizing tool we had,\u201d said the antiwar activist Sam Brown. Not just male students but also their sisters and girlfriends joined protests against the war on campuses and in Washington.\n\nDemonstrations were not the only manifestation of the growing opposition to the war. Senator Eugene McCarthy and \u2014 after seeing how vulnerable Johnson was to an intraparty challenge when McCarthy nearly won the March 12 New Hampshire primary \u2014 Senator Robert F. Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic nomination. Days afterward, Johnson\u2019s \u201cwise men,\u201d 14 high-ranking foreign policy officials from recent administrations who previously had endorsed his conduct of the war, told the president that \u201cwe must take steps to disengage.\u201d Johnson withdrew from the election at the end of the month.\n\nAs the spring primary season unfolded, McCarthy vied with Kennedy to be the main antiwar alternative to Vice President Humphrey, who delayed announcing his candidacy until April 27, too late to compete in the primaries. Kennedy won all but one head-to-head primary contest with McCarthy before being assassinated on June 4. But even if Kennedy had lived, Humphrey\u2019s nomination was essentially sealed by support from the Democratic Party\u2019s Southern, labor and organizational wings, which dominated delegate selection and, ultimately, controlled the nomination.\n\nHumphrey wanted to move his party\u2019s platform in a slightly dovish direction to placate Kennedy and McCarthy supporters, but he backed off when Johnson told him that doing so would \u201cendanger American troops,\u201d that he \u201cwould have their blood on my hands.\u201d The consequence was that the Democratic platform ended up more hawkish on Vietnam than the Republican one, which at least called for a \u201cde-Americanization\u201d of the war.\n\nPlagued by war protesters and trailing Nixon badly in the polls, Humphrey pledged at the end of September to stop the bombing of North Vietnam. His campaign steadily gained strength from that day on, rising from a low of 29 percent in a Gallup poll early that fall to near parity with Nixon by Election Day.\n\nNixon\u2019s victory, however narrow, broke the Democratic Party\u2019s record of seven victories in the previous nine elections, most of them by a landslide. Once united in support of an assertive foreign policy, Democrats now were fiercely divided entering the 1972 presidential nominating contest. One leading contender, the strongly anti-Communist Senator Henry Jackson, was squarely in the old Democratic tradition. With support from party heavyweights such as the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president George Meany and Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago, he may well have been nominated under the rules that prevailed in 1968.\n\nBut in a concession to antiwar delegates at the 1968 convention, Humphrey had not opposed a resolution requiring that in the future \u201call feasible efforts\u201d would be \u201cmade to assure that delegates are selected through primary, convention or committee procedures open to public participation.\u201d A postelection commission headed by Senator George McGovern and Representative Donald Fraser fleshed out this resolution with rules requiring that every delegate in 1972 and after be chosen in a primary or caucus open to every Democratic voter.\n\nWith grass-roots party activists now driving delegate selection, McGovern won 15 primaries and Jackson none. Humphrey had not won any primaries either in 1968, but under the pre-McGovern-Fraser rules that did not prevent the party\u2019s leaders from making him the nominee. In 1972 these leaders were outshouted by war opponents who had carried McGovern to victory in the primaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMcGovern lost the election to Nixon, but the new activist-centered party he midwifed remained. The party lost interest in using American power, and spent the next generation trying to constrain it. Democratic Congresses voted to hem in Nixon\u2019s war-making power by enacting the War Powers Resolution and forbade President Gerald Ford to continue to supply arms to the government of South Vietnam, which quickly fell to the Communists.\n\nThey hamstrung President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to roll back Communist advances in Central America and did their best to impose a \u201cnuclear freeze\u201d on America\u2019s arsenal. They opposed President George H. W. Bush\u2019s Gulf war.\n\nOnly with victory in the Cold War in the early 1990s did Democrats begin regain a trace of their old confidence that American involvement in the world, especially for humanitarian reasons, should sometimes be embraced. Bill Clinton, the party\u2019s victorious nominee in 1992 and 1996, made clear that he was not a \u201cMcGovern Democrat.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party was a bystander to the changes in the presidential nominating process, but was still affected by them. The Democrats\u2019 move toward a primaries-based system required alterations to state election laws that opened Republican nominations to grass-roots capture as well, albeit grudgingly and with party leaders better able to hold the reins of power for a longer time.\n\nBut just as the Democratic nomination after 1968 was won by political outsiders such as McGovern in 1972 and, four years later, Jimmy Carter, so eventually was the Republican. How else to explain the ability of history\u2019s ultimate outsider, Donald Trump, to become the 2016 Republican nominee despite the near unanimous opposition of established party leaders?\n\nAnd is it mere coincidence that what had happened among Democrats starting with McGovern finally happened among Republicans? Voters in both parties have always been more reluctant than public officials to embrace foreign aid, military deployments and multinational agreements. In 2016, Republican primary voters seized the opportunity to choose a candidate who disdained his party\u2019s previous support of these pillars of an assertive foreign policy.

They\u2019ve read the classic books by the historian Bernard Fall on the French and American wars in Indochina. They start off determined to bring insights from the recent past to their reporting about international situations and understand that American elected officials are generally ignorant about other countries.\n\nThe Vietnam War has ended up putting an unusual burden on young reporters, their newspapers and TV outlets. Too much stress is placed on reporting the latest incremental turn in a story, especially regarding America\u2019s current and brewing conflicts abroad. The news media\u2019s business model depends on it. But to serve the public well, the industry needs the time and space to permit reporters to include a larger context in their reporting from abroad. Otherwise, news becomes \u201cHere they come, there they go\u201d linear reporting about military action that doesn\u2019t have the meaning it needs to permit Americans to understand where these new conflicts are taking us.\n\nFor me, in my old age, the war comes back, out of order, my subconscious offering up memories without my asking. Here\u2019s one: that time climbing through a hillside bamboo thicket during a military operation when the heat felt so intense it got inside me, and yet I couldn\u2019t seem to drink enough water and was vomiting. I thought I was going to die. Here\u2019s another: The troop-carrying choppers settle onto the rice paddy, mud a foot deep, the men move out, tense because this is a Vietcong area, and they burn the village down, even though the enemy isn\u2019t shooting at them, ignoring the screaming women and children who are trying to keep the fire from taking everything as they run to haul water from their wells in buckets, throwing it up on their burning thatch.\n\nIn 1995, 20 years after the end of the war, I was asked to do an anniversary report. I chose to go to Beallsville, Ohio, a small town that had too many casualties. One of the veterans I went to see, a Marine, came to the door but didn\u2019t invite me in or shake my hand. I explained what I was doing, a film for PBS about his experience and the town\u2019s loss. He listened, but his expression was hostile. I said I had been in Vietnam myself as a TV reporter for five years over a decade. I tried to think how I could get beyond this awkward moment because sometimes by sharing experience, you can help people realize that you\u2019re with them, not against them. But I couldn\u2019t overcome his hostility so many years after the war was supposed to be over. I thanked him and left.\n\nI was probably a reminder of all the bad news that had come out of Vietnam, especially on TV. The news was always too brief and too blunt \u2014 the ambush, the mine, the wounded, the medevac helicopter trying to come in to get the men out. Then cut to a commercial. His family might have written to him about what they were seeing and asked, is it like that? It was clear that he resented me, maybe hated what he thought was journalistic misrepresentation of the war as he knew it. Or maybe he knew the bad news was correct but didn\u2019t want to deal with that either.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere was often resentment among ground troops about \u201chit and run\u201d reporting \u2014 getting news and pictures of the latest firefight by riding helicopters in and out of the battlefield the same day. That style of reporting was a response to pressure from editors back home to get the story out as quickly as possible, to beat the competition, the other wire services, the other networks. Better reporters stuck around for a while, spent the night, shared the combat food rations, the heat and rain, made friends before leaving. So the grunts felt you weren\u2019t just using them, like a stage set to entertain the viewers back home with a little bang-bang, as we used to call it.\n\nWhen the Vietnam War was over, the Pentagon decided that there had been too much negative reporting from the war zone and that it would limit journalists\u2019 access to battlefields. Handouts about what had happened would be prepared by public affairs staff, and officers, called \u201cminders,\u201d would go along with correspondents to supervise their movements and the information they got. A colleague told me that in Iraq, he wasn\u2019t permitted to speak with local people. It\u2019s still possible to find out what\u2019s actually going on under these restrictive conditions, but it\u2019s harder and takes more time. It\u2019s also a lot more dangerous now, because wars have become more violent.\n\nGood journalism is always hard to do, but there\u2019s a new generation of reporters who take nothing for granted because of what they know about Vietnam. Their work is everywhere in the best daily newspapers, on cable news and in online newsletters, blogs and websites. Of course journalism is populated by an assortment of people. There\u2019s no entrance exam, so a lot of reporting is done by people who are ignorant and inexperienced about the subjects they pretend to know. Journalism is no better or worse than any other American institution. But the best young reporters have learned from the Vietnam War to question authority and find out for themselves what\u2019s really going on.

For many pro-democracy Westerners, Mr. Orban\u2019s efforts to build an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d inside the European Union is chilling.

He described Mr. Orban as \u201cthe most significant guy on the scene right now.\u201d\n\nThat scene, some say, is the unraveling of democracy. In a report issued in March, a German research group, Bertelsmann Stiftung, said Hungary was \u201cnearing\u201d the threshold of autocracy.\n\nIn Budapest, government officials describe their societal revamp as a mainly technocratic reform effort, rather than an ideological campaign, one validated by Mr. Orban\u2019s success at the ballot box.\n\n\u201cThe government is using its democratic legitimacy not only to reform the state but to reform the society,\u201d said Professor Andras Patyi, the head of a new university formed by Fidesz to train the public officials of the future. He said the current president of France, Emmanuel Macron, was doing the same thing. \u201cThis is common in democratic societies,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Orban has recognized the political power to be gained by harnessing culture, history and civil society. He usually spends Thursdays reading books, essays and polling data, while meeting with writers and thinkers, two of his longtime associates said. The goal is not pleasure but power, said Zoltan Illes, a former Fidesz minister.\n\n\u201cHe wants to see what the new developments are and adapt them to his politics, to increase the life span of his governance,\u201d Mr. Illes said.\n\nAuthors with a sweeping vision of human nature and society seem to fascinate him. Last April, for example, he met with Philip Zimbardo, the psychologist who created the Stanford Prison Experiment, the 1971 study of authoritarianism, which explored how ordinary people would respond when placed in positions of power.\n\nThe two men spent more than two hours talking alone in Mr. Orban\u2019s office, surrounded by paintings of Hungarian history. Mr. Orban seemed uninterested in the Stanford experiment, Mr. Zimbardo said, but was keen to understand his theory about how to energize frustrated young men who feel left behind by modern society.\n\n\u201cI was giving him ideas,\u201d said Professor Zimbardo, who disagrees with Mr. Orban\u2019s politics, \u201cabout how psychology plays a central role in our lives.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nCo-opting Civil Society\n\nThis month, tens of thousands of people marched in Budapest to cheer a speech by the prime minister in a political rally to help Fidesz win re-election.\n\nExcept the organizer was not Fidesz but a civilian named Laszlo Csizmadia \u2014 whose work embodies how Mr. Orban has tried to influence the civil arena through like-minded culture warriors.\n\nFor the past eight years, Mr. Csizmadia has led a government institution called the National Cooperation Fund, the largest Hungarian fund for civil society organizations. The group does not provide a fully itemized list of its grants, but in 2012 the independent news website Atlatszo found that its biggest beneficiaries tended to be groups with religious and nationalist aims. Three of the top recipients were led by Fidesz politicians.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA right-wing theorist, Mr. Csizmadia has written widely that the duty of nongovernmental groups is to preserve national identity and uphold Christian values. Most tellingly, he argues that since an elected government represents the will of the people \u2014 and since civil society should strive to fulfill the people\u2019s will \u2014 then civil society exists to carry out a ruling party\u2019s manifesto.\n\n\u201cObviously, civil society needs to help and support the government to follow through with its promises,\u201d Mr. Csizmadia said in an interview this month. \u201cThis is an incredibly important thing.\u201d\n\nWhile channeling money toward its supporters, the government has simultaneously squeezed alternative sources of funding for NGOs that oppose its ideas. With few funding opportunities now available inside Hungary, human rights groups have become increasingly reliant on foreign money \u2014 in particular from the Norwegian government and the Open Society Foundation, a charity run by Mr. Soros.\n\nIn response, the authorities raided some of the organizations that distributed Norwegian money, and accused several of the recipients \u2014 including the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, two of the country\u2019s most prestigious watchdogs \u2014 of acting on behalf of foreign powers.\n\nThe Orban government later forced rights groups receiving more than 24,000 euros (roughly $30,000) from foreign sources to register with the authorities, and led a smear campaign against Mr. Soros and the groups he finances.\n\nOver the winter, the government sent an opinion survey to every Hungarian household. The survey claimed Mr. Soros was leading a project \u2014 named the Soros Plan \u2014 to force Hungary to admit thousands of migrants, dismantle its border fences, and in the process \u201cdiminish the importance of the language and culture of European countries.\u201d It was demonstrably false.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Mr. Orban was a young liberal activist who studied civil society at Oxford University (financed by a Soros grant). But by 2014, when he won a third term as prime minister, he had decisively pivoted. In a meeting that April with Zoltan Illes, then the minister for environmental protection, he lambasted nongovernmental groups as foreign-funded enemies of the state.\n\n\u201cI would like,\u201d Mr. Illes recalled Mr. Orban telling him, \u201cto destroy all NGOs in this country.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nInfiltrating the Arts\n\nIn many Western countries, theater is an avocation for elites.

Most are not political ideologues, but the new directors do little to prompt reflection about contemporary issues, said Andrea Tompa, the former head of the Hungarian Theatre Critics\u2019 Association.\n\n\u201cMost theaters,\u201d she said, \u201chave a socially unengaged message,\u201d and a majority are overseen by directors appointed under Fidesz.\n\nPerhaps the most provocative appointment has been of Gyorgy Dorner, a far-right director who now runs a theater in Budapest. In his 2011 application for the job, Mr. Dorner vowed that the theater, the Uj Szinhaz, would become \u201ca repository for Hungarian values\u201d and attract an audience of \u201cHungarian people who share the idea of the nation state.\u201d Hungary, he said, had been \u201csuffering under the social-liberal yoke.\u201d\n\nThe Uj Szinhaz now performs only Hungarian plays, and holds an annual festival devoted to Christian theater. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to emphasize our identity because we could lose it in a few moments,\u201d Mr. Dorner said in an interview, citing anxiety about immigration by \u201cthe Africans, the Middle Easterners.\u201d\n\nAnother director, Mr. Alfoldi, has gotten a much cooler reception from the government. Mr. Alfoldi was appointed as director of Hungary\u2019s National Theater while Mr. Orban was out of office, and was vilified in conservative circles for his provocative productions, some of which encouraged a debate about Hungarian national narratives.\n\nAt one point, he was summoned for questioning in Parliament. Then, when he applied to renew his contract in 2013, his application was rejected.\n\nThe government has also turned its attention to other branches of the arts. In 2011, a small independent group of right-wing artists \u2014 led by Gyorgy Fekete, the husband of Mr. Orban\u2019s former spokeswoman \u2014 was turned overnight into a state institution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Hungarian Academy of Arts was enshrined as a state entity in the Hungarian Constitution, given jurisdiction over several artistic institutions and awarded the right to distribute state-funded stipends and prize money to artists Mr. Fekete deemed as displaying a \u201cclear national commitment.\u201d\n\nUnder Mr. Fekete, who retired late last year, the academy ignored and even condemned critics of Mr. Orban such as Gyorgy Konrad, a renowned author. Instead, it awarded monthly stipends in perpetuity to artists like Gyozo Somogyi, best known for depicting Hungarian military heroes, and Pal Ko, who has made a career from sculpting Hungarian historical figures.\n\nPhoto\n\nChurch and Campus Life\n\nWhen the University of Debrecen awarded an honorary doctorate last August to Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president and an ally of Mr. Orban, four academic departments protested the decision. It was an act of free expression central to the principles of the European Union.\n\nYet in response, the university leadership conducted an investigation into their dissent.\n\nThough Mr. Orban did not personally order the investigation, many academics saw it as a sign of how much influence the government and its appointees have exerted over university decision-making since he was elected. Under Fidesz, the finances of each university department have been placed under the control of a government-appointed chancellor.\n\nOfficially, the loss of each department\u2019s financial autonomy has been presented as a cost-saving measure. But for professors like Zoltan Fleck, who heads a law department at Hungary\u2019s oldest college, Eotvos Lorand University, the real aim was to curb the academic autonomy of each department.\n\nNo one tells Dr. Fleck what to think. But the only research funding available to his department is allocated directly by the Ministry of Justice. For a time, that money was restricted to research on family law.\n\nBut while overall funding for universities dropped by 30 percent from 2010 to 2014, money was found to sustain two entirely new academic institutions.\n\nThe first \u2014 Professor Patyi\u2019s National University for Public Service \u2014 was set up to train civil servants, policemen and soldiers, leading skeptics to fear that Fidesz hoped to rear a generation of Fidesz-friendly bureaucrats. Mr. Patyi, who also heads the Hungarian electoral commission, denies that the college has any political association.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe second, a think tank called Veritas, has a more demonstrably political aim. Its main mission is to provide revisionist interpretations of 20th-century Hungarian history \u2014 including the reign of Miklos Horthy, the autocrat who led Hungary before and during the Second World War.\n\nSoon after Veritas was founded in 2014, its director, Sandor Szakaly, gave a sense of what this revision might involve. He described the deportation of Jews under Horthy in 1941 as a mere \u201cpolice action against aliens.\u201d\n\nThis kind of revisionism has also entered the national curriculum. High school graduates can now be tested on the new preamble to the Hungarian Constitution \u2014 a text which implies that Hungarian nationality is exclusively Christian, even though Hungary has a substantial Jewish minority. Its wording also reduces the agency of Hungarian officials in the final year of World War II, when hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were murdered.\n\nTo exert greater influence over churches and synagogues themselves, Fidesz has stripped hundreds of religious institutions of their legal status, and scrapped their state funding.\n\nFor the government, this was a legitimate reform of an abused subsidy system. But critics said it punished preachers who criticized Mr. Orban, while ensuring the loyalty of the 32 religious institutions that were allowed to keep their legal status.\n\nThe Faith Church, a Pentecostal Christian group that still receives state funding, provided a telling recent example. The church was previously associated with the opposition.\n\nThis month, its leader, Sandor Nemeth, told his congregants to vote for Mr. Orban.", "title": "How Viktor Orban Bends Hungarian Society to His Will", "authors": ["Patrick Kingsley"]}

College-educated suburbanites outside Philadelphia are angry at Mr. Trump and in a mood to send him a message. And blue-collar voters in western Pennsylvania are suddenly up for grabs, after they turned out strongly in the special election this month to elect a moderate young Democrat, Conor Lamb, over a Republican who ran as a wingman to the president.\n\nIn the Philadelphia suburbs, three Republican incumbents who have seen the writing on the wall are retiring, and a fourth is stepping down after a sexual harassment scandal. The latest to retire is Representative Ryan Costello, who announced his decision over the weekend, citing the difficulty of being heard over the cacophony from the White House.\n\nThe shifts outside Philadelphia mirror changes in suburbs around the country, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and behavior have pushed away college-educated voters. The Pew Research Center reported this week that more voters with a four-year college degree now identify as Democrats or lean Democratic \u2014 54 percent \u2014 than at any time since 1994.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s suburbs were once so reliably Republican that Ronald Reagan\u2019s cabinet included three residents of Montgomery County alone. But the region\u2019s allegiance began to shift as well-educated and culturally liberal voters came to predominate in the suburbs in the 1990s.\n\nThe tide was held back in the last decade by gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Republicans to protect their candidates. But that map was thrown out by the state court in January, and Republicans lost appeals to have the United States Supreme Court intervene. The state's new districts hew more compactly to county and town boundaries.\n\nTwo nonpartisan handicappers of House races, the Cook Political Report and Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, now rate four Republican-held seats in the Philadelphia suburbs as either \u201csolidly\u201d Democratic, \u201clikely\u201d to fall into the party\u2019s hands, or \u201cleaning\u201d that way.

Mr. Fitzpatrick has a record of attracting crossover votes from Democrats and enjoys the advantages of incumbency but is in his first term. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get incumbents, you typically knock them off in their first term,\u201d Mr. Gerow said.\n\nAt the other end of the state, Mr. Lamb, a former Marine and prosecutor, is running his second race of the year, this time in a new district against an incumbent, Representative Keith Rothfus, a Republican who was once paired by a political blog in a celebrity look-alike feature with the cartoon character Milhouse.\n\nThe new district, the 17th, is more evenly balanced in its partisan leanings than the former 18th District, where Mr. Lamb won his upset victory in part by reawakening dormant Democratic DNA in white working-class voters who had supported Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Rothfus, by contrast, is \u201cseveral clicks to the right\u201d of his new district, according to one Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to candidly assess the race.\n\nAnother Republican who was shifted to a more competitive district is Representative Scott Perry, who represents Harrisburg and York in central Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry is the only member of the far-right Freedom Caucus in the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. Mr. Trump won his old district by 21 percentage points; the new map places him in territory the president carried by only nine.\n\nFive Democrats are seeking their party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Perry.

The last time International Atomic Energy Agency inspection teams were allowed inside North Korea, nearly a decade ago, they could not travel outside the heavily-protected Yongbyon nuclear site.\n\nWithout freedom to roam the country, looking for evidence of a second uranium enrichment facility that the C.I.A. believes exists but cannot prove, or for hidden mobile missile launchers, any agreement runs the risk of falling apart \u2014 as previous ones have.\n\n\u201cNot only would North Korea have to make a complete declaration of existing stocks \u2014 we would also need a mechanism to access suspected sites,\u201d said Gary Samore, who also joined the meeting in 2000 with Marshal Jo, and returned to the White House as President Barack Obama\u2019s top nuclear adviser.\n\nThat, Mr. Samore notes, is \u201csomething North Korea has never agreed to.\u201d\n\nMr. Kim\u2019s opening offer is to suspend missile and nuclear testing while talks are underway.

It doesn\u2019t sit with past practice.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe precarious state of his nomination became clear when he testified last month before the Legislature\u2019s Judiciary Committee, where, as a former state senator and chairman of the committee, he faced lawmakers who had once been colleagues. The proceedings stretched over more than 12 hours, with questions about his time on the Supreme Court as well as his experience in the Senate and his friendship with Mr. Malloy, who hired him as general counsel, appointed him to the Supreme Court and even officiated at his wedding.\n\nAsked about judicial activism, Justice McDonald defined it as \u201cwhen a judge takes their personal opinion about what the outcome of a case should be and disregards the law in an effort to achieve that outcome.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proper role for a judge.\u201d\n\nThe committee was evenly divided in its vote, which meant that his nomination received an unfavorable recommendation. His nomination was then endorsed by a single vote in the House, where the Democrats have a nine-member majority. The Senate, where Democrats and Republicans have the same number of seats, is expected to vote before the end of the month; one Democrat has already indicated that she will abstain from voting.\n\n\u201cJustice McDonald is a consummate jurist who has earned the respect of legal professionals across the state for his exceptional ability to understand, analyze, research and evaluate legal issues,\u201d Mr. Malloy said in a statement, adding that he encouraged senators to vote \u201cbased on a substantive and objective assessment of facts and not based upon a political calculation.\u201d\n\nJustice McDonald\u2019s nomination is the latest hiccup in Mr. Malloy\u2019s difficult relationship with lawmakers. Last year, as the state operated for months without a budget amid a financial crisis, Republicans recruited several Democrats in the House and Senate to pass a spending package of their own, which the governor vetoed. The budget that Mr. Malloy ultimately signed was negotiated without him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJustice McDonald, 52, was nominated to the Supreme Court by Mr. Malloy in 2013, and enjoyed wide bipartisan support in the State Legislature, where he was approved 30-3 by the Senate and 125-20 by the House.\n\nSince then, several high-profile cases have come before the court, including appeals brought by Michael C. Skakel, whose conviction for the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley was reinstated by the court, and family members of victims of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, who are arguing that the companies that manufactured and sold the military-style assault rifle used by the gunman bear responsibility for the 2012 attack.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the case that has most incited his critics, including some Democrats, was the court\u2019s ruling in 2015 that the state\u2019s law abolishing capital punishment must be applied to inmates who had been sentenced before the law, passed in 2012, went into effect.\n\nThe decision spared 11 inmates from execution, including the convicted perpetrators of the home-invasion robbery in Cheshire that ended with the rape and strangulation of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and the killing of her daughters, Michaela, 11, and Hayley, 17. (Dr. Petit, the victims\u2019 husband and father, was bludgeoned, but escaped to a neighbor\u2019s house.)\n\nJustice McDonald was part of the 4-to-3 majority. His critics believe that Justice McDonald should have recused himself from the case; they argued that he had a record of opposing the death penalty as a legislator and that he was the governor\u2019s general counsel involved in crafting the language of the bill, which maintained previous death sentences while repealing capital punishment going forward.

Many also expressed fear of political incursion threatening the judiciary\u2019s independence.\n\nIn a letter to the Judiciary Committee, James D. Horwitz, president of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association, suggested a rubric for weighing court nominees: \u201cDoes he demonstrate patience, calmness and attention?

If a Saints cheerleader enters a restaurant and a player is already there, she must leave. If a cheerleader is in a restaurant and a player arrives afterward, she must leave. There are nearly 2,000 players in the N.F.L., and many of them use pseudonyms on social media. Cheerleaders must find a way to block each one, while players have no limits on who can follow them.\n\nThe team says its rules are designed to protect cheerleaders from players preying on them. But it puts the onus on the women to fend off the men.\n\n\u201cIf the cheerleaders can\u2019t contact the players, then the players shouldn\u2019t be able to contact the cheerleaders,\u201d said Sara Blackwell, Davis\u2019s lawyer. \u201cThe antiquated stereotype of women needing to hide for their own protection is not permitted in America and certainly not in the workplace.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear if the cheerleading squads of other N.F.L. teams have similar policies, though Blackwell said she had come across information suggesting the Saints were not alone.\n\nThey are far from the only team whose regulations for cheerleaders have come under question. The Buffalo Bills cheerleaders, before the squad disbanded in the face of a wage lawsuit, said they were told to do jumping jacks in tryouts to see if their flesh jiggled, and had to attend a golf tournament for sponsors where high rollers paid cash to watch bikini-clad cheerleaders do back flips. Their Facebook pages were monitored by team officials without their knowledge.\n\nCheerleaders for the Oakland Raiders settled a lawsuit over their wages and are now paid minimum wage and overtime. Members of squads from other teams have won settlements worth thousands of dollars after suing the Cincinnati Bengals, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Jets, over poor pay and requirements that they pay for their own makeup, uniforms and transportation.\n\n\u201cThe Saints organization strives to treat all employees fairly, including Ms. Davis,\u201d Leslie A. Lanusse, a lawyer who is representing the Saints, said in an email. \u201cAt the appropriate time and in the appropriate forum, the Saints will defend the organization\u2019s policies and workplace rules.

The league\u2019s personal conduct policy, which applies to all N.F.L. personnel, prohibits \u201cany forms of unlawful discrimination in employment based on an individual\u2019s\u201d race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or sexual orientation, \u201cregardless of whether it occurs in the workplace or in other N.F.L.-sponsored settings.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Legal experts say that she might prevail if the team cannot show why women need to be protected more than men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illegal for employers to discriminate against women and other groups protected by law,\u201d said Greg Simpson, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis who handles many E.E.O.C. cases. \u201cBut sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell if an employment policy or practice crosses the line if the policy doesn\u2019t single out women or minorities, but in practice has a harsher impact on them. These kinds of policies can still be legal if the employer shows it\u2019s necessary for the operation of their business.\u201d\n\nDavis is arguing that the restrictions go too far and that the Saints\u2019 enforcement of them is overly aggressive.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been told that anything beyond \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018great game\u2019 is too personal,\u201d said Lora Davis, Bailey Davis\u2019s mother and a longtime choreographer for the squad, known as the Saintsations. \u201cIt\u2019s considered fraternization to say anything beyond that.\u201d\n\nNow 22, Davis was told by another cheerleader of rumors that she was seen at a party where a player was also present. Team officials called a meeting to discuss the rumors. She denied being at the party, and the team told her it had no evidence she was there.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe told her supervisors that she was contacted by players on social media, but did not respond to them. The team reminded Davis and the other cheerleaders to block players from following them on social media, and to all change their social media presence from public to private even though the players are not required to block cheerleaders from their accounts.\n\n\u201cIt bothers me that they tell me the players know who you are because you\u2019re a pretty girl, you\u2019re on the field with them all the time, but then it\u2019s my fault because my Instagram was public,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis made her Instagram page private to prevent unauthorized people from viewing it. She later posted a photo of herself in a one-piece outfit. The team acquired a copy of the photo and told her that although the page was private, it still violated team rules regarding cheerleaders\u2019 attire.\n\n\u201cVery poor judgement to post a picture like that especially considering our recent conversations about the rumors going around about u,\u201d Ashley Deaton, the senior director of the Saintsations, wrote to Davis in a text message. \u201cThis does not help your case. I\u2019d expect you to know better.\u201d\n\nDavis was fired four days later.\n\nShe does not expect to get her job back, and says she still likes football and the Saints. She has been a cheerleader since junior high school, and used to accompany her mother to Saintsations practices. She routinely drove two hours from her home in Hattiesburg, Miss., where she is going to college, to get to Saintsations practices, and to off-field appearances.\n\nSaintsations are allowed to work for the team for only four years. Davis will not be able to work her fourth year, when she would have received $10.25 an hour, or $3 above the minimum wage in Louisiana. But in filing her discrimination case, she said she wanted the team to help other cheerleaders by forcing the team to change its rules so all employees were treated equally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this for them so they can do what they love and feel protected and empowered, and be a female athlete and not be pushed to the side and feeling unimportant,\u201d Davis said.", "title": "How an Instagram Post Led to an N.F.L.

Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia, crossed a line. The British authorities say they were exposed to the nerve agent Novichok, representing the first use of a chemical agent on European soil since the Second World War.\n\nThe brazen nature of the act was too much for European officials to ignore.\n\n\u201cThis is an intelligence operation carried out with intelligence capacity with weaponized, weapons-grade chemical agents,\u201d one senior European official said. \u201cIt has taken matters to an entirely different level.\u201d\n\nAlluding to Russia\u2019s earlier aggressions in Ukraine, the senior official added, \u201cRussia keeps violating international law in Crimea and Ukraine and unwritten rules on nonintervention, and now there is the use of nerve agents in Britain.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, Mrs. May had already expelled 23 Russian diplomats earlier this month, while members of her cabinet spoke in increasingly strident tones against Mr. Putin.

Greece and Cyprus, with close ties to Moscow, were unwilling to do so without a smoking gun, and some small countries, like Malta, did not want to lose all representation in Moscow and risk breaking relations entirely.\n\nAustria was disappointing to some, refusing to expel anyone now that the far-right Freedom Party controls the Interior Ministry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "Under the volcanoes in Mexico\u2019s Michoac\u00e1n state, violent cartels are fighting to dominate a shadowy and lucrative market. One gang, called La Familia Michoacana, announced its presence about a decade ago by tossing five rivals\u2019 heads onto a dance floor in the town of Uruapan. The Knights Templar muscled in next, spouting a chivalric code of honor as it taxed, extorted and kidnapped farmers and usurped their land. Mexican security forces and local landowners have tried to fight back, but warring cartels continue to splinter and proliferate. In March, an armed group known as Los Viagras \u2014 apparently named for the way their leader\u2019s heavily moussed hair stands up \u2014 wreaked havoc by burning dozens of vehicles and effectively shutting down the state\u2019s main highway. One conflagration took place not far from where an American businessman named Steve Barnard owns a packing plant in Uruapan. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous to drive on the roads,\u201d Barnard says. The farm owners \u201chave to be very careful not to get kidnapped.\u201d\n\nThe precious commodity that drives Michoac\u00e1n\u2019s economy and feeds an American obsession is not marijuana or methamphetamines but avocados, which local residents have taken to calling \u201cgreen gold.\u201d Mexico produces more of the fruit than any country in the world \u2014 about a third of the global total \u2014 and most of its crop is grown in the rich volcanic soil of Michoac\u00e1n, upland from the beaches of Acapulco. It is one of the miracles of modern trade that in 2017, Mexico\u2019s most violent year on record, this cartel-riddled state exported more than 1.7 billion pounds of Haas avocados to the United States, helping them surpass bananas as America\u2019s most valuable fruit import. Nine out of every 10 imported avocados in the United States come from Michoac\u00e1n.\n\nThe real marvel of Mexico\u2019s avocado trade, however, is not so much its size as the speed of its sudden growth. Avocados have been cultivated in Mexico for around 9,000 years. (When Spanish conquistadors first encountered the oblong fruit in the early 16th century, they called it aguacate, after ahuacatl, an Aztec word that means testicle.) Despite this deep history, Mexico exported very few avocados \u2014 and none at all to the United States \u2014 through the 1980s, when Barnard\u2019s California-based company, Mission Produce, opened the first avocado-packing plant in Uruapan. The United States had banned Mexican avocados since 1914 over fears of an insect infestation and cheaper competition. But in 1994, Mexico, Canada and the United States enacted the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and soon thereafter the United States began lifting its ban.\n\nAn avocado explosion followed. In 1994, Americans consumed a little more than one pound of the fruit per person per year \u2014 almost all from California growers, whose harvest comes only in the summer. Today, that figure is up to seven pounds per person year-round. Fueled by a growing Latino community and Hollywood stars promoting the health benefits of the fruit\u2019s unsaturated fats (Miley Cyrus has an avocado tattoo on her arm), America\u2019s avocado craze has intensified every year. An estimated 135 million pounds of avocados were consumed in the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl last month. (The Super Bowl is America\u2019s top avocado day, just ahead of Cinco de Mayo.) \u201cThe boom caught everybody by surprise,\u201d says Barnard, whose company is the world\u2019s largest avocado distributor. \u201cWe\u2019re really scrambling.

Whatever news the 90th Academy Awards ceremony makes, the editors on The New York Times\u2019s social media team stand ready to spot it and share it.\n\nDozens of Times reporters, editors and photographers will be covering different aspects of the biggest awards show of the year. One part of the social team\u2019s work is to pull all that reporting together. Using Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, the team begins coverage just before the red carpet entrances at 5 p.m. Eastern and works until the end of the show, typically around 11 p.m. Each platform serves as a home for different mediums, depending on timeliness: Twitter for live breaking news, Facebook for comprehensive coverage and Instagram for photography.

That is not entirely true.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez became one of the most well-known of the shooting survivors after giving a passionate speech about gun control the Saturday after the attack. But when her name began to trend on Twitter, she did not know how to use it.\n\n\u201cYou know that meme where it\u2019s a picture of a grandma in front of a computer?\u201d she said in a recent interview. \u201cThat was me. In the early days, someone DM\u2019d me and I was like, \u2018O.K., so how do I respond? Where does the keyboard go?\u2019\u2019\u2019 (A DM is a private message.)\n\nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez, 18, had been more of a Tumblr fan. She was also a fan of Instagram, but, before the shooting, had begun to use the platform less frequently after realizing she was wasting her time on it.\n\nAnd Facebook?\n\n\u201cFacebook is not really used by the people in my community.\u201d\n\nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez was surrounded by classmates who were familiar with Twitter\u2019s ever-evolving dialect of memes, wisecracks and news stories. Within a week, she said, they had taught her the basics. How to make a thread. How to follow a thread. And, perhaps most importantly, the difference between a retweet, which reposts someone else\u2019s tweet, and a quote tweet, which allows a user to retweet with a comment above the original.\n\nThe Parkland students\u2019 use of quote tweets is one of their most effective tools. Ms. Chadwick, in particular, has used the technique, as well as other memes to mock the students\u2019 ideological opponents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one memorable exchange, Ms. Chadwick was scrolling through her Twitter feed last month when she saw someone remark that politicians were \u201ceasy to buy.\u201d She and her classmates had spent the last week educating themselves on how easy the AR-15 was to purchase. She made the obvious connection, and tweeted:\n\nThe Fox News host Laura Ingraham chided Ms. Chadwick, 16, for her tone, and attributed the quote to \u201cStoneman Douglas sophomore Sarah Chadwick.\u201d\n\nMs. Chadwick\u2019s response?\n\nGiven their single-minded focus on preventing school shootings, the more prominent Parkland students most often find themselves tangling with conservative politicians and commentators who support broad gun ownership rights, including Senator Marco Rubio, Ms. Ingraham, the N.R.A. spokeswoman Dana Loesch and the Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren.\n\nThe Florida senator, who has vast experience being mocked on Twitter by his political opponents, declined to comment directly on Ms. Chadwick\u2019s tweet. A spokeswoman for Mr. Rubio pointed toward his recent tweets about political discourse, and how the two sides need to learn to talk each other again.\n\nIn response to a call and texts, Ms. Loesch, who is usually not shy about responding online or elsewhere to critics, directed an interview request to an N.R.A. official, who declined to comment.\n\nAnd as for Ms. DeVos? Students said that she spoke to few of them on her visit Wednesday, and left in a hurry.\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Ms. Lahren applauded the students\u2019 use of social media to fight for their views. She said she was not bothered by quote tweets, which she saw as simply \u201ca way to continue a conversation,\u201d a tool that she said that she also used frequently.\n\nBut when it was pointed out that one of Ms. Chadwick\u2019s meme tweets instructed her to \u201cstop talking,\u201d she added: \u201cI hope these kids understand that free speech isn\u2019t just saying what you want to say, it\u2019s hearing what you don\u2019t want to hear. It\u2019s great to be vocal about your stance but simply telling someone to stop talking doesn\u2019t seem very constructive.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nQuote tweeting may allow Twitter users some small window into the other sides of a debate. Delaney Tarr, who had about 500 followers before the shooting and now has close to 97,000, said she believed the tool breaks through the filter bubbles that keep ideological opponents from hearing each other.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEven if people maybe side with the other people a little bit more, they understand both sides,\u201d she said, of the benefits of quote tweeting. \u201cWe want people to be educated.\u201d\n\nThe social media activism has come with a cost for the high schoolers, who before the shooting just used these platforms to keep up with friends, make jokes and pass the time. Ms. Tarr was one of several students interviewed who said that she no longer felt comfortable using her Twitter account to express her opinions on pop culture, or the other lighter subjects she used to tweet about.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that I have to represent our movement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me tweeting whatever I want to tweet about. It has to be drawn back to who I am to the media, to who I am to the country.\u201d\n\nIt is another way in which the students at Parkland have lost the normalcy of their teenage years. Ryan Deitsch said that he did not feel comfortable even tweeting his opinion of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d (he thought it was great and that comparisons to \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were beside the point). Many other parts of his life have been put on hold. He has yet to respond to the colleges that have accepted him.\n\nAll of the students scoffed at the idea that they were coordinating their tweets. But they did say that as they are all following one another on the various platforms, they frequently alight on the same subject or tweet. (When reached for interviews, several of them were in the same room.) On Tuesday, a handful of them worked together to make a video parody of Ms. Loesch\u2019s own video using an hourglass to tell celebrities and other N.R.A. critics \u201cyour time is running out.\u201d\n\nBut while Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez and Ms. Chadwick said they usually composed their tweets on the fly, Ms. Tarr said she often took more time, mindful of her new audience and of the gravity of what she says online now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll start typing a tweet, then I\u2019ll delete it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll think \u2018what else can I say\u2019 then type and delete again. I do miss having that teenage Twitter account. But we don\u2019t get that regular teenage life anymore.

Mahoney, a pro-segregation Democrat. But his mood soon turned. He became obsessed with black \u201cagitators\u201d; he had state law enforcement spy on civil rights activists, and when King was killed he shut down Bowie State University, one of the state\u2019s historically black campuses, because he feared the students would riot.\n\nLike many conservatives in both parties, Agnew was convinced that the wave of rioting in the late 1960s wasn\u2019t the expression of black frustration over urban unemployment, discrimination and police brutality, but was the result of a conspiracy by black leaders. \u201cThe looting and rioting which has engulfed our city during the past several days did not occur by chance,\u201d he told his audience that day in Baltimore.\n\nPredictably, and justifiably, the state\u2019s civil rights leaders excoriated him. But they were drowned out by the thousands of Americans who voiced praise. According to Agnew\u2019s office, by the end of April 1968 he had received 7,588 letters and telegrams in support, against only 1,042 in opposition. The state\u2019s suburban newspapers uniformly praised him as well.\n\n\u201cHe was blunt but honest,\u201d wrote the editorial board of The Bethesda-Chevy Chase Tribune. \u201cGovernor Agnew is that type of man who is needed in the White House,\u201d one letter writer told The Washington Post.\n\nAgnew wasn\u2019t the only one taking a sudden hard line on the riots, or using them to build a case against civil rights liberalism in general. Nixon moved further to the right that spring and summer, abandoning his previous sympathy for urban blacks and adopting a fierce law-and-order stance. \u201cThe first civil right of every American is to be free from domestic violence,\u201d he said in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Miami. On the same day he uttered those words, Nixon named Agnew as his running mate.\n\nTo political insiders and the media, Agnew was a disaster. He fumbled his speeches and once used a crude racial epithet to describe an Asian-American reporter. But as they did with Donald Trump a half-century later, pundits missed Agnew\u2019s fundamental appeal. He said it like it was, and if he dropped an occasional racial slur, well, so did many white Americans.\n\nNixon\u2019s campaign that fall was built on what would be called the Southern strategy, but as the historian Kevin Kruse has noted, it was really a suburban strategy. Nixon played to the middle by eschewing the overt racism of George Wallace. But he deployed a range of more subtle instruments \u2014 antibusing, anti-open housing \u2014 to appeal to the tens of millions of white suburbanites who imagined themselves to be racially innocent, yet quietly held many of the same prejudices about the \u201cinner city\u201d and \u201cblack radicals\u201d that their parents had held about King and other civil rights activists.", "title": "Opinion | How the Party of Lincoln Became the Party of Racial Backlash", "authors": []}

I know you claimed as much this past November, when you tweeted a couple shots of yourself and Britney Spears from 2006, along with the caption, \u201c11 years ago today, Me & Britney invented the selfie!\u201d I did not invent the selfie either, but I did write a Sunday Styles cover story on the topic nine months before you and Britney said cheese. As far as I can tell, that article was the first in-depth journalistic look at the emergent phenomenon of the quickie digital self-portraiture. That accomplishment might have earned me first-ballot entry to the Trend Reporter\u2019s Hall of Fame if I just had the good sense to appropriate the term \u201cselfie.\u201d Oh well. In journalistic terms, it counts as a muted victory, like driving home the winning run of the World Series with a bunt.\n\nThe term itself: Credit for the first documented use of the term selfie typically goes to an Australian man who used it in an ABC Science Online forum in 2002 to describe a shot of the bloody lip he sustained after a drunken face-plant: \u201cSorry about the focus, it was a selfie.\u201d The term may or may not have been big in Australia, but it was still unfamiliar enough on these shores even four years later that none of my one to two dozen sources for the story, many of them young digital natives, ever invoked it. It was not until 2012 that the term \u201creally hit the big time,\u201d according to Time, which included selfie in its top 10 buzzwords of the year.\n\nFlip phones and webcams: It may seem primitive by the standards of this Instagram-mad era, but the boom in digital photography in the mid-aughts was actually pretty groundbreaking from a cultural perspective. The century-plus dominance of film photography, with its hassle and expense, had ended just a few years earlier. The rise of cheap digital point-and-shoot cameras, webcam-enabled laptops and camera-enabled flip phones meant that, for the first time in history, people could carry a camera pretty much anywhere and snap pictures of anything. For free! (Kind of.) Given that this technological shift happened just as members of the millennial generation, soon to become famous for broadcasting their lives online, were taking the stage, we can hardly be surprised that the kids turned the camera on themselves.\n\nBut was this new? It was, according to photography historians. Those digital self-portraits soon to be known as selfies represented nothing less than \u201ca new genre of photography,\u201d Guy Stricherz, the author of \u201cAmericans in Kodachrome, 1945-65,\u201d said. He should know. For that book, Mr. Stricherz spent 17 years thumbing through more than 100,000 slides gathered from midcentury American families, yet found fewer than 100 self-portraits. By 2006, you could find that many scrolling through a few dozen MySpace pages.", "title": "How the Selfie Conquered the World", "authors": []}

Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who reviewed the database. Mr. Mann has specialized in federal government studies for four decades and has tracked the process that previous administrations have used to fill political jobs.\n\nLindsay Walters, deputy White House press secretary, said the administration had appointed well-qualified staff.\n\n\u201cThe president selects the highest caliber of individuals from an array of backgrounds and experiences to fill positions in his administration,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are proud that these individuals \u2014 whether they worked on the campaign, conservative think tanks or elsewhere \u2014 share the president\u2019s vision that got him elected.\u201d\n\nAgency officials added that these new political hires had brought value to government. For instance, Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that Matthew Mowers, the former Trump campaign official who recently traveled to South Africa, provided a \u201cfresh focus and renewed passion for helping women, children and men who are living with H.I.V./AIDS.\u201d\n\nMr. Mowers, who had also worked on the presidential campaign of Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, is chief of staff in the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. Last month, he tweeted from South Africa, \u201cGreat meeting today with Ministry of Health Officials in Johannesburg.\u201d\n\nOne of the top sources of the appointees has been the presidential campaign, according to the database. Some of the people listed in the database have already left the Trump administration, but it offers a snapshot of those hired for political jobs in the past year. At the White House alone, there have been almost 60 former campaign workers. In addition, about 20 have been hired at the Energy Department, and another 20 or so at the Commerce Department.\n\nSome of the Commerce jobs have been filled with people who have extensive experience in government or the private sector.

Not that I didn\u2019t see some brutal, stomach-churning stuff. On an operation south of Danang in November 1967, I watched marines attack a village from which they had been ambushed the day before. One marine officer, responsible for calling in airstrikes on much of the village and then for providing food and aid for survivors, grinned when he gave me a memorable line, \u201cFirst I annihilate them, then I rehabilitate them.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

They believed in what they were doing \u2014 or, at least, believed what they were doing would win the war. After Tet, the violence and brutality continued, but it came from a different place \u2014 frustration, anger, resignation, nihilism. After all that destruction, for the enemy to mount such a widespread, if strategically futile, campaign spoke to the great distance between the generals\u2019 grand pronouncements about \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d and the reality on the ground.\n\nThe Tet attacks also coincided with the arrival of a new type of G.I., men who had witnessed or heard about antiwar activism and rising drug use back home, experiences they brought with them to Vietnam. Drug use, in particular, reached epidemic proportions in the years after Tet. The decline in morale intersected with a growing trade in heroin, sold in vials of white powder purveyed by roadside hucksters outside bases.\n\nViolence, threatened or actual, against officers became common too. Not infrequently, officers found grenade pins on their bunks \u2014 a warning of the \u201cfragging,\u201d or detonation of a fragmentation grenade, that might befall them for hassling their men, especially about drugs \u2014 i.e., for acting like officers.\n\nIn the summer of 1971, working on an article for The New York Times Magazine, I visited American bases and walked with troops on jungle patrols along with a photographer, David Terry. My angle was also the eventual title of the piece: \u201cWho Wants to Be the Last American Killed in Vietnam.\u201d Tensions among the troops was like nothing I had ever seen before Tet.

Call the references and ask how they communicated with the contractor about their projects: Were there regular meetings or weekly progress reports? In addition, sit down with the contractor to gather information, Mr. Taddei suggested. Will the contractor have multiple renovation projects happening at the same time? What type of insurance does he have? Which subcontractors will work on your project? Do the same due diligence on them.", "title": "How to Avoid a Renovation Nightmare", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "But of course it is the advent of Trumpian politics \u2014 its nonstop carnival of paranoia; its scapegoating of Hispanics and African-Americans; its anti-immigrant phobia \u2014 that has rung Weisman\u2019s alarm bells, which accounts for his subtitle: \u201cBeing Jewish in America in the Age of Trump.\u201d More sinister for him than the foaming lunacies of the neo-Nazis is the alt-right\u2019s embrace of conspiracy theorists; the routine mutation of fantasy into fact; the appetite for seeing secret hands (George Soros for instance) at work in plots to undermine America \u2014 all of which have a whiff of late Weimar about them, not to mention the long history of populist anti-Semitism in the United States. Better, Weisman believes, to be fretfully vigilant than torpidly complacent. In one of the 1940s movie-poster homilies he favors (\u201cthe world is watching,\u201d \u201cthe nation gasped\u201d), he warns that while \u201cunheard thunder\u201d was rumbling, \u201cthe Jews slept.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nBut this reduction of \u201cbeing Jewish\u201d to a state of hair-tearing anxiety about the surge of anti-Semitism means Weisman never quite delivers on his subtitle\u2019s promise. A richly researched and nuanced account of Jewish life in stressed-out, polarized America would be timely, but this isn\u2019t it. Instead, Weisman takes a chapter to complain about what he considers the major distraction preventing American Jews from being fully alert to the perils of the time \u2014 but this, a little surprisingly, turns out to be \u201cIsrael, Israel, Israel.\u201d It is not clear whether he thinks the AIPAC herd mentality, so elated at gestures like the embassy move to Jerusalem, blinkers Jews to the threat that Trump and Trumpism represent to the liberal culture he champions. Or whether he believes that increasingly abrasive debates dividing the Jewish community about the occupation of the West Bank and the expansion of settlements are the greater problem. Weisman reports with understandable pain his demonization by hard-liners as a self-hating Jewish traitor for daring to point out, in a Times infographic, which opponents of the Iranian nuclear deal were Jewish. But such bitter arguments have gone on for a while and it seems odd to suppose that engagement with the trials and tribulations of Israel somehow precludes engaging with diaspora anti-Semitism, as if Jews of all people have a finite capacity for attentiveness. Anti-Semitism and the existence of Israel are hardly historically disconnected.\n\nThe second malaise Weisman identifies as blunting Jewish alertness to the peril of the times is the hollowing out of a Jewish identity that is neither uncritically Zionist nor devoutly religious. \u201cThe Jews who are most interested in a liberal, internationalist future, who wish to live progressive, assimilated existences free of threat,\u201d he warns, \u201care disappearing.\u201d But his sense of the tradition he believes is being lost is romantically wishful. In a hasty drive through Jewish history he nominates Moses Maimonides and Moses Mendelssohn as embodying this outward-looking nontribal Judaism. But the two Moseses were intensely devout and at times darkly pessimistic about the prospects of a Jewish life in a non-Jewish world.\n\nIt is true nonetheless, as Weisman points out, that a considerable majority of Americans identifying as Jews do so by way of remembering the Holocaust or being engaged with the fate of Israel rather than anything much rooted in Judaism and Jewish history. Weisman confesses he isn\u2019t \u201cmuch into davening\u201d and reckons that even efforts to introduce more Hebrew into the Reform liturgy is a matter of simply \u201cgoing through the motions,\u201d ultimately more impediment than inspiration. But if \u201cbeing Jewish\u201d means nothing more than an ethically attuned solidarity with kindred disadvantaged at home and abroad, then the reawakening he wants will just evaporate in a cloud of airy good will. Being Jewish is knowing Jewish history in some depth; being Jewish is engaging with the incomparable treasury of disputation that is the Talmud; being Jewish is immersion in the boundless glories of Jewish literature, poetry, philosophy and art.\n\nIt\u2019s this broad-minded debate-conscious kind of Jewish life that Weisman worries is moribund. But it may be too soon to write its obituary. Annual Limmud retreats, which offer a festival of learning and discussion on all things truly or even notionally Jewish, are thriving in Britain and increasingly in America. Jewish journalism in magazines like Moment and Tablet alongside reinvigorated institutions like The Forward and The British Jewish Quarterly Review seems to be entering something of a golden age. In London, JW3 \u2014 since its opening in a spankingly smart modern building \u2014 has become a magnet of cultural energy, and Jewish Book Week (also in London) draws packed houses (and not exclusively Jewish audiences) to its offerings in early March. And if it is acts of solidarity Weisman wants (those have never really gone away) he might note that the home page of the American Jewish World Service for Purim featured a photograph of a Rohingya refugee.\n\nNone of this is to make light of the sinister anti-Semitic strain in the ascendancy of alt-right ideology. There are plenty of signs that Jew-hatred is pushing through the soft walls of ultraright politics and poisoning its bloodstream. There is nothing wrong, as Weisman counsels, with Jews standing shoulder to shoulder with those most damaged and threatened by tribalist populism, as Jews like Abraham Joshua Heschel did in the heyday of the civil rights movement. Ultimately, though, what is needed is an aggressive defense of those things that not so long ago could be taken for granted in America, and under which Jewish life has prospered to a degree unique in the world: the integrity of the democratic process, the protections of the Constitution and the preservation of the ideal of a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d a phrase just deleted from the Immigration Service\u2019s mission statement.

{"date": "2018-03-26 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nIn her Highland Park, Dallas, home, the facialist Joanna Czech has an arsenal of skin-care products for every need: vegetal placenta serums for lightening dark spots, green algae face masks to decongest pores \u2014 to name a few. \u201cBut the most important regime is your evening one,\u201d she says emphatically. \u201cYour skin absorbs a higher level of nutrients while your body is resting.\u201d Czech is not alone in her devotion to nighttime rituals. Indeed, many facialists reserve their most potent, effective elixirs for their after-hours routines.\n\nCleanse and Cleanse Again\n\nAs a first step, skin-care experts agree that cleansing and toning should never be skipped (or rushed) at night. Danuta Mieloch, the facialist and founder of Rescue Spa, swears by a double-cleanse with Biologique Recherche\u2019s Lait U ($33) using a muslin cloth to remove any last traces of makeup. Crystal Greene, a facialist at CAP Beauty, prefers to \u201ckeeps things simple\u201d at night, and balances her acne-prone complexion with a few sweeps of In Fiore\u2019s Treate ($70). For toner, both Mieloch and Czech use Biologique Recherche P50, which \u201cexfoliates, hydrates and balances the pH of the skin,\u201d Mieloch says. Czech then whips out her Environ Gold Roll-CIT ($298), a microneedling tool studded with tiny needles that puncture the skin, a (slightly painful) practice that she says stimulates collagen and helps topical ingredients absorb better. If you\u2019re trying this at home, roll the device over your face multiple times but only do one to two passes on delicate skin around the eyes.\n\nPersonalize Your Serum\n\nNext, according to all of the facialists we polled: an overnight serum. These concentrated liquids contain the highest doses of nutrients, and facialists often combine them to create customized, targeted tinctures. Currently, Czech favors a medley of Dr. Barbara Sturm\u2019s firming Super Anti-Aging Serum ($350), mixed with the brand\u2019s anti-inflammatory Calming Serum ($250), and a drop of Environ\u2019s C-Quence Serum 1 ($137), which Czech says improves \u201ccellular turnover, skin tone, hydration,\u201d and keeps your complexion \u201cyouthful and healthy looking.\u201d Britta Plug, a facialist with Mama Medicine in New York City, is so into nighttime serums that she makes her own: blending together hydrating jojoba, toning frankincense and purifying lavender oils. She works in this brew using facial gua sha \u2014 a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves gliding a flat crystal over the meridians of your face with gentle pressure to stimulate circulation and release blockages (the result, Plug says, is \u201ca serious glow that lasts\u201d).\n\nThe Manhattan facialist Negin Niknejad, meanwhile, applies \u201cmultiple, light layers\u201d of her vitamin-E-rich Rejuvenating Facial Oil ($65) in the colder months, pressing it in with a kansa, a domed bronze-and-wood tool used in ayurvedic practices, to \u201cdraw out acidity in the skin and body,\u201d she explains.\n\nMoisturize Generously\n\nLastly, moisturize \u2014 and moisturize some more \u2014 since the body\u2019s natural hydration levels dip at night. Czech is a fan of Swiss brand Meder\u2019s Hydra-Fill Mask ($90 per pack), a sheet mask saturated with plumping hyaluronic acid. She heats the pouch (by running it under warm water) and once the sheet is on her face, glides over it with chilled Cryro-Sticks ($114) from Biologique Recherche \u2014 the combination of hot and cold increases absorption and brings down inflammation. Finish with a rich cream; Mieloch is partial to MBR Cream Extraordinary ($369), spiked with ultra-hydrating lanolin and light-reflective gold particles to subtly conceal any imperfections.\n\nTo lull yourself into a deep sleep, so you can reap all the restorative benefits that occur overnight \u2014 from skin-cell turnover to DNA repair \u2014 Greene recommends using incense. She burns earthy cypress sticks for a bit of \u201cstillness and joy\u201d before bed, and then lets her body do the rest.", "title": "How to Care for Your Skin \u2014 While You Sleep", "authors": ["Kari Molvar", "On Beauty"]}

Many of Crenshaw\u2019s research subjects considered their online names to be as important to their identities as the ones given to them by their parents. But even if you\u2019re not a serious gamer and just want to jump in and play, don\u2019t be too offhand about making your alias. The moniker might stick to your digital embodiment whether you like it or not. One of Crenshaw\u2019s study subjects ended up being known as \u201cStinkypeen,\u201d after initially choosing it as a joke.\n\nThink through how much demographic information you want to reveal about yourself. \u201cPeople generally associate A\u2019s and E\u2019s at the ends of names as being female,\u201d Crenshaw says. Given the pervasive misogyny found online, female gamers sometimes opt for a gender-neutral tag. Some platforms allow names to include numbers. If you want to suggest your age, people tend to read two digits at the end as a birth year. One of Crenshaw\u2019s first online handles was \u201cGazelle,\u201d an offline nickname from her gangly preteen years. The name morphed over time to \u201cGazzy\u201d and now \u201cGaiazelle.\u201d\n\nConsider signaling your interests with cultural references to things you like (millions can play these games, of course, and your desired name might be taken). Pick a word that\u2019s easy to type; if, say, \u201cLegolas\u201d is taken, don\u2019t try to spell it with an umlaut. Unlike your given name, this one is not bound by law or familial expectations. If you\u2019ve grown out of a handle, give yourself another (note that some game makers charge a fee of around $10 for a name change). \u201cPeople are always learning new things about themselves,\u201d Crenshaw says. \u201cYour name can evolve with you.\u201d", "title": "How to Choose an Online Handle", "authors": []}

Balke\u2019s work has nothing to do with money laundering, which is the bailiwick of law enforcement; for much of the last decade, he has studied how cash gets dirty and methods for keeping it cleaner. Globally, governments spend nearly $10 billion annually replacing grimy or crumpled cash (some half a billion euros are shredded each month for this reason). After Balke published research finding that people\u2019s waxy skin oils are mainly to blame, he and his colleagues began investigating what could be done about it. \u201cTo clean money,\u201d he says, \u201cyou need to remove that built-up sebum.\u201d\n\n\u201cBleach bank notes in the sun,\u201d Balke says. One scientist has suggested letting ultraviolet light do the work by laying out the cash on the central bank\u2019s roof. (\u201cWe\u2019d rather keep it in the vault,\u201d Balke says.) Most bills will remain intact in the washer and dryer. But while a wash cycle may make your money look untainted, it nonetheless ruins the bills; hot water can damage security features, and detergents change the way cash reflects light, which currency-sorting machines detect. Banks shred washed money.\n\nAt the microscopic level, because cash is so highly trafficked, it becomes a sort of palimpsest that records all the hands and back pockets and piggy banks it has passed through, accreting a kind of monetary microbiome. A study of $1 bills in New York identified a total of 397 bacterial species. Swiss researchers discovered that when they smeared bills with mucus from children with the flu, the virus lived for up to 12 days. Bank notes also retain evidence of our recreational habits. Ninety-five percent of the currency researchers tested from Washington showed traces of cocaine; in Macao, 98 percent contained ketamine.\n\nThere is a cleaning technique that works without damaging your dollars. It requires highly pressurized and heated carbon dioxide. \u201cYou basically dry-clean it,\u201d Balke says. After studying the method, the European Central Bank opted to use a sebum-repelling varnish on euros instead. Despite dozens of online tutorials on how to clean cash at home, Balke doesn\u2019t think you should bother: If you end up with a particularly nasty (or mangled) bill, most banks will let you exchange it.", "title": "How to Clean Paper Currency", "authors": ["Malia Wollan"]}

In Atlanta, it funded about 260 projects, valued at more than $280,000.\n\nThe requests can be wide-ranging. Many are for necessities like supplies, clothing or food, but others can help teachers pursue passion projects that schools may not have the resources to support, school administrators said.\n\n\u201cIt encourages teachers to be excited about their practice, to test things that we typically would not be able to fund,\u201d said Meria Carstarphen, the superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools.\n\nMost of the donations teachers receive come from outside of their community, allowing instructors in low-income areas to connect with those who have the means to help.\n\nThis week\u2019s gift from Ripple not only eclipsed the previous top donation of $9 million, but it also sparked a flurry of activity for DonorsChoose.org.\n\nOn Wednesday, 16,000 projects were created on the website, beating its previous weekly record of 15,000 new requests in a single day.\n\nAmong them is one from Ms. Vibbert, who hopes to purchase a set of books for her students about the friendship between Alexander Hamilton and his sister-in-law Peggy Schuyler.", "title": "How to Get $29 Million for Classroom Projects?

You must dress warmly, in layers, and take along a hot, nonalcoholic beverage in an insulated thermos. Before stepping out onto the ice, consider your safety. \u201cNever go alone,\u201d says Eliseev, 25, who has fallen through the ice five times since he took part in his first expedition, as a toddler. Know the ice. Ice is harder when it\u2019s new, clear and blue; avoid ice that appears milky or is covered in snow. Using your auger (you\u2019ll need one), drill a test hole near the shore. Don\u2019t go out unless the ice is at least four inches thick.\n\nCarry two picks \u2014 or metal spikes protruding from buoyant handles \u2014 securely connected to a cord that is 24 to 30 inches long, in case you need to claw your way out of the freezing water. You\u2019ll also need a rescue rope, an ice-fishing rod (which is shorter than a regular rod) and bait. \u201cBloodworms work well,\u201d Eliseev says. To save time and energy, use a sonar device to locate fish before settling on a spot.\n\nBegin when the sun rises. \u201cLike us, fish want to eat breakfast,\u201d he says. Carry a portable chair and food if you intend to stay all day. If you\u2019re not having any luck, bore more holes, but keep them far apart unless the ice is at least 10 inches thick. Try to give other anglers some space too, though that won\u2019t always be possible. During Russia\u2019s long winter, frozen lakes can teem with hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of bundled-up men, women and children eager to catch a perch or a common bream. \u201cA crowd is fine if the ice is thick,\u201d Eliseev says.\n\nEliseev beat 78 competitors from all over the world at last year\u2019s ice-fishing championship on a frozen lake in Latvia. \u201cDon\u2019t think or talk about politics when fishing,\u201d he says, especially at international tournaments.

Even the Americans have improved in recent years: \u201cThey\u2019re eager and very friendly.\u201d You can always find a way to get along with fellows anglers, Eliseev says. \u201cJust talk about fish.\u201d", "title": "How to Go Ice Fishing", "authors": ["Malia Wollan"]}
{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Although great progress has been made with mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and private investment opportunities, the short answer is, it can be hard for any investor, particularly for those who hew to an exacting standard.\n\nBut that challenge has seemingly increased interest in impact investing, which can be difficult to achieve if a solid return is the goal. It is also hard to measure, given the differing definitions of impact investing.\n\nGone are the simple days when investing with a conscience meant excluding alcohol, tobacco and firearms from a portfolio. Today\u2019s impact investors want their investments to align with a more rigorous standard of good while achieving a maximum return.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere are some tips that even the most committed impact investor should consider.\n\nDo Your Homework\n\nMs. Case said she started trying to move one portfolio to full impact investments about two and a half years ago.\n\n\u201cI created a portfolio and let the wealth advisers run it while I was out talking about impact investing,\u201d Ms. Case said. After one of her quarterly meetings, she said, she realized she was invested in companies that did not match her criteria.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo she created a screening process to find only the impact investments she wanted, like companies with diverse boards solving 21st-century problems like alternative energy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken longer, and it\u2019s been harder to do,\u201d she said.\n\nThis does not come as a complete surprise to Douglas M. Cohen, managing director at Athena Capital Advisors. Mr. Cohen said that not all the options for impact investing had good track records.\n\nKristin Hull, the founder, chief executive and chief investment officer of Nia Impact Capital, took a different approach to this challenge. In 2007, when her family set up a foundation after the sale of her father\u2019s trading firm to Goldman Sachs, she decided to invest only in companies that were looking to have an impact on the world and had women in positions of leadership.\n\nShe has continued this approach as she expanded her firm into advising other investors. She said one fund, which is small at $20 million, was up more than 37 percent last year \u2014 or 17 percentage points higher than the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in the same period.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just focusing on those companies that are playing their part in an inclusive and sustainable economy,\u201d she said.\n\nDefine Your Priorities\n\nOne of the challenges of measuring \u201cimpact investment\u201d the way someone would measure automobile investments or oil and gas investments is the variety of ways to interpret the term.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a different definition of impact investments,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cSome people say no fossil fuels, and that\u2019s their negative screen. Others say, \u2018I understand these companies are going to exist, but I want to find the one that is doing it the best.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Case said she needed three things to assess an impact investment: intention to have impact, measurement of results and transparency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nErika Karp, founder and chief executive of Cornerstone Capital Group and a friend of Ms. Case\u2019s, said the two defined impact investing differently.\n\n\u201cAll investments have impact,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cJean has spent years as more of a purist than I am. She wants measurement that is more precise. I believe it\u2019s more diffuse.\u201d\n\nA screening process that is too narrow can also increase the risk because clients may wind up investing in new companies or first-time funds without track records, Mr. Cohen said.\n\nFor instance, one of his clients wanted to invest only in hedge funds and private equity funds that were led by a woman, he said. What the firm came up with were funds that it would not approve for all clients because of their risk. But he suggested a slight change to the client: Loosen the criteria to focus on companies with one to two women on the senior investment team.\n\n\u201cThat was the essence of what we were trying to get to,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.\n\nFill the Gaps\n\nAmit Bouri, chief executive of the Global Impact Investing Network, said the three most robust areas for impact investing were private debt, private equity and real assets, like land or rental properties. And those areas work for the most affluent investors who can afford to have their money tied up in less-liquid investments.\n\nBut, Mr. Bouri said, \u201cthere are gaps in the market\u201d when it comes to big, publicly traded companies. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to have large-cap public equity exposure, it\u2019s hard to invest in Fortune 500 companies and identify them as impact.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, with big companies, investors may need to apply a \u201cbetter than the rest\u201d approach. With this metric, for instance, the oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil fares well relative to its peers because it has a diverse board.\n\nAndrew Lee, head of impact investing and private markets at UBS Wealth Management, said measuring impact returns could be complicated when judging new companies against existing companies that are trying to make changes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhile there are sets of metrics by sector that are accepted, it is difficult to aggregate across the portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to keep it by sector.\u201d\n\nGrade on a Curve\n\nThe individual trade-offs in impact investing make it difficult to create a general index like the S.&P. 500 to track, although several providers have tried.\n\nR. Paul Herman, chief executive of Human Impact & Profit Investor, or HIP Investor, has developed a measurement framework for impact investments that is not unlike that of a college chemistry course. The HIP Investor Ratings provide what amounts to an actual grade and also a grade on a curve.\n\nMr. Herman said a good raw score for a fund was in the range of 55 to 60 in terms of its impact on society. And the relative score allows an investor to see how that fund performs against similar funds.\n\nCompanies use the measurement to gauge their investments. STOK, an architecture and engineering firm, wanted its 401(k) offerings to align with its progressive values as a company, so it asked Mr. Herman to rate its fund with HIP Investor Ratings.\n\nMs. Karp said investors who focused on smaller-scale investments could be purer in their measurements, but her goal was to invest trillions of dollars to affect big change.\n\n\u201cOne of the things Cornerstone believes is, to really have impact on the world, we need to move trillions of dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cTo do that, you need to evolve the standard of what is the discipline of impact investing.\u201d\n\nOne solution, Ms. Karp said, would be to consider impact measurements in all investments as part of sound investing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSet Your Expectations\n\nSetting expectations is crucial in the selection and measurement of impact investments because the manager will otherwise fail to deliver what the client wants.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to lay things out up front,\u201d Ms. Karp said. \u201cThere should be no excuses.\u201d\n\nThe HIP ratings include the fund\u2019s returns as another factor in actual and adjusted grades for companies. Most of the fund returns in the STOK 401(k) plan, for example, are from the middle to upper end of the HIP range.\n\nAnd Mr. Bouri said his network had developed themes that people could invest in, like clean energy and affordable housing.\n\nStill, to increase the power of impact investments, all investors are going to need to consider investments in that light.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be a do-gooder thing,\u201d Ms. Case said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have diversity because it\u2019s a box we check. We want to have diversity because we\u2019ll be a stronger economy in America and around the world.\u201d", "title": "How to Invest With a Conscience (and Still Make Money)", "authors": ["Paul Sullivan", "Wealth Matters"]}

If breaking news on social media aligns perfectly with your carefully structured view of the world, then pause before liking it or retweeting it. Why? Because you \u2014 like most of us \u2014 have curated a personal news feed to confirm things you already suspected or \u201cknew.\u201d If you didn\u2019t do this yourself (by unfriending people who dared argue politics with you on your feed), Facebook and Twitter are doing it for you. They structure your timeline to make it as agreeable as possible. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s success was premised on building a distribution system tailored to precisely exploit the biases and preconceptions of specified Facebook users.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica is the symptom, not the disease. The larger problem is that unpleasant and frustrating information \u2014 no matter how accurate \u2014 is actively hidden from you to maximize your social media engagement. George Orwell once noted that he became a writer because he possessed \u201ca facility with words and a power of facing unpleasant facts.\u201d There\u2019s no place for \u201cunpleasant facts\u201d in our social media universe. Were Orwell alive today, he\u2019d remind us of the terrible political costs caused by this devolution in our informational habits.\n\n3. Why am I talking? My wife is a psychotherapist, and occasionally I skim her Psychotherapy Networker magazine. I read a piece by a therapist who realized his most effective communicative moments often occurred when he asked himself a simple question: \u201cWhy am I talking?\u201d Inevitably this question shut him up and allowed him to absorb much more information. \u201cWhy am I talking\u201d works out to a great acronym: WAIT. If we all just asked ourselves this simple question immediately before posting or retweeting, we\u2019d all be better off. There are numerous reasons to participate in the public sphere, and everyone can contribute something valuable. But there\u2019s also far too much noise out there, and we need to think more seriously and realistically about the added value of our own communication.\n\nThese are three simple rules. Of course, they contradict every mechanism Facebook and Twitter uses to encourage our behavior on social media. Being more skeptical, engaging more selectively and prioritizing links to information providers outside our social media silos will hurt the bottom line of the social media giants. Using social media in a more responsible manner might ultimately leave these companies to rot away as they cede their civic responsibilities to the Russian trolls and bots dedicated to polluting our discourse. If they won\u2019t act, it\u2019s up to us.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nO.K., so what do I do now?\n\nThere is a multipronged approach you can take to protect yourself from data-harvesting apps and programs. That includes tools you can install in your browser and settings you can tweak on Facebook. Here\u2019s a run down of what you should do:\n\n\u2022 Audit your Facebook apps. If you used Facebook to sign in to a third-party website, game or app, those services may continue to access your personal data. On Facebook, go to the settings page and click on the Apps tab to see which apps are connected to your account. From there, you can take a closer look at the permissions you granted to each app to see what information you are sharing. Remove any apps that you find suspicious or no longer use. (Facebook has also made some changes to prevent the gathering of detailed information of friends of users.)\n\nOn the App Settings page there is another setting called Apps Others Use. This is where you choose which details are shared about you when your friends use apps. Make sure to uncheck all the boxes if you don\u2019t want any of your information, like your birthday or hometown, accessed by your friends\u2019 apps.\n\n\u2022 Audit your Facebook privacy settings. If you are concerned about what details apps can see about you and your Facebook friends, now is a good time to check your privacy settings and minimize the information you share publicly. For example, you can make sure that only your friends can see your Facebook posts, or that only you can see your friends list.\n\n\u2022 Read privacy policies. When you sign up for a new app or web tool, the company typically asks you to agree to its terms of service. Make it a habit to peruse the terms and pay particular attention to the privacy policy. If you see language that suggests your data could be shared in a way that makes you uncomfortable, don\u2019t use the program.\n\n\u2022 Install a tracker blocker. There are add-ons that you can install in your browser that try to block trackers embedded on websites. But be aware that in some cases, they will make parts of websites work improperly. In our tests, Disconnect and Privacy Badger were useful tools for blocking trackers on Google\u2019s Chrome browser.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s a primer on how tracking works, to give you a sense of why blockers are important: When you engage with an app on Facebook, it may plant a tracker in your web browser, like a cookie, that collects information from you. Even when you close out of the app, the tracker can continue to follow your activities, like the other sites you visit or the people you interact with through status updates, according to Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t go away after you\u2019ve stopped looking at the ad,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Install an ad blocker. Another way to block trackers is to prevent ads from loading altogether. Ad blockers are also add-ons that you can install for your browser on your mobile device or computer. Mobile ads are fully functioning programs, and they sometimes include malware that harvest some of your data. Even the largest websites do not have tight control over the ads that appear on their sites \u2014 and sometimes malicious code can appear inside their ad networks. A popular ad blocker among security researchers is uBlock Origin.\n\n\u2022 Clear your browsing data. Periodically, you can clear your cookies and browsing history. Apple, Google and Microsoft have published instructions on how to clear data for their browsers Safari, Chrome and Internet Explorer. That will temporarily delete cookies and trackers, though they will probably reappear over time.\n\n\u2022 Be wary of unknown brands. Even if you read the privacy policies, you still may have to take them with a grain of salt. In the case of the thisisyourdigitallife app, the fine print said the information would be collected for academic use, not commercial purposes. So think twice before sharing information with unfamiliar companies or organizations.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI work for a staffing agency that places workers in groups of varying size, to work on specific projects, often at large firms. Recently, a member of a crew I am part of has engaged in behavior that could easily be construed as sexual harassment. He has touched one person in the group inappropriately \u2014 running his finger down her neck, caressing her back, for example. He has also repeatedly asked co-workers for the phone numbers of women in our group. (In general, our crews are majority female.) He even asked a recent widow if he could move in with her. Some of us are concerned since all of this pretty much violates the client firm\u2019s sexual harassment policies. But I think there is a reluctance to report him because the job doesn\u2019t pay well, and he needs the money. Any ideas? EVANSTON, ILL.\n\nAs described, your colleague\u2019s behavior is a serious issue. The fact that he \u201cneeds the money\u201d is not a valid excuse. Nor is it a good reason to let this slide.\n\nYou should definitely take some sort of action, but the details might depend on a couple of factors. For general legal context, I checked with Amy Epstein Gluck, an employment lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office of the firm FisherBroyles. Given the variety and frequency of this worker\u2019s apparent behavior, she said, the behavior should probably be reported to management at the agency that you and your fellow contractors work for.\n\n\u201cThe agency should investigate,\u201d Ms. Epstein Gluck said, and it should promptly talk to this employee and other relevant parties, handling the issue as appropriate.

Still, they didn\u2019t want to spend too much money. Centerpieces and bouquets are often thrown away after the night ends, and as architects, they believe strongly in sustainability.\n\n\u201cWeddings can be so wasteful, so we tried to reuse as much as we could,\u201d said Ms. Guedes, who budgeted $2,000 for florals. She and her husband used discarded squares of marble from finished architectural projects to make decorative table number plaques and seating number assignments. Then Ms. Guedes discovered Bloomerent, a company that finds ways for brides and grooms to share wedding flowers. \u201cWe loved that our flowers would have a second life,\u201d she said. And, of course, they saved cash.\n\nPhoto\n\nMy Flowers Are Now Your Flowers\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: If you sign up with one of 60 participating Bloomerent florists, brides and grooms can rent back their wedding flowers to another couple locally, with florists picking up the designs at the completion of one wedding and delivering it to another wedding for use the following day. (Currently, the company works with florists in 26 states and the District of Columbia.) The reward: big savings on flowers for both brides. The first bride receives a 10 percent refund on the total cost of her flowers, while the second bride pays 40 to 60 percent of the original cost. (So if the flowers originally cost $10,000, the second bride is paying only $4,000 to $6,000, and the first bride gets $1,000 back.)\n\nWhen Ms. Guedes\u2019s industrial modern affair wrapped one Friday night in November, the long strands of greenery that lined the extra long communal tables at her wedding were set up at Patty Lee\u2019s wedding \u2014 a complete stranger to Ms. Guedes \u2014 the next day at the Brooklyn Winery. Here, the same strands of floral garland were also used to decorate long communal tables. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell \u2014 our florist did such a good job refreshing them,\u201d said Ms. Lee, a freelance food writer.\n\nPhoto\n\nEveryone wants their wedding to be beautiful, and florals are often considered crucial when completing the look and feel of a ceremony and reception space.

Don\u2019t Be.\n\nErica Jones, the creative director of O Luxe Designs, a Boston-based wedding design company that caters to high-end clients around the world, says that floral budgets climb when couples meet with a florist with very specific ideas, often gleaned from a glossy social media post or swoon-worthy magazine spread. \u201cYou\u2019ll save money by going in with an open mind,\u201d she said. You should still bring the photo, but ask how you can realistically achieve the look within your budget. Maybe the floral designer can suggest a similar color scheme using less expensive flowers, or maybe the flowers in the photo are particularly expensive at that time of year, but a similar flower is less at the same time.\n\nPhoto\n\nSometimes a simple adjustment can save hundreds or thousands of dollars. Ranunculus flowers, which are often considered timeless and ephemeral, are readily available most of the year, but one popular variety, the Clooney, is available only for a few weeks, making them extra expensive.

{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "The state also has an interest in protecting fetal human life, even if fetuses are not legal persons, but this state interest needs to be balanced against others. Nevertheless, our courts have determined repeatedly that, until the last third or so of a pregnancy, the state\u2019s interest in protecting women\u2019s health and decisional privacy outweighs its interest in protecting fetal life. Yet, why do these interests need to be rebalanced in the last part of pregnancy?\n\nFirst, performing an abortion in the last months of pregnancy is medically more complicated and poses a higher degree of risk than one performed earlier. Moreover, a pregnant woman in the late stages of a healthy pregnancy has already endured most of the bodily burdens of a pregnancy, and thus the health benefits of an abortion at that stage may not outweigh the risks.\n\nSecond, given the viability of the fetus in the late stages of pregnancy, an abortion \u2014 a medical procedure in which the fetus\u2019s death is an unavoidable outcome \u2014 imposes on the medical staff the act of performing a procedure in which a viable fetus will die. It is only reasonable to order a medical team to do this when such a procedure is medically necessary. Alternatively, attempting to induce a premature live birth that is not medically necessary, should a woman request this, would likely injure a viable fetus and endanger its postnatal health and life. Because an abortion is a medical service, and not something a woman decides or does by herself, her right to decisional privacy in this matter is not absolute.\n\nGiven these considerations, governments have a compelling interest in restricting abortions in late stages of a healthy pregnancy, but they have an equally compelling interest in ensuring that legal and safe abortions are available to women, without burdensome restrictions, before the last third or so of a pregnancy.\n\nIf, in the future, a public consensus on the question of when human personhood begins (in particular, one that agrees that a human person could exist before any complex psychological properties have developed), then we would need to recognize that there is more than one \u201cpatient\u201d involved in an abortion. We are not there yet. To get there, the minority who believe this would have to convince the rest of us of this metaphysical, or religiously based, assertion. Until they do, we need to focus on the more manageable and relevant question of how to regulate a medical service or procedure that is sought by millions of women.\n\nWhen there is a lack of public consensus on a moral question, our public policies need to reflect the principles on which there is broad agreement. In a liberal democracy, we don\u2019t need to resolve many difficult questions of individual morality in order to have defensible public policies \u2014 policies that are justified by our commitment to democratic decision making, liberty and equality. State officials who appeal to their own beliefs on questions of individual morality, in order to justify their policy decisions, are violating values more fundamental to our society.\n\nQuestions like \u201cIs homosexuality immoral?\u201d or \u201cIs abortion immoral?\u201d suggest that entire groups of people that pursue activities necessary to securing their basic human needs are possibly morally compromised, and are thus insulting; they also encourage civic leaders and their constituents to take up rigid and extreme views based on their own personal convictions, and to be morally arrogant toward others who don\u2019t share their views.\n\nRaising these questions in the midst of heated public debate about access to abortion services or to civil marriage makes it seem as if we are hopelessly divided as a society in ways that render the policy questions irresolvable. Yet questions about individual moral behavior or personal ethics, which still generate wide disagreement based on religious diversity, are not really all that relevant to the issue of lawmaking.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "In a Sunday Review essay last weekend, David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard, argued that science is changing how we think about \u201crace\u201d and urged a candid discussion of the findings, whatever they may be. Hundreds of readers left comments, many expressing worry about the possibility that the results could be misinterpreted or nefariously applied. Here are Dr. Reich\u2019s responses to some of the comments. \u2014 The Editors\n\nUnfortunately, science has always been misused. From slavery, to eugenics, to economic Darwinism, to anti-abortion politics, the latest scientific knowledge has been employed in the service of evil. The idea of forestalling such efforts is valiant but fruitless. Science must continue its pursuit of truth, and scientists, as always, must speak out when their discoveries are exploited for harmful purposes. \u2014 Syfredrick, Providence, R.I.\n\nWe scientists always need to keep in mind our social responsibilities and to think about whether what we are doing has positive or negative effects on our world.\n\nWith respect to today\u2019s study of human variation, I am optimistic \u2014 I believe that it has been socially positive. It is making every racist view of the world untenable. In my just-published book, I explain how the ancient DNA revolution \u2014 which has provided far greater power to reveal what happened in our deep past than what was available before \u2014 has done far more to undermine racist beliefs than to support them. As I wrote in the final paragraph of my book:\n\nThe study of human variation has not always been a force for good. In Nazi Germany, someone with my expertise at interpreting genetic data would have been tasked with categorizing people by ancestry had that been possible with the science of the 1930s. But in our time, the findings from ancient DNA leave little solace for racist or nationalistic misinterpretation. In this field, the pursuit of truth for its own sake has overwhelmingly had the effect of exploding stereotypes, undercutting prejudice, and highlighting the connections among peoples not previously known to be related. I am optimistic that the direction of my work and that of my colleagues is to promote understanding, and I welcome our opportunity to do our best by the people, ancient and modern, whom we have been given the privilege to study.\n\nMy book also gives concrete examples of how it is no longer so easy to twist science to support long-cherished stereotypes because ancient DNA is now debunking the stories that used to be made up about the nature of human variation. As I wrote there:\n\nThe Nazi ideology of a \u201cpure\u201d Indo-European-speaking Aryan race with deep roots in Germany, traceable through artifacts of the Corded Ware culture, has been shattered by the finding that the people who used these artifacts came from a mass migration from the Russian steppe, a place that German nationalists would have despised as a source. The Hindutva ideology that there was no major contribution to Indian culture from migrants from outside South Asia is undermined by the fact that approximately half of the ancestry of Indians today is derived from multiple waves of mass migration from Iran and the Eurasian steppe within the last five thousand years. Similarly, the idea that the Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi have ancestry from West Eurasian farmers that Hutus do not \u2014 an idea that has been incorporated into arguments for genocide \u2014 is nonsense. We now know that nearly every group living today is the product of repeated population mixtures that have occurred over thousands and tens of thousands of years. Mixing is in human nature, and no one population is \u2014 or could be \u2014 pure.\n\nHaving been immersed in the ancient DNA revolution for the past 10 years, I am confident that anyone who pays attention to what it is finding cannot come away feeling affirmed in racist beliefs. My childhood guesses about who we are and how we\u2019re related to one another \u2014 and about the nature of differences among people \u2014 have been shown to be wrong again and again.", "title": "Opinion | How to Talk About \u2018Race\u2019 and Genetics", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "As Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, has written: \u201cThe economic case for corporate tax rate reduction is not based on how companies \u2018use\u2019 their tax savings. It is based on how companies change their behavior in order to obtain larger tax savings.\u201d\n\nYet the early debate about whether the tax cut is working has barely focused on the incentive effect, tracking instead what companies are doing with their cash windfalls.\n\nMr. Trump boasts that he\u2019s put more money in the hands of corporations and that they are using it to give bonuses to their workers. Many critics counter that the recent spike in stock buybacks shows the money isn\u2019t going to anything useful like financing new investments.\n\nBoth of these arguments are beside the point. They\u2019re based on flawed reasoning that says businesses invest only when they\u2019ve got the cash on hand to pay for it.\n\nIt\u2019s wrong because companies with profitable investment opportunities can usually find ways to finance them, whether by borrowing from the bank, issuing stock or bonds, or taking on strategic partners. (Cash is especially helpful for smaller companies that find it difficult to borrow, or for projects where outside investors fear being exploited, but these effects are likely to be small.)\n\nThe big mistake is to assume that what\u2019s scarce is cash. The reality is that profitable investment opportunities are scarce.\n\nWhat can we learn from the recent surge in stock buybacks, in which companies buy back their own shares, effectively returning their spare cash to shareholders?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nQuite possibly, nothing, as far as the merit of the tax cuts goes. Standard economic theories suggest buybacks would occur whether or not the tax cuts succeed at stimulating investment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nHere\u2019s why. The tax cut showers cash on corporations indiscriminately, not just on those with great investment ideas. Some companies now have extra cash but no ideas to spend it on. For them, the best response is to return the money to shareholders, through higher dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nWhether that money will bolster the economy depends on what shareholders do with these unused funds.\n\nSay the tax bill is a success and it leads companies to find many new investment opportunities. Shareholders will be eager to use their newly-returned funds to finance those companies with the most profitable projects. In this happy version, the buybacks channel money from firms with few profitable investment opportunities to those with better prospects. Investment rises and the economy grows more rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, the tax bill could be a bust, for several possible reasons. Perhaps lower taxes don\u2019t lead companies to invest more. Maybe rising government debt results in higher interest rates, countering the investment incentives created by the new tax code. Whatever the cause, if the tax bill fails to create new investment opportunities, shareholders won\u2019t reinvest their funds.\n\nIn either scenario \u2014 both when the bill\u2019s proponents are right and when they\u2019re wrong \u2014 stock buybacks are common. John Cochrane, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, has described the idea that buybacks yield any worthwhile judgment about the efficacy of the tax law as \u201cthe buyback fallacy.\u201d\n\nThe broader lesson is that it\u2019s worth paying greater attention to what actually happens to investment, and less to cash flows and buybacks.\n\nFinally, what should we make of Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts that his corporate tax cuts are responsible for companies announcing bonuses for their workers?\n\nKent Smetters \u2014 a professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, and a Treasury official in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration \u2014 found Mr. Trump\u2019s reasoning unimpressive.\n\nIn the short run, giving more money to corporations helps only the owners of corporations. The benefits trickle down to workers over many years, as tax cuts first increase investment, eventually intensifying competition among firms looking for workers to operate newly-purchased machinery and other capital equipment, ultimately raising wages.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, Mr. Smetters suggested that these carefully-timed bonus announcements were a \u201cgratuitous payback for President Trump,\u201d from opportunistic chief executives looking to be seen \u201cpatting him on the back.\u201d\n\nMr. Smetters noted that the incentive to grant pay rises hasn\u2019t risen, but the incentive to make Trump-friendly corporate announcements probably has.\n\nNeither stock buybacks nor bonus announcements say much about whether the tax bill is working.

Audrey Hepburn was searching for designs that would inspire the character of Sabrina Fairchild, a chauffeur\u2019s daughter who is transformed into a sophisticate while studying in Paris, in Billy Wilder\u2019s film \u201cSabrina\u201d (1954).\n\n\u201cShe wore tight little pants and a little T-shirt, and I was so disappointed she wasn\u2019t Katharine,\u201d Mr. Givenchy said of the actress, who came before him in ballerina flats and a straw gondolier\u2019s hat. \u201cI said I had no time \u2014 I was in the middle of making my second collection, and I didn\u2019t have too many workers then. But we had dinner that night, and before dinner was over, I told her, \u2018I\u2019ll do anything for you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the duration of their partnership, Ms. Hepburn said it was Mr. Givenchy\u2019s designs that gave her the confidence to play her parts, or to step onstage before thousands of people to promote a charity. But \u201cwhen I first went to Hubert\u201d in 1953, she told Vogue, \u201cI was still in homemade dresses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Hepburn insisted on seeing Mr. Givenchy\u2019s designs in progress, and felt they were perfect for the character; one was a dress with a square, above-the-collarbone neckline that would come to be known as the \u201cd\u00e9collet\u00e9 Sabrina.\u201d She persuaded Mr. Givenchy to submit several designs for the film, including that number, which closed with little bows on the shoulders.\n\nBut Edith Head, the most powerful costume designer of the period, was nominated for an Academy Award for the designs in \u201cSabrina,\u201d and when she won the Oscar she did not acknowledge Mr. Givenchy\u2019s contributions in her acceptance speech. (In fact, she maintained until her death that she had created the \u201cd\u00e9collet\u00e9 Sabrina.\u201d)\n\nMs. Hepburn was furious, and from that point forward insisted, \u201cEach time I\u2019m in a film, Givenchy dresses me.\u201d\n\nMr. Givenchy never complained, and even allowed in later interviews that Ms. Head may have at some point made a copy based on his design.\n\nAround this time he was introduced to his creative idol, the Spanish couturier Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, with whom Mr. Givenchy would share an uncommon bond for more than a decade. It was during this period that Mr. Givenchy\u2019s style transformed from simple and girlish to lavishly embroidered and romantic, with a strict reverence for construction.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1959, he moved his atelier across the street from Mr. Balenciaga\u2019s studio on the Avenue George V, and from then on the two enjoyed a creative relationship that produced memorable designs, like the chemise and the sack dress.\n\nA devout Protestant, Mr. Givenchy regarded his talents as a gift from God, but in 2007 he told Women\u2019s Wear Daily: \u201cBalenciaga was my religion. Since I\u2019m a believer, for me, there\u2019s Balenciaga, and the good Lord.\u201d\n\nMr. Givenchy was the founding chairman of the Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga Foundation, which opened a museum dedicated to Mr. Balenciaga in Getaria, Spain, in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince his retirement from fashion in 1995, Mr. Givenchy remained active in the arts as an antiques expert for Christie\u2019s, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles and the Louvre museum. He also managed the French branch of the World Monuments Fund for several years.\n\nHe maintained several residences, including an h\u00f4tel particulier decorated with paintings by Matisse and Picasso in Paris and an exceedingly grand chateau in France, the 16th-century Manoir du Jonchet. Its gardens were designed \u201cas a delicate piece of embroidery,\u201d he once said, describing a collaboration with one of his many longtime friends and clients, the American philanthropist Rachel Mellon, known as Bunny.\n\nSix feet six inches tall, with a shock of sand-colored hair, chivalrous to a fault, athletic and handsome, Mr. Givenchy was the epitome of a French aristocrat.\n\nPhoto\n\nSon of a Marquis\n\nCount Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy was born on Feb. 21, 1927, in Beauvais, France, the younger of two sons of B\u00e9atrice Badin, who was known as Sissi, and Lucien Taffin de Givenchy, the marquis of Givenchy. His mother\u2019s family was well connected with the great tapestry artisans of Beauvais, and his father\u2019s had been ennobled in the 18th century.\n\nAfter Lucien died of influenza in 1930, Hubert and his brother, Jean Claude, were brought up by their mother and maternal grandparents. He was introduced to the fine craftsmanship of textiles at an early age.\n\nWhen Hubert was 10, the family visited a Parisian fair, organized by the couturier Jeanne Lanvin, which included a display of fashions by Chanel, Elsa Schiaparelli and other designers. It was a moment that Mr. Givenchy later remembered as inspiring his career.\n\n\u201cIt was always my dream to be a dress designer, and my mother accepted that decision,\u201d he recalled during a talk at the Oxford University Union in 2010.\n\nAt 17, he left for Paris to study at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. The next year, through his family\u2019s connections, he began an apprenticeship with the innovative couturier Jacques Fath. In short order, he went on to work in the studios of Robert Piguet, a Swiss designer known for his rigorous organization and devotion to classical elegance, in 1946, and Lucien Lelong the same year, after Christian Dior had left that house to establish his own.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the postwar years of Paris were challenging for couture fashion in Europe, as designers struggled to create a case for expensive decoration in an environment of austerity, as evidenced by the controversy stirred by Dior\u2019s introduction of the New Look in 1947.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom 1947 to 1952, Mr. Givenchy worked for the eccentric Ms. Schiaparelli, dreaming of starting his own house even as leading couturiers, including Edward Molyneux and Mr. Piguet, were closing their doors because of the rising costs for luxury fabrics.\n\nThe March 3, 1952, issue of Life magazine introduced Mr. Givenchy to American audiences in a four-page feature: \u201cDe Givenchy, a New Name in Paris.\u201d The young designer had planted his flag in a tiny showroom at 8 Rue Alfred de Vigny, heralding a new concept for modern women: separates that were designed to be worn interchangeably, creating multiple outfits from a few key pieces \u2014 three tops plus three skirts equals nine outfits.\n\nA white cardigan with coral beads, an organdy blouse and a fringed black sweater could be worn with a black skirt, a longer black skirt or a striped black skirt. Part of Mr. Givenchy\u2019s strategy was practical: His fabrics cost about a third less than those of his competitors, and he recognized the growing market in America for sportier fashion and ready-to-wear. He also hired Ms. Graziani, who ensured that important buyers and editors would pay attention.\n\nLife magazine wrote: \u201cHis small collection ranged from coats and ball gowns that compete with the seasoned haute couture, to fashion gimmicks like a paper-lantern-pleated babushka, big sleeved blouses in washable shirting and \u2018Garbo\u2019 hats. These were displayed in a show as smoothly elegant as the most experienced house in Paris could put on \u2014 in quarters so cramped that ironing was done in the bathroom.\u201d\n\nThe Bettina blouse, a white cotton shirt with black-embroidered flamenco ruffles, became a sensation. At the time it was common for American retailers to pay a fee, called a caution, to couture designers in order to buy their patterns, so that they could copy them line for line at home. A copy of the Bettina blouse sold at Russeks in New York for $10.95, while two examples of couture originals with lavish embroidery from Mr. Givenchy\u2019s first collection, according to The New York Times that year, cost $2,800.\n\nMr. Givenchy created one of the most recognizable fashion labels in France, with products licensed for children\u2019s wear, men\u2019s dress shirts, and at one point a Givenchy edition of a Lincoln luxury car.\n\nPhoto\n\nLadylike Meets Chic\n\nCritics described Mr. Givenchy, with due respect, as dependable for creating tasteful clothes that looked timeless \u2014 dramatic capes and shawls, two-piece evening dresses, simple jersey bodices and minimalist tunics in a brilliant array of colors. Designs that were chic and ladylike were the hallmarks of the house.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Givenchy was the rare designer who maintained financial independence for most of his career and also owned his own fragrance business, which was run by his brother, who died in 2009. Ms. Hepburn once appeared without payment in an ad campaign for Givenchy\u2019s hit scent L\u2019Interdit.\n\nMr. Venet is Mr. Givenchy\u2019s only immediate survivor. A nephew, James de Givenchy, one of Jean Claude\u2019s seven children, is the designer of the New York jewelry collection Taffin.\n\nHubert de Givenchy\u2019s wealthy clientele included the Duchess of Windsor, who wore a coat to her husband\u2019s funeral that was reportedly created by Mr. Givenchy overnight. Jacqueline Onassis, when she was Jacqueline Kennedy, had to publicly renounce French couture during her years as the first lady.\n\nAmong many awards, Givenchy received the Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur in 1983 and a lifetime achievement award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1995. He was chosen for the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nMr. Givenchy sold his house to the luxury conglomerate LVMH in 1988 and continued to design there until his retirement. Just hours after he presented his final couture collection, in 1995, the company announced that his successor would be the brash British upstart John Galliano, who moved to Dior a year later and was replaced by another maverick, Alexander McQueen.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 2005, the label was handed to the Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, who introduced an aggressive aesthetic of street wear printed with gaping sharks and raging Rottweiler graphics in addition to more avant-garde evening wear.\n\nMr. Tisci\u2019s muses included the transgender model Lea T and the reality television star Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West \u2014 providing a fascinating contrast of aesthetics to the Hepburn-Givenchy dynamic upon which the elder designer, for the most part, refrained from remarking.\n\nIn a 2007 interview with Women\u2019s Wear Daily, however, Mr. Givenchy allowed: \u201cI suffer. What is happening doesn\u2019t make me happy. After all, one is proud of one\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis was a rare moment of indiscretion. Normally, he would say that he took no interest and that he was too busy to look at Givenchy collections since he retired. It was unseemly, he said, to complain.\n\nLast March, Clare Waight Keller became the first woman to run the creative side of the Givenchy house when she was made artistic director, replacing Mr. Tisci.\n\nSpeaking to the Oxford students in 2010, Mr. Givenchy gave this piece of advice to the aspiring designers among them:\n\n\u201cYou must, if it\u2019s possible, be born with a kind of elegance.

Each time, he spoke warmly about his dear friend and most devoted client, Audrey Hepburn. Here are some excerpts.\n\nHow did you first meet her?\n\nParamount Studios called. I was told that \u201cMiss Hepburn\u201d was coming to look for clothes for her new movie, \u201cSabrina.\u201d Since I loved Katharine Hepburn\u2019s style and look, I thought this was fantastic. But when the door of my studio opened, there stood a young woman, very slim, very tall, with doe eyes and short hair and wearing a pair of narrow pants, a little T-shirt, slippers and a gondolier\u2019s hat with red ribbon that read \u201cVenezia.\u201d I told her \u201cMademoiselle, I would love to help you, but I have very few sewers, I am in the middle of doing a collection, I can\u2019t make you clothes.\u201d So she said, \u201cShow me what you have already made for the collection.\u201d She tried on the dresses \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what I need!\u201d \u2014 and they fit her, too. We just changed the top of the evening dress when she dances with William Holden in the tennis court from black jersey to a white organza bustier since it was for a summer ball.\n\nHow did you design for her?\n\nAudrey was someone who knew perfectly how to dress, and knew perfectly what she should wear. What counted was her eyes, her face and her silhouette. We refined, purified, cleared away for her face. We had to, as I would say, surround Audrey. The results were extraordinary because her face and her style became my style.\n\nShe served as the first \u201cface\u201d of a perfume, for you. How did that come about?\n\nI said to her: \u201cI\u2019m creating this perfume called Interdit, and I want it to be your perfume for all the women in the world.\u201d She immediately understood and she said, \u201cYou can use my picture.\u201d We didn\u2019t pay a million dollars for Miss Hepburn to be our brand image. All that happened with truth, friendship. We understood each other.\n\nWhat made her so special?\n\nShe had an elegance, she knew how to walk, she knew what she wanted, she knew the faults in her face, she knew herself perfectly. She was true, honest. From time to time I\u2019d say, because she was so thin, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if we didn\u2019t show your collarbone?\u201d And she\u2019d say, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d As Billy Wilder said, \u201cWhat counts in Audrey is her allure.\u201d And she was kind. When the telephone would ring in the studio, I knew when it was her. I would answer and she\u2019d say, \u201cI know you are busy, but I want to send you a big kiss,\u201d and she\u2019d hang up. That was Audrey.", "title": "Hubert de Givenchy on Audrey Hepburn", "authors": ["Dana Thomas"]}

There\u2019s not a ton of choices.\u201d\n\nSandy Edry discovered the neighborhood 19 years ago, when he was a journalist and lived on the Upper West Side. \u201cI decided to take a very long walk up Riverside Park toward the bridge,\u201d he said, referring to the George Washington Bridge. \u201cWhen I got close to the bridge, I saw something that looked like a mirage: a tiny red lighthouse. I kind of fell in love with it, and came out of the park. I started walking around the area and was shocked to find a beautiful neighborhood.\u201d\n\nMr. Edry, now 50 and a real estate agent with Keller Williams NYC, first rented and then bought an apartment. He has seen gradual changes. Starting around 2004, he said, better restaurants, a gourmet market and more upscale shops came in. The area was \u201chistorically a German-Jewish enclave,\u201d he said, but many of the younger people left. \u201cNow they are returning.\u201d\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Find\n\nSet on a bluff somewhat apart from the rest of the city, Hudson Heights stretches from West 173rd Street to the top of Fort Tryon Park (home to the Cloisters, a branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art), and from Broadway to the Hudson River. A park beside the water is unusually wild in some parts and conducive to picnics in others, including the area around the historic Little Red Lighthouse, subject of a popular children\u2019s book. Other green spots are J. Hood Wright Park, which includes a recreation center, and Bennett Park, which occupies the highest point of land in Manhattan, 265 feet above sea level. A paved outline near the center marks part of the footprint of a fort built there in 1776 by American troops.\n\nResidential areas are lined with handsome apartment buildings, many built in the 1920s, \u201930s and \u201940s in an Art Deco style. Two complexes are particularly distinctive. Castle Village, a string of five co-op towers, each with four wings, was completed in 1939 and is set on 7.5 acres of parklike grounds with play areas and benches overlooking the river. Hudson View Gardens is a 1924 enclave of 15 Tudor-Style buildings on a winding private street with gardens, a playground and other amenities, meant to resemble a medieval English village. In 2016, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.", "title": "Hudson Heights: A Hidden Gem, Gaining Popularity", "authors": []}

And so I made my way to Shawinigan, in central Quebec, at the red-neon-lit brewery of Le Trou du Diable (The Devil\u2019s Hole), with Isaac Tremblay, the laid-back founder of one of Quebec\u2019s most successful microbreweries.\n\nIsaac, a former film technician on movie sets, first conceived of the idea for the brewery at age 25 with a group of friends from Shawinigan. He named it after a mythical bottomless caldron at the base of Shawinigan waterfall that leads straight to hell (he wrote his business plan on set during breaks). Isaac likes to draw, and his beer labels feature intricate narratives and psychedelic colors.\n\nMany readers urged me to visit a microbrewery because beer is such a part of Quebec\u2019s social fabric. Quebec\u2019s first brewery, the Brasserie du Roi, was established in 1668 by Jean Talon, the chief administrator after the French colonized Quebec. Today, there are roughly 150 microbreweries in the province, reflecting an appetite for local producers, and artisanal beer.\n\nOver a dinner of beef tartare and a citrus and coriander-infused pint of Blanche de Shawi beer, Isaac noted that, in this former pulp and paper industrial region, the \u201ctaverne\u201d has long been a place that marked the end of a factory shift, a place for beer-fueled political banter and letting loose. \u201cQuebec is a melting pot of France, Britain and Irish immigration, and drinking beer is part of its bon vivant spirit,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJoin the conversation on Instagram here.\n\nJf_dugas: But not a microbrewery anymore...

{"date": "2018-03-16 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe Venetian settings are enchanting and Commissario Guido Brunetti\u2019s investigative methods are drolly amusing. But it\u2019s the living, bleeding humanity of the characters that makes Donna Leon\u2019s police procedurals so engaging. In THE TEMPTATION OF FORGIVENESS (Atlantic Monthly, $26), Brunetti comes to the assistance of Professoressa Crosera, whose 15-year-old son is taking drugs and whose husband suffered a brain injury after being thrown down the stone steps of a bridge. In his sensitive dealings with the victims of crime, Brunetti proves as much a psychologist and social worker as a cop: When the distraught Signora Crosera appears to be on the verge of a breakdown, he escorts her home and urges her to cook dinner for her children, \u201cto show them you\u2019re all right and life is normal.\u201d\n\nDespite the personal satisfaction Brunetti takes in his job, it distresses him that the cynical Venetians have so little use for their police force. \u201cThe contract\u2019s been broken, between us and the state,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one trusts us.\u201d But Brunetti occasionally has doubts about the efficacy of the law, and at those times he\u2019s likely to consult the classics. This time he reads Sophocles for inspiration about the ethics of breaking an unjust law. \u201cI am doing only what I must do,\u201d declares the unruly heroine of \u201cAntigone,\u201d a role model for Brunetti.\n\nTagging along after this sleuth is a wonderful way to see Venice like a native, especially since Leon takes care to give us precise directions for his routes. But Brunetti\u2019s observations aren\u2019t always pretty. The air pollution is beyond acceptable limits, and don\u2019t even mention the pollution of the canals. Drugs are everywhere in the schools, even the private schools. Much of the \u201cVenetian\u201d glassware is made in China and the newspaper kiosks are full of junky trinkets. The once-bustling fruit and vegetable stalls of the outdoor markets are emptying out and half the fishmongers are gone. As Signora Crosera notes, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for Venetians to buy,\u201d not when olive oil costs 15 euros for a half liter and the new shops are catering to tourists. \u201cWhat Venetian wants a glass elephant or a plastic mask?\u201d\n\n\u2666\n\n\u201cI put people to rest. That\u2019s my job.\u201d Jim Zigarowski stands behind those modest words in Brad Meltzer\u2019s new thriller, THE ESCAPE ARTIST (Grand Central, $28). As an undertaker at Dover Air Force Base, Zig works on \u201cthe U.S. government\u2019s most top secret and high-profile cases,\u201d including the fatal crash in Alaska of a small plane carrying the head of the Library of Congress, a close friend of the president. Whenever a person of consequence perishes in a disaster, the other victims barely get a mention \u2014 unless one of them happens to be Sgt. First Class Nola Brown, a decorated combat veteran who held the prestigious job of the Army\u2019s artist in residence. Although Nola is more a notion than a character, Zig is a mensch, and when he realizes that the body he autopsied is not the Nola he knew as his daughter\u2019s friend, he makes his own inquiries. Of more interest than this investigation, however, is the mortuary business itself, especially the respectful if elaborate procedures of military funerals like the one in which the president himself serves as a pallbearer.\n\n\u2666\n\nWhatever the British writer Clare Mackintosh tells you, don\u2019t believe a word of it. Deception, misdirection, fabrication and fakery are the tricks of her trade, and there\u2019s plenty of all that in LET ME LIE (Berkley, $26). After a slow and soggy start, the narrative picks up as it follows Anna Johnson\u2019s efforts to determine why her parents chose to commit suicide, seven months apart, by leaping from the cliffs at Beachy Head, \u201ca beautiful, haunting, agonizing place. At once uplifting and destroying.\u201d\n\nMurray Mackenzie, a retired police detective caring for a suicidal wife, is also fixated on this curious case, all the more so when Anna confides that she thinks she\u2019s seen her mother \u2014 or perhaps her ghost. Many (perhaps too many) narrative twists and turns later, the mystery is resolved, but not before all the principals in this moody story have gone through their own private hells.\n\n\u2666\n\nIt takes brains \u2014 and a quirky sense of humor \u2014 to pull off a clever crime caper like the ones Donald E. Westlake, the master of this genre, executed with such panache. Paul Di Filippo gives it an honest try in THE BIG GET-EVEN (Blackstone, $26.99), working with a motley crew of scam artists who team up to take revenge on a common enemy, a real-estate mogul named Barnaby Nancarrow. He\u2019s a real jerk and deserves whatever he gets, so let\u2019s not shed any tears when Glen McClinton, a disbarred lawyer and two-bit con man (\u201cBernie Madoff, c\u2019est moi\u201d), hooks up with Stan Hasso (\u201ca crook with a certain code of ethics\u201d) to hustle the tycoon out of $20 million. Stan has a plan that involves buying a decrepit motor lodge that comes with 500 godforsaken acres on a weedy lake. To pull off the swindle, the ratty resort must first be restored to a functional state \u2014 a chore so distracting that the men (and the women who clean up after them) wait until we\u2019ve lost all interest before they even launch the heist.", "title": "Hustles, Hoaxes and Heinous Crimes", "authors": ["Marilyn Stasio"]}

He told me he did so, and my ex said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem again.\n\nHow can I get over my sense of betrayal, my rage and my desire to punish this man for the disrespectful way he treated me? I want him to be appropriately sanctioned for violating workplace policy, but as a woman in a male-dominated setting, I know pursuing such action would make the environment hostile and stressful for me. The stress from this is already negatively affecting my work. How can I get closure and let this go?\n\nLearned the Hard Way\n\nSteve Almond: You\u2019re dealing with two forms of betrayal here, Learned, both painful and infuriating. The first is personal. Given the fact that you ended the relationship because you were \u201cfalling for him,\u201d it seems that part of you hoped the erotic connection you felt for this man would lead to a loving relationship. Your ex didn\u2019t provide that. He then violated your trust by bragging about intimate details of your sexual life with co-workers. That betrayal is both personal and professional. If your ex violated the company sexual harassment policy \u2014 and if outing a co-worker isn\u2019t a violation, I don\u2019t know what is \u2014 he should be held accountable. The fact that his supervisor is his \u201cfriend\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. He either broke the rules or he didn\u2019t. I realize pursuing this course could make your work environment stressful and hostile. But I\u2019d suggest that a workplace where any employee with a penis gets to flout the sexual harassment policy is already hostile and stressful for every employee without one. Threatening to file a grievance to silence this man hasn\u2019t resolved your feelings because he\u2019s already said too much, and you know it.\n\nCheryl Strayed: I think you should file a grievance. Not because doing so will undo the damage that\u2019s already been done to your sense of well-being at work, but because it may prevent further damage. You did not share the details of your company\u2019s code of conduct with us, but it seems you\u2019re sure that your co-worker/ex-lover violated it when he shared information about your sex life with his supervisor. By reporting this occurrence, you\u2019d be formally documenting this ethical breach, rather than relying on the good will of two people who have already demonstrated they don\u2019t have your best interests in mind. And I will note, it isn\u2019t only your ex who behaved badly. His supervisor was complicit in the violation of your privacy by virtue of the fact that he allowed it, by his own admission, \u201cfrom day one.\u201d I understand your fear of increasing the stress in your workplace, and yet, as Steve points out, it\u2019s already pretty stressful.

Ms. Reid described Meg as \u201can African-American girl that is smart, that is beautiful and that basically realizes that she is enough.\u201d Through this awareness, the actress added, Meg \u201cjust taps into her superpowers to be able to save her dad, her brother and save the world.\u201d\n\nThis revision \u2014 alongside the film\u2019s broader multiracial cast, which includes Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Reese Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey \u2014 not only expands the feminist reach of L\u2019Engle\u2019s original vision, but also directly challenges the overwhelming absence of girls of color as leads in Hollywood films in general, and science-fiction films in particular. As recently as 2012, controversy greeted Amandla Stenberg when she played Rue in the first \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie. Rue was a black character in the dystopian novel it was based on, but fans seemed not to realize it and complained loudly about the casting. Ms. Reid\u2019s turn as Meg, by contrast, seems to have only increased fan anticipation for the movie.\n\nMore radically, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s choice for Meg helps redefine our notions of the universal. Rather than assume children of color will seamlessly identify with Meg as we do with the book or with the young, white heroines of the \u201cHunger Games\u201d or \u201cDivergent\u201d franchise, this film gives us a different, racially inflected female future and present.\n\nAnd that changes how I now appreciate the book.\n\nIt is still my favorite from childhood, but now, rather than contort myself into Meg, I am able to see how the novel\u2019s play with time and space continues to influence me as an African-American writer. I\u2019m obsessed with how people, events and cultural objects from the past shape our understandings of race and gender in the present. \u201cA Wrinkle in Time\u201d might not ask the same questions that I do now, but it was the first novel I ever read that explored multiple time dimensions and gave me permission to imagine history as incomplete, unfolding, and a phenomenon with hopes that can be taken up by successive generations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter I was done with the novel this time, I put my copy on my 5-year-old daughter\u2019s bookshelf, for I am comforted by what she is now able to find in \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d Though we contemporary viewers and readers are unable to engage in interplanetary travel like Meg, Ms. DuVernay\u2019s version takes us somewhere even more substantive. By emphasizing diversity over dystopia, her film does not simply warn against the dangers of who we might become, but celebrates the vast richness of who we already are.", "title": "I Saw Myself in \u2018A Wrinkle in Time.\u2019 But I Had to Work Hard.", "authors": ["Salamishah Tillet"]}

In one remote hamlet reachable only by boat or footpath, I saw a stunted 4-year-old, Umar Amin, being bathed by his big sister.\n\nI pulled out a MUAC strip, used to assess child malnutrition by measuring the upper arm, and Umar Amin was in the red danger zone, signifying severe acute malnutrition. He can\u2019t walk or talk and desperately needs help, but he has never been able to see a doctor.\n\nInternational aid groups are ready and eager to help children like Umar Amin, but the government often blocks them, especially in northern areas near the Bangladesh border. It is difficult to understand this denial of humanitarian access as anything but an intentional policy of grinding down and driving out the Rohingya \u2014 one reason I see this as a slow-motion genocide.\n\nWhat of \u201cThe Lady,\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi, who won her Nobel for her resolute struggle for the human rights of Myanmar? She is now the effective leader of Myanmar\u2019s government and has emerged as not only an apologist for this genocide, but also as complicit in it.\n\nSuu Kyi does not control the army, which committed the massacres, but she has helped keep aid groups away. She has also tried to erase the existence of the Rohingya, rejecting the term and saying that they are merely illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. (In fact, a document from 1799 shows the Rohingya were well established here even then.) And it is her government that is proceeding with the criminal case against the two Reuters reporters.\n\nI was able to get a tourist visa because I was leading a segment of a tour sponsored by The New York Times Company to Myanmar. The visa came with a stern warning that I must not do any reporting. In general, I believe that journalists should obey the laws of countries they visit, but I make an exception when a regime uses its laws to commit and hide crimes against humanity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one case on this trip, I arrived after dark so I would be less likely to be spotted. In others, villagers advised me on what paths to take to avoid the police. To get to two villages, I took a boat around a police checkpoint.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Nicholas Kristof Newsletter Receive emails about each column and other occasional commentary.

It was her first pregnancy, and she got no medical help.\n\n\u201cMaybe she would have died even in a hospital, but at least she would have had a chance,\u201d Zainul Abedin said. \u201cThis way she didn\u2019t even have a chance.\u201d\n\nHe is thinking of trying to escape, which would entail paying human traffickers $2,300 to smuggle him to Malaysia. The authorities hound aid workers and journalists, but they seem to look the other way from these human traffickers.\n\nMany of those who set out die en route. Zainul Abedin knows the risks because his own father fled in hopes of reaching Malaysia and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\n\n\u201cWe are like a bird in a cage,\u201d Zainul Abedin told me. \u201cThey give us less and less, we get smaller and smaller, and then we die. Or we can try to flee, and then they can kill us.\u201d\n\nThe Rohingya have been confined to their villages and the concentration camp for almost six years now, with restrictions tightened further after the August massacres. Elders complained to me in particular about the loss of education, as Rohingya aren\u2019t allowed to attend regular schools. Villages try to run informal schools of their own, but without textbooks, desks and proper teachers, not much learning happens, and even the most brilliant children have no hope of ever attending high school or a university. The result is a lost generation.\n\nMany Myanmar readers will find my reporting unfair, for their narrative is very different. Htun Aung Kyaw, a leader of the Arakan National Party, the main political party here in Rakhine State, told me the key points as he sees them: The Rohingya are illegal immigrants, they have been trying for decades to create a separate Islamic state, they include armed insurgents who commit atrocities, and they burn their own villages so as to discredit the Myanmar government.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat is mostly nonsense, although it\u2019s quite true that a Rohingya rebel group precipitated the August violence with attacks on police stations. The army responded with scorched-earth tactics that, by the count of Doctors Without Borders, resulted in at least 9,000 Rohingya deaths. The army has for decades waged ferocious counterinsurgencies against other ethnic minorities, such as the Shan and Karen, so raping and murdering civilians may have reflected not so much military strategy as muscle memory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOrdinary citizens often seem to have been manipulated by anti-Rohingya propaganda, particularly on Facebook. One moderate Rakhine village leader, U Maung Kyaw Nyunt, told me that the hatred toward the Rohingya has escalated because of the arrival of smartphones and Facebook, resulting in virulent anti-Rohingya propaganda depicting them as murderous terrorists who commit atrocities against Buddhists.\n\n\u201cYoung people are using their smartphones a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see with their eyes; they just see with their phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have arguments with my son about this,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cFacebook has been bad for Myanmar.\u201d\n\nThe military has internet units trained by Russia, and one theory is that the army may be behind part of the social media campaign against the Rohingya.\n\nThe West doesn\u2019t have much leverage over Myanmar, and China protects it on the United Nations Security Council. David Mathieson, a longtime human rights analyst in Myanmar, said that outside protests about the Rohingya have been largely ineffective, and sometimes counterproductive, as when exaggerations play into the Myanmar narrative of victimhood.\n\nStill, we can work with other countries to raise the cost of ethnic cleansing, and under international law we have an obligation to take steps to address genocide (although the law does not stipulate that these actions must be particularly significant). A crucial first step is targeted sanctions against Myanmar leaders, as bipartisan legislation in both the House and the Senate proposes. The bill passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee but needs approval from the Senate Republican leadership to go forward.\n\nThe U.S. government can also do more to name and shame the perpetrators, and to exert relentless pressure for humanitarian access. It was good to see Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, denounce Myanmar last month for making life for the Rohingya \u201ca death sentence.\u201d We can ask the intelligence community to gather evidence of war crimes. Through Voice of America, we could broadcast lessons for Rohingya schools.\n\nThe suffering in these Rohingya villages is easy to ignore at a time of global and domestic upheaval. We all suffer distraction and compassion fatigue. But as Elie Wiesel, the great survivor of a different genocide, said in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, \u201cWherever men or women are persecuted because of their race, religion or political views, that place must \u2014 at that moment \u2014 become the center of the universe.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy that standard, the grass-roof hut where Sona Wara weeps over her lost twins cries out to us as a center of the universe.", "title": "I Saw a Genocide in Slow Motion", "authors": ["Nicholas Kristof"]}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "With the crucial exception of combat, music was ubiquitous in Vietnam, reaching soldiers via albums, cassettes and tapes of radio shows sent from home; on the Armed Forces Vietnam Network, featuring songs from stateside Top 40 stations; and on the legendary, if short-lived, underground broadcasts of Radio First Termer, a pirate station operated out of Saigon. Soldiers played it in their hooches on top-of-the-line tape decks they\u2019d purchase cheap at the PX or via mail order from Japan; they listened to it over headphones in helicopters and planes.\n\nSometimes the music was live: soldiers strumming out Bob Dylan and Curtis Mayfield songs at base camps; Filipino bands pounding out \u201cProud Mary\u201d and \u201cSoul Man\u201d at enlisted-men\u2019s clubs and Saigon bars; touring acts from Bob Hope and Ann-Margret to Nancy Sinatra and James Brown granting momentary calm. And on many a weary war night, Hanoi Hannah, the North Vietnamese equivalent of World War II\u2019s Tokyo Rose, would play classic tunes by Ray Charles and B. B. King as she encouraged G.I.s to lay down their weapons.\n\nThey were the same songs our friends were listening to back home, but the music took on different, and often deeper, meanings in Vietnam. Nancy Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThese Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019\u201d became an anthem to the grunts who humped endless miles on patrol in the jungles, adding layers of meaning to the story of a young woman turning the tables on her cheating boyfriend. Likewise, the Jimi Hendrix Experience\u2019s \u201cPurple Haze\u201d meant one thing in an LSD-friendly dorm room and another to troops who associated it with the color of the smoke grenades used to guide helicopters into landing zones. \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d \u201cNowhere to Run,\u201d \u201cRiders on the Storm\u201d \u2014 all of them shifted shape in relation to the war.\n\nThe meaning of songs often changed for individual vets whose personal (and in several cases, political) perspectives underwent seismic shifts in the years during and after the war. The dynamic was complicated by music\u2019s peculiar status as both a center of political or cultural resistance and a manifestation of America\u2019s high-tech supremacy. That Barry McGuire\u2019s hit song \u201cEve of Destruction,\u201d which railed against injustice and nuclear war in 1965, was quickly countered by Sgt. Barry Sadler\u2019s \u201cThe Ballad of the Green Berets,\u201d the No. 1 song of 1966, is as much a reflection of the shifting politics of the country as it is about changes in musical tastes. Likewise, \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth\u201d by Buffalo Springfield, the song frequently played to accompany film depictions of antiwar protests, had nothing to do with Vietnam per se \u2014 Stephen Stills wrote it about a riot on the Sunset Strip \u2014 yet it was as treasured by scores of Vietnam soldiers as it was by protesters in America.\n\nOpposition to the draft helped fuel the sounds of protest \u2014 \u201cDraft Dodger Rag,\u201d \u201cUniversal Soldier,\u201d \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me Babe.\u201d But they were songs we G.I.s knew and often sang in Vietnam. While researching our book, my co-author, Craig Werner, and I heard poignant stories from Vietnam veterans about listening to a fellow soldier play \u201cMasters of War\u201d or \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone\u201d in Vietnam. Neil Young\u2019s \u201cOhio\u201d resonated in ways political and personal, too, since many of us Vietnam-era soldiers were the same age as the students killed at Kent State \u2014 and the National Guardsmen who fired at them. Just about all the guys I served with in Vietnam in 1970 and 1971 laughed at Edwin Starr\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d because we knew better than he did that it was good for \u201cabsolutely nothin\u2019.\u2019\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

When Craig and I met Joe at the North Berkeley BART station in 2008 to interview him for our book, he introduced himself by saying, \u201cI consider myself a veteran first and a hippie second.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the pro-war \u201chawks\u201d who flooded him with hate mail \u2014 he still receives it \u2014 were unaware of the crucial fact that Joe McDonald was a Navy veteran, one who\u2019d realized that, as he put it, \u201call military experience, all combat experience universally is the same \u2014 not good/bad, moral/immoral. I believe if we had the music of all these different armies, all the infantries everywhere, you\u2019d have the same attitude expressed within their songs that we expressed in ours.\u201d\n\nReturning to the Bay Area after his discharge from the Navy, Joe threw himself into the growing counterculture. In the summer of 1965 he wrote the song that even today is an anthem of the antiwar movement, yet holds a special resonance for Vietnam veterans, a point we heard again and again from the hundreds of Vietnam veterans we\u2019ve interviewed.\n\n\u201cThe song was irreverent but not political,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cIt blames leaders and parents, not soldiers. It\u2019s not a pacifist song; it\u2019s a soldier\u2019s song.\u201d The most radical line in the song, he added, \u201cis, \u2018Be the first one on your block to have your boy come home in a box.\u2019 It\u2019s military humor that only a soldier could get away with. It\u2019s a soldier\u2019s song from a soldier\u2019s background and point of view. It comes out of a tradition of G.I. humor in which people can bitch in a way that will not get them in trouble and that also keeps them from insanity that can be experienced during war.\u201d\n\nAs the war ground on and the casualties mounted, music became even more essential for troops and veterans struggling to express their feelings and understand the politics of the war, and politics in general. The war was coming to an end, and those of us still there, and the veterans who were already back home, understood that it would be music that helped us reintegrate into civilian life. As Michael Kramer observes in \u201cThe Republic of Rock,\u201d the music of the 1960s and early \u201970s gave the generation \u201ca sonic framework for thinking, feeling, discussing and dancing out the vexing problems of democratic togetherness and individual liberation.\u201d\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to return home from Vietnam, music echoed through those secret places where you stored memories, including some you never shared with your parents, spouse or children for decades. Music was the key to survival and a path to healing, the center of a human story that\u2019s too often lost in the haze of politics and myth that surrounds Vietnam.", "title": "I Served in Vietnam.

I read \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d for the first time before that. I preferred \u201cMoby-Dick.\u201d\n\nWhich fiction and nonfiction writers \u2014 playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 inspired you most early in your career? And which writers working today do you most admire?\n\nV. S. Naipaul, Simon Leys, Arthur Koestlerand Christopher Isherwood. As an adolescent, I was thrilled by Henry Miller, but perhaps not for entirely literary reasons. Another influence was John Cleland\u2019s \u201cFanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\u201d which I found on my father\u2019s bookshelves. Again, literary merit was of secondary importance. I recognize that it is unusual to get one\u2019s sexual education from an 18th-century porn novel, but I didn\u2019t have the benefit (or the curse) of the internet when I grew up, nor much opportunity to learn on the job, as it were. Current writers I admire are Elif Batuman, Emmanuel Carr\u00e8re and Adam Thirlwell.\n\nWho are your favorite travel writers?\n\nApart from V. S. Naipaul, Bruce Chatwin (who hated being called a travel writer). I now rather shy away from travel writing. Some of the best books on travel are wholly imaginary, i.e. \u201cRen\u00e9 Leys,\u201d by Victor Segalen, a fiction about a European in the last Imperial Chinese court, or indeed \u201cGulliver\u2019s Travels.\u201d Then there is Frederic Prokosch\u2019s \u201cThe Asiatics,\u201d a book about travels in the Orient by an author who had never ventured further east than Berlin. Perhaps I should also include Laurence Sterne\u2019s \u201cA Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy.\u201d\n\nWhich books do you think best convey Japanese culture and history?\n\nI think fiction is the best way to understand another culture. Anything by Junichiro Tanizaki, most of Nagai Kafu, or Kawabata. I should mention, too, \u201cOzu: His Life and Films,\u201d by Donald Richie, the American writer who taught me more about Japan than anyone. He learned about Japan when he first arrived in Tokyo in the late 1940s by endlessly watching movies. This is not a bad idea. I believe Kazuo Ishiguro did the same before writing his first novels set in the country of his birth. In any case, I followed Richie\u2019s example. I find it more interesting to learn about people\u2019s fantasies than about who they really are.\n\nWhat kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days?\n\nGood books.\n\nWhich genres are you drawn to and which do you avoid?\n\nI can\u2019t stand science fiction. Apart from that, I\u2019m fairly omnivorous. Well, I admit I haven\u2019t read many westerns, even though Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), the writer of westerns in \u201cThe Third Man,\u201d is one of my favorite movie characters. In popular fiction I like crime stories: Raymond Chandler and Elmore Leonard.

Great novels rarely make good films. \u201cMidnight Cowboy\u201d was a wonderful film of a so-so novel. This means that if I recommend a book for a movie, this might be construed as a put down.

Your favorite antihero or villain?\n\nI\u2019ve always had a soft spot for Disney\u2019s the Big Bad Wolf. I very much like Julien Sorel in \u201cThe Red and the Black,\u201d and Valmont in \u201cDangerous Liaisons.\u201d Villains are always more appealing. It is hard to write about a good person without making him or her look like a bore. Real life is a little different. Hitler is a fine subject. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to have met him. Perhaps this means that great villains can also be great bores.\n\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\n\nI was not precocious, so I read the conventional English books: Enid Blyton, et cetera. Growing up in the Netherlands, I also read stories about a fat boy called Dik Trom who stole apples from the neighboring orchard \u2014 an example of amusing mischief a long time ago. I then graduated to memoirs of Spitfire pilots.\n\nWhat book made you a reader?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just one book.\n\nIf you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\n\nThis president doesn\u2019t read, so I\u2019d like him to watch the Marx Brothers\u2019 \u201cDuck Soup,\u201d which my friend and former publisher Jason Epstein calls the best thing ever done on war.\n\nYou\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party.

As first reported by TMZ Sports, the league, which was founded by the rapper Ice Cube and Jeff Kwatinetz, an entertainment industry executive, fired its commissioner, with Ice Cube taking over on an interim basis.\n\nIn a letter sent to the league\u2019s players, coaches and staff that was provided to The New York Times, it was revealed that Roger Mason Jr. had been terminated as a result of his relationship with a pair of Qatari investors whom Mason had brought to the league. The letter said the investors, Ayman Sabi and Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, had failed to contribute the money required of minority investors in Big3, and the league brought a lawsuit against them in February.\n\nMason, a former N.B.A. player, was known to have a close relationship with Sabi and Al-Rumaihi, according to the letter, and the league was troubled by Mason\u2019s continued personal and business association with them after the lawsuit was filed, which included his appearing in a picture posted to Rashard Lewis\u2019s Instagram account with them in which he commented \u201c#family.\u201d", "title": "Ice Cube Fires Big3 League\u2019s Commissioner Amid Scandal", "authors": []}

His legacy is secure, and he will almost assuredly be the first player enshrined in the Halls of Fame in both the United States and Japan. In the United States, he is a 10-time All-Star, a 10-time Gold Glove Award winner and a two-time batting champion. He is one of just 31 members of baseball\u2019s 3,000-hit club, despite starting his career in North America at 27. The second-latest start for a member of the 3,000-hit club was Wade Boggs, who debuted for Boston when he was 23.\n\nThere are even those who have encouraged including Suzuki\u2019s 1,278 hits in Japan as part of his career total, which would make him baseball\u2019s true hit king rather than Pete Rose. But that questionable inflation \u2014 which falls apart as an argument if you also give Rose credit for his 427 minor league hits \u2014 is unnecessary to bolster Suzuki\u2019s reputation as one of the most unusual and fantastic players the game has ever seen.\n\nAs for what the Mariners can expect from Suzuki this season, the prognosis is a bit grim. Just eight position players have continued in the majors once they have turned 44, and in the 16 seasons they combined to play, only Julio Franco in 2004 \u2014 when he was 45 \u2014 managed to finish a season with 1 or more WAR. Eight of the 16 seasons finished with the player in negative WAR, with Rose\u2019s 1986 season being the nadir. The player-manager of the Cincinnati Reds was worth minus-0.9 WAR that year, though he did add 52 hits \u2014 42 of them singles \u2014 to his career record.\n\nThe good news for both Suzuki and the Mariners is that he will not have to do much for this to be a successful move. He is guaranteed $750,000 on a one-year contract and can earn an additional $1.25 million in performance bonuses based on plate appearances. The team, while currently dealing with some injury issues, including Ben Gamel\u2019s serious oblique strain, will have other outfield options at some point soon, so letting the franchise icon play some in spring training, and even in the regular season, would be a treat for fans who were sad to see Suzuki traded away. And if he plays well enough to get the bonuses, then everyone wins.\n\nBut Suzuki has not acknowledged that he sees an end point to his career, so the question is if this return to Seattle is intended to cap off his lengthy career, or if it will be just another stop on his road as a journeyman.", "title": "Ichiro Suzuki Returns to the Mariners With Nothing to Prove", "authors": []}

But does such a moment really exist?\n\nAs with so much in wine, what is in fact subjective is often presented as objective. Just as no perfect moment exists to open a bottle, and no optimum length exists for aging a wine, no particular set of conditions defines perfect ripeness. It all depends on the intent and taste of the grower and producer, along with vintage conditions, the site and perhaps a bit of luck.\n\nThe motives of the marketer and the desires of the consumer inevitably clash. Here at Wine School, we love wine, but are inherently skeptical about anybody in the trade who claims to have done anything at the one right moment.

Some of Lazarin\u2019s stories \u2014 not coincidentally, my favorites \u2014 show women pinging furiously off one another instead of their boyfriends, husbands and fathers, gathering incremental surges of strength and autonomy and rage, of unspoken power.

It won\u2019t help to note that Lazarin\u2019s characters are educated and middle- to upper-class, that her stories are often set in New York and Paris. They are, certainly, beautifully crafted.

So I\u2019d prefer to say that the sentences in these stories are living and seamless, as if Lazarin had run her hand over them until they became smooth and gleaming with the evidence of her touch. Yet they are not without viscera; sublimated rage fills the crevices between them.\n\nLazarin\u2019s style succeeds in part because the stakes for her characters are wide-ranging, because the implications of their actions ripple outward. In \u201cBack Talk,\u201d the theme of internalized misogyny is, to be quite blunt, terrifying. It\u2019s all the scarier in that it\u2019s so quietly and accurately rendered: These women aren\u2019t running screaming through the night, fleeing to convents, joining all-female cults or driving off into the desert without looking back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn \u201cSpider Legs,\u201d the teenage narrator goes to Paris to visit her mother, who is writing a book about St. Agnes.

Although Lazarin\u2019s work has the tone and style of traditional mainstream short fiction, it joins a growing canon of quietly realist stories that establish women\u2019s experiences as worthy of literary attention. And not just women\u2019s experiences: These stories also explore the exhausting, slow poison of masculine power, the grind of the patriarchy on even the most privileged of women, the subtle ways in which men have trained women to minimize themselves.\n\nThe hunger for these types of stories is powerful.

The AT&T-Time Warner merger would be the second largest in media history, behind only AOL\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner in 2000. A vertically integrated AT&T-Time Warner would have an important bargaining advantage over its non-integrated rivals. That\u2019s particularly dangerous for rivals like Dish, which offers a virtual pay-TV service called Sling TV for as little as $20 a month.\n\nPost-merger, when an AT&T-Time Warner negotiates with Dish for access to HBO and CNN, for example, it would hold all the cards. It could set new and higher prices, knowing that if Dish pays more, it hurts itself. But if it refuses and leaves a big hole in its lineup, it hurts itself more, by driving some of its customers to AT&T.\n\nThat harsh logic will not only force Dish and similar companies to raise their prices to reflect higher costs (as Justice argues), but also drive them to seek their own dancing partners (bodyguards might be another term), to gain reciprocal bargaining power. Perhaps Dish sells itself to Disney or Viacom. Verizon might buy parts of Fox or Viacom. Cable providers like Charter and Altice could pick up whatever is left.\n\nWhatever the precise combinations might be, the media lineup would rearrange itself into a new group of \u201cmajors.\u201d Consumers would face, in effect, a giant replica of the 1930s Hollywood studio system, an integrated oligopoly in which each player cooperates to keep those big bills big.\n\nThe obvious strategy for the new majors would be to take aim at the remaining smaller players, especially the new internet television services like Sling TV, Sony\u2019s PlayStation Vue or YouTube TV. In time, internet TV will come to resemble cable TV in pricing and content, with the true outsiders, like Sony or YouTube, forced to play along or face industry-wide exclusion.", "title": "Opinion | If You Love High TV Bills, This Is the Merger for You", "authors": []}

That\u2019s the premise of Chris Bohjalian\u2019s new novel, \u201cThe Flight Attendant,\u201d which enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 8. A seasoned flight attendant on a layover in Dubai \u2014 a hard-partying, hard-working woman who\u2019s also a functioning alcoholic \u2014 wakes up one morning to find the Russian businessman next to her dead, his neck sliced open with the shards of a Stoli bottle.

I had just flown from Armenia to New York and was meeting a friend for dinner in Manhattan. I fly a lot, but I\u2019ve never lost my wonder at the miracle of aviation. I had just had breakfast in Yerevan, and now I was having dinner in New York City. Second, I had flown through Moscow on Aeroflot. I\u2019ve always been fascinated by Russia \u2014 the literature, the soul and the fact they always wind up with a Bond villain running the show in the Kremlin.\u201d And then, he says, \u201cthere was the booze before me. I was at a handsome bar and I was jet-lagged just enough to see the aesthetic beauty in the rituals around which we drink: the colors, the bottles, the glasses. I asked the bartender for all the scrap paper he had, and for the next 45 minutes I wrote frenetically. I think I wrote the first three and a half pages of the novel.\u201d\n\nBohjalian doesn\u2019t outline his novels. \u201cI\u2019m in awe of writers who outline \u2014 or even those writers who know how a book is going to end when they begin,\u201d he says. \u201cI never have even the slightest clue. I depend upon my characters to take me by the hand and lead me through the dark of the story. I\u2019ve always loved the E.L. Doctorow observation: \u2018Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.\u2019\u201d\n\nBohjalian admits that he likes writing books where a character\u2019s life changes in a heartbeat. \u201cI love stories that begin with cataclysmic disequilibrium. How do women and men deal with the sudden, disastrous and possibly ruinous trials? Will they rise to the challenges or be destroyed by them? I have no idea when I\u2019m in the midst of the book,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes these characters break my heart.

The economic model has adjusted accordingly. Executives in the off-season shied away from spending big on free agents, who tend to be around 30, and favored younger (that is, cheaper) players.\n\nExcept the Mets.\n\nLacking enough assets to plug holes through trades, the Mets spent $88.5 million in the off-season on six players 30 or older: first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, 35; third baseman Todd Frazier, 32; right fielder Jay Bruce, who will turn 31 on Tuesday; relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak, 32; starting pitcher Jason Vargas, 35; and Reyes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt was about availability and being somewhat opportunistic,\u201d General Manager Sandy Alderson said.\n\nAll but one of the contracts the older players signed were for one or two years, and at manageable prices, Alderson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a changed game,\u201d said Frazier, who held out until the week before spring training began to sign a two-year, $17 million contract at a price lower than some people had once expected. \u201cTeams want the younger guys, but we\u2019ve still got it. I know we do.\u201d\n\nThe players joined a cast that included the relief pitchers Jerry Blevins, 34, and A. J. Ramos, 31; the oft-injured team captain, David Wright, 35; infielder Asdrubal Cabrera, 32; and left fielder Yoenis Cespedes, 32.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for the blend of ages,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have experience, but bottom line, it\u2019s important to have good players.

Their lack of speed is a weakness, so the manager, Mickey Callaway, emphasized sound base running in spring training. The Mets, which had one of the worst defenses in the majors last season, will take into account data and players\u2019 experience to better position them in the field.\n\n\u201cYou get by on your guile more than muscle, brute strength and speed,\u201d the team\u2019s bench coach, Gary DiSarcina, said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Poor performance and injuries among players of all ages derailed the Mets\u2019 2017 season. Some infirmities are inevitable, but Callaway and the new medical staff vowed to be vigilant about preventive measures, such as regular days off.\n\nWith age, Frazier has toned down his weight lifting and limited dining on the Italian food he loves. Cespedes incorporated yoga this winter in hopes of keeping his legs healthier.\n\nWhen he was younger, Gonzalez rolled out of bed ready to play. Now, the pregame routine for his back is two hours.

The agency\u2019s scientific advisory panel had concluded in 2016 that children risked irreversible brain damage and neurodevelopmental problems from very low levels of exposure to food residues of the chemical, which continues to be widely used on fruits and vegetables.\n\nIn hopes of bolstering the coal industry, Mr. Pruitt, who has rejected established climate science, has also scrapped regulations in the Clean Power Plan put in place by the Obama administration to minimize heat-trapping pollution. A warming trend in sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in recent decades has been strongly associated with the spread of potentially deadly marine pathogens like Vibrio cholerae, the cause of cholera, and V. parahaemolyticus, a cause of food poisoning, and could lead to widespread outbreaks.\n\nFood safety measures are also in jeopardy. Enforcement has been delayed indefinitely of crucial rules in the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Food Safety Modernization Act, enacted seven years ago with bipartisan support to protect consumers from exposure to dangerous pathogens like salmonella and E. coli. Some of those who harvest, package and store foods produced on farms are now exempt from the act\u2019s rules to prevent contamination of the food supply. Yet, each year 48 million people in this country are sickened, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from preventable food-borne diseases.\n\nThe lax food safety rules of the European Union should be a lesson to heed. France and its allies are currently reeling under massive recalls of baby formula and other products contaminated with salmonella, a crisis said to stem from weak regulations that allowed tainted products to make their way into supermarkets and pharmacies even weeks after the problem was discovered.\n\nNutritional depletion from rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, is another risk to the healthfulness of the American food supply, according to some experts. Dr. Samuel S. Myers, principal research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and colleagues linked significant reductions in zinc, iron and protein in staple grain crops like rice and wheat and smaller reductions in protein in legumes to rising levels of carbon dioxide in the air.\n\nThe researchers demonstrated these effects by growing 41 different varieties of staple crops under conditions likely to exist by 2050 unless there is a major decline in carbon dioxide pollution.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Myers explained that even a small reduction in the protein content of grains could increase carbohydrate consumption and raise the risk of metabolic diseases like diabetes and heart disease that already endanger our overweight population.", "title": "Ignoring Science at Our Peril", "authors": []}

Some people may imagine that they\u2019re the same question, but they definitely aren\u2019t:\n\n1. Does the Fed know how low the unemployment rate can go?\n\n2. Should the Fed be tightening now, even though inflation is still low?\n\n3. Is there any relationship between unemployment and inflation?\n\nIt seems obvious to me that the answer to (1) is no. We\u2019re currently well above historical estimates of full employment, and inflation remains subdued. Could unemployment fall to 3.5% without accelerating inflation? Honestly, we don\u2019t know.\n\nI would also argue that the Fed is making a mistake by tightening now, for several reasons. One is that we really don\u2019t know how low U can go, and won\u2019t find out if we don\u2019t give it a chance. Another is that the costs of getting it wrong are asymmetric: waiting too long to tighten might be awkward, but tightening too soon increases the risks of falling back into a liquidity trap. Finally, there are very good reasons to believe that the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target is too low; certainly the belief that it was high enough to make the zero lower bound irrelevant has been massively falsified by experience.\n\nBut should we drop the whole notion that unemployment has anything to do with inflation?

Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, famously once said that Europeans could \u201cgo whistle\u201d if they expected huge British payments. Last year, Britain agreed to a divorce payment estimated by its official watchdog at $52 billion, including liabilities for pensions that will run until 2064.\n\nEven the idea of a standstill transition was initially resisted by Mrs. May, who, once reconciled, insisted on calling it an \u201cimplementation period\u201d instead.\n\nAnalysts struggle to identify concessions made by the other side. Seemingly the only one of any substance is to limit the time the European Court of Justice will help adjudicate post-Brexit disputes on the rights of European Union citizens living in Britain.\n\nThough David Davis, Britain\u2019s Brexit secretary, trumpeted on Monday the fact that Britain would be able to negotiate and sign non-European trade deals during the transition, if not to implement them, experts were unimpressed. Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research institute, describes that as a \u201ctoken,\u201d since prospects of such talks being completed during the transition period were remote. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a real concession,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Menon believes that Britain\u2019s divorce financial settlement could have been worse, but added that \u201cin general the European Union has got what it wanted.\u201d\n\nMuch of this is the legacy of Mrs. May\u2019s decision to invoke Article 50 \u2014 the exit clause of the European Union\u2019s treaty \u2014 before she was ready (though after she had laid down \u201cred lines\u201d that have faded away in some cases).

During this time, the detail of future trade ties should be finalized and, with the clock ticking, the advantage will again be with the European side as another \u201ccliff edge\u201d looms \u2014 one more damaging to the British than the continental side.\n\nAlmost no one outside the British government thinks 21 months is enough time for this task, something that Mr. Menon describes as a significant worry. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we do without extending it, and, technically, I don\u2019t see how we extend it,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch missteps derive from the fact that, in London, decisions over Brexit are motivated not primarily by expert advice, strategic considerations, game theory or negotiating tactics but by domestic politics. Mrs. May is under pressure from hard-liners who \u2014 perhaps fearing that public support for leaving might ebb \u2014 want to quit the bloc as soon as possible and certainly before Britain\u2019s next elections.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome Brexiteers want to negotiate an orderly rupture with the bloc\u2019s economic structures. Others want Britain to crash out without a deal and withhold its divorce payment. There are more pragmatic, pro-European voices in the cabinet too, worried about the impact of departure on the economy, and such political divisions have paralyzed decision making.\n\nMr. Grant points out that there is still no detailed policy paper explaining the type of trade deal Britain wants with the European Union, an omission he attributes to political divisions.\n\nAnother complication is that pro-Brexit politicians, including Mrs. May, have consistently overestimated their bargaining power and made a number of unrealistic statements.\n\nThough Mr. Gove once claimed that \u201cthe day after we vote to leave, we hold all the cards,\u201d Mr. Grant says the opposite is true, with Britain only having a couple of real bargaining chips. Money was the biggest one, but the Brussels negotiators insisted that the financial terms for divorce were settled early in the talks, reducing London\u2019s leverage.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBritain has coastal waters that other European nations want to fish. But fishermen are popular, so trading their livelihoods for the thing Britain really wants \u2014 privileged access to European financial and services markets \u2014 would be politically toxic. Britain\u2019s strength as a security partner, while real, is hard to use in negotiations, said Mr. Grant, who noted that Mrs. May provoked a continental backlash when she hinted that she might.\n\nBritain remains a big export market for the European Union, and continental countries have commercial interests that will test their unity during trade talks. But so far, the belief that Europe\u2019s negotiating position would be determined by the interests of German carmakers has looked like another miscalculation.\n\nPerhaps because of their disdain for the European Union, the Brexiteers seem to have little understanding of their enemy. Some, including John Redwood, a former cabinet minister, have argued that a show of obduracy in negotiations invariably prompts Brussels to give way.\n\nWhile this tactic often worked well for Britain during internal discussions as a member nation, it is now embroiled in a trade negotiation with a bigger and more formidable adversary that needs to demonstrate the misfortunes that can befall a country that chooses to leave.\n\nAnd most analysts say that the bloc\u2019s trade negotiators are used to dealing with hardened counterparts, from the United States to China, and rarely cave in.\n\n\u201cI think the logic is seeping through,\u201d said Mr. Grant, who worries that it will only sour opinions in Britain. \u201cPeople realize that the European Union is a very tough and strong negotiator, that we have very few cards and that the outcome will be imposed on the British \u2014 on European terms.\u201d", "title": "In Brexit Give-and-Take, Britain Gives and the E.U.

By contrast, Proposition 64, the ballot measure that allowed marijuana legalization, passed with 57 percent voter approval in 2016, a seemingly solid majority.\n\nThe low acceptance of marijuana businesses strikes me as part of the liberal, not-in-my-backyard paradox in California. Yes, Californians want shelters for the homeless, but just not across the street. Yes, Californians want more housing built, but not if it changes the character of the neighborhood. A marijuana dispensary? Sure, preferably in the next town.", "title": "In California, Learning How Marijuana Is an Unlikely Divider", "authors": []}

In the early 20th century, countless buildings, many of them clad in brick or Indiana limestone, served as pillars of the Midwestern economy. Now, the city features a growing number of former commercial buildings that have been repurposed as hotels, including the LondonHouse Chicago in the Loop and The Robey in the Wicker Park neighborhood. The building renovations have revealed intricate design details and created rooftop spaces that allow hotel guests to enjoy the vistas that continue to define Chicago.\n\nLondonHouse Chicago\n\nRates\n\nFrom $149.\n\nBasics\n\nDesigned by the prominent Chicago architect Alfred S.

Chile\u2019s Constitution does not allow consecutive second terms.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Mr. Pi\u00f1era succeeded her, his election in 2010 was pathbreaking, too, as he was the first right-wing leader elected since democracy was restored in Chile in 1990, after a 17-year military dictatorship led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.\n\nAt this political turning point, interviews with the departing and incoming presidents suggest, there is much the two political figures in Chile agree on.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth say they believe the country should continue to be a beacon of free trade. Both want to see even deeper ties with China, Chile\u2019s top trading partner, and have rebuffed Trump administration warnings that Beijing is consolidating itself as a colonial, exploitive power in Latin America.\n\nThe two leaders are bullish about Chile\u2019s transformation into a renewable-energy powerhouse and the country\u2019s role as a global leader in countering climate change. And both say Chile should continue to welcome immigrants, even as a large wave of recent arrivals from Haiti and Venezuela has called into question the country\u2019s capacity to absorb so many newcomers at once.\n\nBut there is plenty on which they disagree. To begin with, there is Ms. Bachelet\u2019s legacy: an ambitious overhaul of the tax system, labor laws and public education. Mr. Pi\u00f1era argues that she overreached and that her efforts amounted to taking a \u201cbulldozer\u201d approach to governing.\n\nThe departing president, however, argued that structural changes were necessary.\n\n\u201cThis is a changed country,\u201d Ms. Bachelet said in the recent interview in Santiago, the capital. \u201cPeople are more empowered. The middle class is a lot more aware of its rights and its needs; people demand more each day; and political institutions are viewed with a growing level of distrust.\u201d\n\nDuring her latest four-year term, the government transformed Chile\u2019s electricity grid, weaning a nation poor in fossil fuels of its dependence on hydrocarbons by building an expanding network of solar and wind-powered grids that have made electricity cheaper and cleaner.\n\nHer government also created protected marine areas and a vast network of national parks in the southern Patagonia region that will shelter much of the country\u2019s forest land and coastline from development.\n\nShe is credited with strengthening consumer protections and labor rights and passing an electoral reform law that made Chile\u2019s political system more inclusive by breaking up a two-party system and broadening the participation of women. The electoral overhaul also limited the influence of private-sector money in campaigns.\n\nHer signature legislative victory: getting a deeply divided Congress to approve the legalization of abortion in limited circumstances.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeatriz S\u00e1nchez, a rising political star who came in third in the first round of last year\u2019s presidential race, said the changes set in motion by Ms. Bachelet might become clear with time.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHer main achievement was proposing, with deep conviction, an agenda of real change that shifted the conversation in Chile toward a society that valued rights and not just markets,\u201d said Ms. S\u00e1nchez, who is to the left of Ms. Bachelet politically.\n\nMr. Pi\u00f1era, however, says there is much that his predecessor got wrong.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t doubt the president\u2019s good intentions,\u201d he said during an interview this past week at his office in Santiago. \u201cBut you know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That initiative was financed by raising corporate taxes, which Mr. Pi\u00f1era and other critics said drove away investors.\n\nWhile it was a laudable goal, Mr. Pi\u00f1era argued, Ms. Bachelet\u2019s education policy is unsustainable and has degraded the quality of universities.\n\nThe education overhaul and other programs were tough to fund as economic growth slowed because the price of copper, Chile\u2019s top export, dropped. Last year, the country\u2019s fiscal deficit topped $8 billion, or 2.8 percent of its gross domestic product \u2014 a level that Mr. Pi\u00f1era called irresponsible.\n\nWhen Mr. Pi\u00f1era, 68, ran for a second time, he handily defeated Ms. Bachelet\u2019s favored candidate, the left-wing former journalist Alejandro Guillier, in December by convincing voters that he was best suited to jump-start economic growth.\n\nThe incoming president says he will cut bureaucratic bottlenecks, court foreign investment more aggressively than his predecessor did and seek to foster unity on economic policy in an increasingly fractured, and left-leaning, Congress. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Mr. Pi\u00f1era said. \u201cFirst, we will need to restore confidence in the country.\u201d\n\nChile\u2019s economic growth will continue to rely heavily on its robust relationship with China, which in 2010 outpaced the United States to become Chile\u2019s top trading partner, Mr. Pi\u00f1era said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe relationship with China has been a good relationship, and it is expanding beyond commercial matters, to investment and cooperation in science and technology, environmental issues and several other fronts,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cChina has been gaining ground in Latin America in part because China has been pursuing it and partly because the United States is stepping back.\u201d\n\nMr. Pi\u00f1era has expressed disappointment that the Trump administration has yet to present a coherent policy toward Latin America while warning the region about drawing closer to China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen signs \u2014 building a wall along the border with Mexico, the deportation of immigrants, protectionism,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a clear policy that would allow us to evaluate the foreign policy of the United States toward the region is still not on the table.\u201d\n\nAs a sign of how muddled the Trump administration\u2019s approach is, Mr. Pi\u00f1era said that when he had a lengthy, cordial conversation with President Trump shortly after the Chilean election last year, Mr. Trump expressed surprise when the president-elect pointed out that the United States had a trade surplus with Chile.\n\nBut foreign policy is unlikely to be among the thornier issues Mr. Pi\u00f1era faces when he assumes office on Sunday. He won the second round of voting by an ample margin, and Chileans elected a strikingly politically diverse Congress during the first round. Anticipating a vigorous political opposition, Mr. Pi\u00f1era has portrayed himself as a deal maker and a moderate.\n\n\u201cI want to replace the perverse logic of the bulldozer that destroys everything in its wake for the wise culture of dialogue, agreement, collaboration,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pi\u00f1era has extended an olive branch on an initiative Ms. Bachelet failed to get across the finish line, vowing to support passage of a bill that would allow transgender people to update their names and gender on government documents.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet he remains opposed to another bill, which would legalize same-sex marriage, arguing that \u201csituations that are different\u201d cannot be \u201ctreated the same way.\u201d\n\nAnd as he sets out to accelerate economic growth, Chileans will be watching closely whether any new wealth is distributed equitably, Ms. S\u00e1nchez, the former candidate, said.\n\n\u201cIf they seek to keep things as they are, where wealth grows and remains hyperconcentrated in few hands while most people\u2019s salaries barely cover basic expenses, he won\u2019t have an easy time making deals in Congress,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd university students, who staged mass protests during Mr. Pi\u00f1era\u2019s first term, are likely to become a thorn in his side if the subsidies Ms. Bachelet established are pared.\n\n\u201cPi\u00f1era promises more work and growth, but just like in his first government, he\u2019s going to govern for the rich and the businesspeople,\u201d Pablo Vilches, 22, a university student said.", "title": "In Chile, a Billionaire Takes the Reins From a Socialist, Again", "authors": ["Ernesto Londo\u00f1o"]}
{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "As we embarked on this project, we wanted to be able to provide, for context, a sense of how the gender breakdown had changed over time. That turned out to be a project unto itself.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first challenge was that The Times\u2019s digital full-text repository only reliably records articles back to 1960. We started there, and even that wasn\u2019t simple: We selected every piece labeled Obituary or in the Obituaries section, and then had to exclude paid death notices, duplicate articles, remembrances, briefs and other things that look like obits but really are not.\n\nJeff Roth and David Dunlap, colleagues who have long served as the newsroom\u2019s unofficial historians, shared a hardcover book, The New York Times Obituaries Index 1858-1968, that had 1,136 pages of small text: one name and publication date per line. But there was no digital version available.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo we turned to the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, which graciously scanned the pages and converted them to machine-readable text for free in exchange for being allowed to make them available on its website. That felt like a win-win, since now the public has access to the index, too.\n\nBut we still had to write a computer program to classify each article or line of the index as referring to either a man or a woman.\n\nFor the articles from 1960 onward it was easier, since most obituaries going back decades are written in a signature style that contains a line about the age their subjects were when they died, beginning \u201cHe was\u201d or \u201cShe was.\u201d That made the computer-program task easier. (The Times has not yet published an obituary of someone who identifies as non-binary.)\n\nFor the lines of the index and for articles without that signature line, we had to guess based on the person\u2019s name. Here honorifics and titles helped: Mrs., for married women, and \u201cLady,\u201d \u201cPrincess,\u201d \u201cCountess,\u201d \u201cQueen\u201d \u2014 luckily, many obit subjects are prominent people.\n\nIf there was no distinctive title, the program guessed based on the first name: John was almost certainly a man and Jessica almost certainly a woman. For those still unidentifiable, we were left to estimate the male-female ratio after rereading many of the obituaries one by one, though we still have not done so for every year\u2019s obituaries.\n\nThe first year of our indexing, 1858, three of the 24 obituaries were of women. The first of these was for Ida Pfeiffer (Nov. 16, 1858, Page 4, Column 5), a Viennese woman famed for her globe-trotting adventures. Her journeys took her all around the world until she contracted a mysterious illness in Madagascar to which she succumbed, despite the best efforts of her doctors back in Vienna.\n\nIn a letter to a friend quoted in the Times obituary, Ms. Pfeiffer wrote that people who knew her only through her travels \u201cfancy that my character, manners, even my figure and movements, are more like those of a man than a woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you, who know me, know that those who expect to find me six feet high, with a bold, imposing gait, and a dagger and pistol in my belt, discover in me the very reverse,\u201d she continued, \u201cand that in every-day life I am plainer, quieter, and more reserved than thousands of my own sex who have never left the seclusion of their native villages.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn those early decades, coverage of death was so different than in our modern history that it is tough to quantify the gender breakdown or compare it to today\u2019s. The Times has long carried both obituaries, which are news stories based on a subject\u2019s importance or interest to readers, and death notices, which are paid advertisements available to anyone who can pay the fare, now starting at about $250 for the shortest ones of 20 words or so.\n\nObituaries varied widely in length and selection criteria over the course of different eras.\n\nFrom 1926 through 1936, only longer-form obituaries were included in the index; about 10 percent of the 400 to 500 indexed each year were for women.\n\nIn the two decades after 1936, many more obituaries appeared in the index, about 10,000 each year. (The peak year was 1949, with almost 13,000 obits, after which the numbers tapered off and slowly declined.) The percentage of women ranged mainly between 15 and 20 percent, dipping and rising without a clear pattern. But in that era there were many single-paragraph obituaries for prominent society figures \u2014 and perhaps, on occasion, the wife of a prominent advertiser.\n\nThrough the 1970s, married women\u2019s obituaries were headlined using the honorific \u201cMrs.\u201d and their husband\u2019s name, as with Frances Stunkard, a New York University librarian whose obituary ran under the headline \u201cMrs. H. W. Stunkard,\u201d for her husband, Horace.\n\nEven Frida Kahlo was identified in the headline of her 1953 obit as \u201cDiego Rivera\u2019s wife.\u201d While both Ms. Kahlo and Mr. Rivera, the Mexican muralist, were famous at the time, he was more so. The six-paragraph piece led the description of Ms. Kahlo\u2019s work with \u201cShe also was a painter.\u201d Her renown has since grown to surpass Mr. Rivera\u2019s.\n\nThen there is Charlotte Bront\u00eb, the author of \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d whose 1855 death did not receive a mention in our pages.\n\nThe Times did cover the death, a half-century later, of the Rev.

Rei Kawakubo\u2019s Boschean excess at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons \u2014 clashing Renaissance paintings and Japanese cartoons as prints and reconstituted pileups of tacky plastic children\u2019s toys as headpieces \u2014 was a stark contrast to Miuccia Prada\u2019s comic-book-print warrior women and the tatty gewgaws and currency-\u200bwar patterns of Demna Gvasalia\u2019s Balenciaga collection. There, the idea of luxury was debased and devalued with gaudy dresses, blouses and skintight pant-boot hybrids cut in post-Brexit-inspired euro-note and dollar-bill patterns.\n\nSo, what is it with fashion at the moment? Designers appear to have assumed a fight-or-flight response to these uncertain times, which, to some \u2014 especially those with a flair for the dramatic \u2014 look a lot like the end of days. \u201cFashion is a reflection of the way we live,\u201d said Gvasalia backstage at Balenciaga. \u201cI wanted to create a feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.\u201d He was talking, specifically, about the sturm-und-drang mood at his show, which took place in a blacked-out venue filled with smoke and the boom of ominous trip hop music.

But in moments of great distress, even clothing tends to reflect our troubles. Immediately prior to the outbreak of war in 1939, there was a surfeit of Austrian and Bavarian influences in the industry; in the late \u201980s, Black Monday gave way to the rise of a movement dubbed \u201cdeconstruction\u201d that originated with the Belgian designer Martin Margiela, whose leitmotif was the unfinished hem and the inside-out seam.

The most experienced diplomat still there, Thomas Shannon, an emblem of professional integrity, has announced his resignation.\n\nPompeo will bring many things Tillerson did not have: a relationship with the president; ideological alignment with him insofar as that is possible with a man driven by gut impulses; knowledge of Congress and the military. He has the energy Trump prizes; perhaps that energy will be used to bring greater coherence to American policy and so reassure shaken allies over time.\n\nI would not bet on it. Morale at State will take a long time to recover. A values-free foreign policy is not what honorable American diplomats signed up for. The Trump-Pompeo convergence could lead to great damage, as it would if a functioning Iran nuclear deal is shredded. Tillerson was also a brake on folly.\n\nAs Jake Walles, a former U.S. ambassador to Tunisia who retired last year, put it to me: \u201cThe fundamental problem here is not who\u2019s in the job. It\u2019s that the president does not really value what the State Department does.\u201d\n\nThis disdain for diplomacy bodes ill for the North Korean summit, a meeting where the loosest cannon in the room could well be the American \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something.", "title": "Opinion | In Faint Praise of Rex Tillerson", "authors": []}

People with dementia, she said, have an easier time of simply reacting emotionally to what they see.\n\nShe did not tell the group that Rebecca Horn had turned her party shoes into art after she had suffered a stroke and could no longer wear them.

(The mayor\u2019s office ultimately estimated that nearly 200,000 people marched on Saturday.)\n\nThe early days, Mr. Clavering, 26, said, were \u201cdecentralized, figuring it out, being scrappy.\u201d But more established gun control groups soon got in touch, offering to connect him to others and, eventually, to pick up expenses that included lighting, sound equipment and stages.\n\nMr. Clavering\u2019s GoFundMe campaign raised more than $25,000, but he said the cost for the entire event was likely around $100,000.\n\nAnd although groups like Everytown provided the infrastructure and expertise, Mr. Clavering, who had never before planned an event of such scale, said they always remained hands-off. They left the decision-making to a core group of about 20 student organizers.\n\nIn Vermont, Ms. Knoop, a freshman at Johnson State College, recalled how she popped into a few Vermont-centric Facebook groups in February to see if anyone was planning an event in her state. She was quickly advised to check in with the people who would know: Women\u2019s March Vermont.\n\n\u201cI just messaged them and I was like, \u2018Do you know if anything is happening yet?\u2019 and they were like, \u2018No, we were waiting for a youth to come forward who wanted to lead the event.\u2019\u201d\n\nMs. Knoop said Women\u2019s March officials shared their organizing skills and spreadsheets with contact information for politicians, media outlets and other organizations that might want to help out. Ms. Knoop applied for a permit to hold a rally on the steps of the gold-topped, Greek Revival State House in Montpelier and said a group called the Peace & Justice Center handled the liability insurance. And Ms. Knoop worked with Gun Sense Vermont, which advocates tighter gun laws in the state. The group also helped with planning and managed the event\u2019s finances, including one of the grants Everytown issued.\n\n\u201cThey handled the finances, any donations we got, they were paying for everything, which was really, really helpful,\u201d Ms. Knoop said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd there were business contributions. Ben & Jerry\u2019s, the ice cream maker, paid for buses to shuttle demonstrators to Montpelier.\n\nThat left Ms. Knoop to attend long weekly planning meetings in Burlington, about an hour away from her school.\n\nShe used the time she had between classes to send emails and make phone calls to hammer out logistics for the rally.\n\n\u201cI definitely fell back in school a bit for it,\u201d Ms. Knoop said, \u201cbut to me, that was worth it.\u201d", "title": "In Gun Control Marches, Students Led but Adults Provided Key Resources", "authors": ["Alan Blinder", "Jess Bidgood", "Vivian Wang"]}

What are the most popular homegrown apps there?\n\nTech in India is mostly mobile \u2014 computers are quite rare. And smartphones are almost all Android, with Apple a bit player.\n\nPhoto\n\nSmartphone use has exploded in the past year. A price war started by a new phone carrier, Reliance Jio, in 2016 has given India one of the lowest prices for data in the world. My primary phone plan costs less than $10 a month for unlimited India calls and more data than I ever manage to use.\n\nCheap data has led to a surge in streaming video. YouTube is popular.

So app makers and internet companies like Google are racing to adapt their products to handle different languages. Android phones, for example, offer a choice of keyboards in 33 different Indian languages besides English. Google also says that more than one-quarter of searches in India are done by voice command instead of typing.\n\nThe combination of smartphones and cheap data has the potential to transform how poorer Indians find a job, socialize, do basic banking, get health care, even pursue an education.\n\nOne big hurdle, though, is that even a basic Android smartphone starts at about $50, which is still out of reach for a lot of people.\n\nWhat is Mumbai\u2019s high-tech scene like?\n\nMumbai, like New York, is still primarily a hub for finance and trade.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn tech, telecom is big \u2014 Reliance Jio and Vodafone\u2019s Indian operations are based here.

The government ordered e-wallet companies to get more identification information from customers by Feb. 28. Most customers did not cooperate, which limits their ability to refill their wallets.\n\nPhoto\n\nStill, it\u2019s inevitable that noncash payments will play a bigger role in India\u2019s economy over time. Debit cards are already popular, and the government is heavily promoting a technology called UPI, which instantly transfers money from one bank account to another.\n\nI doubt cash will ever disappear, though.

I think rising stocks help everybody.\u201d\n\nFaith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street\u2019s consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year \u201cboom\u201d that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches.\n\nBut Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions.\n\nLike many conservatives, he warned in 2010 that the Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to help prop up the economy, risked stoking rapid inflation, which did not happen.\n\nHe said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cacross-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy\u2019s long-run potential to grow.\u201d Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around.\n\nCritics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur.\n\nLiberal groups criticized Mr. Kudlow this week for dismissing concerns about inequality and the pay gap between women and men, and for his critiques of expanded safety net programs \u2014 which he has said discourage work and contributed to slow growth under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama. He has also expressed opposition to the federal minimum wage.\n\nThose critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.", "title": "In Larry Kudlow, Trump Finds His Economic Evangelist", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley"]}

{"date": "2018-03-29 00:00:00", "text": "As a director, Mr. Rasche strives for dramatic mood and effect through music and ritualistic methods. In \u201cDie R\u00e4uber,\u201d the American composer Ari Benjamin Meyer\u2019s pulsating score for violin, viola, electric bass and drums, performed live from the sides of the stage, creates a dronelike, hypnotic effect. The robber band itself becomes something of a Greek chorus, reciting both dialogue from the play and texts by the Invisible Committee, an anonymous radical leftist French author (or collective), as two baritones and a tenor chant a grim, martial hymn.\n\nAlong with his better-known contemporary Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Schiller adored and venerated Shakespeare, whose plays had been performed in German since the early 17th century \u2014 a time when no other translations existed. Shakespeare remains a superstar of Germany\u2019s vast and generously funded theater scene. While classic translations, including several by Schiller himself, are still used, it is increasingly common to present modern-language translations. No doubt, this method entails a trade-off: What is lost in poetic beauty and precision is gained in emotional, dramatic and even psychological immediacy.\n\nPhoto\n\nClaus Peymann\u2019s production of \u201cK\u00f6nig Lear\u201d at the Schauspiel Stuttgart uses a new performing version by Jutta Ferbers, supplemented by Peter Handke\u2019s modern translations of the fool\u2019s songs. As Shakespeare\u2019s darkest, most nihilistic work, \u201cLear\u201d benefits from such contemporary idiomatic directness. Without needing to work through Shakespeare\u2019s ornate language, one is especially struck by the work\u2019s pervasive cruelty and pessimism. Mr. Peymann is the former artistic director of the Berliner Ensemble, and the starkly focused style he honed at Bertolt Brecht\u2019s old theater during his long tenure there is evident in this sparse production, where the action is confined to an empty circle. Throughout, the stage remains bare save for Lear\u2019s golden crown dangling from a fishing-hook center stage: an image that becomes a powerful symbol for the work as a whole. There are neon lights, gusts of rain and music, but the success of the production rests largely on the actors\u2019 shoulders.\n\nMartin Schwab, a longtime member of Vienna\u2019s Burgtheater, made for a flustered and impetuous Lear. With nothing mannered about his brash performance, he managed Lear\u2019s stubbornness, madness and grief convincingly, without grand theatrical flourishes. The 80-year-old actor, clad in white linen, undoubtedly possessed gravitas, but it was consistently undercut by this production\u2019s ability to expose the play\u2019s unadorned, naked brutality.\n\nMr. Peymann\u2019s most audacious idea was casting one actress as both Cordelia and the Fool, an inspiration tied to a scholarly debate that Shakespeare may have written both roles for the same actor. Regardless of the original intent, it was an ingenious and often heartbreaking move, thanks to Lea Ruckpaul\u2019s brilliantly pliable performance. As Lear\u2019s silent, modest daughter, one understood the emotional pain that her repressed affection cost her. As the jester who accompanies the mad king on his wanderings, she caterwauled and played a squeezebox while childishly giving vent to the anguish that Cordelia only hints at.\n\nPhoto\n\nNearly four years into Armin Petras\u2019s tenure as artistic director, the Schauspiel Stuttgart has become one of the most exciting dramatic stages in Germany. If \u201cLear\u201d has been the theater\u2019s biggest success of the season thus far, then Kay Voges\u2019s \u201cDas 1. Evangelium,\u201d freely adapted from the New Testament, is far and away the most controversial.\n\nTheater scholars and practitioners may treat works by Schiller and Shakespeare as sacred texts. In terms of sanctity, however, their plays have nothing on the Bible. Mr. Voges, who leads the Schauspiel Dortmund, has cooked up an insane multimedia montage that turns \u201cThe Greatest Story Ever Told\u201d into a riotously colorful, loud and exactingly choreographed romp through the New Testament.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOr is it?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to identify the figures standing in for Jesus and Mary, but the meta-theatrical frame, with a filmmaker struggling to make a Jesus movie, is both ludicrous and banal. In addition to the biblical sources, the script contains quotes from Joseph Beuys, Allen Ginsberg, Jean-Luc Godard, Susan Sontag and R.E.M. It would all be mega-pretentious if it weren\u2019t so flat-out idiotic.\n\nMonty Python offered a sharper satire with \u201cLife of Brian,\u201d and Pier Paolo Pasolini was far more radical \u2014 and genuine \u2014 with \u201cThe Gospel According to St. Matthew.\u201d With its mixture of kitsch, excess and slick production values, \u201cDas 1.

Zimet is less wide-eyed and more unsentimental in her approach.

In 1854, a century before Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus, there was Jennings\u2019s defiant bravery on a streetcar in the Five Points neighborhood of New York. Wrapped up in Hearth\u2019s detailing of Jennings\u2019s courage is a sobering recognition that the shame of our nation\u2019s history was widespread. Slavery wasn\u2019t restricted to the South. In fact, New York City itself was home to a municipal slave market until 1762. Writing with a compassionate hand-holding tone perhaps best suited for readers on the younger end of the book\u2019s suggested age range, Hearth reminds us that Jennings was not only blocked from riding in a streetcar, she also faced institutionalized obstacles. \u201cFor blacks, both boys and girls, the road to success was blocked by the color of their skin,\u201d she explains. \u201cOnly a very few managed to break through the barriers, and when they did, they still were not considered equal to whites.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThings hadn\u2019t improved much nearly 100 years later, during the time that Melba Pattillo Beals writes about in her shocking autobiography, MARCH FORWARD, GIRL: From Young Warrior to Little Rock Nine (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 224 pp., $16.99; ages 10 and up). This book looks at Beals\u2019s younger years, before she was part of the Little Rock Nine who integrated Central High School (as she recounts in her best-selling \u201cWarriors Don\u2019t Cry\u201d). In empathetic yet unflinching prose respectful of younger readers, Beals depicts the nightmarish way the KKK held sway over the lives of black people. \u201cThe first thing I remember about being a person living in Little Rock, Ark., during the 1940s is the gut-wrenching fear in my heart and tummy that I was in danger,\u201d she begins. \u201cBy age 3, I realized the culture of this small town in the Deep South was such that the color of my skin framed the entire scope of my life.\u201d Beals candidly details the origins of her activism, as her fear transforms into rage over the passivity of the tormented adults who felt they could do nothing. There is in this new book even more untold history, more pain, outright terror and forgotten bravery, and yet so little has changed.\n\nIt\u2019s thrilling to think of girls and young women immersed in not just history-book bullet points, but entire chapters fleshing out the stories of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Elizabeth Jennings. Previously, a curious child might have found these depictions in the pages of a dusty encyclopedia, and only if she knew where to look. We have been denied the full reality of our past, both its injustices and its secret heroes.

(Her campaign website has a section devoted to #CuomosMTA.)\n\nShe has already called Mr. Cuomo\u2019s liberal credentials into question. At her campaign\u2019s debut, she asked if he was a \u201creal Democrat,\u201d and she has linked him to the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight breakaway Democrats in the State Senate who collaborate with Republicans. Several progressive groups in New York that have expressed their enthusiasm for Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy have suggested that they will take their anger at President Trump out on the I.D.C. and its allies.\n\nThe budget seemed a perfect opportunity for Mr. Cuomo, who has spent most of the last 40 years involved in New York State politics, to show his mastery of Albany\u2019s levers of power \u2014 and his knowledge of how to use them against his foes.\n\n\u201cCuomo never, ever missed an opportunity to stick it to de Blasio,\u201d said Douglas Muzzio, a professor of political science at Baruch College.\n\nIn the spending plan, Mr. Cuomo also sought and won new oversight of the city\u2019s public schools. The budget requires districts located in cities with populations of more than one million to submit a detailed, school-by-school accounting of how they spent state educational funds. Previously, the state allocated money to districts but did not oversee the distribution of that money.\n\nLike the city\u2019s subways, if districts do not comply, the state can withhold funding.\n\nMr. Cuomo billed the move as a much-needed increase in transparency. But it also served a dual political purpose: It jabbed at the tradition of mayoral control of New York City\u2019s schools, and it also allowed the governor to take an aggressive stand on the issue of educational equity \u2014 a marquee issue of Ms. Nixon, a longtime education activist who has placed the issue squarely at the heart of the early stages of her campaign.\n\nSpecifically, Ms. Nixon has blasted Mr. Cuomo for underfunding schools, accusing him of neglecting children of color in the poorest districts.

The condition-laden deal has the blessing of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who has been criticized by some \u2014 most recently by his new primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon \u2014 for not using his influence to force a truce years earlier.\n\nNonetheless, residual anger over Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, combined with the Democrats\u2019 hopes of flipping Congress in the midterm elections this fall, have invigorated efforts to drive the I.D.C. senators out of office.\n\nA coalition of 60 anti-Trump groups has endorsed five Democratic challengers who will run against members of the I.D.C. in the September primary. The Working Families Party, which often cross-endorses Democratic candidates, has come out in support of seven challengers.\n\nActivists from groups like Progressive Women of Pelham, True Blue NY and Rockland Citizens Action Network have held postcard-writing parties, protests and educational forums to inform the public about the I.D.C.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey face an uphill battle: The I.D.C. members have all the advantages of incumbency, from name recognition to fund-raising.\n\nThe I.D.C. was created in 2011 by Mr. Klein, whose district includes parts of the Bronx and Westchester, and a coterie of breakaway Democrats who were dissatisfied with the Senate Democratic leadership. A year later, the group declared its intention to form a bipartisan coalition with Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince then, the Republicans have ruled the Senate, while Democrats control the governorship and Assembly.

They were outraged that Mr. Buhari hired a former director of the nation\u2019s pension fund to a new post in his government after the previous administration had fired the man on grounds he had pilfered billions.\n\nMr. Buhari also hired a national health insurance executive who was being investigated by Nigeria\u2019s anti-graft agency on suspicion of approving shady contracts and engaging in nepotism.

The contradiction between Latin America\u2019s extravagant creativity and its agonies of injustice and poverty can be overcome with sound laws and reasonable democracy, he believes, if only \u201cpoetic metaphors\u201d are kept out of politics and stay where they belong.\n\n\u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d Vargas Llosa\u2019s 20th novel, is a political mystery of the kind he regularly turns out between his more monumental historical productions. The tone, perfectly conveyed in Edith Grossman\u2019s virtuoso translation, is amused and theatrical \u2014 realism that never asks the reader to forget it has been neatly contrived.\n\nThe subject, however, couldn\u2019t be more serious. The story takes place in Lima shortly before the downfall of the Fujimori regime in 2000. The cast of characters includes the star reporter of a vile tabloid magazine who is \u201cnourished\u201d by \u201cfinding out other people\u2019s secret shames,\u201d her flashy, unscrupulous editor, an impoverished old man who worked in show business until the editor destroyed his career and two complacent, upper-class couples who are also best friends. The wives pass the time shopping, decorating and bossing their servants around while secretly conducting a passionate lesbian love affair. The husbands make the money that keeps their bubble from bursting \u2014 one is a lawyer at Peru\u2019s most prestigious firm; the other owns a mining company and has extensive international connections, as well as an engineering degree from M.I.T. Vargas Llosa\u2019s portrait of the couples is ambiguous: At one moment they are worldly sophisticates doing their best to operate productively in the political barbarism of Peru; at the next they are vulgar members of an elite for whom \u201cculture comes down to two words: whiskey and Miami.\u201d In the background, bombs explode at all hours, guerrillas kidnap businessmen, government death squads murder indiscriminately and workaday life somehow manages to grind on.\n\nThe plot slips into gear when the tabloid editor tries to blackmail the mining magnate with explicit photographs from an orgy. Vargas Llosa knows how the levers of power in his country work, and he uses his story to anatomize the degradation of civic life under Fujimori. Vladimiro Montesinos, who was the head of Fujimori\u2019s secret police, emerges as a character in the novel, buying the support of journalists and opposition leaders with bags of cash and videotaping the bribes from his compound. In these scenes, the novelist need hardly invent a word: The real-life Montesinos is currently serving time for bribery in a maximum-security prison he himself built for his enemies.", "title": "In Politics if Not Art, Realism Trumps Magic for Mario Vargas Llosa", "authors": []}

The possibility that such characteristics might be associated with A.D.H.D. was first examined in the 1990s. The educational psychologist Bonnie Cramond, for example, tested a group of children in Louisiana who had been determined to have A.D.H.D. and found that an astonishingly high number \u2014 32 percent \u2014 did well enough to qualify for an elite creative scholars program in the Louisiana schools.\n\nIt is now possible to explain Professor Cramond\u2019s results at the neural level. While there is no single brain structure or system responsible for A.D.H.D. (and some believe the term encompasses more than a single syndrome), one cause seems to be a disruption of the brain\u2019s dopamine system. One consequence of that disruption is a lessening of what is called \u201ccognitive inhibition.\u201d The human brain has a system of filters to sort through all the possible associations, notions and urges that the brain generates, allowing only the most promising ones to pass into conscious awareness. That\u2019s why if you are planning a trip to Europe, you think about flying there, but not swimming.\n\nBut odd and unlikely associations can be valuable. When such associations survive filtering, they can result in constructive ideas that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have been thought of. For example, when researchers apply a technique known as transcranial stimulation to interfere with key structures in the filtering system, people become more imaginative and inventive, and more insightful as problem solvers.\n\nIndividuals with A.D.H.D. naturally have less stringent filters. This can make them more distractible but also more creative. Such individuals may also adapt well to frequent change and thus make for good explorers. Jews whose ancestors migrated north to Rome and Germany from what is now Israel and the Palestinian territories show a higher proportion of the A.D.H.D. gene variant than those Jews whose ancestors migrated a shorter distance south to Ethiopia and Yemen. In fact, scientists have found that the farther a group\u2019s ancestors migrated, the higher the prevalence of the gene variant in that population.\n\nOr consider the case of the Ariaal, a Kenyan tribe whose members through most of its history were wild-animal herders.

The child of immigrants understands her countrymen, while seeing them as they cannot see themselves. Brookner studied art history (with the infamous Soviet spy Anthony Blunt), put out well-received scholarly books, joined the faculty at the Courtauld Institute of Art. A most impressive life. Then, at the age of 53, she published a novel. Those of us dismayed by lists of successful people under 30 should take heart. In the ensuing 28 years, she published 23 more (and one slim novella).\n\nLearning these facts from Brookner\u2019s obituaries in 2016, I was intrigued. I picked up her first book, \u201cThe Debut\u201d (published originally as \u201cA Start in Life\u201d). Upon finishing it, I went to the Strand and bought copies of every one of her novels. I\u2019ve had to ration them; they\u2019re so brief they last me only two days and besides, it brings me joy to know there are Anita Brookner works I\u2019ve not yet read.\n\nThe prevailing criticism of Brookner is that her work is repetitive. There are concerns she returns to: the single woman who wishes not to be, the dutiful daughter overwhelmed by filial obligation, the family that is not unhappy but not quite happy. I find such intelligence and vitality in her books that it does not bother me that they amount to variations on a theme. Repetition is part of the particular pleasure; the books\u2019 familiarity, as well as the cunning with which the author pushes herself to reinvent the form she\u2019s chosen as her own.\n\nMy affection is rooted in the fact that Brookner\u2019s hobbyhorses are my own. There\u2019s food: \u201cHartmann, a voluptuary, lowered a spoonful of brown sugar crystals into his coffee cup, then placed a square of bitter chocolate on his tongue, and, while it was dissolving, lit his first cigarette.\u201d (\u201cLatecomers.\u201d) There\u2019s fashion: \u201cCaroline undulated like a siren, clutching her bag, her scarves, touching her chains, her feet slipping about in ridiculously fragile sandals.\u201d (\u201cProvidence.\u201d)\n\nIt should be boring, but it\u2019s invigorating to see the most quotidian things through Brookner\u2019s intelligent eyes. Her heroines go for long walks: \u201cShe was too lonely to sit in her room reading, too restless to work. She went back to Edith Grove and started walking from there, down to the river, along the embankment to Chelsea Old Church, all the way to Victoria and back to Sloane Square and along the King\u2019s Road and into the Fulham Road until it got too late and she caught the 31 bus home.\u201d (\u201cThe Debut.\u201d) They find comfort in looking at art: \u201cI wanted to look at pictures, either in the National Gallery or in the Wallace Collection.

Even more so than the free trade champions at the Cato Institute or the foreign policy hawks at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, these expats are our real globalists, representing the things that make America great: adventure, engagement, commerce, openness to new ideas, and a love of America honed by a combination of critical distance and a new depth of appreciation.\n\nThe White House could use those same virtues.

At a time when trust in democracy is waning, everybody kept underlining their faith in our democratic system, that voting is the way to make change. There was no culture war nastiness, no hint of resentment. Hunters and farmers and vets were celebrated. There was no ill will toward anybody but the N.R.A.\n\nOf course some of the student speakers were grandiose and pretentious. Most of us were like that when we were 18.

(What was it like to lose her mother when she was only 8? Why did McKenney leave home as a teenager?) It centers on her relationship with her husband, Richard Bransten, an editor at the New Masses, whom she married eight days after their first meeting. In their first decade together, they weathered financial ups and downs, were expelled from the Communist Party and endured two near-death experiences, one for Ruth and one for their daughter, Eileen.\n\nMost of this is related with McKenney\u2019s signature breeziness. The darkest passage in \u201cLove Story\u201d is a stingingly short chapter midway through: Her sister Eileen\u2019s death at the age of 27.

But barely anything had been written about what it is like for Puerto Ricans who return to the island after months in exile \u2014 the basis for my recent story about a couple\u2019s return home.\n\nThe idea stemmed from a brainstorm session with Peter Applebome, a former Times editor I worked with when I covered Hurricane Maria for more than a month in Puerto Rico. As we looked for new ways to cover the island\u2019s post-hurricane recovery, he wondered aloud, \u201cWhat if we followed a family back to Puerto Rico?\u201d\n\nThe idea stuck with me. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and since the hurricane I\u2019ve felt more than ever that it\u2019s my responsibility to seek out the untold stories of my homeland. To tell this one would mean finding a Puerto Rican family in New York City, where I am based as a reporter for the Metro desk.\n\nWhile working on another article about Puerto Ricans taking refuge stateside in hotels paid for by the federal government, I met several Puerto Ricans in a hotel in Queens who were debating whether to stay permanently or return home. I met Omaira L\u00f3pez, who seemed stressed: At the time her parents, Enrique and Emma L\u00f3pez, were dealing with several medical issues. I couldn\u2019t interview them then, but when I checked in with Ms. L\u00f3pez weeks later, she told me that Enrique and Emma would soon fly back to Puerto Rico. I asked if I could join and chronicle the homecoming.\n\nMs. L\u00f3pez said yes, in part because she wanted readers to understand the difficulties older people face in Puerto Rico. But it was also personal: She was losing sleep over how her parents would fare alone on an island where power is still unreliable.\n\nI immediately got the green light from my boss, Wendell Jamieson, Metro editor for The Times, who had asked for stories examining how Hurricane Maria\u2019s toll had rippled to the mainland and to New York.\n\nA couple of days before their flight, the two greeted me enthusiastically in the hotel room where they had been staying for several months. Enrique, 81, was recovering from a recent stroke that had left his legs weak. Emma, 75, has Alzheimer\u2019s and repeatedly asked me my name and where I was from. Yet both insisted on going home.\n\nI understood their eagerness. While I was there covering the hurricanes, my grandparents left the island and spent several months in New York, just like Enrique and Emma. And just like them, after fleeing the immediate chaos after the hurricane, they grew tired of being away from their patria. Just like my grandparents and Ms. L\u00f3pez\u2019s parents, I want to return to Puerto Rico for good one day.\n\nBut I was also aware of some of the challenges that awaited Enrique and Emma there. My grandparents on my mother\u2019s side stayed on the island and struggled for months alone in a house without electricity. Like the L\u00f3pez children, my mother and uncles also stressed over my grandparents\u2019 fragile health on an island with unreliable hospitals.\n\nThe story was also personal for Christopher Gregory, the photographer I worked with. Chris is from Puerto Rico and, as he told me, the island \u201cwill never again be the place I made so many of my first memories, so each opportunity to document a small part of that episode in its history is something I don\u2019t take lightly.\u201d\n\nThroughout the trip, it became increasingly clear to me and Chris that the couple\u2019s return was much more than a post-hurricane homecoming. Their mortality loomed over Enrique and Emma. \u201cLet\u2019s go \u2014 I\u2019m ready for the cemetery,\u201d Emma said to no one in particular before the flight home. Seemingly, they had chosen their deathbed: Puerto Rico \u2014 home, despite having lived most of their lives in New York.\n\nAs one of their sons, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, told me in his parents\u2019 uprooted backyard in Puerto Rico: \u201cThis is their final resting place, and I feel better that they\u2019re here.\u201d", "title": "In Puerto Rico, Following Stories That Hit Close to Home", "authors": []}

You start with a corned ham, which is a whole, fresh ham that has taken a long vacation in salt. (Good luck, by the way, finding one outside the county \u2014 especially one that weighs less than 20 pounds.)\n\nNext, you chop several pounds of cabbage, kale and onions, then perk it all up with enough black and red pepper \u201cto give it some bite,\u201d as cooks here say.\n\nFrom there, the recipe diverges into a debate that runs the length of the county. In the north, cooks will tell you to add a lot of kale. In the south, kale is just an accent color, if it goes in the stuffing at all. Whether mustard seed, celery seed or celery itself belongs in the stuffing depends on the version you grew up eating.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe stuffing is packed into pockets cut deep into the meat with techniques that vary from cook to cook. What\u2019s left over \u2014 and there will be a lot left over \u2014 is pressed around the ham. The whole thing is wrapped in cheesecloth (or a clean pillowcase or T-shirt) and boiled for four or five hours.\n\nThen, you drain the ham and set into the refrigerator to chill, although plenty of people just leave it in the cooking liquid out on the back porch during cool weather. You slice it cold, serving the ham as a main dish or tucked into soft potato rolls or between slices of white bread. Don\u2019t ask about mustard or mayonnaise. You don\u2019t want to start an argument.\n\nA ham stuffed with cabbage simmering on the stove for hours makes a lasting olfactory impression, and not necessarily a good one. Unprompted, even the hams biggest fans allow that the smell can linger for days.\n\n\u201cOld-timers used to cook it all day on Christmas Eve, then put the pot on the back porch, go to midnight Mass, come home, have a sandwich and go to bed,\u201d said Daniel Raley, a retired county commissioner whose family used to run a small grocery store in Ridge, Md., that specialized in stuffed ham. \u201cEveryone smelled like stuffed ham at midnight Mass.\u201d\n\npa.

At fund-raising dinners for churches and volunteer fire departments, stuffed ham is set out on long tables along with fried chicken, crab cakes, steamed shrimp or fried oysters. If you\u2019re in a hurry, a volunteer will hand you some in a foam container from a makeshift drive-through. (The hams fell out of favor at community suppers for a few years after a 1997 incident when one woman died and several hundred people got sick after eating stuffed ham tainted with salmonella.)\n\nStuffed hams are a big auction item, too.

The store has been in his family since 1949, before the supermarket chains and the Dollar Generals started moving in, when most people still cooked stuffed hams at home.\n\nHe makes about 400 a year selling them for church dinners, to big families who need a holiday centerpiece, and for $12.99 a pound at the store. The Dent brothers sell a lot by the pound, too.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of young people who\u2019ll come get a sandwich, but they\u2019re not going to make one,\u201d Andy Dent said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t want to be bothered, but they have to have the ham.\u201d\n\nMr. Dent would make at least dozen a week. Around Thanksgiving and Christmas, that number doubled. He was particularly proud of his stuffed ham egg rolls, which are a relatively new invention. He sold a lot of $16 pizzas with stuffed ham as a topping, too. Even his cordon bleu, which costs $16 including two side dishes, was stuffed with stuffed ham.\n\nEveryone from St. Mary\u2019s knows that life\u2019s big events should be punctuated with stuffed ham, so they served it at his funeral.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The dish, from Lincolnshire, is made from a brined chunk of pork taken from between the shoulder blades. Herbs are stuffed into slashes in the meat, and then the whole thing is boiled in muslin.\n\nMs. White and other regional historians say it\u2019s more likely that the dish has Afro-Caribbean roots; indentured or enslaved West Africans would season the greens and onions left over in the winter garden with red pepper, and stuff it into jowls or whatever chunks of pork they had on hand.\n\nBut as in so many parts of the South, the line between black and white food is blurry.", "title": "In This Corner of Maryland, Holidays Mean a Stuffed Ham", "authors": ["Kim Severson"]}

At first he sold and repaired eyeglasses and watches, but nowadays he mostly just repairs watches, both quartz and mechanical.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn Japan, craftsmen who can now repair mechanical watches are slowly disappearing,\u201d Mr. Ikeda said, \u201csince high skills and techniques are not required anymore to repair quartz styles,\u201d which most of his customers own these days.\n\n\u201cThe most serious problem is the lack of people who want to learn those skills,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t force the younger generation and our own children to take over our businesses. It takes at least seven to 10 years to learn the basic skills, and they don\u2019t want to invest that amount of time. Nowadays, they are more interested in becoming independent watchmakers, to create their own original watches.\u201d\n\nMr. Ikeda usually gets parts from local craftsmen who specialize in the work, but occasionally he has to make them at a work table in the corner of the shop. \u201cIf I can\u2019t find the exact part, I\u2019ll find one that\u2019s very similar or just make it myself, as some parts are not produced anymore,\u201d he said, noting that making pieces is costly. \u201cIf I find a similar part I can just reshape it. Even if it\u2019s not exactly like the original shape, it can work.\u201d\n\nHe says he believes every watch can be repaired \u2014 well, most likely. \u201cIt depends on how much the customer is willing to invest in repairs. Sometimes they just choose to buy a new one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI always tell my customers that a 70-year-old watch does not becomes younger after I fix it; it doesn\u2019t magically go back to 20 years old,\u201d Mr. Ikeda said. \u201cI can fix it, it will work, but it will work like a 70-year-old watch.\u201d\n\nMr. Ikeda works every day except Wednesday, when the shop is closed. He usually stays until 11 p.m., doing the more detailed repairs after hours. \u201cIf it\u2019s a Rolex, for example, I need to focus, and close the shutters,\u201d he said. \u201cI spend on average three hours on a mechanical watch.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis favorite type of watch to repair is an Omega Constellation. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, very easy,\u201d he said, displaying one that he said was more than 40 years old.\n\nMr. Ikeda has been thinking about the day he will retire. \u201cIn Japan, regular office workers usually retire at 60. I\u2019m getting old. I want to retire at age 70 because of physical reasons \u2014 of course my eyes, but also my memory,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019ll start forgetting which parts belong where.\u201d\n\nAfter retirement, he said, he won\u2019t repair watches as a hobby.\n\n\u201cBut maybe I\u2019ll teach my skills,\u201d Mr. Ikeda said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for craftsmen to survive in the Japanese society, as it does not value craftsmanship as much as it values the typical salaryman lifestyle. That\u2019s why the younger generation is not interested in learning those skills; they\u2019re afraid they won\u2019t be able to support themselves financially.\u201d\n\nMr. Ikeda keeps his motorcycle parked right in front of the shop. About once a month he rides it around the small parking lot nearby, to maintain the engine.

Whose body is this, and how did it end up in the water? In alternating chapters, two female narrators provide the long, lurid and psychologically complex answer. Neither woman is necessarily trustworthy, a trait they share with the unreliable female narrators of recent best sellers like \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cThe Girl on the Train.\u201d Like those novels, \u201cTangerine\u201d is on track to become a film, with Scarlett Johansson tentatively attached to star.\n\nMangan draws her narrators with broad strokes, using classic Hollywood color coding. Alice Shipley is pale, rich and emotionally fragile. She wears lace gloves and pearls. Lucy Mason is dark, voluptuous and worldly. She smokes. They meet on their first day at Bennington College in the mid-1950s and develop one of those possessive, erotically charged friendships that never seem to end well. The two young women experience \u2014 or perhaps instigate \u2014 an unspecified tragedy. Then Alice drops out of school, marries and flees to Tangier with her caddish new husband, John, to escape the traumatic memory, and perhaps Lucy as well. Soon, though, Lucy turns up unannounced at Alice\u2019s Tangier flat. Alice\u2019s response: \u201cI thought of the few works of Shakespeare I knew and the line that frequently rattled in my brain \u2014 what\u2019s past is prologue.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nBut what exactly is that past? As Lucy and Alice re-establish a volatile intimacy over sugary mint tea in sweltering Tangier cafes, via flashback we gradually learn the details of that earlier mystery, which unfolds in frosty Vermont. It\u2019s as if Mangan couldn\u2019t decide whether to write a homage to Donna Tartt\u2019s \u201cThe Secret History\u201d or a sun-drenched novel of dissolute Westerners abroad in the tradition of Patricia Highsmith and Paul Bowles, so she tried to do both. She mostly succeeds.\n\nMangan openly acknowledges the influence of Bowles on \u201cTangerine.\u201d Lucy strikes up a friendship with a shady Moroccan artist named Youssef, who tells her: \u201cYou are unfamiliar with Bowles, I see. You must read him, if you want to understand this place.\u201d Youssef claims to know the novelist, who lived in Tangier and wrote about Westerners who lose their moral compasses, and sometimes themselves, in North Africa. The \u201cTangerine\u201d of the title refers to a native of the Moroccan city, and it seems inevitable that one or both of the narrators will lose herself there.

{"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "Labor discipline was another matter. In the farming and domestic work that people had been doing for generations, \u201cintense activity alternated with slack times,\u201d whereas factory production was repetitive and continuous, requiring \u201ccoordinated activity by dozens or hundreds of workers, who were expected to start and stop work at the same time, day after day.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia, it can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us. For an agrarian society like England, the factory generated a wistfulness for the bucolic agricultural past. The \u201cdark Satanic Mills\u201d bemoaned by William Blake were powered by steam and coal-fired boilers that belched smoke and soot. Seventy-hour work weeks were common. Male workers chafed at the constant supervision on the factory floor, and owners preferred not to employ men, anyway. \u201cToday, in the United States, factories are associated with masculinity,\u201d Freeman writes, \u201cbut in their early days they were spaces largely occupied by women and children.\u201d\n\nSome of the details recounted here are familiar, though still appalling. In the 19th century, textile mills in New England \u2014 which were supposed to be gentler than the cruel depredations of the Old World \u2014 employed children as young as 4. Factory workers in Britain overwhelmed urban areas, crowding together in squalor. A Manchester official described streets \u201cso covered with refuse and excrementitious matter as to be almost impassable from depth of mud, and intolerable from stench.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Freeman shows, what started inauspiciously became an engine for material abundance and, in the cases of the United States and the Soviet Union, a source of national pride. Factories, especially steel mills, became the behemoths of the book\u2019s title, consolidations of equipment and labor on a massive scale. Freeman suggests the awe that these enormous structures must have inspired, describing how dignitaries attending the opening of a steel mill in 19th-century Maryland \u201crode in decorated gondola cars along the route iron ore would take,\u201d ascending to a height of eight stories. Unlike the textile worker, who brought to mind wan images of a young woman or \u201ca sickly child,\u201d steelworkers were often portrayed \u201cas intensely masculine, often bare-chested, with muscles rippling.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWith size and strength came strife too, as steel mills became sites for a bitter class war. Start-up costs were high, so a few big firms dominated the industry. Unions organized in response. Steel magnates like Andrew Carnegie resented any incursions on their freedom to set wages and working conditions at will; they wanted the right to squeeze labor to maintain profitability. The Homestead strike of 1892 turned into a literal conflagration, as steelworkers in Pennsylvania set the Monongahela River on fire.\n\nFreeman handles all of this material with the seriousness it deserves. If \u201cBehemoth\u201d can feel a little slow-going at times, that\u2019s partly because of the knottiness of the history Freeman lays out, as well as his honorable refusal to resort to simplistic notions of grand progress or portentous doom.\n\nHe shows how Henry Ford\u2019s assembly-line innovations rendered his company both dominant and vulnerable: Switching to a new product in 1927 from the Model T required a wholesale overhaul of equipment and processes, costing Ford today\u2019s equivalent of a cool $3.5 billion. Gigant industrialism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc showed its own seams and contradictions; for all the talk of a workers\u2019 paradise, the Soviets eventually criminalized absenteeism, tardiness and \u201cquitting without permission,\u201d controlling labor in ways that would have made the most ruthless capitalist proud.\n\nToward the end of \u201cBehemoth,\u201d Freeman finally arrives in China and Vietnam, where the factory system is still flourishing. Unlike the 20th-century behemoths of the United States, which were publicly showcased as marvels of ingenuity and industry, these new factories keep much of their work hidden. Freeman says Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China, might well be the largest factory ever, though the number of employees is hard to pin down: perhaps as many as 400,000 workers, making sleek and expensive gadgets like Apple\u2019s iPhone.\n\nA spate of worker suicides at Foxconn captured the world\u2019s attention in 2010 \u2014 at least for a while, though none of Foxconn\u2019s major clients stopped using it. Nor did reports of Foxconn\u2019s merciless and degrading environment put a dent in demand for Apple\u2019s coveted products. Instead of substantively changing its production regime, Foxconn surrounded its factory buildings with yellow netting, to catch despairing workers before they hit the ground.\n\nOur brave new world of consumer goods is now fabricated in \u201cbland, boring structures,\u201d Freeman writes, designed for grim functionality as opposed to showing off: \u201cRather than representing an enlargement of the human spirit, modern factory giants often seem to symbolize its diminishment.\u201d \u201cBehemoth\u201d doesn\u2019t romanticize the earlier incarnations of gigantic factories, but Freeman understands why some people did \u2014 and still do.", "title": "In \u2018Behemoth,\u2019 Manufacturing Still Looms Large", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}
{"date": "2018-03-20 00:00:00", "text": "Majmudar, who lives in Ohio and is a radiologist as well as a writer, had been familiar with the Gita (as it is commonly called) since childhood but was surprised by a sudden surge of religious feeling later in life. \u201cIt is an incongruity I hide from the other rich, bespectacled Indian doctors of my cohort, entering middle age like me, trying to stay fit like me, suburban and Midwestern like me,\u201d he writes.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo love the Gita is apparently to be seized by a desire to translate it.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nMajmudar has a gift for imagery (\u201cKrishna fanned and shivered the universe like a peacock\u201d) but he writes for the ear above all, retaining the traditional couplets and meter of the shloka structure. He remembers the Gita was intended to be sung (\u201cGodsong\u201d is a literal translation of \u201cBhagavad Gita\u201d).\n\nFor Emerson, the glory of the Gita was its voice: \u201clarge, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.\u201d Majmudar\u2019s Krishna commands the same awe, but he feels closer to us. The Gita, as Majmudar points out, \u201cimagined a relationship in which the soul and God are equals. It\u2019s a relationship mostly missing from every other scripture: friendship.\u201d We encounter a more human Krishna, who can turn querulous or even insecure as he makes his revelations: \u201cSince you aren\u2019t scoffing / I\u2019ll proclaim to you the utmost secret.\u201d\n\nThis can, on occasion, go too far. A feeling of intimacy with the divine is one thing, to have Krishna sounding like a teenage vampire from \u201cTwilight\u201d another: \u201cHear me out again. My highest word, / the secret of all secrets: / I love you. Hard.\u201d\n\nThe verses of the Gita are traditionally accompanied by commentaries. Majmudar uses this space to discuss his faith and his translation decisions, as well as to make a curious assertion: \u201cI prefer to let my Gita float free of history or geography,\u201d he writes. \u201cHistorical quibbling isn\u2019t just irrelevant when it comes to scripture; it\u2019s a buzz kill.\u201d\n\nThis is strange \u2014 not least because the religious concepts in the Gita, like karma and dharma, are not static, as historians like Wendy Doniger have pointed out; they emerged at \u201cparticular moments in Indian history, for particular reasons, and then continue to be alive \u2014 which is to say, to change.\u201d It\u2019s especially odd given that Majmudar engages passionately with historical quibbling when it comes to issues of translation. What he doesn\u2019t want to discuss, it seems, is historical quibbling when it comes to social issues. What he doesn\u2019t want to discuss is caste.\n\nHe does reckon with it, though \u2014 briefly, defensively. He claims the text mentions \u201cdifferences but no inequalities. In other words, Krishna introduced differences among people; human beings attached relative values to these differences, introducing inequality.\u201d This is rather strenuous special pleading. The Gita may argue for the essential equality of all beings but even in Majmudar\u2019s own translation it also includes passages that regard intercaste marriage and mingling with explicit horror: \u201cThe women once corrupted, Krishna / The colors pour together \u2026 codes of caste, eternal / family laws \u2014 obliterated.\u201d\n\n\u201cFault envelops all / Endeavors, as smoke does fire,\u201d the Gita tells us. These are quibbles of my own, but they can hardly be helped. \u201cGodsong\u201d reveals how beautifully this 2,000-year-old book lends itself to the careful, loving work of translation.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "Notice how far we\u2019ve gotten without a mention of you-know-who, the chief populist of the United States. He\u2019s included in \u201cThe People vs. Democracy,\u201d as he should be, but one of the many things to recommend this clarifying book is its international scope. As much as Donald J. Trump might fancy himself one of a kind, Mounk argues that the American president is part of a global wave. Populist forces are surging in Britain, Germany, Italy and France; in places like Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey and Poland they have already settled in, set up house and gotten around to the next step: gutting institutional safeguards in order to shore up their rule.\n\nPhoto\n\nPolitical scientists like Mounk talk about norms and institutions with a kind of reverence that can seem puzzling to non-scholars and non-wonks. But institutions are what allow people, whose experiences and interests differ and diverge, to live together in a democratic system. Whether entrusted with regulating banks or protecting civil rights or enforcing term limits, \u201cliberal institutions are, in the long run, needed for democracy to survive.\u201d\n\nMounk is a clear and often forceful writer, if not an especially stylish one; he favors the step-by-step explication and the tidy formulation.

Mounk doesn\u2019t believe the resentment is necessarily baseless, even if he thinks the demagogues who seize on such anger offer scapegoats instead of solutions. \u201cSome of the most important economic decisions facing countries around the world are now taken by technocrats,\u201d he writes, with little to no allowance for people to voice their dissent.\n\nEven if economic inequality among nations is decreasing, it\u2019s been growing within most countries, including the United States. Elites do democracy no favors, Mounk suggests, when they respond to the public\u2019s fears by ignoring them, or insisting that everything as a whole is getting better while downplaying suffering as mere collateral damage. Addressing those fears, though, shouldn\u2019t mean indulging the populist penchant for racist invective and conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cThe case for taking so many policy decisions out of democratic contestation may be perfectly sound,\u201d Mounk writes, in his typically sober way. But such a case needs to be actively made, rather than offered up as a no-brainer; there\u2019s little a populist demagogue can weaponize more easily than a policy, however sensible, presented by knowing elites as a high-minded fait accompli.\n\nMounk spends a good deal of his book offering concrete proposals for how to get out of the populist spiral. Pointing to the impeachment last year of South Korea\u2019s spectacularly corrupt president Park Geun-hye, he advocates mass protests in response to blatant abuses of power and the need, however difficult, \u201cto peel off some members of the ruling regime\u201d and get them to change sides. He also suggests some remedies that might sound reasonable to technocratic ears but seem politically wistful, to say the least: tamping down exorbitant housing prices, devoting more resources to enforcing tax regulations, enabling \u201call working-age adults to take regular sabbaticals to upgrade their skills.\u201d\n\nYou can sense Mounk trying to be hopeful, wondering whether the chaos in the White House will \u201cinoculate\u201d Americans against the illiberal siren song, but the norm-watching political scientist in him can\u2019t help being worried. He points to the example of the Roman Republic, which lurched between plebeian and patrician rule for a century, wearing down norms and institutions so that with each blow, they \u201cwere a little less capable of containing the assault.\u201d President Trump, with his extensive experience in both real estate and bankruptcy, has probably deployed his demolition crew knowing full well that swinging the wrecking ball is easy; building something is harder.", "title": "In \u2018The People vs. Democracy,\u2019 Trump Is Just One Populist Among Many", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}

The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s current estimate for full-employment, 4.7 percent, is down from around 5.7 percent in 2012. And models used by the Fed and the budget office have failed to identify the point at which further total spending growth in the economy will bump up against a ceiling and bring not just a little more inflation but possibly an unsustainable spiral of ever-rising price growth.\n\nIt may be that the United States economy\u2019s \u201cpotential\u201d \u2014 estimates for what gross domestic product could be if all of our country\u2019s resources, including unemployed labor, were utilized \u2014 is much larger than we think.

Particular standouts at the Sunday matinee included a sweeping sense of melodic line from the baritone Renato Dolcini and the controlled viciousness of the countertenor Kacper Szelazek. The lustrous warmth of the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Molinari\u2019s tone was put to ample use as she was given a four-role marathon that included Eurydice.\n\nIn directing \u201cThe Raft of the Medusa,\u201d Romeo Castellucci followed an occasional strategy of Mr. Audi\u2019s: Take something that is not really an opera, squint at it, and make it one. Here, Henze\u2019s oratorio about the shipwrecked conscripts of the frigate Medusa in 1816 \u2014 you probably know the classic G\u00e9ricault painting \u2014 was connected to contemporary political concerns by a film of Mr. Castellucci\u2019s, projected on a scrim at the front of the stage.\n\nIn the film the athlete Mamadou Ndiaye languished in roughly the same patch of sea where the Medusa once disintegrated, off the coast of Senegal, while Henze\u2019s characters congregated on both sides of the screen. The filmed presence of Mr. Ndiaye, evoking current-day refugees in current-day waters, slices through some of the \u2019twas-ever-thus fatalism of Henze\u2019s socialist critique. By placing contemporary images front and center, the staging reopens these old questions, as if to ask: Must it always be this way?\n\nAfter exciting opening minutes, the staging lost coherence for a stretch. It wasn\u2019t consistently clear which of Henze\u2019s characters were dead and which were living. Henze\u2019s vividly aggrieved string writing, stacked with eerie harmonics and col legno abrasion, had more impact than some of the images; the conductor, Ingo Metzmacher, and the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra drew intense drama from these passages.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is an arresting turn near the end. Throughout the work, the character of Death (sung with steely urgency by the soprano Lenneke Ruiten) is dressed as a camera-toting cable news anchor. When Mr. Castellucci makes what seems an obvious move \u2014 turning the camera on the seats, implicating the audience \u2014 he doesn\u2019t offer the live feed we might expect; instead, the seats appear empty.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe effect goes beyond challenging the audience\u2019s politics, and instead calls its very existence into doubt.

There\u2019s Michael, a tenor role (and sometimes a loose stand-in for Stockhausen himself), who tends to be accompanied by some tricky trumpet playing.

As Tamar Jacoby wrote in her 1998 book \u201cSomeone Else\u2019s House\u201d: \u201cIf integration is still most Americans\u2019 idea of the goal, few of us talk about it any more. The word has a quaint ring today \u2014 like \u2018gramophone\u2019 or \u2018nylons.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow we seem to have entered a phase of trepidation, or even passive segregation. Race is on everybody\u2019s mind, but are there enough efforts to create intimate bonds across racial lines? Jacoby emphasizes that there are two kinds of integration, objective and subjective. The former is about putting people of different races in the same classroom, office and neighborhood. The latter is about emotional bonds of connection, combining a positive sense of pride in group with an overall sense that we are a \u201cwe.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Integration Now, Integration Forever", "authors": []}

The loans are based on the equity in your home, and are secured by the property. (Home equity is the difference between what the house is worth and what you owe on your mortgage.)\n\nBut the Internal Revenue Service, saying it was responding to \u201cmany questions received from taxpayers and tax professionals,\u201d recently issued an advisory. According to the advisory, the new tax law suspends the deduction for home equity interest from 2018 to 2026 \u2014 unless the loan is used to \u201cbuy, build or substantially improve\u201d the home that secures the loan.\n\nIf you take out the loan to pay for things like an addition, a new roof or a kitchen renovation, you can still deduct the interest.\n\nBut if you use the money to pay off credit card debt or student loans \u2014 or take a vacation \u2014 the interest is no longer deductible.", "title": "Interest on Home Equity Loans Is Still Deductible, but With a Big Caveat", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "Duffen said it soon became clear to him that Jarvis \u201chad not done a football transaction before, or more likely, any transaction.\u201d He said none of Jarvis\u2019 Chinese contacts ever materialized.\n\nIn a series of interviews and emails, Jarvis said his contacts with China and throughout international soccer are well known. But a close look at Jarvis\u2019 career indicates all may not be what it seems. Company records and interviews with people who have dealt with Jarvis indicate that Jarvis may have overstated his connections with some of the top figures in the sport and exaggerated his partnerships and associations with top clubs and companies \u2014 some of which have asked him to stop trading on their names.\n\nNone of that stopped him from becoming a go-to source for journalists who have been trying to make sense of a Chinese soccer spending spree that has sent cash westward after President Xi Jinping announced in 2015 he wanted to turn the country into a soccer powerhouse. Jarvis has been quoted as an expert throughout international news media reports, which has helped open doors for him and get executives to take his calls in a world where everyone is always searching for the next deal.\n\nPhoto\n\nNothing indicates that Jarvis has acted illegally. However his rise shows how someone with apparently little in the way of experience or a track record of success can forge a reputation with relative ease, especially in the largely unregulated realms of international soccer.\n\n\u201cIn the football space I\u2019ve got unlucky on a few big things, been screwed over on some things. But I\u2019ve not lied,\u201d said Jarvis, whose company, Blackbridge Cross Borders, recently posted debts of more than $60,000, according to public filings. \u201cEverything that\u2019s on the credentials and background is all real.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn annual accounts filing published by Britain\u2019s companies\u2019 register in February showed Blackbridge had just over 1,000 pounds ($1,378) in cash. Jarvis appears to be the only shareholder in the company.\n\nJarvis registered a small victory recently, playing a supporting role in a deal consummated last week. Darragh MacAnthony, the chairman of the third-division club Peterborough United, said Jarvis had introduced him to the Canadians Jason Neale and Stewart Thompson, who bought 50 percent of the club. In 2016, the most recent year for which figures are available, the club lost nearly $3 million on revenues of about $8.6 million.\n\nDavid Taylor, the former chairman of Woking F.C., a semiprofessional soccer team based near London, said Jarvis had been brokering a bid to buy the club involving undisclosed property developers. The process has gone on for months, but Taylor said he was grateful Jarvis had devoted as much time as he had \u201cto our little club\u201d given his stature in the business world.\n\nNot everyone shares Taylor\u2019s high opinion of Jarvis.\n\nBarnsley, a second-division club based in northern England, was looking for new investors last year.\n\nJarvis had established a relationship with Chien Lee, a Chinese-American businessman who owns the French club Nice and is now part of the ownership group at Barnsley. Jarvis introduced the businessman to several soccer teams in Britain. Jarvis said he also acted on behalf of the Barnsley seller Patrick Cryne, who was terminally ill at the time and died earlier this year.\n\nThe relationship grew fractious, and people close to the Cryne family accuse Jarvis of leaking information about the deal to the news media in order to boost his company\u2019s profile. Jarvis denies this, describing Cryne as a \u201cbitter man\u201d who was \u201chigh on drugs\u201d at the time. A lawyer for the Cryne family declined to comment.\n\nPaul Conway, a former investment banker and Lee\u2019s business partner in the Nice and Barnsley investments, said he had \u201ccut off all communication\u201d with Jarvis.\n\nJarvis\u2019s explanation for his unexpected rise involves a chance meeting aboard the iconic ocean liner the Queen Mary 2 when he was 20 years old. Jarvis said he left school at 16, and before he turned 20 he switched from brokering painting and decorating contracts in his native Liverpool to advising on international real-estate and mining deals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThen, according to Jarvis, he met the co-founder of one of the world\u2019s largest private equity firms \u2014 a billionaire \u2014 in the first-class lounge of the famous ocean liner. This person, whose identity he said he preferred not to reveal \u201cin case of blowback,\u201d took a shine to him and offered the opportunity to travel to China, where he could assist the firm\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cI was always in the room when they were negotiating contracts over dinners,\u201d he said.\n\nJarvis said he learned the trade and made friends with the sons and daughters of China\u2019s emerging plutocrats. Then he decided to strike out on his own. He registered Blackbridge on May 23, 2014, according to corporate documents, and soon claimed operations in more than a dozen cities across China and partner firms across the globe, from Moscow to Switzerland to the British Virgin Islands.\n\nThe company listed an array of individuals with grand titles on its website, including Sir Peter Heap, a former British ambassador to Brazil, who was listed as a \u201cspecial adviser,\u201d and Erik Brattberg, billed as \u201csenior partner and head of North America.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhen contacted, Heap said he met Jarvis in 2013. He said Jarvis, whom he described as a charming and ambitious young man, told him he had already made millions by that point and was interested in projects in Brazil. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come to anything,\u201d Heap said.\n\nJarvis declined to disclose the source or size of his wealth.\n\nBrattberg, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, connected with Jarvis via LinkedIn. He, too, said he never worked for Blackbridge or with Jarvis in any formal capacity.\n\nJarvis said he refers to \u201cpartners\u201d as people he works with on deals rather than people who are shareholders in the business. \u201cBlackbridge looks a lot bigger than it is just because of the people I\u2019m working with,\u201d he said.\n\nJarvis also posts selfies on social media with top industry figures, including Peter Kenyon, a former chief executive of the Premier League titans Manchester United and Chelsea and one of world soccer\u2019s leading executives. In one image from 2016, the men are wearing hard hats on the construction site of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s new stadium.\n\nKenyon, who now runs a soccer advisory business, said a public relations executive introduced him to Jarvis. Jarvis asked to come see the stadium when Kenyon was doing some work for the soccer team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in Madrid, he rings up and basically has a look at the new stadium, which was under construction, and it was as innocuous as that,\u201d Kenyon said. They have \u201ccertainly\u201d never done business together, he added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJarvis did arrange a meeting for the American-owned Liverpool F.C. with the solar energy company Hanergy. Nothing came of it.\n\n\u201cI got very close to doing several multimillion-pound deals with success fees,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough business.\u201d\n\nAn early version of a Blackbridge prospectus included mentions of business relationships with major soccer clubs and financial services firms. Two of those well-known entities have since distanced themselves from Jarvis.\n\nIn January, the Premier League team Tottenham requested that Jarvis remove a reference in a Blackbridge prospectus to the club\u2019s retaining him as an adviser in 2015 to secure sponsorship and financing opportunities in China. The accounting firm Deloitte also asked him to remove references to it from Blackbridge materials.\n\nStill, Jarvis continues to speak as an authority on the business of soccer to the British news media. He has been quoted dozens of times in media ranging from The Financial Times in Britain, to Canada\u2019s Globe and Mail, Bloomberg News and even the Turkish daily Milleyet. In 2017, he was quoted in an article in The New York Times.\n\nAs early as 2016, news media profiles and interviews credited Jarvis with successfully concluding soccer transactions and being one of the key middlemen in deals with Chinese interests. Reuters credited Jarvis with brokering \u201cdeals for investors like Suning Commerce Group and Citic Securities, as well as European clubs from Hull City in England to Nice in France.\u201d\n\nJarvis said he met the Nice owners after they had bought the club. A deal for Hull that he pursued on behalf of Lee, the Chinese-American businessman, never materialized. It is unclear what deals he concluded for Suning, which in 2016 acquired the Serie A soccer team Inter Milan. Jarvis declined to discuss his business with Suning.\n\nJarvis often uses his social media accounts to burnish his reputation as a jet-setting dealer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough but fun week. Deals in play. Not sure in what order to do this New York, Beijing, HK or Tampa...headed to airport,\u201d read one recent Tweet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJarvis last September captioned a picture of himself standing in front of the BBC\u2019s headquarters with the words: \u201cLooking forward to a morning of interviews.\u201d\n\nThere has been no sign of any such interviews. A BBC staff member who checked visitor logs there did not find Jarvis\u2019s name listed. Jarvis now insists he was there for a \u201cprivate meeting.\u201d\n\nA Twitter update in November reads: \u201c59 meetings in the US over the last 17 days. That\u2019s allot [sic] of follow up to be done over the next week. Exciting times! More progress made this month in US than the last 6 months in China for Blackbridge. Several new buy-side mandates received. News to follow.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Jarvis denied misrepresenting his achievements. He acknowledged making \u201cBlackbridge and myself look bigger than I currently am.\u201d\n\nWith China\u2019s money-rush into soccer slowing, Jarvis has turned his attention to the United States. He then said he has 21 deals in the works, including the sale of a Premier League club to an American investor for $700 million.\n\n", "title": "International Soccer\u2019s Man of Mystery", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"]}

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Trump\u2019s dependence on relatives with no government experience has demonstrated the corrosive effect of such nepotism: Even an incompetent in-law can reject the directions of the most experienced staff members; access \u2014 the currency of government \u2014 is unchecked; dismissal is difficult no matter how deserved; and ethical standards are near-impossible to enforce.\n\n\u201cThe public will never be made to believe that an appointment of a relative is made on the ground of merit alone, uninfluenced by family views,\u201d Thomas Jefferson warned. \u201cNor can they ever see with approbation offices, the disposal of which they entrust to their Presidents for public purposes, divided out as family property.\u201d\n\nAlmost from the beginning, presidents have struggled to reconcile this notion with their instinct to reward, and benefit from, familial loyalty. None has so blithely ignored this conflict as Mr. Trump.\n\nPublic service can certainly be a family legacy in the United States, and name recognition is crucial to successful campaigns. So voters have proved willing to accept, or to be enticed by, a candidate\u2019s family connections, from the Adamses, to the Roosevelts, to the Kennedys, to the Bushes, to the 2016 presidential primary featuring the brother and son of two former presidents and the wife of yet another. But Americans\u2019 aversion to presidential nepotism has also been deep and lasting, even as presidents have tested it.\n\nJefferson was furious when John Adams appointed his son John Quincy Adams, already an accomplished diplomat, as the nation\u2019s first minister to Prussia. While even the younger Adams objected, his father retorted, \u201cThe sons of Presidents have the Same Claim to Liberty, Equality and the benefit of the Laws with all other Citizens.\u201d\n\nUntil 1857, presidents paid for their own White House staffs, and many named relatives to these jobs. But after the assassination of James Garfield by a thwarted patronage seeker led to the creation of the Civil Service system in 1883, presidential relatives served chiefly as informal advisers and envoys because of popular revulsion with the spoils system.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Kennedy\u2019s appointment of his brother Robert as attorney general that led to the first antinepotism law, in 1967. It prohibited presidents and members of Congress from appointing or promoting relatives and spouses \u201cin or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department has cited that law in a half-dozen legal opinions that prevented Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama from appointing relatives to roles as minor as unpaid clerical assistant.\n\nIn 1972, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel opined that the law \u201cextends to any appointment to a \u2018civilian position\u2019 over which the president exercises jurisdiction or control\u201d and that \u201cit seems clearly applicable to subordinate positions on the White House staff.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department again cited the 1967 law in blocking Mr. Carter\u2019s plan to name his wife, Rosalynn, to lead a commission on mental health, even though first ladies have often been powerful informal advisers to their husbands.\n\nThen Bill Clinton pushed the boundaries between informal adviser and government employee by naming his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead a White House task force on health care. There is no public evidence he sought the Justice Department\u2019s opinion on the legality of the appointment. But when a lawsuit accused the administration of violating a federal law that requires presidential advisory committees with any nongovernmental members to make their records public, the court maintained that Mrs. Clinton was in essence a federal employee, preventing the task force from being fully subject to the disclosure law.\n\nIn a twist of history, the acceptance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s role handed her nemesis Donald Trump justification for putting his own relatives in power and running the White House like his private real estate business. In a January 2017 ruling, Daniel Koffsky, a career lawyer in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, noted that the court said that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appointment to a White House position did not violate the antinepotism law. He also said that a 1978 statute governing White House appointments granted the president \u201cspecial hiring authority,\u201d a position many ethics experts criticized.\n\nThe ruling allowed Mr. Trump to give his daughter Ivanka Trump and Mr. Kushner, her husband, White House offices and virtually unfettered access to the cabinet and world leaders.\n\nThe couple\u2019s many businesses offer foreign allies and adversaries a channel for seeking to influence American policy, fueling suspicion that the Trumps and Mr. Kushner are leveraging public office for private gain. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that officials of at least four countries have discussed ways to manipulate the inexperienced Mr. Kushner by taking advantage of his family\u2019s financial difficulties and business entanglements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner\u2019s family has tried to leverage his position, too. They broadcast his role in the administration as part of a real estate sales pitch in Beijing, touting a controversial program that grants foreigners American visas in exchange for investments in development projects. On the same day as Mr. Trump\u2019s first meeting with President Xi Jinping of China \u2014 who was serenaded by the president\u2019s grandchildren \u2014 Ms. Trump\u2019s company was awarded three trademarks in the Chinese market.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Pangoal Institution, a Beijing think tank, described the Trump White House as a tribal battleground dominated by the \u201cTrump family clan.\u201d The New Yorker quoted the think tank\u2019s assessment that the Trump family seems to \u201cdirectly influence final decisions\u201d on business and international relations in a way that \u201chas rarely been seen in the political history of the United States.\u201d The analysis used an ancient Chinese expression meaning \u201cto treat the state as your possession,\u201d a feudal concept of governance that conflicts with basic American principles.\n\nAppalling as it is, White House nepotism is only one element of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader determination to install unqualified friends, patrons and political lackeys across the government.\n\nThe founders would have dreaded a president like Mr. Trump. His behavior is a warning that ethical traditions and culture are not enough. Lawmakers need to harden some of these norms into law, to safeguard the executive branch and the public trust from future presidents eager to use America\u2019s highest office to benefit their families.", "title": "Intrigue in the House of Trump", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"]}
{"date": "2018-03-19 00:00:00", "text": "Her self-mocking nebbish is a familiar persona, but there comes a moment when she drops and deconstructs it, and that turning point makes you re-evaluate everything you saw before. \u201cDo you know what self-deprecation means coming from somebody who exists on the margins?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt is not humility; it is humiliation.\u201d\n\nThen she goes on the attack, cheerfully smashing pieties like the one about comedy being the best medicine. \u201cI reckon penicillin might give it a nudge,\u201d she says. \u201cYour baby is sick? Just give it a tickle.\u201d\n\nBreaking down comedy with mathematical precision, she explains that good stories have three parts (beginning, middle and end) while jokes require two (setup and punch line), which means that to end on a laugh, comics often need to cut off the most important and constructive element, where hindsight, perspective and catharsis exist.\n\n\u201cA joke is a question, artificially inseminated with tension,\u201d she says, before explaining the mechanics of her job. \u201cI make you all tense and then I cure it with a laugh. And you say: \u2018Thanks for that, I was feeling a bit tense.\u2019\u201d Then in one of many tonal shifts, she raises her voice, irritated at the audience\u2019s hypothetic gratitude: \u201cBut I made you tense!\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Theater Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest news, interviews and reviews from Broadway and beyond.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThen she points to the audience and back at her and quips, darkly: \u201cThis is an abusive relationship.\u201d\n\nSkepticism about comedy, which dates at least to Plato, is older than the romanticized view that prevails today, undergirding both the comics who champion it as well as critics who suggests the best jokes punch upward and are rooted in truth. Ms. Gadsby is at her most radical pushing back on this idea, explaining that funny comedy isn\u2019t always honest, and in fact rewards deception.\n\nShe said that in her homophobic town, she lived with shame that she turned into comedy, but that she paid a price. She never entirely grew out of her own self-hatred. When she retells her story without the jokes, it\u2019s bracing. By stopping at the punch line, she says, she froze \u201can incredibly formative experience at its trauma point and sealed it off with jokes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn explaining how she turned her story of coming out of the closet into a bit, she upends the clich\u00e9 of the comic who finds salvation by turning pain into laughter.\n\nThis is a show where, more than once, the performer makes the crowd laugh and laugh and, suddenly, turn deadly silent. She also nimbly leaps from personal stories to big-picture analysis, including a damning digression about Picasso, whom she calls a misogynist, citing both his own statements and an affair with a 17-year-old. After drawing attention to the silliness of discussing art history in a stand-up show, she gets serious again, saying comics have been more likely to make dismissive jokes about Monica Lewinsky or \u201cthrowaway gags\u201d about Mr. Weinstein. It\u2019s on this subject that her jokes stop and her tone becomes grave, saying we care more about the reputations of artists like Louis C.K. and Bill Cosby than their accusers.\n\nDoes that mean that \u201cNanette\u201d is no longer comedy? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nComedy is much broader than Ms. Gadsby suggests. It can double down on prejudices or challenge them. Rape jokes have shamed victims and one bit by Hannibal Buress helped kick off the backlash against Mr. Cosby. Despite Ms. Gadsby\u2019s formulaic definitions of comedy, a whole tradition, which includes Andy Kaufman and Tig Notaro and various proponents of cringe comedy, experiments with the tension-release dynamic of the setup and punch line.\n\n\u201cPeople really only feel safe when men do the angry comedy,\u201d Ms. Gadsby says. \u201cI do it and I\u2019m just an angry lesbian ruining all the fun and banter.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right that angry stand-up has long been the province of men, and that there\u2019s a double standard at work, but comedy isn\u2019t frozen in time. We\u2019re at a moment when I suspect audiences are not as interested in hearing from angry male comics, and yet the work of Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks laid the groundwork that allows us to see Ms. Gadsby\u2019s roaring polemic wrapped in jokes as firmly part of a stand-up tradition.\n\nThe best defense against Ms. Gadsby\u2019s assault on comedy is her own show \u2014 an irony she is clearly aware of, and even perhaps nods to in a tangent about the ridiculousness of gendered parenting. Instead of dressing babies in pink or blue, she proposes they all wear blue, pointing out that the color evokes a cool temperature while also being the shade of the hottest part of a flame. \u201cBlue has the flexibility to accommodate contradiction,\u201d she says.\n\nSo does great art, which is why the paradox at the heart of this remarkable show \u2014 it\u2019s a comedy arguing against comedy \u2014 actually elevates it.

Mr. Duterte won the 2016 election in a landslide on a promise to kill more criminals and eradicate drugs in Philippine society.\n\nThere is no question that drugs are a blight in the Philippines, and Mr. Duterte remains enormously popular.

Instead of solving the problems, miners use computers to submit a flood of guesses. This can be lucrative: Each Bitcoin is currently valued at about $10,550.\n\nBelievers insist it is a worthwhile endeavor. They describe Bitcoin as a superior currency that will eventually come into wide use, and they predict even broader applications for blockchains, the digital bookkeeping method used to record ownership of Bitcoins and to verify transactions.\n\nBut Bitcoin remains so hard to use that a major Bitcoin conference in January had to stop accepting Bitcoin. It is, in practice, a speculative investment, like gold. And Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University, said mining gold was a better use of resources, because even if it lost value, it could be used to fill teeth.\n\n\u201cOnce the Bitcoin power is burned, it is never coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nColin L.

He is the only employee of his company, and he is presently a full-time medical student on the Caribbean island of Grenada. But Bitcoin mining paid his college tuition and it is paying for medical school.\n\nAnd he doesn\u2019t see that Plattsburgh has better options.\n\n\u201cThe place needs all the jobs they can get,\u201d he said, although his company employs no one beyond him. He does pay fees to an investor-owned company that operates and maintains the machines and has one employee.\n\nOther governments also are grappling with the merits of virtual currencies. Enel, the largest European power company, said earlier this month it would not sell electricity to a virtual miner, citing environmental concerns.\n\n\u201cEnel has undertaken a clear path toward decarbonization and sustainable development and sees the intensive use of energy dedicated to cryptocurrency mining as an unsustainable practice that does not fit with the business model it is pursuing,\u201d the company, partly owned by the Italian government, said in a statement.\n\nSome Bitcoin miners emphasize their reliance on renewable energy, but the energy they use might otherwise be put to other purposes. Consider the example of Quebec, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of hydroelectric power. Local demand has flatlined, leading the province to consider exporting electricity to Massachusetts, which is seeking to increase the share of current power consumption generated by sustainable sources. But Quebec is now weighing that possibility alongside a wave of proposals from mining companies.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome American utilities, too, are hungry for new customers. Domestic demand for electricity is in decline as power-hungry industries, like aluminum smelting, have moved to other countries and households are increasingly using LED light bulbs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re thankful that anyone still wants to use energy,\u201d said Robert McCullough of McCullough Research, an Oregon energy consultancy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd plenty of places are hungry for jobs \u2014 even the relatively few jobs that virtual mining brings.\n\nMassena, the town with the shuttered smelter, is about two hours from Plattsburgh. It also enjoys a guaranteed supply of cheap electricity, but it has lost several of its major employers, including the smelter and a General Motors factory.\n\nThe New York Power Authority reserves 490 megawatts of low-cost power for industrial users in Franklin, Jefferson and St. Lawrence counties, the northern tier that includes Massena. The decline of local industry means only 52 percent of that power is currently committed, which is why officials were delighted when a company called Coinmint proposed to install 16,000 computers in the old aluminum building.\n\nThe company, which is still negotiating contracts, told the power authority it would employ 150 people. Employers historically have created 30.5 jobs in exchange for each megawatt of low-cost electricity, according to the power authority, while Coinmint is proposing to create just new 10 jobs per megawatt. But 10 is more than none.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to get anybody here that you can,\u201d said Steven D.

Do you think it is a place children should be allowed to play? Why or why not?\n\nIn \u201cIn Britain\u2019s Playgrounds, \u2018Bringing in Risk\u2019 to Build Resilience,\u201d Ellen Barry writes:\n\nEducators in Britain, after decades spent in a collective effort to minimize risk, are now, cautiously, getting into the business of providing it. Four years ago, for instance, teachers at the Richmond Avenue Primary and Nursery School looked critically around their campus and set about, as one of them put it, \u201cbringing in risk.\u201d Out went the plastic playhouses and in came the dicey stuff: stacks of two-by-fours, crates and loose bricks. The schoolyard got a mud pit, a tire swing, log stumps and workbenches with hammers and saws. \u201cWe thought, how can we bring that element of risk into your everyday environment?\u201d said Leah Morris, who manages the early years program at the school in Shoeburyness in southeast Britain. \u201cWe were looking at, O.K., so we\u2019ve got a sand pit, what can we add to the sand pit to make it more risky?\u201d Now, Ms. Morris says proudly, \u201cwe have fires, we use knives, saws, different tools,\u201d all used under adult supervision. Indoors, scissors abound, and so do sharp-edged tape dispensers (\u201cthey normally only cut themselves once,\u201d she says). Limited risks are increasingly cast by experts as an experience essential to childhood development, useful in building resilience and grit.

But what if those workings, and the conflicts behind them, are precisely what we should be meddling with and arguing over?\n\nThe difference between a process and any old series of events is that a process is designed to lead to an outcome.

It\u2019s not that the students are hopeless. They are dedicating their lives to social change. It\u2019s just that they have trouble naming institutions that work.

As a default, I\u2019ll venture, the therapist should reveal the existence of this communication. A relation of trust with your therapist depends on believing that he or she will be honest with you about such matters. It might be all right to tell you that the letter had come and that, because your wife wrote in confidence, you needed to ask her what she said. But telling you nothing could reasonably be seen as a betrayal.\n\nI\u2019ll leave for the therapy profession the question of whether what your wife\u2019s therapist did was consistent with professional norms. What puzzles me is your sense that the situation was made worse by the fact that your therapists work out of the same office. Why would it have been better if the therapists were strangers?\n\nAll these considerations are less than pressing, though, given that your wife has informed you about the letter and will share its contents with you.

She has made it clear to her father that she will not accept them, and when they have been sent to her directly, she has sent them back. The problem is that he enlists my other child to bring the gifts to her. She is further upset that he would put her sibling in this difficult situation.\n\nTo bring the gifts back to my ex-husband would likely incite his ire, which is something I don\u2019t want directed at my child, or create other drama, which I would like to avoid. I have suggested that we donate these gifts to charity; she agreed this would be fine.\n\nI know that another option would be for my other child to refuse to deliver the gifts, but I understand better than most how difficult my ex-husband can be.

So if she says you can give them to charity, you can. And if she wants to tell him what\u2019s happening, she can. Both of these things are up to her.\n\nMy job recently moved its headquarters to an open-plan workplace. I now sit about three feet away from a man, my peer, who is a well-respected veteran of my trade and a hard worker. I am about three decades his junior. Recently I caught him dozing off at his desk momentarily, then waking up, resuming work and then dozing off again. I\u2019ve seen him nod off more than 20 times in an hour. I\u2019ve read that nodding off throughout the day is a risk factor for stroke and other major cardiovascular events. I do not want to alert my bosses for fear they might retaliate against him in some way. I\u2019m also afraid of hurting his feelings, embarrassing him or making him angry with me.

Telling him outside the office in a conversation with just the two of you will probably make things easier. I can see that he might be embarrassed \u2014 which will be easier to handle without company \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t make much sense to be angry. You\u2019re simply demonstrating a concern for his health. And even if he was angered, he\u2019s got good reason not to alienate you, given that, as you acknowledge, you could have taken this up with his supervisor.

If you fear that telling him what you\u2019ve noticed might harm your relationship with him, I suppose you could just leave him an anonymous note.

Nesheim, emeritus professor of nutrition at Cornell University, who chaired an Institute of Medicine committee assessing the risks and benefits of seafood in the early 2000s. \u201cI\u2019ve been an omega-3 skeptic since doing this study.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, large population studies with solid data both on the participants\u2019 diets and causes of disease and death bolstered the beliefs that eating fish often was a heart-healthy practice linked to reduced rates of cardiovascular disease. For example, a comprehensive analysis conducted by Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian and Eric Rimm of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that eating two servings of fatty fish a week \u2014 equal to about two grams of omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 lowered the risk of death from heart disease by more than a third and total deaths by 17 percent.\n\nOmega-3s in fish clearly have effects that can account for such findings. They protect against abnormal heart rhythms, lower blood pressure and heart rate and improve the function of blood vessels. They may also lower heart-damaging triglycerides and counter inflammation, a known risk to the heart.\n\nThe question is whether the observed cardiovascular benefits often found among fish eaters is due solely to the oils in fish or to some other characteristics of seafood or to still other factors common to those who eat lots of fish, like eating less meat or pursuing a healthier lifestyle over all. Whatever the answer, it does not seem to be fish oil supplements.\n\nIn the latest report, published online on Jan. 31 in JAMA Cardiology, an international team headed by Dr. Robert Clarke of the University of Oxford analyzed the combined results of 10 trials of fish oil supplements involving 77,917 older adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nAt doses ranging from 226 milligrams to 1,800 milligrams per day of omega-3 fatty acids, no significant protection against \u201cmajor vascular events\u201d was found overall among the participants or for any subgroup, like those with prior heart disease or diabetes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(At the moment, I\u2019m still doing both.)\n\nFor example, large predatory fish like shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish and albacore tuna can contain high levels of methyl mercury, a toxin that would override any health benefit, especially for the developing brains of fetuses and young children as well as for adults, Dr. Nesheim and Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, noted in 2014 in an editorial in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. (Levels of mercury and other contaminants in fish have since declined somewhat but are not negligible.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever, in both observational studies and controlled clinical trials, eating fish was shown to foster optimal development of a baby\u2019s brain and nervous system, prompting advice that pregnant women and nursing mothers eat more fish rich in omega-3s while avoiding species that may contain mercury or other contaminants like PCBs sometimes found in freshwater fish.\n\nAnother concern is the environmental cost that could result if people ate more fish, given that \u201cmany ocean fisheries are fully exploited or are in decline,\u201d Drs. Nesheim and Nestle wrote. \u201cIn the face of limited supplies,\u201d they added, the price of seafood would likely be \u201cout of the reach of many consumers.\u201d\n\nThe declining supplies and rising costs of wild-caught fish have spawned a worldwide explosion of fish farming, which also has its downsides. For example, marine organisms used to feed farmed fish can diminish this vital food supply for wild stock, and fish that escape from farms may change the gene pool of wild fish.\n\nHowever, if the cost of wild fish is a concern, farmed salmon typically has as much or more omega-3s as wild-caught salmon, which can be three times as expensive.\n\nCurrently, fewer than one person in five in this country eats fish at least twice a week, as recommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and by the American Heart Association, among others. Fish, after all, are high in protein, low in saturated fat and contain beneficial nutrients like vitamin D and selenium.\n\nOther suspected health benefits of omega-3s and fish are less well established and need further study. They include suggestions of a reduced risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer and possibly advanced prostate cancer, all related to eating fish rather than taking supplements. Some observational studies have associated omega-3s to a lower risk of cognitive decline, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia, as well as age-related macular degeneration.\n\nAlso not firmly established is the protective value of plant sources of omega-3s: alpha-linolenic acid found in flax seeds, walnuts and some vegetable oils, which could be an option for vegetarians and people allergic to fish.", "title": "Is It Time to Give Up on Fish Oil?", "authors": ["Jane E.

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it welcomes the easing of tensions. But experts have said that Beijing would want to make sure that any negotiations protect its interests.\n\nNorth Korea depends heavily on China for trade, food, energy and a degree of protection from even tougher international sanctions. But the North has bristled at the idea that it is beholden to China. And Chinese officials and many experts say that China\u2019s influence over North Korea is more limited and brittle than Mr. Trump and other Western leaders seem to believe.\n\nFrom 2003, Beijing hosted six-party talks which brought together North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, Russia and China to seek an agreement on ending the North\u2019s nuclear program. But the talks foundered after 2009. More recently, Beijing has proposed that North Korea suspend its nuclear and missile tests in return for the United States and South Korea suspending major joint military exercises.", "title": "Is Kim Jong-un Visiting Beijing?

Born in 1934 to an affluent Jewish family, Cohen descended from the hills of his rarefied Westmount neighborhood to play country music in Montreal\u2019s gritty downtown cafes when he was only a teenager. He became part of an avant-garde Montreal literary circle and would recite his poetry at jazz clubs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile he lived part of his life in New York, London, the Greek island of Hydra and Los Angeles, Cohen observed that \u201cI have to keep coming back to Montreal to renew my neurotic affiliations.\u201d He kept a home near Boulevard Saint-Laurent, a vibrant immigrant street where Cohen-spotting was a favorite pastime at local delis.\n\nNeighbors say they would see him on the porch of his handsome but unostentatious triplex in Plateau-Mont-Royal, a shabby-chic neighborhood peppered with graffiti, designer furniture shops, dive bars and pastel-painted houses; he was unfailingly polite and usually holding a notepad.\n\n\u201cLeonard loved the narrow streets near the harbor and the working class Montreal Jewish neighborhoods of Mordecai Richler novels,\u201d Sylvie Simmons, who wrote a biography of Cohen, said. \u201cHe lived his whole life away but he never left.\u201d\n\nThe city helped fuel his music and poetry, including his song \u201cSuzanne,\u201d about the dancer Suzanne Verdal, with whom he would stroll around the Old Port in Montreal, a romantic quarter where the sound of horse-drawn carriages clunk-clunking over cobblestones provides an urban rhythm. The lyrics, \u201cAnd the sun pours down like honey/On Our Lady of the Harbor,\u201d allude to a statue of the Virgin Mary that crowns the 18th-century Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a city consumed by culture wars over language, Cohen\u2019s music proved a unifying elixir. Following the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, when many Francophone Quebecers sought to break free from the Catholic Church and Anglophone domination, Cohen was nevertheless embraced across the linguistic divide.\n\nIt didn\u2019t hurt that he sometimes sang in French and his meditations on love, the sacred and the profane found particular resonance in a libertine city formed by the Catholic Church it had revolted against.\n\nJean-Pierre Ducharme, 68, a retired Quebecois army officer, who is featured in the Candice Breitz piece, recalled discovering Cohen at 17. He didn\u2019t understand the lyrics, but the poetic reverie was so hypnotic that it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about politics or ideology but because of the beauty of his music.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe melancholy that suffused Cohen\u2019s work also had echoes in Montreal\u2019s endless winters, Kevin Ledo, the 39-year-old artist behind the Cohen mural in Plateau-Mont-Royal, noted. When spring finally arrives, the city bursts with color and unwrapped bodies, a transformation captured by the sensual euphoria of Cohen\u2019s lyrics. \u201cThere is a yearning, a feeling of unrequited love in his music that is somehow very Montreal,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nCohen, a humble man, might have been embarrassed by the sometimes cultish reverence.\n\nEdward Singer, 71, a retired businessman, wrote a novel based on \u201cSuzanne,\u201d and displays over his desk a photoshopped image of himself and his idol with Cohen\u2019s arm lovingly draped around his shoulder.\n\n\u201cHe was a one of a kind, a Jew from the Anglo community in Montreal who became beloved across the world,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people ask, What would Jesus do?

He returned for last month\u2019s Australian Open with a revamped, abbreviated service motion designed to relieve pressure on the elbow and showed flashes of fine form before eventually losing in straight sets to Hyeon Chung in the fourth round.\n\nAfter that defeat, he decided to undergo a medical procedure on his elbow in Switzerland \u2014 one that the 30-year-old Djokovic has yet to explain in detail. But he did say on Sunday that he initially did not expect to be ready to play in Indian Wells but recovered more quickly than anticipated.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about reinjuring the elbow against Daniel, Djokovic said, \u201cnot really.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBut obviously having played only a couple matches in nine months, you are still in a way battling inside of your mind whether you are fit or not,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cAnd even though you don\u2019t have pain, you are still thinking about it because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been feeling and dragging for over two years.\u201d\n\nClearly, comebacks from extended layoffs are nowhere near as smooth as Roger Federer has made his look since he returned in 2017 after a six-month break to heal his postoperative knee. He continues to roll and on Sunday in the second-round match that followed Djokovic\u2019s, he finished off his two-day 6-3, 7-6 (6) victory over Federico Delbonis, saving a set point in the second-set tiebreaker.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "Today, however, the world economy looks much more like it did in the 1920s than in the depressed \u201930s. Unemployment and inflation are low, growth is reasonably strong, inequality is back to levels last hit in the 1920s, and the mood is shifting against globalization. Still, the clamor for protection could grow significantly in intensity.\n\nThe obvious concern: If Mr. Trump is pushing tariffs during good times, just imagine what he might do if the times turn bad. That\u2019s when governments normally become even more protectionist, and this administration is already moving in that direction. The decision by Mr. Cohn, the head the National Economic Council and a staunch defender of free trade, to leave the administration is clear evidence of the trend.\n\nThe next chapter in this period of deglobalization may revolve around how Mr. Trump deals with China. If the world\u2019s two largest economies fall into a spiral of tit-for-tat retaliation, the global trend toward trade protection could pick up pace. China is a minor supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States but a major supplier of much else.\n\nIn the global financial markets, many observers are thus less concerned about the steel tariffs than about the Section 301 investigation launched by the Trump administration against China, which goes well beyond earlier investigations into illegal subsidies for export manufacturers and other stealth trade protection. Instead, the 301 investigation \u2014 named after the section of the Trade Act of 1974 that gives the president great leeway to address trade issues \u2014 is a broad look at Chinese practices such as investing in American companies to steal technology, penetrating American data networks and lifting technology from American companies that invest in China.\n\nIn short, the current controversy over steel and aluminum tariffs involves old industries that are shrinking as a share of the global economy and affect about 2 percent of global trade. Even if Mr. Trump\u2019s suggested new tariffs provoke Chinese retaliation in these industries, it would have a manageable impact. A broader trade conflict involving newer sectors such as technology, or that leads to restrictions on foreign investment, could be much more damaging.\n\nOf course, this is not the first time in the postwar era that an American president has resorted to trade protectionism. Richard Nixon fought his 1968 election campaign on a mercantilist platform. Both Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush imposed trade tariffs. The difference then was that America exercised more dominance over the global economy and had greater reason to believe it could squeeze concessions from trading partners. Rising powers such as China are not likely to be as compliant now, and even allies in Europe seem to feel less obliged to placate America.\n\nRegardless of how far Mr. Trump goes in pressing tariffs against both rivals and allies, it is important to remember that this is not the beginning of the story, or the end. We are somewhere in the middle. The seeds of discontent against globalization were sown following a period of intensive trade and migration that culminated in the financial crisis of 2008. The age of deglobalization is now a worldwide phenomenon that is larger than Mr. Trump. It was coming whether he won election or not. And it is unlikely to end until long after he is gone.", "title": "Opinion | Is Trump About to Start a Trade War?", "authors": []}

We don\u2019t know yet how much his leadership will erode support for democracy among his loyal base, but without powerful conservative voices offering an alternative vision of what it means to be a Republican, it\u2019s unlikely that most Trump voters will push back on his illiberal impulses on their own.\n\nWe worry what might happen if Mr. Trump stokes well-honed Republican concerns about voter fraud as the November midterm elections approach. If Republicans lose the House or the Senate based on a few close contests, will Mr. Trump challenge the results and encourage his partisan supporters to do the same? At the very least, Mr. Trump\u2019s continued anti-system, illiberal appeals, which surface whenever he campaigns, continue to energize his base (his recent performance in Pennsylvania is a good example).\n\nThe highly polarized state of our two-party system accentuates the danger. If Mr. Trump transgresses more seriously against democratic norms, many Republicans might go along with him simply out of distrust of or enmity toward the Democrats. And many others might simply disengage from politics, unhappy with either alternative and deeply frustrated with the whole political system. This creates its own set of problems, since we also find (like many before us) that those who are most disengaged from politics are no great lovers of democracy.\n\nStill, to return to the good news for a moment: Public support for democracy as a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d system has returned to a historic high in the past two decades (86 percent), as has the proportion (82 percent) attaching great importance to living in a democracy.\n\nWe don\u2019t take our good news as cause for comfort. The lesson we draw from our data \u2014 and from the current global democratic recession \u2014 is that democracy is not self-sustaining. It depends on public commitment to its essential values: pluralism, mutual respect and tolerance, flexibility, critical thinking and a willingness to compromise.\n\nThese must be renewed with every generation through civic education.

It did not estimate expenses, but start-up costs for congestion zones in London, Singapore and Stockholm were between $110 million and $237 million, according to an analysis.\n\nPeter Ajemian, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said Mr. Cuomo was not committed to any specific technology and continuing negotiations with the State Legislature \u201cinclude discussions about funding and technology.\u201d\n\nTechnology is the backbone of congestion pricing, providing the tools for a market-based approach long espoused by economists and urban planners. The basic idea is that charging a fee at peak traffic times can influence driver behavior so not everyone ends up on the same spit of asphalt, in the same way that hotels and airlines raise prices during holidays to manage limited inventories. With the inception of electronic tolling in the United States in 1989, there was finally a convenient way to do that with roads, said Ginger Goodin, a senior research engineer at Texas A & M Transportation Institute.\n\n\u201cAll of that theory has always been there, but it wasn\u2019t until we had electronic toll collection that we began to see some of these projects take off,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\nThroughout the country, the fees are typically charged using E-ZPass or a similar system of electronic readers mounted on overhead gantries to communicate with transponders or stickers with smart chips placed inside vehicles, Ms. Goodin said. License-plate cameras enable vehicles without transponders to be billed by mail.\n\nOne of the earliest uses of congestion pricing was on California\u2019s car-clogged freeways. In 1995, tolled express lanes were built alongside regular lanes on 10 miles of State Road 91 in Orange County; last year, another eight miles were added in adjoining Riverside County. The pre-scheduled tolls range from $1.60 to $10.15 in Orange County, and from $1.45 to $15.90 in Riverside County, with the higher prices at busier times.\n\nDarrell E. Johnson, chief executive officer of the Orange County Transportation Authority, said express lanes had shaved up to 30 minutes off commutes, and also helped reduce congestion in the regular lanes. The tolls have generated millions of dollars \u2014 a record $41.4 million for his county alone in 2017 \u2014 that have helped pay for improvements to the highway as well as to public transit. \u201cEven if drivers choose to never pay for the express lanes,\u201d he said, \u201cthey still receive benefits from those who do use them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese so-called price-managed lanes have spread to 42 highways in 11 states, including Texas, Georgia and Virginia, according to Pat Jones, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, an industry group. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart way to help people get where they\u2019re going and alleviate congestion,\u201d Mr. Jones said.\n\nIncreasingly, many tolled lanes use real-time congestion pricing with fees adjusted every few minutes using algorithms that reflect traffic conditions, Mr. Jones said. The fees are usually posted on signs or websites so that drivers know what they will pay.\n\nThe 11-mile MoPac Express Lanes in Austin, Tex., employ real-time pricing to manage the number of drivers entering the lanes. The tolls, from 25 cents to $10.13, have generated more than $1.7 million since October to help cover the cost and maintenance of the lanes.

The proposal for a Manhattan congestion zone has drawn worldwide interest.\n\nRick Geddes, a professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University, and Peter Cramton, a professor of economics at the University of Maryland and the University of Cologne, said new technologies could create a comprehensive congestion-pricing system for a city or region that would charge varying fees for using all the roads \u2014 not just targeted highway lanes or neighborhoods \u2014 so that drivers do not simply pile onto free roads and cause traffic jams elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Geddes said the proposed Manhattan congestion zone was a step in this direction, though it was still \u201cat a very basic level.\u201d\n\nBut Samuel I. Schwartz, a task force member and traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, said New York could not afford to wait for developing technologies that could take years to perfect. He added that once a congestion zone was in place, other technologies could be explored to enable real-time pricing or fees based on time and mileage. \u201cWe have our hands full just getting across the finish line,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis now so we need something fast.\u201d\n\nThe advantage of E-ZPass is that it is a known quantity. Last year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority converted all nine of its bridges and tunnels to an open-road, cashless tolling system using E-ZPass. It spent about $80 million on technology, including building gantries to mount the latest generation of E-ZPass readers and license-plate cameras.\n\nThe transition has not been without issues. Some drivers have complained about glitches in cashless tolling, saying they were not aware that payments did not go through until they received hefty late fines in the mail; in response, the M.T.A. has forgiven some of the violations. An audit by Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, has also raised questions about the authority\u2019s ability to collect unpaid tolls and fines.\n\nM.T.A. officials said there had been relatively few problems overall, and the result had been fewer chokepoints and shorter commutes, with drivers saving an average of 20 hours over a year. Even though E-ZPass is not new, \u201cit\u2019s pretty tried and true and reliable,\u201d said Cedrick Fulton, president of M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels.\n\nThe $6.6-million Midtown in Motion program relies on 60 E-ZPass readers \u2014 resembling rectangular pizza boxes \u2014 that work with traffic cameras and motion sensors to monitor more than 350 blocks traveled by an average of 700,000 vehicles a day. The E-ZPass signals are scrambled so vehicles cannot be identified.\n\nJohn Tipaldo, an associate deputy commissioner for traffic operations, said that without this automated system \u201cit would be a higher level of congestion and spread out in more areas than before.\u201d\n\nStill, some critics point out that a congestion zone built on E-ZPass would require far more infrastructure \u2014 readers, gantries, license-plate cameras \u2014 on already cluttered streets. Hugh O\u2019Neill, a consultant on transportation issues, said that would be inefficient and impractical.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can have E-ZPass readers everywhere \u2014 which you would need,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI think the answer in the long run is sensors and GPS technology. We\u2019re not far away from having a more sophisticated system for charging trips.\u201d", "title": "Is Your E-ZPass the Key to Congestion Pricing?", "authors": ["Winnie Hu"]}

No? Neither did the novelist Brad Meltzer, who discovered it while he was filming an episode of his cable TV show, \u201cLost History,\u201d at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. \u201cThey were giving me a tour and showing me their art collection,\u201d he says. \u201cI kept thinking, \u2018Why does the Army have all this art?\u2019\u201d Meltzer, an enthusiastic researcher, soon discovered that \u201csince World War I, the Army has assigned at least one person \u2014 an actual artist \u2014 whom they send out in the field to, well \u2026 paint what couldn\u2019t otherwise be seen.

In this world, where so much of the government is a mess, Dover is the one place that does it absolutely right,\u201d Meltzer says. \u201cIt is the one no-fail mission in the military. When a soldier\u2019s body comes home, you don\u2019t mess it up.\u201d The most interesting thing he learned there, which he obviously incorporated into the novel, was also the oddest: \u201cWhen your plane is going down and about to crash, if you write a farewell note and eat it, the liquids in your stomach can help the note survive the crash.

The Workologist is a guy with well-intentioned opinions, not a professional career adviser. Letters may be edited.\n\nI have worked for the same large company for 12 years, ever since entering my current field. It\u2019s a great company and the job is mostly fulfilling, but it can also be stressful. There is a lot of travel (weekends included), which puts a strain on my personal relationships. And while management talks about work-life balance, the true workaholics are rewarded with bonuses. I recently took about six weeks off for some minor surgery. This was the first real break from work travel since joining the company. I really enjoyed working from my home office, spending more time with family and friends. I felt relaxed and energized. Now I am back on the road again and having a hard time. I am sleeping poorly, have developed migraines and find that the multiple demands on my time make me anxious. At my own request, I am working on a project I thought would get me more home-office time, but it just added to my travel schedule. I am working evenings and weekends to catch up. I am in my mid 50s, and if I keep it up, I can retire in about eight years \u2014 but worry about my physical and mental health holding out. My position is very specialized, so I don\u2019t think there is another job at this company that I can transfer to. I don\u2019t want to return to the field I left. I think it is too late and too expensive to go back to school. What to do? ANONYMOUS\n\nThis strikes me as an extreme example of what I suspect is a widespread issue. We could call it The Home Stretch Problem: The finish line of retirement is in sight, but getting there is going to be unpleasant at best. Is it better to risk making a change that could improve your work life \u2014 or to grit your teeth and ride it out?\n\nMike Lewis, author of the recent book, \u201cWhen To Jump: If the Job You Have Isn\u2019t the Life You Want,\u201d offers some useful thoughts, drawn from his conversations with dozens of people who have switched careers at some point in their work lives. It\u2019s possible, he concedes, that a particular job might be so specialized, or perhaps tied to a lucrative \u201cgolden handcuffs\u201d situation, that sticking with the shortest road to retirement makes sense.\n\nBut, Mr. Lewis continues, while it\u2019s easy to convince yourself that you have no options, that\u2019s probably more rare than you think \u2014 and it\u2019s worth putting your assumption to the test. Look for \u201cwiggle room,\u201d as he puts it: Be open-mind and creative about how your skills could be applied to positions that may not be a perfect match, but that have some overlap.\n\nThis means considering what could be more of a lateral move, or even a minor step back \u2014 maybe putting you ten years from retirement instead of eight. \u201cTen years is going to feel like five if it\u2019s something you prefer doing,\u201d Mr. Lewis argues. \u201cAnd eight years is going to feel like 16 if you\u2019re stuck doing what you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d", "title": "Is a Late-Career Change Worth It?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "When I mentioned Murnane\u2019s bartending to his old friend Imre Salusinszky, a journalist in Sydney, he paused, then said: \u201cYeah, look, it\u2019s bizarre. Somebody\u2019s going to come to this godforsaken dry golf course and order a beer from a person who could be the winner of the next Nobel Prize for Literature?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThen again, for Murnane, who once expressed regret at not having simply allowed \u201cdiscerning editors to publish all my pieces of writing as essays,\u201d the author is always present in the text, and so for the enterprising scholar, there\u2019s arguably legitimate hermeneutic value in buying a Carlton from the subject of your dissertation. Murnane\u2019s life, his fiction and the landscape he inhabits \u2014 the beauty and isolation of the Victorian interior, calm seas of yellow grassland that conjure schoolbook images of the veld \u2014 are so inextricably entwined that to visit him in Goroke feels at once like a field trip and a close reading.\n\nA few weeks after my own journey to Goroke had been arranged, but before I had left for Australia, I heard from a publicist at Murnane\u2019s American publishing house: Could I send Gerald a text message? (After Murnane moved to Goroke, his sons insisted he violate one of the other longstanding strictures laid out in the Newcastle speech and purchase a cellular telephone.) Murnane was concerned because he hadn\u2019t received word from me. I\u2019d assumed, incorrectly, that he wouldn\u2019t want to be bothered by a journalist unless necessary. But five minutes after I sent him a quick introductory note, I received a long reply. It began: \u201cVery pleased to hear from you. I promise you abundant material. I have a reputation in some quarters as an aloof recluse but that\u2019s only because I refuse to go to writers\u2019 festivals and talk the fake-intellectual [expletive] that most writers talk. I\u2019m wholly different and original and also affable and friendly when I\u2019m with genuine unpretentious folk such as the old guys I play golf with every week.\u201d After dispatching some scheduling questions, he ended the message, \u201cOnce again, I promise you an interview unlike any you\u2019ve done before.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one of my favorite Murnane stories, \u201cPrecious Bane,\u201d published in 1985, the narrator, an aspiring writer who worries about becoming an alcoholic, browses unhappily in a used bookstore. He carries around a list of authors in a notebook labeled \u201c1900-1940 ... Unjustly Neglected\u201d and worries about his own legacy \u2014 a bit prematurely, as he hasn\u2019t published anything yet. Then, because it\u2019s Murnane, the plot, such as it is, turns inward, as the protagonist pictures a scene far in the future: the year 2020. (The story is set in 1980.) In his mind, he sees a man standing before a wall of bookshelves, gazing at the spine of the last remaining copy of a novel composed 40 years earlier. The man has read the book, but he\u2019s struggling to remember a single detail from the text, anything, a line, an image. (This is a favorite exercise of the real-life Murnane.) An odd five-page digression follows, in which the narrator imagines the human brain as a Carthusian monastery, with monks in charge of preserving memories. Eventually, he returns to the imagined future reader, who has failed to recall anything from what is, of course, the narrator\u2019s book: \u201cThe man fills his glass again and goes on sipping some costly poison of the twenty-first century. He does not understand the importance of his forgetfulness, but I understand it. I know that no one now remembers anything of my writing.\u201d\n\nHappily, though we\u2019re only two years shy of his imagined dystopia, the Goroke symposium took place in the context of a belated surge of interest in Murnane\u2019s work. Here in the United States, Murnane\u2019s publishing history was spotty to nonexistent until Dalkey Archive, a small literary press, released his novel \u201cBarley Patch\u201d in 2011. This month, Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish \u201cStream System,\u201d Murnane\u2019s collected short fiction, and a new novel, \u201cBorder Districts.\u201d\n\nThe trickiness of categorizing Murnane\u2019s work goes some way toward explaining why he\u2019s not a household name, even among households with lots of books. Is he an outsider artist or a postmodern master? Both? Neither? As much as Murnane reveres Proust, his own elaborate memory palaces remain a genre unto themselves. On a sentence level, Murnane adheres to a militant grammatical precision and engages in repetition that verges on the incantatory (and that privileges the noun over the pronoun). It\u2019s a hypnotic style, dryly funny, or at least aware of the ways in which its fussiness might be amusing. In 1990, The London Review of Books published a cranky letter from Murnane that read, in full: \u201cDear Editors, Frank Kermode quotes what he calls a very long sentence from Thomas Pynchon (LRB, 8 Feb, 90). The passage quoted is not a sentence. The passage consists of a sentence of 66 words followed by a comma and then a sequence of clauses and phrases that is neither a part of the sentence preceding it nor a sentence in itself.\u201d\n\nMurnane once described himself as a \u201ctechnical writer\u201d \u2014 meaning, he explained, that in his depictions of \u201cthe mental imagery that is my only available subject-matter,\u201d he strove for the rigor and precision of a white paper. (He often refers to his stories as reports.) I\u2019d say he\u2019s more like a detective, pacing in front of a gigantic evidence board. A typical Murnane work of fiction unfolds like a procedural, often spinning out from a single, half-remembered image, something as simple as a jockey\u2019s racing colors, as glimpsed on a youthful outing to the track in Bendigo, a city in Victoria. Other memories will follow \u2014 anecdotes, personal asides, funny or sad little stories within the story \u2014 and it can all seem digressive, until the methodical obsessiveness of Murnane\u2019s self-interrogation becomes clear. He\u2019s searching the furthest reaches of his memory for clues, hidden meanings, details that might have slipped away. The digressions turn out to be leads. And in the end, there\u2019s no writing-workshop epiphany, but rather that thrilling moment when the circles and arrows linking up the photographs thumbtacked to the squad-room wall form a previously unseen web of connection.\n\nFor newcomers, the wide-ranging \u201cStream System\u201d is the place to begin. Some of the stories assume more recognizable forms \u2014 for instance, the entire history of Australian colonialism becomes a concise, Borgesian parable about desire in \u201cLand Deal.\u201d Most of the other pieces feature self-conscious narrators who compulsively draw readerly attention to the text (\u201cBoy Blue\u201d begins \u201cA few weeks ago, the person writing this story read aloud to a gathering of persons another story that he had written\u201d) and could be read as fragmented, expressionistic memoirs in miniature. In \u201cVelvet Waters,\u201d the subject is failed romance; in one of the story\u2019s funnier episodes, the shy, Murnane-like narrator tries to impress a love interest by telling her about a weekend trip to an art movie \u2014 unfortunately, it\u2019s Ingmar Bergman\u2019s \u201cThe Virgin Spring,\u201d and he ends up going into great detail about the rape sequence. \u201cCotters Come No More\u201d is a tribute to a complicated relationship with a favorite bachelor uncle who, in a lovely bit of imagery at the opening of the story, traps a fly under a glass, tosses it into a spider web \u201cand then stands with his hands on his hips, observing.\u201d Later, the teenage narrator recalls walks with his uncle on the family land, where\n\nthe chief event of the afternoon might have been his sitting down beside me on a hilltop, taking out of his trousers pocket the folded form-guide from The Age, pointing to a certain name among the fields of horses, and then fiddling with his wireless until I was just able to hear, above the crackle of static and the buzzing of insects in the grass, the call of a race more than a hundred miles away with the horse that my uncle had brought to my notice in the thick of the finish.\n\nIn a long appreciation in his recent collection of essays, Coetzee praised Murnane\u2019s \u201cchiseled sentences,\u201d placing him among of the last generation of Australian writers to come to maturity when the country \u201cwas still a cultural colony of England, repressed, puritanical and suspicious of foreigners.\u201d Murnane\u2019s Australianness comes through most clearly in \u201cThe Plains\u201d \u2014 considered his masterpiece by many \u2014 which follows an artist seeking patronage from wealthy landowners in a mysterious frontier town, hoping to film the unfilmable secrets of the titular landscape. The world Murnane describes is a dream-country, where battles are waged between rival schools of artists (the Horizonites and the Haremen) and coastal condescension is flipped on its head as the vast, unloved interior becomes a place of rich and bedeviling obscurity, where landowners in their baronial estates \u201cpity the poor coast-dwellers staring all day from their cheerless beaches at the worst of all deserts\u201d and express bafflement with \u201ctheir awe at a mere absence of land.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen I spoke to Salusinszky, a former professor of English who published a monograph on Murnane with Oxford University Press in 1993, he brought up the story \u201cPrecious Bane,\u201d which is also included in \u201cStream System,\u201d pointing out that the title is a phrase used by Milton to describe money, something \u201cwe need to get the things we want.\u201d Salusinszky went on, \u201cI think for Gerald writing is a kind of precious bane. It\u2019s a burden and a nuisance, almost a duty, having to explore the connections between the images in his mind. And he keeps telling us that he has done his duty, that this is it. But of course, to use, if you\u2019ll forgive me, Derridean language, there\u2019s always a supplement. There\u2019s always an appendix. There\u2019s always something left unsaid.\u201d\n\nMy first day in Goroke, Murnane instructed me to pick him up at the local Men\u2019s Shed, housed in a former bank. For the non-Australian reader, a quick explanation: A men\u2019s shed is a communal workshop where members do things like repair shelves or bicycles, part of a national public-health initiative aimed at curbing depression among retired men. Murnane possesses few useful skills for a men\u2019s shed, but the week after he moved to Goroke, the owner of the local service station invited him to join. He looks after the kitchen, cleans the toilet and serves as treasurer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMurnane had been watching the street from behind the muslin storefront curtain, and he marched outside to greet me. He wore a plaid shirt tucked into light khaki trousers and had the loose, ruddy skin of an avid golfer of a certain age. A successful treatment for prostate cancer had left him unable to sleep without interruption, but he appeared sharp and full of vim.\n\n\u201cYour body adapts, like a soldier in the trenches,\u201d Murnane said matter-of-factly. The shed wasn\u2019t technically open, but Murnane led me past dusty workbenches scattered with tools into a modest lounge, where he put on a kettle and opened a jar of instant coffee. His health, he said, had been improving, and he felt \u201cfull of optimism,\u201d and not just about his recovery. \u201cMy publishing history\u2019s just so checkered with sudden reversals, ups and downs, confusions, wrong turnings, and at the end of my life, virtually, it seems like things are starting to work out,\u201d he said.\n\nThen he pulled out an envelope, on which he\u2019d written a series of preliminary questions to ask me. They included \u201cAre you at all interested in golf?\u201d \u201cAre you at all interested in horse racing?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you propose to do for lunch?\u201d My answers (no, sort of, your call) seemed to satisfy him. \u201cYou might feel like you\u2019re being overorganized, but this is how I do things,\u201d Murnane said, leaning back in a chair. On a bulletin board behind him, someone had tacked up a photograph of a man at a pub drinking from a glass of beer the size of a trash barrel. The caption read, \u201cI\u2019m Only Going Out for One.\u201d\n\nMurnane moved to Goroke in 2009, after the death of his wife of 43 years, Catherine. Their eldest son, Giles, whom Murnane repeatedly described as a hermit, had come to Goroke years earlier, having chosen the town off the map for its cheap housing. Murnane had always been attracted to the country, and the first time he visited Giles, driving past the town graveyard, he had a premonition, \u201ccalmly and wordlessly,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cas one understands things in dreams\u201d: That\u2019s where my ashes will lie.\n\n\u201cI think you can probably see that I\u2019m sane, but I say and believe things that insane people believe,\u201d Murnane told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in a personal God, but I believe in the survival of the soul. And I get intimations and feelings.\u201d Catherine had no desire to move from their home in the Melbourne suburbs, but when her doctor informed her that she had terminal lung cancer, she turned to Murnane and said, \u201cNow you can go and live in Goroke.\u201d Less than a year later, she was buried in the town\u2019s cemetery. \u201cAnd I came up here to live with my hermit son,\u201d Murnane said. \u201cScholarly people who admire my books find it somewhat incongruous that I should live in a place like this. But I don\u2019t mix very much with writers. We have very little to talk about. I find most of them pretentious. So it seems to me the most natural thing in the world that I should live here at this period in my life.\u201d\n\nMurnane and his son live on a residential street a few blocks away from the Men\u2019s Shed. An unpaved alley lined with corrugated-tin fencing led to the back entrance. The place had a ramshackle quality. A corrugated-tin barn stood beside five squat reservoirs used to capture rainwater \u2014 the town\u2019s water is not potable \u2014 and a lonely clothesline tree leaned crookedly in a cement courtyard surrounded by an uneven stone wall. Murnane lived in a studio behind the main house. Both buildings were constructed from unlined blocks of white sandstone quarried nearby, giving Murnane\u2019s quarters, especially, a bunkerlike feel.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the lack of shared qualities between Murnane\u2019s room and any recognized notion of a living area. There were nods in the latter direction: the kitchen sink and minifridge; the tiny bathroom; a wooden schoolboy\u2019s desk, facing a blank wall in the corner, where Murnane writes. But the bulk of the room had been filled with Murnane\u2019s archives: more than a dozen filing cabinets, lining three walls and containing thousands of pages of journals, letters, lecture notes and ephemera from every stage of his life. A separate row of metal storage lockers bisected the center of the room, adding to the jarring overall motif, a blend of fanatical organization and claustrophobia, as if a squatter had taken over a secluded wing of a research library. There was no bed. Murnane keeps a folding cot in his shower stall. A threadbare sleeping pad, meant for a tent, was stored atop the storage lockers along with some blankets.\n\nMurnane began keeping the archives more than 50 years ago, both for posterity and to satisfy his own meticulous sense of order, and he has left strict instructions regarding their contents, which are not to be made public until after his own death and the death of his surviving siblings. (He has one brother, a Catholic priest, and a sister; another brother, who was born with an intellectual disability and was repeatedly hospitalized, died in 1985.) Nonetheless, Murnane opened the cabinets to give me a sense of their contents. His so-called Chronological Archive is stuffed with hanging files covering each period of his life and featuring headings like \u201cI rebuff a wealthy widow,\u201d \u201cI fall out with an arrogant student of mine,\u201d \u201cTwo women bother me,\u201d \u201cI decide that most books are crap,\u201d \u201cHoaxes! How I love them!\u201d and \u201cPeter Carey exposed at last.\u201d He also has multiple drafts of his 13 books; letters addressed, as in a time capsule, to a future Murnane scholar, whom he imagines as a young woman, and whom he addresses in the letters as \u201cFc,\u201d for \u201cfuture creature\u201d; a notebook of 20,000 words titled \u201cMy Shame File\u201d; a 40,000-word report on miraculous or unexplained events in his life; and a 75,000-word account of his dealings with everyone he has ever courted romantically or considered courting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s your seat,\u201d he said, gesturing to a camping chair unfolded at the foot of his desk. It sat comically low to the ground. I settled in, the lockers containing every detail of Murnane\u2019s mind rising on either side of me like canyon walls, and Murnane pulled out a list of agenda items he wished to discuss.\n\nThe list had been organized, I soon realized, in such a way that we would move in a counterclockwise direction around the room, stopping at various points to discuss objects of particular significance. One of the first items he pointed out, a poster covered with the racing colors of every jockey who had won the Melbourne Cup from its inception in 1861 until 2008, turned out to be part of his daily routine of memory exercises, which he compared to the offices, or hourly prayers, performed by Catholic priests.\n\nTurning away from the poster and clutching his hands behind his back, he told me to pick a year. I offered 1970. \u201cNineteen-seventy,\u201d Murnane said. \u201cThat horse was Baghdad Note. Emerald green, with white-striped sleeve and cap.\u201d Mondays, he said, he recited the entire list in order. Tuesdays he went backward. Other days involved skipping around the poster in ways I didn\u2019t quite follow. After that, he did the same with the 50 states of America and then recited passages in Hungarian, a language he\u2019d learned at 56. He showed me a set of flashcards. The English side of the one I picked up read, \u201cHe was caught up in the enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nMurnane had started talking the moment I picked him up at the Men\u2019s Shed, and he didn\u2019t stop, with few exceptions, for the next 12 hours, until I left for my hotel, a room above a pub in nearby Natimuk. He spoke rapidly, in a futile effort to keep pace with the speed of his own thoughts, constantly interrupting himself with muttered asides \u2014 a quote from the symbolist playwright Alfred Jarry, a self-deprecating story about his haplessness with women, a gripe about a Publishers Weekly review from the mid-1980s. He accepted my own interruptions of his monologues with good humor and often delight at the prospect of a new digression. When he excused himself to use the toilet, he closed the bathroom door and raised his voice.\n\nEven though their accents are nothing alike, something about the way Murnane spoke reminded me of Michael Caine, or at least of the East London gangsters Caine once played. His voice, clipped and nasal, had a bantam toughness, and his sentences (in life, not literature) make regular detours from formidable erudition into the slangy and profane. He described a cheapskate he knows as \u201cmean with money, the [expletive],\u201d a reputedly promiscuous girl of his youth as \u201ca rough sort of tart.\u201d He took special pleasure in revisiting old grudges, but could also be casually impolitic. On Raymond Carver: \u201cI met him. He came to Australia once. The second word he said to me was [expletive]. I thought, You\u2019re too dumb to have written what you wrote.\u201d\n\nWe came to a map of Victoria. Murnane estimates that his family moved a dozen times before his 20th birthday, always in and around greater Melbourne and often in flight from gambling debts incurred at racing meets by his father, Reginald, described to me by a friend of Gerald\u2019s as \u201ca wastrel.\u201d Murnane pointed out Murnane Bay, a notch on Victoria\u2019s southern coast said to be named after his grandfather, a prosperous dairy farmer: \u201cNasty old [expletive] of a bloke. Tom. No one liked him. Well, my father worshiped him, for some reason. I hated the guy.\u201d Despite all his time spent there as a boy, Murnane never learned to swim. \u201cThe water gets in my eyes, I panic, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have showers,\u201d he said. (He washes himself, he explained, standing at the sink.) \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned to hate the sea,\u201d he went on, \u201cand to look inland toward the plains.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt 18, Murnane entered a seminary. He lasted only three months and lost his faith by his early 20s; the lure, more than God, had been the idealized notion of a monastic writing life. He\u2019d been reading Thomas Merton, the American Trappist monk, and envied such an ordered existence, so pure in its devotion. As a teenager, he dreamed of becoming a poet, in part because he assumed writers of prose possessed an understanding of human behavior, which he believed he lacked. \u201cI don\u2019t know what anyone is thinking,\u201d Murnane told me. \u201cPeople are a mystery to me.\u201d He spent 13 years as a public servant, teaching in primary schools and working as an editor in a government office, and he married Catherine, who also worked as a teacher, in 1966, when he was 27. They settled in an unfashionable northern suburb, where she supported his decision to quit his day job and take care of their three sons, snatching free moments to work on his fiction and supplementing the family income with the occasional grant.\n\nBy the time he published \u201cThe Plains,\u201d Murnane had begun teaching creative writing at the Australian equivalent of a community college, but despite the novel\u2019s critical success, he maintained an ambivalent distance from the literary scene. He still did most of his writing at an ironing board set up in his kitchen, because his family\u2019s home was so crowded for space.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe novelist Helen Garner told me in an email that she first met Murnane at a literary festival in Adelaide in 1986. She won an award, and after the presentation, Murnane quietly introduced himself and asked, somewhat agitated, if he could put a question to her: Had she received word of her award in advance? Yes, Garner replied. \u201cHis face darkened, and he turned away muttering,\u201d Garner recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to put myself, thinking he was unable to conceal his anger at not having won the prize. But he pulled himself together and explained that he had never before traveled outside his home state of Victoria, that he hated traveling and never wanted to go anywhere \u2014 against all his principles and natural inclinations he had come all this way to Adelaide (I think by train) ONLY because he\u2019d thought his book (which I think must have been \u201cLandscape With Landscape\u201d) had a very good chance of winning the prize. ... His explanation was so sincere, and his distress at having been betrayed into acting against his inner self so genuine, that I felt very warmly toward him, and have done ever since, in my very distant acquaintance with him.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(His doctor had instructed him to drink more water, but he didn\u2019t like the taste.) Around 4:30, as he does every day, Murnane switched to beer, a slightly sour, high-alcohol-content pale ale he brewed himself, originally to save money, though now he\u2019d grown partial to it. His golfing partner, the daughter of a friend from the Men\u2019s Shed, had invited us over for dinner. Before we left, Murnane settled into his desk chair and rubbed his eyes, his unruly eyebrows squirming above his fingers.\n\n\u201cEven though I\u2019ve lived what some people would call a sheltered life,\u201d Murnane said, \u201cI love how \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a misquote or what, but Kafka is once supposed to have said, \u2018If you stay in your room, the world will come to you and writhe on the floor in front of you.\u2019 I came here to Goroke intending to stay in this room. And the world is writhing in front of me.\u201d Editors, scholars, journalists, Murnane said, \u201cthey all come up here to see how I live.\u201d\n\nWell, but not just that, I thought, looking around. A visit to Murnane\u2019s room made me think of the one-way intimacy that occurs between reader and writer \u2014 that feeling, after finishing a poem or novel, of having temporarily inhabited a consciousness not your own. Only here, I had the rare opportunity to experience that sensation in a physical space. (As in his \u201cchiseled\u201d paragraphs, in Murnane\u2019s archive everything has its place: While showing me the chronological files, Murane pointed at a cabinet drawer and said, \u201cMy wife dies over here.\u201d) Stepping into the hermetic confines of Murnane\u2019s world so perfectly mirrored his fictional project that it felt like stepping into the pages of one of his books.\n\nMurnane\u2019s golfing partner, Tammy Williams, lives with her two children in a cozy, art-filled home about five minutes away. (To be clear, everything in Goroke is five minutes away.) Pulling up a chair at the kitchen table, Murnane nodded in my direction and said: \u201cHe tasted the home brew. Didn\u2019t make any comment. But he got it down. He didn\u2019t spit it out.\u201d\n\nWilliams, looking appalled, quickly poured me a glass of wine.\n\n\u201cDid you see the way he lives?\u201d Williams asked, as she began to arrange a buffet. Murnane appeared delighted by the teasing. Williams shook her head and said, \u201cI told Gerald once, \u2018You might be a famous writer, but you\u2019re a crap golfer.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring my time in Goroke, I never met Murnane\u2019s son Giles. Murnane said he slept during the day and mostly ventured out at night to pick up snacks or fast food in Horsham, a city about 45 minutes away. Despite the \u201chermit\u201d cracks, he spoke tenderly, and in protective terms, of Giles; ailing or troubled children appear in several of his stories, including, most powerfully, in the opening story in \u201cStream System,\u201d \u201cWhen the Mice Failed to Arrive,\u201d in which the protagonist, a primary-school teacher turned househusband, struggles to explain suffering to a son hospitalized with asthma. Catherine also dealt with serious illnesses throughout her life, often leaving Gerald to care for the children.\n\n\u201cGerald had a hard time in the city,\u201d Chris Gregory, a friend and former student, told me in an email. \u201cHe isn\u2019t the sort of person to tell you his problems, and I\u2019m not the sort to ask about them, but it\u2019s clearly been hard, working in semi-obscurity, kicking against the pricks, dealing with a sometimes-difficult family life, his wife\u2019s painful death.\u201d Ivor Indyk, Murnane\u2019s longtime Australian publisher, believes the recursive mode of his fiction, its circularity and baroque structure, was a way for him to deal with \u201chot material \u2014 hot for him, because it\u2019s emotionally charged,\u201d Indyk told me. \u201cThere are events in his past that he\u2019s still coming to terms with.\u201d\n\nOn my last day in Goroke, Murnane and I visited Catherine\u2019s grave. The simple marker read:\n\nMurnane, Catherine Mary B. Albury, NSW 31-5-1937 D. Heidelberg, Vic 19-2-2009\n\nHe pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped off the top of the stone. It was the last day of January, summer in Australia, and the shorn barley and wheat fields we\u2019d driven past had seemed to pixelate in the bright afternoon sunlight.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEver one for spatial precision, Murnane pointed to the spot on the ground where Catherine\u2019s ashes had been interred, forming a small, boxlike shape with his hands. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be buried where you\u2019re standing,\u201d he said.\n\nI took a step back.\n\nMurnane had other things he wanted to show me: the golf club, a lake on the outskirts of town. Back at the Men\u2019s Shed, he introduced me to some of the other members, Rob, Taffy, Rossco, former truck drivers, farmers, mechanics: \u201cNow, this man says he likes a lot about Australia, but he has found a few faults with Australian men,\u201d Murnane said, gesturing to me. \u201cHe thinks they swear too much, they tell too many dirty jokes and they drink too much. So I said, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Mark, I\u2019ll take you to a place where none of that happens.\u2019 \u201d The guys chuckled, and Murnane waggled a finger at them: \u201cSo you [expletive] [expletive] better not make a liar of me!\u201d\n\nMurnane, who has said \u201cBorder Districts\u201d will be his final novel, did not look like someone who missed his old life. In fact, he had recused himself from the literary scene once before. Back in Melbourne, as his books after \u201cThe Plains\u201d became more experimental and inward-looking, he felt like an increasingly marginal figure \u2014 so much so that, in 1991, he decided to quit. Over the next decade, Murnane published only a single story collection, \u201cEmerald Blue,\u201d comprising mostly older material; the final sentence of the final story, \u201cThe Interior of Gaaldine,\u201d reads, \u201cThe text ends at this point.\u201d (\u201cEmerald Blue\u201d sold 600 copies, affirming his decision.) For extra cash, he took a job bundling newspapers and magazines in the early hours of the morning. He returned to writing only in 2001, after Indyk, the publisher of an independent literary press, offered to give him a home.\n\nWhat exactly did Murnane get up to during his lost decade? It turns out he left a clue in \u201cThe Interior of Gaaldine.\u201d The first half is a comic telling of a drunken journey by boat to Tasmania for a literary tour, made under duress by a writer who hates to travel. The story takes a turn into the supernatural after the protagonist\u2019s arrival in Hobart, where, after he passes out in his hotel room, a ghostly messenger delivers a briefcase. It contains thousands of pages of writing \u2014 not, as the protagonist fears, an unpublished manuscript, but details of a complex horse-racing game devised by its owner, who has spent decades playing the game alone in his room. The protagonist wonders if \u201cthe author of the pages wanted to meet me in order to persuade me to write a different sort of fiction in the future.\u201d\n\nThough Murnane never became a problem gambler like his father, one of his most cherished childhood memories involves a horse-racing game he played with a set of colored marbles. (To this day, he keeps the marbles in a jar in his room, where they occupy a place of pride just behind his writing desk.) And the strangest thing about \u201cThe Interior of Gaaldine\u201d is that not only the obviously autobiographical first half of the story, but the entire thing, basically, minus the ghost and the briefcase, is true. Murnane, working in secret beginning in 1985, developed a wildly more intricate version of his boyhood racing game, which is how he spent most of his retirement, and how he fills many of his evenings in Goroke.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe calls the project his Antipodean Archive. Inside its cabinet\u2019s drawers, there were maps of the two fictional countries where the races take place (including timetables for the major train networks), detailed sketches of racecourses and notebooks filled with the names and racing colors of the 1,500 full-time trainers, illustrated with head shots cut from newspapers and Murnane\u2019s own childlike drawings of the racing silks. An index listed every horse to have raced in the Antipodes, and there were handwritten, single-spaced results of the hundreds of races, as in a racing form. His method of determining race outcomes, too complex to get into here, involves, of course, books: A randomly chosen sentence generates points for a particular horse based on the number of vowels and consonants, combined with a banked system of points Murnane can award to favorites.\n\nAs we flipped through the folders, I thought of the great Robert Coover novel \u201cThe Universal Baseball Association, Inc., J. Henry Waugh, Prop.,\u201d about a recluse who invents a proto-fantasy-baseball game with players who become more real to him than any live human, and also about the work of outsider artists like Henry Darger, the reclusive Chicago janitor who secretly crafted his own elaborate, obsessive mythology illustrated with hundreds of paintings and collages. As Murnane explained the world he had created, he sounded as if he were speaking of a real place: \u201cNow in New Arcady, which is the smaller island, there are only 12 racecourses. They have races about five days a week up in the North.\u201d At one point, Murnane closed his eyes, clenched his hands into fists and broke into song. It was the New Eden national anthem, which he\u2019d written and composed himself.\n\nOceans foaming, mariners roaming, never a home in perilous seas. ...\n\nThe lyrics \u201care not my best shot,\u201d Murnane acknowledged. \u201cThey\u2019re meant to sound like something people would compose in 1880.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor years, he kept his project under wraps, even from his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassing thing for an old man, or a middle-aged man at the time, that he plays kids\u2019 games,\u201d Murnane said. \u201cBut they\u2019re not kids\u2019 games.\u201d To help me better understand, he showed me a letter he\u2019d written to \u201cFc,\u201d his future creature. It read, in part: \u201cAll the fiction I ever wrote or read was a preparation for this, my true life\u2019s work. In book after book of mine, I wrote about the contents of my mind, setting all my images on paper so that I could have done with them; could sweep them out of sight and leave my mind free for the infinite imagery of the Antipodes.\u201d His reports from the interior, from his own interior, had always skirted around the edges of a central image winking at the far reaches of his consciousness, a pair of his dream jockeys crossing a finish line. How could he ignore them?\n\nNext year, to coincide with his 80th birthday, Murnane will publish a book of poetry and outtakes from a previous novel. But other than the poems, composed in Goroke over the last few years, Murnane says he has retired once again. \u201cIf I woke up tomorrow morning feeling a tremendous pressure to write, I would write,\u201d Murnane told me. \u201cBut I probably won\u2019t. I almost certainly won\u2019t.\u201d Instead, he spends his evenings recording the results of imaginary races for his archive. Surely it must contain a germ of a narrative, an editor once insisted. \u201cBut, of course, several, no, thousands of narratives are embodied in the Archive,\u201d Murnane wrote to \u201cFc.\u201d \u201cThere are at least as many narratives as there are horses and jockeys and trainers and owners.\u201d\n\nI no longer felt as if I\u2019d stepped into a story by Murnane, but rather one by Borges: a story about a brilliant writer who discovers that the purest form of writing is, in the end, to write nothing at all.\n\nGingerly, I prodded Murnane. All his books had been so deeply personal, but also something any reader could enter into. But with the Antipodean Archive, Murnane had created countries where only he could travel. Did he harbor any second thoughts about diverting so much of his creativity into such a private pursuit?\n\nMurnane smiled. He could see another connection forming. From one of his cabinets, he retrieved a typewritten manuscript page from his poetry collection. Read it, he instructed. That\u2019s where we\u2019d stop.\n\nThe poem, after explaining the archive over many lines, \u201cthe perfect summation/of my lifelong belief in the sport of horse-racing/as a better source of inspiration/than opera, theater, film, you name it,\u201d ended like this:\n\nReader, if you\u2019re urged\n\nto learn more about this imagined world,\n\noutlive me and my siblings and visit the library\n\nwhere my archives end up. You\u2019ll find there a filing\n\ncabinet full of the sort of detail\n\nthat I wanted to include in this poem but failed.\n\nYou\u2019ll read thousands of pages, though you\u2019ll never see,\n\nunfortunately, what they revealed to me.", "title": "Is the Next Nobel Laureate in Literature Tending Bar in a Dusty Australian Town?", "authors": ["Mark Binelli"]}

The titular hero, whose real name is T\u2019Challa, is heir apparent to the throne of Wakanda, a fictional African nation. The tiny country has, for centuries, been in nearly sole possession of vibranium, an alien element acquired from a fallen meteor. (Vibranium is powerful and nearly indestructible; it\u2019s in the special alloy Captain America\u2019s shield is made of.) Wakanda\u2019s rulers have wisely kept their homeland and its elemental riches hidden from the world, and in its isolation the nation has grown wildly powerful and technologically advanced. Its secret, of course, is inevitably discovered, and as the world\u2019s evil powers plot to extract the resources of yet another African nation, T\u2019Challa\u2019s father is cruelly assassinated, forcing the end of Wakanda\u2019s sequestration. The young king will be forced to don the virtually indestructible vibranium Black Panther suit and face a duplicitous world on behalf of his people. This is the subject of Ryan Coogler\u2019s third feature film \u2014 after \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cCreed\u201d (2015) \u2014 and when glimpses of the work first appeared last June, the response was frenzied. The trailer teaser \u2014 not even the full trailer \u2014 racked up 89 million views in 24 hours. On Jan. 10, 2018, after tickets were made available for presale, Fandango\u2019s managing editor, Erik Davis, tweeted that the movie\u2019s first 24 hours of advance ticket sales exceeded those of any other movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The black internet was, to put it mildly, exploding. Twitter reported that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was one of the most tweeted-about films of 2017, despite not even opening that year. There were plans for viewing parties, a fund-raiser to arrange a private screening for the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem, hashtags like #BlackPantherSoLit and #WelcomeToWakanda. When the date of the premiere was announced, people began posting pictures of what might be called African-Americana, a kitsch version of an older generation\u2019s pride touchstones \u2014 kente cloth du-rags, candy-colored nine-button suits, King Jaffe Joffer from \u201cComing to America\u201d with his lion-hide sash \u2014 alongside captions like \u201cThis is how I\u2019ma show up to the Black Panther premiere.\u201d Someone described how they\u2019d feel approaching the box office by simply posting a video of the Compton rapper Buddy Crip-walking in front of a Moroccan hotel. \u2026 \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d by contrast, is steeped very specifically and purposefully in its blackness. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time in a very long time that we\u2019re seeing a film with centered black people, where we have a lot of agency,\u201d says Jamie Broadnax, the founder of Black Girl Nerds, a pop-culture site focused on sci-fi and comic-book fandoms.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "Technically, Trinidad had not been on the original itinerary of the yearlong, worldwide trip I\u2019m on for The Times, visiting each place on the 52 Places to Go in 2018 list. In an effort to convey to readers that the Caribbean, large swaths of which had been hit by two hurricanes last year, shouldn\u2019t be avoided as a travel destination, my editors had put the entire region at No. 4. Working with data scientists from Kayak, the online booking site, we crafted an itinerary that would take me to two islands that hadn\u2019t been affected by the hurricanes (Trinidad and St. Lucia) and one that very much had (Puerto Rico, which I\u2019ll be writing about next week).\n\nThat lineup scratched a few itches: the desire to experience Carnival; to island hop (to me, another defining Caribbean experience); and to go somewhere that had sustained damage and see for myself what being \u201cback open for business\u201d really looked like. What would it mean to be a responsible visitor to such a place, and how could I both encourage tourism while accurately conveying the situation?\n\nWhat followed was a visit to the Caribbean at a breakneck pace that I would advise no sane person to mimic. For complicated logistical and cost-related reasons that made sense at the time, I\u2019d mapped out a plan with Kayak to go to St. Lucia, then to Trinidad and back, then off to San Juan \u2014 all in four days.\n\nTraveling to Trinidad during Carnival turns out to be stressful even when you\u2019re not on a 24-hour, please-don\u2019t-try-this-at-home marathon. The Brits I shared my taxi with showed up only to find out that their hotel had given away their reservation (common, apparently), so they came to my place, President\u2019s Inn, where we all encountered the surprise that the front desk only took cash. (For me, that meant a trip to an A.T.M. on a dark and isolated street. Our heroic taxi driver refused to let me go alone.) Still, as simple as our hotel was, it was in an ideal location close to the action. Just three blocks away, I found a calypso show called Pandemonium in a dirt lot and featuring incredible steel-pan players from as far away as Paris.\n\nI had good luck finding that show, and the K2K band, while walking around, but nearly everyone I ran into seemed horrified to see me on my own. When I strayed from the show to look for something to eat, a young man raced up behind me. His name was Kadeem and he wanted to warn me that I had just narrowly escaped a robber who had been casing me, and who was blocking my way back to the show. \u201cBe careful of that guy. He\u2019s not a nice guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe won\u2019t bother you, but he looked like he wanted to get someone at the corner.\u201d\n\nLater, back at the show, I befriended a female pan player named Lenitia Solomon who happened to be a police officer in another part of town. \u201cTrinidad is not safe, especially around Carnival. A lot of phone snatchers. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen it all. Be aware of who\u2019s around you,\u201d she said, before telling me the story of a Japanese pan-player friend of hers who had been murdered at last year\u2019s Carnival. She insisted on taking me back to my hotel with a male friend who had come to walk her back to the show. Despite such warnings, Trinidad was vibrant and colorful and edgy, and I loved every minute of it.\n\nBut I also wouldn\u2019t trade the serenity of the brief time I got to spend in St. Lucia. A volcanic island known for its twin mountains, the Pitons, it has a kind of rugged charm one doesn\u2019t normally associate with Caribbean luxury. (It\u2019s also the only island I got to spend any time on during my one previous visit to the Caribbean, on a friend\u2019s sailing trip more than 10 years ago, and has always held special memories for me.) The hurricanes largely skipped the island, though Judith Verity, who owns the Mango Beach Inn, where I stayed, kept mentioning how much more beautiful her incredibly beautiful garden had been before the storm. \u201cWe are blessed people. God loves us,\u201d said my taxi driver, Barry Augustin, of why the jungle paradise where he\u2019s lived his whole life had been spared. \u201cIn St. Lucia, the economy is already so hard, so God protects his children.\u201d", "title": "Place 5 of 52: Island-Hopping on Vibrant Trinidad and Lush St. Lucia", "authors": []}

Most Jews outside of Israel are not accepted in the eyes of the Israeli ultra-Orthodox, who control ritual life and holy places in the state. Seven million of the eight million Jews living in America, Europe, South America, Africa and Australia are Modern Orthodox, Conservative, Reform or secular. Many of them have come to feel, particularly over the last few years, that the nation that they have supported politically, financially and spiritually is turning its back on them.\n\nBy submitting to the pressures exerted by a minority in Israel, the Jewish state is alienating a large segment of the Jewish people. The crisis is especially pronounced among the younger generation, which is predominantly secular. An increasing number of Jewish millennials \u2014 particularly in the United States \u2014 are distancing themselves from Israel because its policies contradict their values. The results are unsurprising: assimilation, alienation and a severe erosion of the global Jewish community\u2019s affinity for the Jewish homeland.\n\nOver the last decade I have visited Jewish communities in over 40 countries. Members in every one of them expressed to me their concern and anxiety about Israel\u2019s future and its relationship to diaspora Jewry.\n\nMany non-Orthodox Jews, myself included, feel that the spread of state-enforced religiosity in Israel is turning a modern, liberal nation into a semi-theocratic one. A vast majority of Jews around the world do not accept the exclusion of women in certain religious practices, strict conversion laws or the ban of egalitarian prayer at the Western Wall. They are bewildered by the impression that Israel is abandoning the humanistic vision of Theodor Herzl and taking on a character that does not suit its own core values or the spirit of the 21st century.\n\nThe leadership of the Jewish world always honors the choices made by the Israeli voter and acts in concert with Israel\u2019s democratically elected government. I\u2019m also keenly aware that Israelis are on the front lines, making sacrifices and risking their own lives every day so that Jews worldwide will survive and thrive. I count myself forever in their debt.\n\nBut sometimes loyalty requires a friend to speak out and express an inconvenient truth. And the truth is that the specter of a one-state solution and the growing rift between Israel and the diaspora are endangering the future of the country I love so dearly.\n\nWe are at a crossroads. The choices that Israel makes in the coming years will determine the destiny of our one and only Jewish state \u2014 and the continued unity of our cherished people.\n\nWe must change course. We must push for a two-state solution and find common ground among ourselves so that we can ensure the success of our beloved nation.", "title": "Opinion | Israel\u2019s Self-Inflicted Wounds", "authors": []}

The people on the ground choose the strategy, and can change it if necessary. \u201cInnovators can think outside the box and tackle health or education in revolutionary ways,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of projects suitable for bond financing. And the federal budget passed on Feb. 9 contains $100 million in competitive funding for \u201cpay for success\u201d programs. Much of it will go to evaluations of promising programs to identify what works.\n\nThe investment capital is there as well; as with impact investing in general, there\u2019s a lot more money than attractive investments. \u201cLots of our projects have been oversubscribed,\u201d said Tracy Palandjian, the chief executive of Social Finance US. The Boston project for immigrants had 40 investors.\n\nThe limiting factor is the reluctance of governments, which are not always innovators. The bonds also have a reputation for being time- consuming and hard to set up. Palandjian said that the real problem is gathering data on how well programs work \u2014 something governments should do anyway, bonds or no bonds.\n\nSo far, two bonds have failed. The first American one had sought to lower recidivism among inmates released from the Rikers Island jail in New York. The second was a British bond that tried to increase adoptions. When the programs didn\u2019t work, investors lost their money. On the other hand, there was no cost to the governments. Cohen points out that this way of financing also allowed unsuccessful programs to die, instead of plodding on for years, unevaluated.\n\nIn the United States, social impact bonds have become synonymous with \u201cpay for success\u201d programs. But there are other ways to pay for success. For example, Wilkinson, the Connecticut official, has just started an Outcomes Rate Card \u2014 a way for a government to pay for home visits for vulnerable families. The social service agencies get base pay, but also bonuses. If a client has a full-term birth, the agency gets an extra $135 for a low-risk family, $170 for a hard-to-help one. A client who finds stable housing brings $150 or $220 to the agency, depending on the family\u2019s situation.\n\nA rate card doesn\u2019t provide upfront money. But it\u2019s easy to use, and allows the government to work with multiple social service providers. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple, understandable way to show that government can invest in what families, providers and taxpayers want to see,\u201d said Wilkinson. \u201cIt allows government to say: \u2018Here are the results we want and here\u2019s what we\u2019ll pay for them.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Issuing Bonds to Invest in People", "authors": []}

Italy was once home to the largest Communist Party outside of the Soviet Union, and the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who still leads the center-right Forza Italia party, has long seemed to feel about Putin the way I do about prosciutto.\n\nTheir bromance spans decades.

In fact, social media has hurled them apart, less bridge-builder than disintegrator.\n\nIn the north, it was the League that triumphed \u2013 and was promptly praised by the rightist French National Front of Marine Le Pen.

After pausing for just a moment, she revealed how she made ends meet during spring break: She increased her online dating activity to secure meals. Banking on men paying for the first date, she felt that her best option was to use Tinder as if it were OpenTable.\n\nAt elite colleges like Harvard, food insecurity \u2014 not knowing where your next meal is coming from \u2014 is more episodic, happening mostly around breaks. That is not the case at many other colleges around the country. At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, public health researchers found in 2009 that 21 percent students there experienced this reality firsthand. A more recent George Washington University survey revealed that one in five first-generation college students reported being \u201cfood insecure\u201d three or more times a week. In a study done by California State University, college officials estimated that 21 percent of their students struggled with food insecurity. The reality is that students at state and community colleges bear this burden most acutely.\n\nFood insecurity undercuts academic performance. But its effects go beyond lowering grades. Hunger in the midst of plenty weakens students\u2019 sense of belonging and undercuts their social, emotional and physical well-being. Knowing one\u2019s peers are away relaxing while you scrounge for food makes poor students not only keenly aware of their own economic disadvantage but also of what their colleges make them endure because of it.\n\nSome colleges are reversing their decision to close cafeterias. Amherst now opens Valentine Hall during break. Connecticut College, which in 2015 charged fees to eat and stay on campus, no longer does for breaks in the academic year. Through valiant efforts by student activists, other colleges have opened food banks. Virginia Commonwealth University (in 2014) and George Washington University (in 2016) opened pantries to provide students with healthy food options. Columbia opened a food bank last year. We need more changes like these on individual campuses. But for systemic change, more robust interventions are needed.\n\nBattling food insecurity in college calls for national policy changes. Increases to federal Pell Grants would provide students with resources for expenses associated with being in college, those covered by tuition and the many incidentals that are not. Expanding college students\u2019 eligibility for SNAP is equally important. These changes would allow students to focus energy and time on academics instead of strategizing about ways to secure food.

Ms. Liik said she had expected Mr. Putin, who won a fourth term by a lopsided margin on March 18, to back away from disruption during what, under the Constitution, should be his last six years in power.\n\nMr. Putin, she said, might not be predictable but usually follows what he considers fairly clear logic. \u201cPutin does not do disruption just for fun, but because he is Putin and he can,\u201d she said.\n\nEach time Russia has been accused of having a hand in acts like the seizure of Ukrainian government buildings in Crimea or the 2014 shooting down of a Malaysian passenger plane over eastern Ukraine, in which nearly 300 people were killed, Moscow has responded with a mix of self-pity, fierce denials and florid conspiracy theories that put the blame elsewhere.\n\nIn the case of the poisoning in Salisbury, Russia\u2019s denials became so baroque that even the state-run news media had a hard time keeping up.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter officials denied any Russian role and insisted that neither Russia nor the Soviet Union had ever developed Novichok, the nerve agent identified by Britain as the substance used against the Skripals, a state-controlled news agency published an interview with a Russian scientist who said he had helped develop a system of chemical weapons called Novichok-5. The agency later amended the article, replacing the scientist\u2019s mention of Novichok with an assertion that the \u201cchemical weapons development program of the U.S.S.R. was not called \u2018Novichok.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe attempted murder of Mr. Skripal on British soil, however, \u201cwas the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d said Vladislav Inozemtsev, a Russian scholar at the Polish Institute of Advanced Studies in Warsaw. \u201cWestern leaders finally decided that enough is enough\u201d because Moscow has played the denial game so many times and showed no real interest in establishing the truth, he said.\n\nUnlike Soviet leaders during the Cold War, he added, Mr. Putin follows no fixed ideology or rules but is ready to pursue any \u201cpredatory policies,\u201d no matter how taboo, that might help \u201cundermine the existing order in Europe,\u201d while insisting that Russia is the victim, not the aggressor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

No longer is that the case, he added, noting that the Russian Embassy in London and the Foreign Ministry in Moscow have issued statements and tweets mocking Britain as an impotent has-been power and scoffing at the Salisbury poisoning as the \u201cso-called Sergei Skripal case.\u201d\n\nPresident Putin, Mr. Bond added, \u201cis not trying to foment international revolution, but he is the great disrupter\u201d and revels in wrong-footing foreign governments by flouting established norms.\n\nWhile Russia may have been surprised by the magnitude of the coordinated expulsions by Britain\u2019s allies on Monday, it was clearly anticipating something. Hours before they were announced, it went on the offensive.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, posted a message on Facebook sneering at the European Union for showing solidarity with Britain at a time when London is negotiating its exit from the bloc. Britain, she wrote, is \u201cexploiting the solidarity factor to impose on those that are remaining a deterioration in relations with Russia.\u201d\n\nWhile President Trump has expressed a curious affinity with Mr. Putin and raised expectations of improved relations, the Russian leader has always been more measured. The underlying mistrust seemed to be reinforced on Monday by Russia\u2019s ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, who told the Interfax news agency that \u201cwhat the United States of America is doing today is destroying whatever little is left in Russian-U.S. relations.\u201d\n\nDespite the unpredictability under Mr. Putin, the possibility of nuclear conflict between the Russians and the West, the most frightening aspect of the Cold War, does not appear to have increased. Arms control agreements reached since the 1970s are still honored \u2014 with the exception of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile accord, known as the ABM Treaty, which Mr. Bush abandoned 30 years later.\n\nMr. Bush\u2019s decision, questioned by even some American allies, opened the way, in Moscow\u2019s view, to a free-for-all in international relations that has left the United States and Russia struggling to recover the trust developed by President Ronald Reagan and the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in the 1980s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a state of the nation address in February, President Putin unveiled what he described as a new generation of \u201cinvincible\u201d long-range nuclear missiles but, speaking later in an interview with NBC, he blamed Washington for pushing Moscow into a new arms race by disregarding a Cold War status quo.\n\n\u201cIf you speak about the arms race, it started when the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty,\u201d he said.\n\nConfronted with Moscow\u2019s disruptive actions in the 1920s, Britain and other European countries \u201cdid not know how to respond and took 10 years or more to figure out how to deal with Moscow,\u201d said Mr. Kurilla, the St. Petersburg historian.\n\nIn the case of Britain, the leading power of the day and the first Western country to recognize the Soviet Union, the process had echoes of the present. It recognized the new Bolshevik government in 1924 but then expelled Soviet diplomats and shuttered their embassy three years later after the police uncovered what they said was a Soviet espionage ring bent on spreading mayhem.", "title": "It\u2019s No Cold War, but Relations With Russia Turn Volatile", "authors": ["Andrew Higgins"]}

Sloan School of Management and an author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not really the robots that are to blame.\u201d\n\nHere are other findings from the research.\n\nCovering the history of Twitter\n\nThe research, published on Thursday in Science magazine, examined true and false news stories posted on Twitter from the social network\u2019s founding in 2006 through 2017. The study\u2019s authors tracked 126,000 stories tweeted by roughly three million people more than 4.5 million times. \u201cNews\u201d and \u201cstories\u201d were defined broadly \u2014 as claims of fact \u2014 regardless of the source. And the study explicitly avoided the term \u201cfake news,\u201d which, the authors write, has become \u201cirredeemably polarized in our current political and media climate.\u201d\n\nThe stories were classified as true or false, using information from six independent fact-checking organizations including Snopes, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org. To ensure that their analysis held up in general \u2014 not just on claims that drew the attention of fact-checking groups \u2014 the researchers enlisted students to annotate as true or false more than 13,000 other stories that circulated on Twitter. Again, a tilt toward falsehood was clear.\n\nThe way information flows online \u2014 and, occasionally, spreads rapidly like a virus \u2014 has been studied for decades. There have also been smaller studies examining how true and false news and rumors propagate across social networks. But experts in network analysis said the M.I.T. study was larger in scale and well designed.\n\n\u201cThe comprehensiveness is important here, spanning the entire history of Twitter,\u201d said Jon Kleinberg, a computer scientist at Cornell University. \u201cAnd this study shines a spotlight on the open question of the success of false information online.\u201d\n\nThe number of tweets containing false claims and stories related to politics spiked during the past two presidential elections. tweets containing false claims 6k 4k 2k 0 4.1k 2010 2012 2014 2016 The number of tweets containing false claims and stories related to politics spiked during the past two presidential elections. tweets containing false claims 5k 4k 3k 2k 1k 0 4.1k 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016\n\nNovelty wins retweets\n\nThe M.I.T. researchers pointed to factors that contribute to the appeal of false news. Applying standard text-analysis tools, they found that false claims were significantly more novel than true ones \u2014 maybe not a surprise, since falsehoods are made up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe study\u2019s authors also explored the emotions evoked by false and true stories. The goal, said Soroush Vosoughi, a postdoctoral researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and the lead author, was to find clues about what is \u201cin the nature of humans that makes them like to share false news.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As a measurement tool, the researchers used a system created by Canada\u2019s National Research Council that associates English words with eight emotions. False claims elicited replies expressing greater surprise and disgust. True news inspired more anticipation, sadness and joy, depending on the nature of the stories.\n\nTwo stories: one true, one false\n\nThe researchers provided an example of two business stories, and how much more time it took the true one to reach 200 retweets. The example also shows the judgment calls made by fact-checking organizations.\n\n\u2022 In 2014, the fashion chain Zara introduced children\u2019s pajamas with horizontal stripes and a gold star. The company said the design was inspired by what a cowboy sheriff would wear. But Twitter users posted messages saying the pajamas resembled Nazi concentration camp uniforms. Snopes: True. Time to reach 200 retweets: 7.3 hours.\n\n\u2022 In 2016, a website republished a portion of a satirical article about how the Chick-fil-A restaurant chain had decided to begin a \u201cWe don\u2019t like blacks either\u201d marketing campaign to stir up controversy and boost sales. It came after the company\u2019s president did say he opposed gay marriage. Snopes: False. Time to 200 retweets: 4.2 hours.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe M.I.T. researchers said that understanding how false news spreads is a first step toward curbing it. They concluded that human behavior plays a large role in explaining the phenomenon, and mention possible interventions, like better labeling, to alter behavior.\n\nFor all the concern about false news, there is little certainty about its influence on people\u2019s beliefs and actions. A recent study of the browsing histories of thousands of American adults in the months before the 2016 election found that false news accounted for only a small portion of the total news people consumed. \u201cWe have to be very careful about making the inference that fake news has a big impact,\u201d said Duncan Watts, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research.\n\nAnother author of the M.I.T. study, Deb Roy, former chief media scientist at Twitter, is engaged in a project to improve the health of the information ecosystem. In fall 2016, Mr. Roy, an associate professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab, became a founder and the chairman of Cortico, a nonprofit that is developing tools to measure public conversations online to gauge attributes like shared attention, variety of opinion and receptivity. The idea is that improving the ability to measure such attributes would lead to better decision-making that would counteract misinformation.\n\nMr. Roy acknowledged the challenge in trying to not only alter individual behavior but also in enlisting the support of big internet platforms like Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, and media companies.\n\n\u201cPolarization,\u201d he said, \u201chas turned out to be a great business model.\u201d", "title": "It\u2019s True: False News Spreads Faster and Wider.

We took in our fellow passenger and his snack for a split second before I shot from my seat, hustling my daughters ahead of me, locking eyes with Will.\n\nAnd so began our wordless conversation.\n\nHe tilted his head, meaning, \u201cIs that person eating nuts in the same airspace as our daughter?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI narrowed my eyes, which meant, \u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\n\nHe frowned, to say, \u201cDon\u2019t let her breathe in until we get off the bus.\u201d\n\nI shrugged, implying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWe ushered our baffled, uncomprehending children off the bus and into the snow, miles from home.\n\nI realize this sounds like a deranged thing to do, so let me explain. When our middle daughter was quite young, we learned that she had an immune disorder. Born with chronic eczema, she was distressed and uncomfortable every minute of every day and didn\u2019t sleep through the night until she was 6.\n\nShe is prone to sudden and severe infections. She is allergic to a long list of things, some of which can tip her into life-threatening anaphylactic shock. Just the inhalation of a single particle of nut dust could kill her within 10 minutes. Life, for her, is a series of dangers, strung together, one after another, like beads on a thread.\n\nSo our family exists in a state of high alert. Will and I must constantly be thinking about how best to protect her \u2014 as well as trying to minimize the impact of her condition on her siblings. From the moment she wakes to the moment she goes to sleep, we are engaged in a waltz with peril. We are trained in resuscitation, in emergency medical action plans, in auto-adrenaline injection.\n\nWe never leave the house without her medication. We taught her brother, age 7, how to dial for an ambulance and to say: \u201cThis is an emergency case of anaphylaxis.\u201d\n\nHer condition and all its attendant cares is what makes up our secret language, its grammar, its vocabulary, its punctuation. This daily battle on behalf of our daughter is the semantics of our silent communication, which runs on an invisible wire stretched between the two of us, at all hours of the day.\n\nWherever we are, whatever we are doing \u2014 working, having meetings, taking phone calls, watching films, eating with friends \u2014 this issue will be there, at the forefront of our minds. It runs through us like mica through granite.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, the above is the expurgated version of our relationship, edited to make us sound like virtuous and unified parents. The truth is that he and I can also argue like fiends. He is mulishly stubborn and I am unfailingly volatile. He is a stickler, a rationalist, and I have been known to throw things, while not exactly at him, then near him.\n\nWe are both exhaustively lexical people; we can dispute the ideal method to cook scrambled eggs for a startling length of time, the subject spiraling outward to encompass other extraneous flaws, neither of us willing to give way. His constant music and iPhone habit can tip me over the edge; my stockpiles of shoes by the front door and penchant for constantly rearranging furniture infuriate him.\n\nThere is, however, a sense of solidarity between us on this one issue. We never argue about how best to take care of our daughter, not because we always agree \u2014 far from it \u2014 but because we know we need to channel every atom of energy into protecting her and her siblings. Family life can be fraught at the best of times, but if one of you suffers a complex medical condition, it is something that affects all of you; every member of the household must face the stress and challenges.\n\nLast winter, Will and I were in the throes of a disagreement that had lasted for more than two days. We whispered furiously at each other when we were alone; we shot dark and freighted looks across rooms; we sent each other long, vexed text messages.\n\nI forget, now, what exactly we were feuding over. Probably some minor domestic detail. All I do know is that the moment my daughter started to feel unwell at the dinner table, the argument that had been so all consuming evaporated, like steam. By the time her throat had swollen and she was losing consciousness, we were assuming our roles, running seamlessly through our well-rehearsed action plan: I administered the adrenaline, he called the ambulance; I raised her legs, sending the blood back toward her heart; he cleared her siblings from the room.\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is this: If you are a couple raising a child who for whatever reason \u2014 physical, mental, neurological, immunological \u2014 requires you to go the extra distance, there will be stress. Enormous stress. You will be tested in every way, beyond limits you didn\u2019t even know existed.\n\nUnder these circumstances, you must not, in the smoke and noise and welter of the battlefield, mistake your partner for the enemy. You have to recognize that they are coming out of the same trench as you; they are facing the same enemy.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial, when you are under fire, that you don\u2019t lose your head and discharge your weapons at them. Because no one else will understand your situation, the rules of your tiny country, like they do; even your closest friends, sisters and parents won\u2019t have seen you at your lowest ebb.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is Will who has seen me cry after Googling side effects and survival rates and medical statistics. It is he who has taken the keyboard out of my hands and said, \u201cEnough.\u201d Only he knows, really, how many times a night I got out of bed and applied emollient and wrappings and bandages to my daughter\u2019s skin. Only he knows how little sleep I got. Only he has witnessed my frustration and grief at the cruel ignorance of others.\n\nIt is he who has sat with me, beside her hospital bed, his hand gripping mine. Only he, among all my acquaintances, comprehends what it is like to witness our child sink into the clutches of anaphylaxis, to see the color drain from her face, to watch her features swell, to hear her breath rattle and strain, to wait by the door, holding her, desperately listening for the spiraling wail of the approaching ambulance.\n\nSo, yes, we can fight like preschoolers about jazz and shoes and sofas and when, in the cooking of scrambled eggs, is the optimum time to put in the butter. Maybe we need to. Maybe these are the small radiator keys that need to be inserted into our marriage in order to drain off the excess steam that builds and fizzes inside its structure.\n\nWhen it counts \u2014 when it\u2019s a situation of life or death \u2014 all that stuff and strife is forgotten. The secret code kicks in, and I know one thing: He and I will stand, teeth bared, between death and our daughter, unquestionably united, saying, Get back, get away. You\u2019re not having her.

She and Mr. Kushner invite legislators, lobbyists and C.E.O.s to their Washington home for off-the-record discussions of their agenda.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s first trip abroad in May, Ms. Trump raised eyebrows when she briefly represented her father at the Group of 20 meeting in Hamburg, taking a seat alongside Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. She was jeered when she called her father \u201ca tremendous champion of supporting families\u201d during a women\u2019s entrepreneurship panel in Berlin. \u201cWhom are you representing?\u201d the moderator asked. \u201cYour father as the president of the United States, the American people, or your business?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an apt question. Ms. Trump chose a formal, unpaid administration role, requiring her to comply with federal conflict-of-interest and ethics rules. Yet she and Mr. Kushner have retained financial control of their businesses and have made repeated errors on federal financial disclosures. CNN reported Thursday that the F.B.I. is investigating one of Ms. Trump\u2019s business deals, in Vancouver. Other projects she has spearheaded, from Azerbaijan to Manhattan, have raised legal questions as well. She hawked her book on Twitter, and has used public appearances to tout Ivanka Trump-branded jewelry and showcase Trump family businesses.\n\nMs. Trump\u2019s zeal for global renown has been exploited by foreign governments eager to curry favor with her father, just as her husband\u2019s financial travails have been viewed as opportunities for influence. On the day Mr. Trump and the Kushners met with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, China granted Ms. Trump\u2019s company three trademarks in the giant Chinese market; other countries have done likewise.\n\nBut where are Ms. Trump\u2019s public policy successes? Language supporting paid family leave appeared in Mr. Trump\u2019s initial budget blueprint, which went nowhere in Congress. There have been executive orders and working groups promoting women in technology, apprenticeships and job training, but no significant government funding, programs or legislation. Her White House detractors deride Ms. Trump\u2019s causes as a \u201cpet agenda,\u201d vigorously opposed by the Republican base her father strives to satisfy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs Mr. Trump targeted undocumented immigrants, women, gay people and the poor, as he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and tried repeatedly to deprive working families of health insurance under Obamacare, Ms. Trump defended herself, telling Gayle King, \u201cI would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence. \u2026 Where I disagree with my father, he knows it.\u201d The interview earned her late-night-TV ridicule as \u201ccomplicit\u201d in her father\u2019s atavistic policies. In another interview, Ms. Trump declared the Syrian refugee crisis a \u201cglobal humanitarian crisis \u2026 we have to solve,\u201d then evaded a question of whether her father\u2019s travel ban, which, among other groups, specifically bars Syrian refugees from the United States, is part of the problem.\n\nLast summer Ms. Trump toured the nation cheerleading for tax cuts that penalize working families while enriching her own family. A child tax credit she favored failed a key Senate vote after she skipped the debate over it, instead traveling to India for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. After Mr. Trump blamed \u201cmany sides\u201d for a violent neo-Nazi demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., in which a young counterprotester was killed, Ms. Trump, who converted to Judaism when she married Mr. Kushner, tweeted an anodyne rejection of \u201cracism, white supremacy and neo-Nazis.\u201d She said nothing more pointed than that about her father\u2019s remarks, which caused C.E.O.s to bolt White House advisory boards.\n\nDuring an interview when she was in South Korea, , Ms. Trump was asked whether she believed women\u2019s accusations of sexual misconduct and assault against her father. Ms. Trump, a senior presidential adviser who profits personally from her support for women\u2019s empowerment, took umbrage. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a question you would ask many other daughters,\u201d she said, before going on to say she believes \u201cmy father.\u201d\n\nWhat a perfect summary of what\u2019s wrong with White House nepotism. Since she is the president\u2019s daughter, Ms. Trump considers herself immune from criticism or tough questions even when she\u2019s acting in her public role as a \u201csenior adviser.\u201d In fact, of course, no policymaker truly committed to the agenda Ms. Trump espouses would have joined this administration. No presidential adviser with the values she claims would still be working for a president so determined to lay waste to them. So why does Ms. Trump stay? The answers could only be family allegiance, personal gain, or plans \u2014 wildly optimistic plans, in light of the F.B.I. noose tightening around this White House \u2014 for a dynastic political career. These are precisely what the founders condemned as nepotism\u2019s dangers to democracy.

What\u2019s your experience of Art Basel Hong Kong so far?\n\nI went about five years ago. I was really impressed with the cross-section of people from all over Asia and the quality of the collectors. Plus, every museum director that I know goes. I don\u2019t usually go to fairs, because everyone knows the artists that I collect. So, if there\u2019s a Francis Bacon on the market, or there\u2019s a Cy Twombly on the market, or there\u2019s a Wool on the market, I get a call from the dealer.\n\nWhat will you do after the fair?\n\nMy daughter Astrid and I are going to go to Beijing.

Let\u2019s go back to the different collections that we have, which is Renaissance bronzes, old master paintings, a dozen post-World War II artists, and now emerging artists. They all have one thing in common: At the moment that the art was created, the country of origin was going through a massive series of changes. China, in my mind, is going through the same thing now.

I got Ed Ruscha to come and give a talk about how the Renaissance had influenced his drawings. Some 75,000 people came to that show, but the average age was much younger than the typical Frick audience. I like to connect the dots between art from different centuries and different disciplines.\n\nIs there an area you\u2019ve thought about but decided against collecting?\n\nI wanted to collect Greek and Roman. But I am also risk-averse, and I didn\u2019t want to go to jail. You had all of this great material that was being taken from Turkey, taken from Italy, and put on the market without proper provenance. So, if you\u2019re risk-averse, you can\u2019t buy it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat are the connections between being successful in business and being successful in collecting?\n\nThat\u2019s a really good question. First, it all starts with research. The discipline of actually doing the research is the same in both fields. And you can\u2019t start down the path of putting a collection together unless you know first, who you are, because you\u2019ve got to really like it, and you\u2019ve got to know what your taste is.\n\nSecond, you\u2019ve got to know the artist. You\u2019ve got to read everything you can about the artist. Then you\u2019ve got to know what\u2019s the difference between a good work and a great work, and that takes study and connoisseurship.\n\nSo what was the first big piece you bought?\n\nAn Andy Warhol soup can from 1962. It was in the mid-90s, at a Christie\u2019s auction. I saw it and said, \u201cThis is really great.\u201d I knew Andy a bit back in the late 1960s, when I was at Harvard and he was hanging around there. So back in the \u201990s, nobody really understood how great Warhol was. And you could buy it for half a million bucks.\n\nNow we have 12 Warhols. I think Andy is actually an even more important artist than Picasso, and you know why? Every artist post-1962 has Warhol on his brain. If Andy were living today, he would fit right in with texting and Instagram.\n\nWere you exposed to art as a kid?\n\nI got lucky because I had a mother who would take me to museums. My father was interested, too. I think about who influenced my life, and my mom, who was an artist, influenced my life. She did sculpture, worked in bronze, worked in clay. She would work every day \u2014 in her 90s she would go to her studio.\n\nThat must dovetail with your interest in living artists. What is enjoyable about knowing them personally?\n\nBecause I can have a conversation with them. I was emailing Christopher Wool this morning.

All the new debt piled onto Qualcomm\u2019s balance sheet might make it harder for the company to sustain its current profit margins, not to mention its high level of research and development spending.\n\nOne way forward might be for Mr. Jacobs to give an idea of how he might settle Qualcomm\u2019s legal dispute with Apple, which was explored here by our colleague James Stewart. A settlement with Apple could unlock revenue and clear up a big area of uncertainty.

Is the market fixed?\n\nBear Stearns, like its peers, had an Achilles\u2019 heel that left it particularly vulnerable to a crisis of confidence a decade ago \u2014 its heavy use of a type of borrowing known as repo. Wall Street firms still use repo markets to borrow and lend billions of dollars a day. But are they fixed?\n\nTo understand why repo markets broke down in 2008, and whether they are still a big risk today, it\u2019s important to know how they work. Repo is a type of short-term secured lending that uses securities as the collateral. Wall Street banks use the repo market to borrow billions of dollars for their own businesses and also to lend to clients.\n\nIn 2008, the repo market went through something akin to a bank run. Banks had borrowed too much against the securities that backed up their repo loans. So when doubts grew about the banks\u2019 financial standing, as well as the value of the securities used in the repo market, clients pulled trades from the banks, creating a vicious spiral that deprived the banks of a crucial source of financing. The Federal Reserve had to bail out Wall Street firms with emergency loans.\n\nTo get the state of play in the repo markets, we checked in with Darrell Duffie, a finance professor at Stanford, who has followed securities markets closely since the crisis. Much has happened that should have made the repo markets stronger, he said, pointing to several improvements.\n\nWall Street firms are borrowing less overall. After the crisis, banks had to increase their capital levels, which means they have to get more of their financing from shareholders, not potentially flighty creditors, like repo lenders. A bank doesn\u2019t have to give back shareholder money, which makes it a far more stable source of funding than, say, short-term repo loans, which have to be rolled over frequently.\n\nLiquid assets. International rules introduced after the crisis require large banks to hold a set amount of easy-to-sell assets, like Treasury bills, that will most likely hold their value even in a crisis. These , in theory, can be sold to raise the cash needed to pay back clients withdrawing their business. Of course, an aim of the liquid asset pools is to prevent runs preemptively. Clients, knowing the bank have access to cash, will be less likely to flee.\n\nRepo cleanup. Sudden doubts about the value of collateral \u2014 subprime mortgage securities in 2008, for instance \u2013 can cause the repo market to seize up. The amount of risky collateral in the repo market is lower than it was before the crisis. But as this page run by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows, equities, perhaps the riskiest repo asset, make up around 8 percent of volume, a not insignificant amount.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPanic on the streets of London. In the lead up to the crisis, investors who wanted to borrow more against securities could do so out of London subsidiaries of United States banks. By trading with the London subsidiaries, investors and banks could skirt a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that aims to protect customers, but may also put a tighter limit on secured borrowing. Mr. Duffie says that European rules introduced since the crisis appear to have somewhat tightened securities-based lending out of London.\n\nHave investors wised up? Mr. Duffie said, after the crisis, fund managers took the step of spreading their business over a number of Wall Street firms, rather than concentrating their trades at one bank. This, in theory, reduces the risk of one bank being hit by an investor exodus. But as time passes, employees at investment firms may become complacent. \u201cOver time, investors tend to forget about crises, or get replaced by younger folks with no direct experience to crises,\u201d Mr. Duffie said in an email, \u201cThe risks are theoretically known, but become less salient over time.\u201d\n\n\u2014Peter Eavis\n\nWhat\u2019s on deal-maker\u2019s minds in the Big Easy\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Twenty-eighteen has gotten off to a great start for the business of buying companies, and the mood at one of the most prominent M.&A. conferences around is optimistic.

Plevan, said in a statement. \u201cIt is shocking that Mr. Levine has refused to accept responsibility for his actions, and has today instead decided to lash out at the Met with a suit riddled with untruths.\u201d\n\nThe suit was filed just hours before the opening of a new production of Mozart\u2019s \u201cCos\u00ec Fan Tutte,\u201d a specialty of Mr. Levine\u2019s that he conducted when he returned to the podium in 2013, after being sidelined for two years because of a spinal injury. To rebut the charge that Met management had been trying to force Mr. Levine out, the Met pointed to the fact that it had retained him as music director even when health problems kept him from conducting for long stretches of time.\n\nMr. Levine is being represented by two prominent attorneys, Elkan Abramowitz \u2014 who has represented a number of high-profile clients including Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen and Gov.

The value of Disney\u2019s stock has fallen 7 percent during the past year, a drop analysts largely attribute to concerns about ESPN\u2019s future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

{"date": "2018-03-05 00:00:00", "text": "In a recent issue of JAMA, Dr. Eve Guth, internist at the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Chicago, basically endorsed my approach. She wrote: \u201cSuccessful long-term calorie reduction is most likely to result when patients decide for themselves which dietary changes to make and when. Essential to any effort is a clear understanding that dietary change is a slow process that requires ongoing vigilance\u201d which, she admitted, \u201cis not a popular concept in a world now accustomed to immediate results.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no one knows this better than Angelica Divinagracia, a fitness specialist in Los Angeles who at 53 still looks as good or better than she did as head cheerleader at U.C.L.A. (Full disclosure: Ms. Divinagracia is my daughter-in-law.) In a posting mid-January on Facebook, she wrote, \u201cThe diet and nutrition business is a billion dollar industry because it\u2019s designed for failure. When the diet ends, which ultimately it will, you go right back to where you were. Then you start another\u2026.\u201d\n\nMs. Divinagracia said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in diets or any particular products. I believe in learning how to create a healthy lifestyle, and the formula is simple.\u201d The most salient points of her well-practiced advice are these: 1) Stop eating crap, 2) Eat good food that is real, not processed, 3) Avoid drinking your calories, 4) Know what one serving is and do not eat more than that in a sitting, 5) Move your butt every day \u2014 even just walking is better than being a couch potato, and 6) Stop making excuses.\n\nDr. Guth warns against numerous pitfalls, like being swayed by package claims of \u201clow fat\u201d or \u201clow carbohydrate\u201d instead of reading the facts on the nutrition label. \u201cThese foods do not necessarily have fewer total calories than the original version of the food,\u201d she wrote, because sugar is often used to compensate for flavor lost, for example, when fat is reduced. Fruit juice may be fat-free but it is not low in calories because it contains large amounts of sugar, she noted.\n\nShe also urges closer attention to add-ons and condiments. \u201cA beef patty has definite food value but after adding a large bun, dressing and extra cheese, the total calories (535) will far exceed the caloric content of the meat, pickle and tomato (240),\u201d she wrote, adding that using butter, margarine or mayonnaise on a sandwich adds far more calories than mustard.\n\nI don\u2019t count calories, but I have a working knowledge of the approximate calories in nearly everything I eat. If you need to lose weight, I urge you to download a comprehensive calorie chart of common foods to help you make substitutions that will cut about 500 calories from your daily diet. You can do the same with an exercise chart, keeping in mind that the caloric cost of any activity depends on how strenuously you do it and how much you weigh.\n\nAlthough most of the Jan. 16 issue of JAMA is devoted to studies of bariatric surgery, which offers the best route to permanent weight loss for some people, Dr. Guth pointed out that surgery is likely to fail too \u201cif a patient is unwilling to make appropriate changes in food choices.\u201d\n\nShe, like me, endorses Michael Pollan\u2019s diet mantra: \u201cEat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\u201d And like me, she notes that slow, steady weight loss suggests that you\u2019ve made sustainable changes in your diet and exercise habits that can become second nature and last a lifetime.", "title": "Jane Brody\u2019s Personal Secrets to Lasting Weight Loss", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "So one year in, what has Mr. Kushner accomplished? The answers point to why, from the nation\u2019s founding to the present day, the architects of American democracy have tried so mightily to restrict the hiring of presidential relatives. Mr. Kushner\u2019s achievements have not only been paltry, but he is directly implicated in some of the president\u2019s most destructive \u2014 and self-destructive \u2014 decisions, as well as in some of the most serious accusations of self-dealing that have been made against the administration.\n\nFor more than two centuries, the principle that federal officials would be selected on the basis of merit, not heredity, has been protected as much by tradition, cultural norms and a desire to avoid the appearance of impropriety as it has been by law. That has proved an insufficient bulwark against an insecure, ignorant president, and his administration, and the American people are now paying the price.\n\nWhat a liability Mr. Kushner has proved to be. American officials have intercepted conversations in which at least four countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates, discussed ways to take advantage of Mr. Kushner\u2019s indebtedness, na\u00efvet\u00e9 and ignorance of foreign policy to further their interests, according to The Washington Post. This week, The Times reported that Kushner Companies received hundreds of millions of dollars in loans through American companies, including Citigroup and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, after their top executives met with Mr. Kushner in the White House. The Qatari government\u2019s investment fund was a major investor in Apollo\u2019s real estate trust.\n\nThis was all occurring while Mr. Kushner had access to top-secret intelligence, despite having failed to secure a full security clearance. His faulty disclosures of his financial interests and foreign contacts and his indebtedness have most likely held up his clearance for more than a year. His access has been downgraded from top secret to secret, hardly reassuring.\n\nMr. Kushner leads the Office of American Innovation. This was once a forum for seeking ideas from the nation\u2019s top corporate executives, who served in advisory roles. But most of them resigned after Mr. Trump defended neo-Nazi protesters in the aftermath of a deadly riot in Charlottesville, Va. The office\u2019s effort to continue the overhaul of outmoded government computer networks, begun under President Barack Obama, has been slowed, according to people working on the project, partly because many government agencies lack chief information officers and other experts to implement the change. Mr. Kushner is partly responsible for the vacancies. Even though Chris Christie, then governor of New Jersey, was running a credible presidential transition, Mr. Kushner helped oust him. (When Mr. Christie was a United States attorney he sent Mr. Kushner\u2019s father, Charles, to federal prison for tax evasion, illegal campaign donation and witness tampering.) Of the nearly 640 key Senate-confirmed positions that President Trump can appoint, fewer than half have been confirmed \u2014 the most laggard staffing record in decades.\n\nThe innovation office was also supposed to focus on the opioid crisis, but a comprehensive list of recommendations written by a presidential commission last year is mostly gathering dust.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The Kushner family\u2019s friendship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Kushner Companies\u2019 extensive business ties to Israel fueled skepticism among Palestinian leaders. Any hopes of progress were effectively dashed when the president recognized Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a coup for Israel for which the United States got nothing in return.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFinally, there\u2019s Mr. Kushner\u2019s role as senior presidential adviser. Mr. Kushner\u2019s multiple contacts with Kremlin-connected Russians while helping to run Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and transition are now part of the special counsel\u2019s inquiry into whether Trump operatives colluded with Russia\u2019s effort to swing the campaign in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. Fortified by Mr. Kushner\u2019s advice, Mr. Trump fired F.B.I. Director James Comey, hoping to derail the investigation. This colossally foolish decision led to Robert Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel, and the beginning of a criminal investigation that could range widely through Team Trump\u2019s finances and connections.\n\nMr. Kushner pushed for the hiring of Paul Manafort as Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, despite Mr. Manafort\u2019s history of shadowy lobbying contracts with Kremlin allies. He also backed Michael Flynn\u2019s appointment as national security adviser, a job he lost after it became public that he lied about discussing American sanctions against Moscow with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. Mr. Manafort is now under indictment, charged by Mr. Mueller with a range of financial crimes, including that he concealed years of lobbying for the pro-Russia government in Ukraine, and laundered millions of dollars in proceeds from that work. Mr. Flynn has pleaded guilty to making false statements to the F.B.I. about his conversations with the Russian ambassador and is cooperating with the special counsel. Some of those conversations, portrayed in the indictment as part of a coordinated effort by Trump aides to create foreign policy before they were in power, were apparently at the direction of Mr. Kushner.\n\nMr. Kushner attended the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Russians who promised \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton. When news of that meeting leaked last year, Donald Trump Jr. initially said the topic was adoptions. The truth later came out, and the meeting is part of the F.B.I. inquiry.\n\nIn December of 2016, Mr. Kushner held a private meeting with Sergey Gorkov, who runs a Kremlin-connected Moscow bank under sanctions by the United States. A White House official said the meeting was under the auspices of the presidential transition, while the Russians said Mr. Kushner was acting in his capacity as head of Kushner Companies. Federal and congressional investigators say the meeting may have been part of an effort by Mr. Kushner to establish a direct line to President Vladimir Putin of Russia outside established diplomatic channels.\n\nMr. Kushner said his failure to disclose the Trump Tower meeting, the Gorkov meeting and scores of other foreign contacts as part of his application for security clearance was an error.\n\nAt this point, the right question to ask is why Mr. Kushner still has any diplomatic role at all.\n\nThe Kushner family is scouring the globe for investors to shoulder billions in debt and redevelopment costs that Jared Kushner encumbered the company with when he bought a skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue, at a record price for the time. How handy, then, that Mr. Kushner, who still owns a hefty stake in the Kushner Companies, is Mr. Trump\u2019s chief liaison with some two dozen nations, often operating outside formal guidance by the State Department or the National Security Council.\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Kushner met with Anbang Insurance Group, a conglomerate closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party, about a joint venture in the 666 Fifth Avenue project, potentially worth billions, even though Anbang\u2019s shadowy ownership had drawn national security concerns. The talks ended after a storm of Democratic outrage, but that didn\u2019t stop the Kushners from continuing to trawl for Chinese investments, using Mr. Kushner\u2019s big White House job as a lure.\n\nLast May, Mr. Kushner\u2019s sister Nicole Meyer mentioned her brother and Mr. Trump in a pitch to Chinese investors in Beijing. This time the Kushners were seeking $150 million in financing for a Jersey City housing development, through the EB-5 visa program, derided as \u201cU.S. citizenship for sale\u201d because it awards foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in American enterprises with a path to citizenship. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Kushner Companies\u2019 past use of the EB-5 visa program. Federal prosecutors have sought records on Kushner Companies from Deutsche Bank, which over the years has lent hundreds of millions to the Kushner and Trump family businesses. Last week, the New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates New York and some international banks, asked Deutsche Bank, Signature Bank and several others for information about their relationships with Mr. Kushner and his finances, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Kushner has spent his career until now inside a cocoon of family wealth and connections. Former associates say that as chief executive of Kushner Companies and as owner of the struggling New York Observer, which the Kushners bought in 2006, Mr. Kushner disregarded relevant experience and rules, leaving it to lawyers and advisers to clean up his mistakes.\n\nIt\u2019s beginning to dawn on Mr. Kushner that Washington doesn\u2019t work like that. And the walls seem to be closing in on him. John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, has been working to narrow Mr. Kushner\u2019s lane, and limit his access to classified material and briefings. But as F.B.I. investigators circle the West Wing and extend their scrutiny to the Kushner businesses, Mr. Kushner might still want the protective umbrella of the White House.\n\nClearly, Americans deserve better from their public servants, but the law doesn\u2019t provide sufficient protection from a president who doesn\u2019t get that. Firming up the anti-nepotism law to cover White House advisers has been criticized as an infringement on a president\u2019s right to seek private personal counsel. But Congress could require that presidential appointees across the federal government possess relevant credentials and experience, that they meet enforceable performance metrics, and \u2014 do we really need to say this? \u2014 that they can pass a background check. If Mr. Kushner\u2019s performance inspires such reforms, it could prove his only real achievement.", "title": "Jared Kushner Flames Out", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"]}

There they would have beheld the man, dying on a cross. \u2026 As far as Pilate was concerned, that was the end of the matter.\u201d\n\nBut of course it wasn\u2019t. As N. T. Wright, the prolific biblical scholar and a former Anglican bishop of Durham, England, relates in his 2003 book, \u201cThe Resurrection of the Son of God,\u201d the story in many ways really begins when Jesus\u2019 female disciples find the empty tomb on Sunday morning. According to the Gospel of Luke, the male disciples at first treated the women\u2019s report as \u201can idle tale,\u201d and \u201cdid not believe them\u201d; the Gospel of John says of Jesus\u2019 followers, \u201cfor as yet they did not understand \u2026 that he must rise from the dead.\u201d\n\nThey dismissed the first report of the Resurrection because they\u2019d been expecting a different new reality. They were still, in the painful hours after the Passion, crushed that their messiah, far from leading the forces of God to victory over the Romans, had instead been mocked and murdered. It was only in the shocked aftermath of the Crucifixion, of the empty tomb and of the post-Resurrection appearances, that the first followers seem to have worked out what it all meant. As late as the writings of Paul, believers held that a \u201cParousia,\u201d or apocalyptic Second Coming, was imminent. In this view, Jesus, rather than ushering in the kingdom as one of their number \u2014 the expectation before the Crucifixion \u2014 would return to earth at any hour and set things to rights. This never happened, leaving the disciples and their heirs in the decades after Jesus to construct an enduring faith for a world that would not end. They then recalled \u2014 or believed they recalled \u2014 words of Jesus (along with miracles such as the raising from the dead of Lazarus, Jairus\u2019 daughter and the son of the widow of Nain) that seemed to foreshadow the Resurrection and its significance.\n\nFor Wright, the Easter story is not only theologically but historically true. In part, the mystification of the disciples \u2014 presumably the ones who would have spirited away the corpse if it were all a hoax \u2014 is, from this perspective, the most compelling evidence of the accuracy of the events reported in the Gospels. So singular was the proposition that a particular person had been resurrected from the dead and that belief in him would lead to eternal salvation; it would hardly have been the early Christians\u2019 first choice of narratives to share. Why argue something so improbable, and so unexpected, unless they believed it had actually happened the way they told the story?", "title": "Jesus Died Only to Rise Again.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Anti-Semitism was supposed to be a disease of the far right. But the people actually killing Jews in France these days are not members of the National Front. They are Islamists.\n\n\u201cThe major crimes against the Jewish community \u2014 Ilan Halimi, the Toulouse killings, the Hyper Cacher killings, Sarah Halimi \u2014 all of them have all been carried out by radicalized Muslims,\u201d Robert Ejnes, the executive director of CRIF, an umbrella organization of French Jewish groups, told me in a call from Paris. \u201cThese young people have French identity cards, but they hate what France stands for. This is the nature of the problem we are facing. And it\u2019s very hard to talk about.\u201d\n\nHere are some facts that are very hard to talk about: Jews represent less than 1 percent of the population in France, yet in 2014, 51 percent of all racist attacks were carried out against them, according to the French Interior Ministry. A survey from that year of about 1,000 French respondents with unknown religious affiliation and 575 self-identified Muslims, conducted by the AJC Paris and the French think tank Fondapol, found that the Muslim respondents were two or three times more likely to have anti-Jewish sentiments than those from the random French group. Nineteen percent of all respondents felt that Jews had \u201ctoo much\u201d political power. Among Muslims, the number was 51 percent. As for the idea that Zionism \u201cis an international organization that aims to influence the world and society in favor of the Jews,\u201d 44 percent of Muslims surveyed approved of this statement. The rest of the survey is just as devastating.\n\nFor years now, France has deployed armed troops to protect Jewish synagogues and schools. But the violence on the streets \u2014 a 15-year-old girl wearing the uniform of her Jewish school slashed in the face; an 8-year-old boy wearing a kippah assaulted; teenage siblings called \u201cdirty Jews\u201d before being beaten \u2014 hasn\u2019t abated. On Wednesday, hours before a march in honor of Mireille Knoll, the office of the Union of French Jewish Students at the Sorbonne was ransacked and defaced with graffiti like \u201cViva Arafat\u201d and \u201cdeath to Israel.\u201d\n\nWhatever else the investigation of Ms. Knoll\u2019s murder might reveal, this much we know for certain: The men who are accused of killing her were living in a culture in which Jews are reviled on the far right and, increasingly, on the far left; in which sensitivity toward cultural differences have driven too many for too long to ignore the spread of an ancient hatred in a vicious new form; in which attacks on Jews have been explained away as politically motivated by events in the Middle East. In such a culture, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that some would come to the conclusion that Jewish blood is cheap.\n\nIn the wake of Ms. Knoll\u2019s murder, all of the usual lines are being repeated. Anti-Semitism is the hatred that never dies. Violence that begins with the Jews never ends with them.\n\nAll of this is true. What\u2019s also true is that anti-Semitism is the oldest hatred in the world because individual people have sustained it in every generation. It cannot be defeated until we look these people and their ideologies in the face.\n\nEvery French Jew \u2014 like millions of Jews throughout history \u2014 will have to make their own choice about whether to leave their homes for safer shores or to stay and fight for their rightful place in a country that prides itself on being a beacon of liberty and fraternity. But perhaps the better part of wisdom is with one of Mireille Knoll\u2019s granddaughters, Noa Goldfarb. Following her grandmother\u2019s murder, she wrote in a Facebook post from Israel: \u201cTwenty years ago, I left Paris knowing that neither my future nor that of the Jewish People is to be found there.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Jews Are Being Murdered in Paris.

His father was a cement mason. His mother, the former Marguerite Hernandez, was a school secretary.\n\nEven when he was a small boy, voting rights were a concern, he recalled in 2012 when he accepted the Harvard Law School Association Award. He was haunted early on by a television image of a mob chasing an elderly black person who was trying to register.\n\n\u201cI could not understand why that was the case,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1970 from Yale, where he switched his major to political science from astrophysics, and a law degree from Harvard, he joined the Texas-based staff of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in 1974. He later directed the organization\u2019s voting rights program and was its president and general counsel from 1982 to 1985.\n\n\u201cJoaquin\u2019s contributions to voting rights and to Latino civil rights have had a profound and incalculable impact, to the benefit of every person living in the United States,\u201d Thomas A. Saenz, the defense fund\u2019s current president, said in a statement.\n\nWith Mr. Avila representing the fund, a federal district court in Texas accepted his reasoning that school boards were \u201cpolitical jurisdictions\u201d under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That meant that any changes in district boundaries and election procedures had to be reviewed in advance by the Justice Department.\n\nSome of those requirements were overturned by the United States Supreme Court in 2013.\n\nAn amendment to the 1965 act for which he successfully lobbied in 1982 defined election practices as unfair if their effect could be proved to be discriminatory, regardless of their intent.\n\nAnd his work in helping to draft California\u2019s 2001 Voting Rights Act, the only such state legislation at the time, led to a provision requiring that a plaintiff\u2019s legal fees be reimbursed by a government if it loses or settles a case.\n\nIn 1996, Mr. Avila was awarded a fellowship by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the so-called genius grant.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "In an interview on Thursday evening on Fox, Mr. Bolton said he recognized that his role would be to play the honest broker bringing different views to the president, and that it would be up to Mr. Trump to make the decisions.\n\nBut he made clear that he also planned to be Mr. Trump\u2019s enforcer. When the president makes a decision, he said, part of his job will be \u201cmaking sure the bureaucracies get the decision and implement it.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton criticized the frequent leaks out of Mr. Trump\u2019s national security team, saying that a president cannot conduct diplomacy \u201cif some munchkin in the White House\u201d is leaking information to the news media. \u201cLeaking of that sort is simply unacceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s appointment elicited mixed reviews. \u201cSelecting John Bolton as national security adviser is good news for America\u2019s allies and bad news for America\u2019s enemies,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. \u201cHe has a firm understanding of the threats we face from North Korea, Iran and radical Islam.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, expressed concern that a bomb thrower in words could become a bomb thrower in deeds. \u201cBolton played a key role in politicizing the intel that misled us into the Iraq War,\u201d Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe cannot let this extreme war hawk blunder us into another terrible conflict.\u201d\n\nClifford Kupchan, the chairman of the Eurasia Group, a consultant firm, sent a note to clients warning that Mr. Bolton\u2019s appointment \u201cincreases risk across the board,\u201d adding that it \u201cmakes U.S. foreign policy \u2018America First on Steroids.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt one point, Mr. Bolton toyed with running for president himself, only to back off. Instead, he created an organization to support like-minded candidates. His \u201csuper PAC\u201d was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which has found itself confronting a deepening crisis after reports last weekend that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe firm was founded with a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor who has backed both Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC and Mr. Trump. Cambridge\u2019s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm\u2019s methods. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC.\n\nUsing the psychographic models, the company designed advertisements from candidates supported by Mr. Bolton\u2019s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina. One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at fearful and neurotic voters \u2014 it emphasized security and the idea that Mr. Tillis could keep the United States safe.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The report said the video was part of an effort by Russian and American gun rights groups to collaborate in the years leading up to the 2016 election.\n\nA native of Baltimore, Mr. Bolton, 69, received undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. In between stints in private practice, he took a series of increasingly important jobs in government, starting at the United States Agency for International Development under President Ronald Reagan and later as an assistant attorney general.\n\nAfter the 2000 election, Mr. Bolton joined the Republican legal team in Florida during the recount battle between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore. After the Supreme Court halted the recount, resulting in Mr. Bush\u2019s victory, Dick Cheney, the new vice president, persuaded the incoming secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, to make Mr. Bolton an under secretary in charge of arms control. In that role, he helped pull the United States out of the Antiballistic Missile treaty but negotiated a separate treaty with Russia paring nuclear arsenals.\n\nWhen Condoleezza Rice succeeded Mr. Powell, she rebuffed pressure from Mr. Cheney to make Mr. Bolton her deputy. Instead, Mr. Bush nominated him for the United Nations post, but key Republicans opposed him, including a former assistant secretary of state who testified that Mr. Bolton was a \u201ckiss-up, kick-down sort of guy\u201d who abused underlings.\n\nAfter the Senate refused to confirm Mr. Bolton, Mr. Bush gave him a recess appointment instead \u2014 a decision he would come to regret. Mr. Bolton clashed regularly with Ms. Rice and, after leaving office, broke with Mr. Bush over what he saw as weak-kneed policies on North Korea and Iran.\n\nHe titled his memoir \u201cSurrender Is Not an Option,\u201d and called the Foreign Service officers in the State Department\u2019s East Asian and Pacific Affairs Bureau the \u201cEAPeasers.\u201d He even went after Mr. Bush. \u201cNothing can erase the ineffable sadness of an American presidency, like this one, in total intellectual collapse,\u201d he wrote in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMr. Bush bristled and, in a private meeting with a group of conservatives, said, \u201cLet me just say from the outset that I don\u2019t consider Bolton credible.\u201d Other former colleagues fought back more publicly. Christopher Hill, who negotiated with North Korea for Mr. Bush, dismissed Mr. Bolton as \u201cPhyllis Schlafly with a mustache.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016, Ms. Rice and other Bush administration veterans like former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Stephen J. Hadley, the former national security adviser, privately warned against an appointment for Mr. Bolton.\n\nMr. Trump considered Mr. Bolton for several posts but ultimately backed away each time. Unlike some of them, national security adviser does not require Senate confirmation. In the interim, Mr. Bolton has repeatedly praised Mr. Trump on television and in his Wall Street Journal columns even when the two disagreed.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter this month that sanctions on Mr. Putin and his inner circle needed to be tougher. \u201cIf you want to punish a country for behavior you don\u2019t accept, you need punishing sanctions that are broad, not targeted, and they need to be enforced,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a Journal column, he made the case for a pre-emptive military strike against North Korea. \u201cGiven the gaps in U.S. intelligence about North Korea, we should not wait until the very last minute,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat would risk striking after the North has deliverable nuclear weapons, a much more dangerous situation.\u201d Other options, he told a reporter, would be persuading China to topple North Korea\u2019s government or reuniting the peninsula under South Korean rule, although he acknowledged neither was likely.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, he went on Fox to disdain South Korea\u2019s willingness to negotiate with North Korea. \u201cThey\u2019re like putty in North Korea\u2019s hands,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the great international relations theorist P. T. Barnum put it, there\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201d Two days later, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation to meet with North Korea\u2019s Mr. Kim.\n\nAs he prepared to take on his new assignment, however, Mr. Bolton was careful to minimize any differences with Mr. Trump. Asked Thursday evening on Fox about the president\u2019s decision to congratulate Mr. Putin on winning an election that most of the world considered a sham, Mr. Bolton said, \u201cI don\u2019t consider it a significant point one way or the other,\u201d adding, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of being polite.\u201d", "title": "John Bolton, an Undiplomatic Voice for American Might", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

They not only shared the same office (the sign on the door said \u201cThe Cacioppos\u201d) but also the same desk. They collaborated on more than a dozen articles about the neurology of social connections. In 2015, when he developed salivary gland cancer, they slept in the same hospital bed, in matching hospital gowns.\n\nDr. John Cacioppo died on March 5 at home in Chicago. He was 66. His wife said the cause had not yet been determined.\n\nDr. Cacioppo (pronounced kass-ee-OH-po) and his Ohio State University colleague Gary Berntson were, in the early 1990s, the founding fathers of what they called social neuroscience.\n\nA new academic domain, it bridged biology and psychology and was inspired, Dr. Cacioppo once explained, by an insight he had after surviving a near-fatal car crash: that love and social connections are what really matter in life.\n\nHe likened loneliness to hunger, explaining that it helps naturally gregarious humans establish mutually beneficial relationships that meet social needs vital to survival.\n\nHe estimated that about one in four Americans are lonely, without any confidants, and that social isolation results in negative emotional and physical consequences.\n\n\u201cChronic loneliness increases the odds of an early death by 20 percent,\u201d Dr. Cacioppo told The Guardian in 2016, \u201cwhich is about the same effect as obesity, though obesity does not make you as miserable as loneliness.\u201d (Although, he pointed out, loneliness can also make you gain weight if you binge on sweets to ease your misery.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe drew a distinction between loneliness and being alone.\n\n\u201cIn animals, it\u2019s not separating a monkey from any companion; it\u2019s separating them from a preferred companion,\u201d he said in an interview last year with The Atlantic magazine. \u201cBeing with others doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to feel connected, and being alone doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to feel lonely.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he said, having fewer social connections can sometimes be healthier.\n\n\u201cMillionaires, billionaires tend to feel lonely,\u201d Dr. Cacioppo said. \u201cA lot of athletes often feel lonely. Lots of people want to be their friend, but how would you feel if all the people who want to be your friend, you had the alternative interpretation \u2014 that they want material or social benefits that you could give them.\u201d\n\nAt his death, Dr. Cacioppo was a psychology professor at the University of Chicago, director of the university\u2019s Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience and chairman of the Social Psychology Program.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe received scores of awards, was the author of hundreds of articles and more than a dozen books, including his seminal \u201cLoneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connections\u201d (2008), which he wrote with William Patrick.\n\n\u201cHe is a creative genius whose cumulative accomplishments are so inseparable from the field that it is hard to imagine contemporary psychology without him,\u201d said another collaborator at Ohio State, Professor Richard E. Petty.\n\nProfessor Amanda Woodward, interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences at the University of Chicago, said Dr. Cacioppo had \u201can uncommon genius \u2014 he was a brilliant scientist and was unique in his ability to see deep connections across diverse fields and to create generative new theoretical frameworks.\u201d\n\nJohn Terrence Cacioppo was born on June 12, 1951, in Marshall Tex., to Cyrus Cacioppo and the former Mary Katherine Kazimour. His parents owned several businesses, including a chain saw distribution company.\n\nA math prodigy in high school, Dr. Cacioppo was the first in his family to attend college. He received a bachelor of science degree in economics in 1973 from the University of Missouri, where a chance meeting with a psychology professor persuaded him to abandon a law career and pursue a doctorate in social psychology at Ohio State; he received his in 1977.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and Richard Petty, who was also a first-year graduate student at the time, engaged in so many intellectual arguments that they became roommates, painted an entire wall black and used it to map competing postulates.\n\nAfter teaching at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Iowa, he returned to Ohio State in 1989, joined a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation research network in 1995 and the University of Chicago faculty in 1999.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Dr. Stephanie Cacioppo, director of the Brain Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Chicago and a research professor at the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience there, he is survived by two children, Anthony and Christina, both from an earlier marriage, which ended in divorce.\n\nThe social neuroscience first defined by Dr. Cacioppo and Professor Berntson spawned research into the impact of personal relationships on physiology, including cognition, emotions and physical health.\n\nDr. Cacioppo cautioned that confiding to a psychotherapist was not a substitute for having friends and companions.\n\n\u201cBeing just a client of a psychotherapist fulfills some needs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t fulfill that real need to have a rich reciprocal bond.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, he said the internet\u2019s role in forming social connections depends on whether a website becomes just a destination.\n\n\u201cIf the only acceptance you can get of yourself is a fake representation on the web, that\u2019s not going to make you feel connected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at online dating, there you\u2019re using it to meet other people, so not surprisingly that tends to be associated with lower levels of loneliness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Stephanie Cacioppo agreed that loneliness and being alone are different.\n\n\u201cI think we both had come to be real fans of loneliness before we met each other,\u201d she wrote in an email on Monday. \u201cAs John would say, and I agreed with him: \u2018If you think about what our species would be like without loneliness, it would not be nearly as endearing a species. Loneliness, which compels us to bond with others, gives us what we call Humanity.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen her husband was sick, she was quoted as saying last year in a \u201cModern Love\u201d column in The New York Times, \u201cAs a couple, we became more united than ever.\u201d\n\nShe wrote on Monday: \u201cI did not know what true love was until I met my husband.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "He died, of stomach cancer, on March 6 at 75, according to the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a British genome research organization in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, where he had been the founding director. The institute did not say where he died.\n\nA soft-spoken man with bristly hair and a beard and always a modest demeanor \u2014 he humbly took a cheese sandwich for lunch each day \u2014 Dr. Sulston lived by one of his favorite dictums: \u201cThere is no point in wasting good thoughts on bad data.\u201d\n\nThe Nobel he received, shared with two other scientists, recognized the good data he amassed in his work on the tiny transparent roundworm C. elegans in an effort to better understand how organisms develop.\n\nPhoto\n\nA simple creature, the worm attracted scientists because they could see each of its cells without staining them. And because the worm contains so few cells, they believed it could be possible to understand every step of its 14-day life by tracking the cells as they followed a program determined by their genes.\n\nThe hope was that by eliciting changes in the DNA that made up those genes, researchers could figure out what genes were needed to drive each stage of the worm\u2019s life, possibly deriving a road map that could lead to insights into the development of more complex organisms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Sulston came to the worm, in the 1960s, through Sydney Brenner, a charismatic British scientist who would share the 2002 Nobel with him. (The third scientist to share the prize was H. Robert Horvitz of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.)\n\nDr. Brenner was the worm\u2019s champion, seeing it as the scientists\u2019 successor to the fruit fly, a favorite of researchers studying inheritance and development. Dr. Sulston was won over, and began working with Dr. Brenner.\n\nAt the time, it was widely believed that the 558 cells the worm had when it hatched were all it would ever have. But Dr. Sulston noticed that, in fact, the worm kept gaining cells as it developed. And by tracing the patterns of divisions that gave rise to those new cells, he found, surprisingly, that the worm also lost cells in a predictable way. Certain cells were destined to die at a specific time, digesting their own DNA.\n\nDr. Sulston\u2019s next major project was to trace the fate of every single cell in a worm. It was a task so demanding and labor-intensive that other scientists still shake their heads in amazement that he got it done.\n\nEach day, bending over his microscope for eight or more hours, he would start with a worm embryo and choose one of its cells. He would then watch the cell as it divided and follow each of its progeny cells as, together, they grew and formed the organism. This went on for a total of 18 months.\n\nIn the end, he had a complete map of every one of the worm\u2019s 959 cells (not counting sperm and egg cells).\n\n\u201cEvery cell had a fate,\u201d explained Eric Lander, director of the Broad Institute, a biomedical and genomic research center associated with M.I.T. and Harvard.\n\nAfter that, Dr. Sulston moved on to map the worm\u2019s genes. This was in the mid-1980s, when gene mapping was in its infancy. Dr. Sulston and his colleagues broke the worm\u2019s DNA into 17,000 large random and overlapping pieces, characterized each piece by cutting it into small fragments, and then patched the pieces together.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe map was a perfect starting point for determining the sequence of the DNA that makes up the worm\u2019s genes. It would initiate the next stage of Dr. Sulston\u2019s career.\n\nHe and a colleague, Dr. Robert H. Waterston, began with the worm DNA \u2014 there was no plan yet to figure out the sequence of the three billion chemical building blocks that make up human DNA \u2014 when they got an offer from an entrepreneur, Frederic Bourke, who had made his fortune in leather goods. Mr. Bourke wanted to set the two up in a laboratory, where they could create a library of human gene sequences that he would then sell to scientists.\n\nDr. Sulston was repelled by the idea. Data, he believed, should be free.\n\nHe met Mr. Bourke in a hotel room in Berkeley, Calif., telling him he would absolutely not help him create that database.\n\nHe recalled Mr. Bourke replying, \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t going to damage you, John.\u201d\n\nDr. Sulston went on to help lead a joint effort by the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust in England to create a center to determine the sequence of the human genome. At Dr. Sulston\u2019s urging, it was named after Fred Sanger, who figured out how to sequence DNA, earning him two Nobel Prizes.\n\nThe joint project soon had a commercial competitor: Celera, a company, now in Alameda, Calif., run by the geneticist Craig Venter, who promised to deliver the sequence of the DNA in a human\u2019s cells \u2014 his \u2014 more quickly and efficiently and to sell his data.\n\nDr. Sulston was appalled.\n\n\u201cIt was not just the commercial bid itself that shocked,\u201d he said in his Nobel lecture; \u201cwhat was worse was that it gained support from all sorts of people for whom I\u2019d previously had respect. I still don\u2019t exactly know why, but part of the reason seems to be a business-style way in science nowadays, of following bandwagons and avoiding controversy in case things turn out politically against you.\u201d\n\nIn June 2000, when the public-effort team had a first draft of human DNA, the group wanted to write a paper. Not Dr. Sulston. His idea, Dr. Lander said, was \u201cjust put all the data out there, write a half-page paper announcing its availability, and let the people have at it.\u201d\n\nInstead, the group wrote a 65-page paper, which was published in the journal Nature.\n\nAfter the draft sequence was done, Dr. Sulston announced that he would leave laboratory science and use his status as a Nobel laureate to speak up about \u201cthe sort of world we want.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGetting the prize,\u201d he wrote in an essay for the Nobel committee, \u201cprovides us all with a higher platform from which (if we don\u2019t fall off through excessive gesticulation) we can have more influence than we did before.\u201d\n\nDr. Sulston took a position at the University of Manchester, where he was chairman of the Institute of Science, Ethics and Innovation, retiring in 2016.\n\nJohn Edward Sulston was born on March 27, 1942, outside London in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, to the Rev. Canon Ted Sulston and the former Muriel Blocksidge, an English teacher. After attending private schools, Dr. Sulston graduated from Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge in 1963 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in natural sciences. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry there in 1966.\n\nThat same year he married Daphne Bate, a research assistant in the university\u2019s geophysics department. For a time in the late 1960s he did research on the molecular origins of life at the Salk Institute in San Diego.\n\nWith Georgina Ferry, Dr. Sulston wrote \u201cThe Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics, and the Human Genome\u201d (2002). He was knighted in 2001.\n\nHis survivors, according to The Guardian, include his wife; his children, Ingrid and Adrian; two grandchildren; and a sister, Madeleine. He lived in Stapleford, Cambridgeshire.\n\n\u201cHe was an amazing scientist, a wonderful human being and a special friend,\u201d Dr. Horvitz, his fellow Nobel laureate, said in an interview. \u201cHis impact on the world has been mostly underrecognized, but will continue through the generations.\u201d", "title": "John E.

Unfortunately, such promising progress has been squandered.\n\nWe need to show equal resolve now to stop the violence and safeguard the rights and freedoms of all Burmese peoples.

The coordinated decision by the State Department and the European Union to cease consideration of travel waivers for current and former senior leaders of the Burmese military is a good start, but it is not enough.\n\nPassing the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act, a bill sponsored by Senator McCain, would impose sanctions on Burmese military and security forces responsible for the bloodshed and send the strong message that those who commit atrocities will pay a price. There can be no free and peaceful future for the country built on impunity for war crimes and persecution.\n\nSecond, we must support efforts to properly investigate human rights violations. The Burmese military has issued an official report exonerating its forces of all accusations, and Burmese officials continue to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing as militant propaganda.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "For over 200 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment, it was uniformly understood as not placing any limit on either federal or state authority to enact gun control legislation. In 1939 the Supreme Court unanimously held that Congress could prohibit the possession of a sawed-off shotgun because that weapon had no reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a \u201cwell regulated militia.\u201d\n\nDuring the years when Warren Burger was our chief justice, from 1969 to 1986, no judge, federal or state, as far as I am aware, expressed any doubt as to the limited coverage of that amendment. When organizations like the National Rifle Association disagreed with that position and began their campaign claiming that federal regulation of firearms curtailed Second Amendment rights, Chief Justice Burger publicly characterized the N.R.A. as perpetrating \u201cone of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Supreme Court overturned Chief Justice Burger\u2019s and others\u2019 long-settled understanding of the Second Amendment\u2019s limited reach by ruling, in District of Columbia v. Heller, that there was an individual right to bear arms. I was among the four dissenters.\n\nThat decision \u2014 which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable \u2014 has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power. Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.\u2019s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.\n\nThat simple but dramatic action would move Saturday\u2019s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform. It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States \u2014 unlike every other market in the world.

She was given the job by a CPV executive, Peter Galbraith Kelly Jr., one of Mr. Percoco\u2019s co-defendants in the trial.\n\nThe jury found Mr. Percoco guilty of two criminal counts \u2014 one of conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and one of soliciting bribes \u2014 related to the alleged CPV scheme, but could not reach consensus on Mr. Kelly\u2019s involvement. Mr. Percoco was also found guilty of one count of conspiracy related to a separate Syracuse-area development company, as was a co-defendant, Steven Aiello, an executive with that company; a fourth defendant, Joseph Gerardi, also of the development company, was acquitted of all charges.\n\nMr. Percoco told reporters after the verdict that he was disappointed and that he and his lawyers would review options for appeal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful to my family and friends that have stood by me through this entire process,\u201d he said, \u201cand I look forward to them all standing by me as we go forward.\u201d\n\nMilton L.

Last week, after less than 20 hours of deliberations, they declared themselves deadlocked; sent back by the judge to continue deliberating, they declared themselves deadlocked again on Monday.\n\nThe panel\u2019s mounting frustration was evident, especially as the trial dragged well beyond its projected four- to six-week finish. Several jurors asked to be dismissed from the case, citing its physical and emotional toll.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Berman, said in a statement that Mr. Percoco had sold \u201csomething priceless that was not his to sell: the sacred obligation to honestly and faithfully serve the citizens of New York.\u201d\n\nMuch of the government\u2019s narrative of the bribery schemes revolved around Todd R. Howe, a disgraced former lobbyist and longtime Albany insider, who prosecutors said engineered the bribes from the executives to Mr. Percoco.\n\nMr. Howe, who had pleaded guilty to eight felonies and was cooperating with prosecutors, described how Mr. Percoco helped COR Development, the Syracuse company that employed Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi, evade a costly union requirement on a development, and wangled a pay raise for Mr. Aiello\u2019s son, who worked in state government. In return, Mr. Howe said, Mr. Percoco pressured the executives to help his wife land the job with the power company or to funnel thousands of dollars a month in covert payments.\n\nBut Mr. Howe at times seemed poised to be the prosecution\u2019s downfall, rather than its linchpin.\n\nIn early February, he was arrested midway through his testimony, after admitting during cross-examination that he had attempted to defraud his credit card company \u2014 after signing his cooperation agreement with the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe shocking development bolstered defense arguments that Mr. Howe was a self-interested liar whose testimony could not be believed; lawyers monitoring the case called the arrest a prosecutor\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nProsecutors also suggested that Mr. Percoco had violated New York State election and ethics laws by continuing to intervene in state business even after he left to work in the private sector. Witnesses said they had often seen Mr. Percoco in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s New York and Albany offices even after he was no longer a state employee. Public records indicate that Mr. Cuomo was often in the office at the same time.\n\nAnd if the dealings themselves were not unseemly enough, prosecutors said, many were carried out via bullying, name-calling and thinly veiled code words; Mr. Percoco\u2019s and Mr. Howe\u2019s use of \u201cziti\u201d to refer to money \u2014 a nod to the Mafia drama \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 was a frequent motif.\n\nAdvocates for government reform called the trial\u2019s outcome an indictment of Albany\u2019s culture. Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, said he hoped the verdict would compel Albany \u201cto deal with its ethics problem.\u201d John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, said the trial had revealed a state government \u201criddled with pay-to-play influence-peddling.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governor has to redeem himself,\u201d Mr. Kaehny said.\n\nOther major Albany corruption trials are scheduled to follow in the coming months: those of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and longtime former Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, a Republican and former Senate majority leader. Both men are being retried after their convictions were overturned on appeal last year.\n\nAnd in June, another former Cuomo ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, will stand trial in a case that may cast further unflattering light on the governor\u2019s administration. The trial of Mr. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University\u2019s Polytechnic Institute, involves bid-rigging in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s signature upstate economic development plan, the so-called Buffalo Billion. Mr. Aiello and Mr. Gerardi also face charges in that trial.\n\nMr. Howe was expected to testify in the Buffalo trial as well.\n\nBarry A. Bohrer, a lawyer for Mr. Percoco, declined to address a question about whether Mr. Percoco, who is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Valerie E. Caproni on June 11, was a victim of political maneuvering. But, he said, \u201cit is a difficult time and place to be trying a case involving Albany politics.\u201d\n\nAsked outside the courthouse if he had spoken to Mr. Cuomo about the verdict, Mr. Percoco cracked a smile.\n\n\u201cI just walked out of the building,\u201d he said.", "title": "Joseph Percoco, Ex-Cuomo Aide, Found Guilty in Corruption Trial", "authors": ["Vivian Wang", "Benjamin Weiser"]}

You\u2019ve got \u201cLady Bird\u201d in one corner, the last \u201cX-Men\u201d extravaganza in the other. You\u2019ve got either no explosions or so many fireballs in the last 15 minutes that you leave the theater half-blind and with temporary hearing loss. But that leads me to a quasi-prediction, or rather a question: Couldn\u2019t \u201cGet Out\u201d take the prize because it best straddles the divide? Bold idea, familiar genre, big box office? It\u2019s like the centrist candidate in an election with only far-left and far-right alternatives otherwise.\n\nObst: If there\u2019s a surprise winner, it could be \u201cGet Out.\u201d Add all the people who just loved this movie, and all the pro-diversity voters, plus everyone who liked nothing more than this, and it\u2019s a big number given this weird algorithm of preferential voting. And the industry loves \u201cGet Out\u201d so much. It didn\u2019t cost much. It was wildly clever and reinvented a genre. It was funny and scary. It showed us life from an African-American point of view \u2014 in a way that I will never experience the suburbs where I grew up in the same way again. And there will be so many new movies created in its wake!\n\nBruni: I guess you could say \u201cDunkirk\u201d is also a centrist candidate, but everyone I know who saw it was so cold to it that it\u2019s one of the rare best picture nominees I skipped. Don\u2019t tell anyone! Oops, too late.\n\nObst: Don\u2019t forget that Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan (and Ridley Scott) are among the only directors who make commercial blockbusters \u2014 or at least, if not blockbusters, big studio movies that reliably are nominated for Oscars, and that is a lot to ask of this diversifying academy. And in the old days, the studios did not have indie filmmakers all over the globe making $3 million movies of their choosing to compete with. They had a monopoly.\n\nDouthat: But they\u2019re the only directors who get the chance to make movies that are big and also serious because every other promising director gets shunted into superhero franchises and is never seen again!", "title": "Opinion | Just How Woke Will the Oscars Be?", "authors": []}

Litigation would tie up the bump stock ban in the courts.\n\nLegal experts say that groups that sue could win because bump stock makers specifically designed the devices so they could not qualify as machine guns under the law.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

It\u2019s like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe controversial new rule is in keeping with Mr. Sessions\u2019s practice of closely hewing to White House political directives, sometimes remaining silent in the face of criticism from Mr. Trump and other times rebuking his own employees.\n\nBefore the Justice Department issued any measures of its own, Mr. Trump had publicly declared that he would use executive authority to ban bump stocks, and he ordered the department to find a way to prohibit them.\n\nThis month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump.\n\nThe department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting.\n\nMr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings.\n\nMr. Sessions also ordered federal prosecutors to more aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on gun purchasing applications, a move that The New York Times reported last month.\n\nEach year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is a felony to lie on that application, but the crime is rarely prosecuted. From 2008 to 2015, prosecutors considered fewer than 32 cases a year, according to the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.\n\n\u201cUnder my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high \u2014 and we are just getting started,\u201d Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures.\n\nThose past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation.\n\nBut the Justice Department\u2019s latest move, which Mr. Sessions previewed in an announcement this month, will be met with more opposition.\n\n\u201cYou need Congress to pass a statute,\u201d Mr. Blackman said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you change a law, not through executive action.\u201d", "title": "Justice Dept.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.\n\n\u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d\n\nAnd Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks.

{"date": "2018-03-15 00:00:00", "text": "In an article in the latest issue of the Harvard Law Review titled \u201cStatutory Interpretation on the Bench,\u201d Richard A. Posner, the former federal judge, and Professor Abbe R. Gluck of Yale Law School describe the contortions required by Justice Scalia\u2019s obstinacy. Before his death, the authors write, \u201cit was common to see opinions that placed all discussion of legislative history in a final, separate part so that Justice Scalia could join the entire opinion except for that part.\u201d\n\nIn last month\u2019s case, Justice Thomas\u2019s separate opinion in turn provoked Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Breyer, to issue an opinion underscoring their agreement with Justice Ginsburg\u2019s use of legislative history. Their concurring opinion reads like a declaration of independence in a post-Scalia world. \u201cI write separately only to note my disagreement with the suggestion in my colleague\u2019s concurrence that a Senate Report is not an appropriate source for this court to consider when interpreting a statute,\u201d Justice Sotomayor wrote. She continued: \u201cLegislative history is of course not the law, but that does not mean it cannot aid us in our understanding of a law.\u201d Her opinion concluded: \u201cI do not think it wise for judges to close their eyes to reliable legislative history \u2014 and the realities of how members of Congress create and enact laws \u2014 when it is available.\u201d\n\nIf the days of linguistic contortions are over for those who would use legislative history, contortions may now be the order of the day for those justices who object to its use \u2014 only to find that they have to use it anyway. On the same day that it decided the Dodd-Frank case, the court also issued an opinion in a criminal case, Class v. United States. The question was whether a defendant who pleads guilty can then proceed to challenge the constitutionality of the statute that he has just admitted violating. The answer, in a 6 to 3 opinion by Justice Breyer, was yes. Justice Alito wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure treats a guilty plea as waiving such a claim. The notes of the advisory committee that drafted the current rule in 1983 \u201cmake this clear,\u201d Justice Alito wrote.\n\nNotes? A committee? Sounds like legislative history, but Justice Alito took pains to explain in a footnote why, in his estimation, it wasn\u2019t. \u201cAdvisory Committee\u2019s Notes should not be equated with congressional committee reports and other items of legislative history,\u201d he wrote, explaining that the notes are part of the official package of recommendations that the Supreme Court eventually submits to Congress.\n\nI find Justice Alito\u2019s distinction elusive at best. Under the Rules Enabling Act, proposed amendments to the rules governing federal court procedure become effective unless Congress acts by a specific deadline to disapprove them. In other words, the default rule is adoption by congressional passivity. Why should this make the preliminary committee paperwork more rather than less reliable as an indication of congressional intent than for a bill on which members actually vote? It is a question that Justice Alito\u2019s footnote hardly answers.\n\nNo matter. In his majority opinion, Justice Breyer dug deeper into Rule 11, found that the committee notes actually pointed in the opposite direction, and concluded that the rule \u201ccannot resolve this case.\u201d\n\nDuring the Scalia era, useful clues to legislative meaning were studiously ignored by lawyers and judges alike, even though very few lower-court judges were ever as rigid as Justice Scalia in their approach to statutory interpretation. For their Harvard Law Review article, Judge Posner and Professor Gluck interviewed 42 federal appellate judges and found none who flatly refused to use legislative history \u2014 and a number who spoke, anonymously, with surprising disdain toward the Supreme Court\u2019s rule-bound approach to interpreting statutes.\n\nWith a handful of exceptions, most notably his 2008 majority opinion that established a right under the Second Amendment to keep a handgun at home for self-defense, Justice Scalia\u2019s 30-year Supreme Court tenure left surprisingly little imprint on the law in terms of majority opinions that bear his name. Invited to assess his legacy, his admirers invariably point to the influence of his insistence on originalism in constitutional interpretation and textualism for statutes. Debates over how to read the Constitution preceded Antonin Scalia and will be with us forever. But the debate about legislative history is a fading memory.", "title": "Opinion | Justice Scalia\u2019s Fading Legacy", "authors": []}

Division I swimming and diving championships.\n\nLedecky, who won five medals (four gold) at the 2016 Rio Games, will continue to train at Stanford with the women\u2019s coach, Greg Meehan, as she pursues an undergraduate degree in psychology and prepares for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nLedecky, 21, said in an email that she had been mulling the decision since August. In multiple discussions with Meehan, she said, they came to the conclusion that this was the best time to make the transition to the pro ranks \u201cin order to set myself up to try to achieve my best performance leading to the 2020 Olympic Trials.\u201d\n\nA major factor in Ledecky\u2019s decision was that the major international competitions before the Olympics, as well as the Olympics themselves, are contested in long-course meters, while the college season is conducted in short-course yards. To excel in a 25-yard course requires a different kind of training, with an emphasis on turns and a faster stroke turnover. In long course, where the number of turns is cut in half, the emphasis is on endurance and maintaining one\u2019s stroke.

Her uncharacteristically tranquil 11-point performance in the Buckeyes\u2019 87-45 victory over George Washington in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament on Saturday gave her 3,374 for her career \u2014 third-most on the N.C.A.A. women\u2019s career list across all divisions, behind Kelsey Plum (3,527) and Jackie Stiles (3,393).\n\nStiles, a 2001 Southwest Missouri State graduate, could be surpassed on Monday night if Mitchell gets even close to her season\u2019s scoring average of 24.1 in a second-round game against Central Michigan. Plum, whose explosive career at Washington concluded last year, is a less realistic target, requiring an exacta of uninhibited shotmaking by Mitchell and a run by the 28-6 Buckeyes to the national championship game on April 1.\n\nThat game, no fooling, will be played at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, a seductive pot at the end of Mitchell\u2019s college career rainbow.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to jump too far ahead but to have it in the back of your mind is totally O.K. with me,\u201d said Mitchell, a 5-foot-8-inch southpaw-shooting guard.\n\nJust winning Monday night and getting through the Spokane Region, where Notre Dame and Oregon are top seeds, would represent a collective flourish to a career perhaps too much defined by individual achievement. When barriers fall, heads turn. In late January, Mitchell blew past Laura Malernee of West Liberty, a Division II program, with her 442nd 3-point shot. Her record total reached 491 Saturday, when she connected on her only long ball in six attempts against George Washington.\n\nThe other race she\u2019s in, unwittingly until apprised of it on Friday, is against Travis Bader, formerly of Oakland University in Michigan, who holds the Division I record for career 3-pointers with 504.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHad Mitchell heard the name?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shrugging while leaning against a wall outside the Ohio State locker room.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the D-I men\u2019s leader with 504,\u201d she was told.\n\nShe laughed and said, \u201cKind of cool, definitely.

Bader is playing professionally in Larissa, Greece, from where he wrote in an email to say he had heard about Mitchell last summer while working out at Michigan State and how \u201cshe could get close to the record.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 3-point shot has changed the game from how it was played in the past so to be able to see my name at the top of that list is surreal,\u201d Bader wrote. \u201cA lot of people think that shooting the basketball is a gift. The truth is, it\u2019s nothing but hard work.

They seldom dwell on crossover records, acknowledging the differences in the games, especially in college, where the best men\u2019s players are often one-and-done temps.\n\nPhoto\n\nMitchell does have a history of running with the guys, though, beginning when her mother, Cheryl, became her youth basketball coach and rounded up neighborhood boys for her team to practice against.\n\nCheryl Mitchell played basketball at Eastern Kentucky, once holding that university\u2019s rebounding record. There she met Mark, a star lineman on the football team, who had a couple looks at N.F.L. training camps.

He was hired as an Ohio State assistant when the girls were high school seniors by Kevin McGuff, the incoming Buckeyes\u2019 coach, who had worked in the area at Xavier before spending two years at Washington, where he happened to recruit Kelsey Plum.\n\nConsider the hiring \u2014 and perhaps Chelsea\u2019s inclusion as a scholarship player \u2014 a case of fortuitous timing and parental leverage, though Mark Mitchell\u2019s 221-50 record at Taft and familiar name in a natural talent market for Ohio State was an attraction for McGuff as he filled out his staff.\n\nThe adjustment to having her father in the gym was not easy, Kelsey said. Coach Mitch, as she refers to him, made a habit of calling her out for questionable shot selection and excess dribbling \u2014 all the things she got away with in high school but would pay for against elite college competition.\n\n\u201cI used to take it personal \u2014 why is he getting on me like that?\u201d she said. \u201cBut the older I got, I\u2019ve come to realize that in the gym he\u2019s my coach more than he\u2019s my dad. It may not have started out that way, but me and my sister have respect for his career, how hard he\u2019s worked at it.\u201d\n\nOff the court, Cheryl Mitchell stresses greater contextual awareness for a growing number of female players whose mothers played the game and know firsthand of how far it\u2019s come. She has regaled her daughters with stupefying stories of yore, how in her first year of organized competition, seventh grade, ancient rules were still in effect \u2014 three defensive players on one side the floor, three offensive on the other, never to cross into forbidden territory.\n\n\u201cI remind Kelsey and Chelsea all the time, `Y\u2019all have steak and potatoes, we had spaghetti,\u2019\u201d Cheryl Mitchell said after watching the George Washington game alongside Chelsea, who is not playing this semester in order to focus on academics.\n\nGeorge Washington is coached by Jennifer Rizzotti, a former Connecticut star, whose strategy was designed to head Mitchell off at the point of attack and take her chances with other shooters. It worked for a quarter. Confronted with double-team attention, Mitchell was not allowed to get into her shooting rhythm. But her penetration and canny passing produced seven of Ohio State\u2019s 20 assists on 33 made baskets in 59 attempts, or 55.9 percent, as the 6-foot-3 Stephanie Mavunga dominated inside.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfterward, Rizzotti called it a preview of how Mitchell would most likely have to play as a point guard in the W.N.B.A. and how making that adjustment was \u201cthe sign of a great player.\u201d\n\nMcGuff had been telling Mitchell as much since her first game, when she scored 25 points on 25 shots in a display of freshman audacity. He has cited Plum\u2019s growth at Washington from junior to senior year, to more selective shot taker from volume gunner. That, in turn, produced career highs in field goal and 3-point shooting percentages as a senior.\n\nMitchell got the message and did likewise. An invitation last September to attend a national team camp \u2014 \u201csurrounded by greatness,\u201d she said \u2014 reinforced it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a team that\u2019s dependent on everything that I do,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a team where everybody wants to make plays.\u201d\n\nThey need the ball first, and if it means a better chance at saying goodbye to Columbus at the Final Four, she is happy to pass it or fetch it.\n\nWhen the Buckeyes appeared for the start of the second half on Saturday, there were no balls for them to shoot with.

Moving there themselves.\n\nMy guess is that No. 3 is, if not impossible, at least several years away from being realistic for most venture capitalists, many of whom have their roots planted in the Bay Area and benefit from being near dense clusters of start-ups. But Nos. 1 and 2 seem completely plausible \u2014 and, in fact, are already happening.\n\nSeveral regional start-up success stories have persuaded investors to add the Midwest to their scouting itineraries. And many large tech companies have already moved a significant number of jobs out of the Bay Area \u2014 Google just opened a huge office in Boulder, Colo., and Facebook is building one in Boston \u2014 and that trend seems likely to continue, given the insane cost of living in Silicon Valley for anyone who isn\u2019t a billionaire.\n\nOn the bus, I heard a lot of talk about \u201cmid-tech\u201d jobs \u2014 jobs at tech companies that aren\u2019t hard-core engineering, but require some technical expertise. (Think sales, growth, design.) While executives and engineers get positive network effects from being near clusters of other executives and engineers in San Francisco, there\u2019s no real reason that mid-tech employees can\u2019t just as easily be in Bend, Ore., or South Bend.\n\nI saw some skepticism about this kind of thinking from people like Adam Nash, an entrepreneur in residence at Greylock Partners. He said on Twitter that the move-away-from-the-Bay phenomenon is cyclical, and that in lean times tech employees tend to stay close to their headquarters, where they are assigned to more critical projects and are less likely to be cut in a round of layoffs.\n\nBut I\u2019m not so sure. Tools like Slack and GitHub now allow tech employees to work remotely in a way that previous generations weren\u2019t able to, and the cost-of-living differential between the Bay Area and every other city (with the exceptions of New York and L.A.) is so great these days that many employees might be willing to exchange some job security for the benefits of living elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf I had to guess, I\u2019d predict that unless Bay Area housing costs miraculously come down in the next year or two, Silicon Valley will undergo a big shake-up. Companies will feel increasingly compelled to move as many jobs as possible out of the Bay Area, and in time, the states between the coasts could effectively become Silicon Valley\u2019s back and middle office, in much the way that Wall Street banks now have thousands of employees in cities like Columbus, Ohio, and Salt Lake City.\n\nThat kind of geographic balancing would be great for cities in the Midwest, where an influx of high-paying mid-tech jobs could transform local economies. And it would arguably be good for San Francisco, which is straining to accommodate its current population and would be well served by a modest exodus.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect the same to happen with venture capital \u2014 a highly face-to-face business in which proximity and start-up density still matter. As much as the venture capitalists on the bus may have loved the Midwest, they\u2019re probably going to remain tourists for the time being.\n\nKevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

According to the complaint:\n\nBut as September 2013 approached \u2014 the date for the launch of the first phase of the rollout of Theranos services in Pharmacy A stores \u2014 it became clear to Holmes that the miniLab would not be ready. At the time, Theranos had not fully integrated other testing methods into the miniLab and had not completed the scientific verification steps needed to make any of its blood tests available on the miniLab for patient testing.\n\nOn its own, this is nothing unusual. Production delays, especially of complex hardware products, are common in Silicon Valley, and overeager marketing and sales departments often get ahead of engineering teams. Apple is notorious for tinkering with new iPhone designs right up until the factory deadline, and practically every major hardware company has shown off products in onstage demos that weren\u2019t yet shelf-ready.\n\nBut according to the complaint, instead of asking Walgreens for more time, Theranos decided to lie. Holmes and Balwani told their engineers to modify standard blood-testing machines to make them look like the company\u2019s new miniLabs. They then misled Walgreens executives and potential investors about how their tests were being performed, the regulators said, while furiously trying to get the miniLabs ready.\n\nWhat\u2019s so odd about the Theranos story is that failure and delays are not just common in the tech industry, they\u2019re practically expected. Apps routinely die on arrival, hardware doesn\u2019t pan out, partnerships fall through. Ideally, these things happen before you raise hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital and strike distribution deals with major retail chains, but even if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re generally not the end of the world. (For an example of a company that raised millions of dollars for an overhyped product and then imploded without accusations of fraud, look at Clinkle.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt would have been embarrassing, and possibly career-damaging, for Holmes to admit to her investors that the miniLab was not going to work out, renege on the deals she had struck with chains like Walgreens and give back some of the money she had already raised. But it was an option, and one that might have kept her out of the legal mess that followed.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, she constructed an elaborate fiction that she would spend the rest of her tenure trying to keep alive, and that would lead her down the path to this week\u2019s charges. In other words, Holmes\u2019s mistake was that she refused to do what so many other entrepreneurs do every day, and come to terms with failure.\n\nKevin Roose writes a column called The Shift and is a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

{"date": "2018-03-22 00:00:00", "text": "We had only about 30 minutes on the phone with Mr. Zuckerberg, but we managed to get him to address several important topics: the Cambridge Analytica mess, Facebook\u2019s lax data policies, its plans to clamp down on third-party developer access and notify users whose data was misused, election interference (including previously unreported Macedonian attempts to interfere in last year\u2019s Alabama special election) and Facebook\u2019s broader responsibility as a global power.\n\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s responses also raised more questions.\n\nHere, for example, is how he answered a question about Facebook\u2019s business model, which is based on selling advertisers and developers the ability to target Facebook users based on their personal data.\n\nRoose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users \u2014 do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks? Zuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that \u2014 our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can\u2019t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned. Now, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.\n\nNarrowly, it may be true that being free and ad supported helps Facebook achieve its goals of connecting billions of people to its services. Facebook has developed a number of ways to make itself cheaper and easier to access \u2014 including, in some countries, effectively subsidizing use through its Free Basics program, which allows people to use Facebook without its counting toward their data plans.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear this approach has served society well. Especially in countries like Myanmar, where Facebook was recently blamed by United Nations investigators for fueling ethnic violence against the Rohingya, it\u2019s possible that having a slightly higher barrier to entry would be a net good, even if it cost Facebook some users in the short term. (And it\u2019s not even clear that it would. People already pay for their cellphones and data plans all over the world, and might be willing to part with a small fee to keep using their favorite social network.)\n\nSwitching to a subscription model wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight. There would still be foreign actors trying to interfere in elections, false news and divisive content intending to sway public opinion, and innumerable other issues. But moving away from an ad-supported model would make the network harder to exploit. (Bot networks are less effective on subscription platforms, for example.) And it would lessen the company\u2019s incentive to sell out its users\u2019 privacy to advertisers.", "title": "Kevin\u2019s Week in Tech: Zuckerberg\u2019s Answers to Privacy Scandal Raise More Questions", "authors": []}

English echoes can be found in the Tudor-style houses near Main Street dating from the 1920s and \u201930s, but the typical Kew Gardens Hills home is plain brick and postwar, built for the swelling population of World War II veterans.\n\nMr. Erlich, the real estate lawyer, said the housing stock south along Main Street to Jewel Avenue is mainly attached homes and small multifamily housing complexes known as garden apartments, which represent about half of the neighborhood\u2019s residences.\n\nWest, toward the Van Wyck Expressway, the garden apartments are frequently co-ops. Below Jewel Avenue, one finds more condominiums, \u201cwhich are a little bit more snazzy,\u201d Mr. Erlich said. A southwestern section called Charm Circle has many detached houses and is in high demand. Two- and three-family homes that appeal to investors are also found throughout the neighborhood.\n\nThe main commercial stretch of Main Street runs from Melbourne Avenue slightly more than a mile south to Union Turnpike. The variety of kosher restaurants includes Chinese (Soysauce Glatt Kosher Chinese, at 68-22 Main Street), Mexican (Carlos & Gabby\u2019s, at 67-11 Main Street) and Italian/Japanese (Benjy\u2019s Kosher Pizza Dairy Restaurant & Sushi Bar, at 72-72 Main Street).

A two-bedroom coop in a garden apartment complex is about $300,000; a more upscale two-bedroom condo will fetch closer to $500,000.\n\nMoving east to Long Island, where more housing value is found, is not a complete solution, Mr. Meirov added. There, buyers lose convenience and pay higher real estate taxes. In Kew Gardens Hills, annual taxes average $6,000 to $8,000, he said.\n\nAccording to the real estate website Trulia, the median sales price of homes in Kew Gardens Hills, as of August 2017, was $698,000, representing a year-on-year increase of 2 percent, based on 384 transactions.

When Buchholz first toured Crandon Park, he saw a garbage dump and a defunct gasoline filling station. It was littered with old tires, refrigerators, even a dog carcass.\n\nBut Buchholz also saw 5,000 parking spaces across the street and envisioned a tennis mecca that would attract world-class players and international fans. What he did not count on was the opposition of environmentalists who feared the venue would attract rock concerts and tractor pulls.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have an easy start,\u201d said Buchholz, 77, who remembers children lying in front of bulldozers to prevent early construction. \u201cI felt like I was in a long five-set match. But I just said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to win this thing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe long fight wasn\u2019t over, even after the first tournament was held in Crandon Park in 1987. The most vocal opponent to the tournament was Bruce Matheson, a local resident. His family deeded the parkland to Miami-Dade County in the 1940s, but, under the deal, the family maintained control over how the land was used. In recent years, when the tournament wanted to spend $50 million in private funds to make much-needed upgrades to the site, including replacing temporary stadiums with permanent ones, Matheson stymied the deal. A lengthy lawsuit over land use persuaded tournament owners to make a move.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay here,\u201d said Mark Shapiro, the co-president of WME/IMG, which bought the tournament from Buchholz in 1999. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand how one guy could have so much control over this island.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust as Shapiro and WME/IMG were entertaining offers to move the tournament north to Orlando or west to California, the Dolphins owner Stephen Ross stepped in, proposing a move to his football complex.\n\nSerena Williams, a minority owner of the Dolphins, said she thought Ross was crazy.\n\nBut she was with Ross on March 19 at a groundbreaking ceremony for a temporary stadium court to be erected on part of the football field.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Miami and I believe in Miami and how aspirational it is,\u201d said Ross, 77, who has spent $550 million renovating the stadium since he purchased the Dolphins from Wayne Huizenga in 2008. \u201cTo me, this is a sound business deal and should be great for all of South Florida. I love challenges.\u201d\n\nRoss added, with a chuckle, \u201cI did it all for my partner, Serena.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new facility will feature 30 total courts, nine more than at Crandon Park, including double the number of practice courts. A permanent grandstand will be erected, and the players will benefit from expanded dining, gym and locker room facilities. Outside the stadium, a 90-foot-by-40-foot video screen will be installed, allowing fans to relax and dine in the plaza while still catching the on-court action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build a full-on festival,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be art, music, food vendors, multiple stages for everything. It\u2019s going to be a real taste of Miami.\u201d\n\nIf one group\u2019s bounty is another\u2019s bummer, there are businesses and individuals who will suffer when the tournament moves. Last year, attendance topped 300,000 for the 10-day event. Employees at Stefano\u2019s Liquor Store, a short distance from the tennis center, likened the tournament\u2019s financial impact on their business to the days leading up to Thanksgiving.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati began their careers in Miami. Djokovic and Andre Agassi each won the men\u2019s title six times, while Serena Williams, who lives in South Florida, has captured the women\u2019s championship eight times. The event is the home tournament for the many players who are based in Florida.\n\nIn 1999, Serena and Venus Williams met in the championship match, the first time sisters contested a top-level final since Maud Watson beat her sister Lilian in the 1884 Wimbledon final. As the song \u201cWe Are Family\u201d rang through the public-address system, 18-year-old Venus beat 17-year-old Serena in three sets.\n\nRoger Federer and Nadal played the first two of their 38 career meetings in Miami. In 2004, Nadal, then 17, stunned Federer, the new world No. 1, in straight sets in the third round. In the final a year later, Federer avenged the loss, rebounding from two sets down and 1-4 in the third to win in five sets over 3 hours 42 minutes.\n\nIn 1989, Thomas Muster, the Austrian star, was hit by a drunken driver as he was loading bags into the trunk of his car hours after his semifinal win. He tore ligaments in his knee and was forced to default the final against Ivan Lendl. Muster came back eight years later to capture the title over Sergi Bruguera.\n\nIn 1994, Pete Sampras got food poisoning on the eve of his final with Agassi. He tried to default, but Agassi would not let him, offering to postpone the match for several hours to give Sampras time to recover. Sampras went on to defeat Agassi in three sets.\n\nPhoto\n\nPerhaps the most emotional moment in tournament history occurred last weekend when members of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tennis teams joined top players, including Nick Kyrgios, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan, in a stadium court ceremony.

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "To Arab falconers, the houbara bustard \u2014 a bug-eyed, long-legged creature about the size of a large chicken \u2014 is the king of game birds. It is a fast flier with an unusual defense: When cornered, it vomits an oily green substance that can temporarily blind an attacking falcon or hobble its wings. In the days before oil was discovered in the Arabian desert, the houbara\u2019s seasonal return every fall was met with celebratory poetry and long hunts on camelback. The Land Rover made things a lot easier, but chasing the houbara, whose stringy flesh is said to be an aphrodisiac, remains one of the hallowed pursuits \u2014 along with thoroughbred stallions, huge yachts and French chateaus \u2014 that occupy the minds of Persian Gulf royalty.\n\nIn late November 2015, a large group of Qatari falcon hunters left Doha in a column of 4-by-4 vehicles and headed south. Crossing the Saudi border, the convoy turned north, traversing a portion of Kuwait and continuing on to their destination, the southern desert of Iraq, 450 miles from Doha. The group was composed of several dozen people, including servants, and was led by nine members of Qatar\u2019s ruling family, the Al Thanis, one of the wealthiest dynasties on earth. The hunting ground the Qataris had chosen \u2014 Iraq\u2019s Muthanna Province \u2014 has had few visitors since the American invasion of 2003. The desert is littered with cluster bombs and mines left over from three decades of intermittent war. With ISIS reigning across much of the north and undisciplined Shiite militias running rampant elsewhere, Iraq was hardly a desirable tourist destination. But this particular stretch of land, almost devoid of people, had become a seasonal haven for the houbara. The Qataris had heard tantalizing reports about a rebounding population, and despite warnings about the potential for danger, they could not resist the chance. For the next three weeks, the hunters meandered through the desert with their hired Iraqi guards, occasionally doling out extravagant gifts to passing Bedouins to ensure their safety.\n\nPhoto\n\nHoubara hunts follow an established daily rhythm. Starting at dawn, trackers and a pack of lean Saluki greyhounds search the dry grasses until they flush a houbara from its roost. The hunters release a trained falcon from its leather jesses, and it takes off in pursuit. High above the desert, the houbara\u2019s slow, powerful wing beats form an eerily graceful counterpoint to the raptor\u2019s fluttering ascents and sudden dives. Once the falcon strikes, the conjoined birds often spiral earthward, trailing intermittent white clouds of the victim\u2019s feathers. Most chases end with the falcon perched atop its prey, sometimes rewarded with the warm brains.\n\nThe hunters had bagged about five houbaras a day, a respectable haul, and by Dec. 15, they were almost ready to return home. That night, as the clear desert air turned bitterly cold, the men warmed themselves around bonfires. Servants bustled around them, grilling a lavish supper and pouring steaming glasses of tea. At about 3 a.m., one member of the hunting party, a 37-year-old Al Thani whom I\u2019ll call Abu Mohammed, was awakened by a servant running into his tent. (He spoke to me on the condition that I not reveal his name.) The servant was terrified. Soldiers were all over the camp, he said. Abu Mohammed got up, dressed quickly and then peeked through the slit between the canvas tent\u2019s flaps. He saw men in uniform and dozens of S.U.V.s and trucks mounted with heavy machine guns. At first, he thought it must be a mix-up, or perhaps a visit by the Iraqi military to warn them about some danger. But within a few minutes, men wearing black balaclavas entered his tent. They were armed with AK-47s. One of them held a clipboard and read out a list of names. He seemed to be looking for the most senior member of the Al Thani family. The gunmen led Abu Mohammed outside into the cold desert air. There, in the glare of headlights, he saw his relatives lying face down on the ground in their long white thobes, their hands cuffed behind them. Men were pointing rifles at their backs. In that instant, he felt certain that their captors were ISIS and soon they would all be killed.\n\nAbu Mohammed heard a voice from the walkie-talkies carried by the kidnappers: Leave everything and get out now. He couldn\u2019t place the accent or determine who these men worked for. They hustled the Qataris into S.U.V.s and blindfolded them. The engines gunned, and they roared off into the desert blackness.\n\nAs soon as the convoy reached a paved road, the captives were hustled out of the S.U.V.s and pushed into vans. They found themselves on the floor, still handcuffed and blindfolded, lurching painfully against other bound bodies every time the speeding van hit a bump. At some point, one kidnapper turned back toward the hostages and began saying crude and insulting things about Aisha, the third wife of the Prophet Muhammad. In the Arab world, this sort of insult is a dead giveaway. Sunnis revere Aisha, but Shiites revile her as a traitor who fought against Ali, the foundational figure of Shiite tradition. Abu Mohammed and his fellow hostages instantly understood they were in the hands of Shiite militiamen, not ISIS or any other jihadi group.\n\nAfter three or four hours of driving, the vans stopped. They could hear jets taking off and landing and the sound of soldiers\u2019 voices in unison. But in addition to military orders and salutes, they heard voices chanting \u201cYa Hussein!\u201d \u2014 a Shiite slogan. The captives couldn\u2019t place their location, but they were most likely on the edge of Tallil air base near Nasiriya, one of the largest military installations in southern Iraq. In the strange tug of war that typifies today\u2019s Iraq, the country\u2019s military \u2014 trained and supported by the United States \u2014 operates literally side by side with Shiite militias backed by Iran. The captives were held on the base for several days, then blindfolded again and driven to a house, where they were locked in basement cells.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt one point, Abu Mohammed \u2014 hoping to work this out Qatari-style \u2014 pulled out his wallet. (The kidnappers had already taken all their cellphones and tossed them out the windows during the drive.) He had about 120,000 Qatari riyals inside, roughly equivalent to $33,000. \u201cWe can pay,\u201d he said. Other hostages had more with them; the total, he said, was probably equal to several hundred thousand dollars, if not more. The lead kidnapper looked unimpressed. \u201cYou think we want your money?\u201d he said.\n\nWord of the kidnapping first reached Qatar at about 6 a.m., spreading a chain of panicked phone calls through the government and the royal family. The news underscored the vulnerabilities that have come with Qatar\u2019s sudden rise to prominence. A tiny, thumb-shaped peninsula jutting into the Persian Gulf, Qatar has catapulted from poverty to immense wealth in just the past three decades, thanks to natural-gas deposits under its desert and coastline. It is a country with a G.D.P. of $181 billion but only around 300,000 citizens, about the same size as Pittsburgh. It sits between the region\u2019s great Shiite power \u2014 Iran, just across the water \u2014 and its most influential Sunni state, Saudi Arabia. Starting in the 1990s, Qatar tried to protect itself by aggressively courting and irritating all sides at once. It made overtures to Syria, Iran and Hezbollah, the region\u2019s rising \u201cShiite axis,\u201d angering both the Saudis and the United States. At the same time, it also reached out to other Sunni countries, using its endless money to broker diplomatic deals in Lebanon and Yemen. It birthed Al Jazeera, the gadfly satellite channel that pleased crowds with its anti-American broadcasts, even as Qatar continued to host the largest American military base in the Middle East.\n\nBut in recent years, Qatar\u2019s balancing act has backfired badly. As the Arab Spring uprisings broke out in 2011, Qatar bankrolled the Muslim Brotherhood across the region, seeing it as a sympathetic force for Sunni populism in an increasingly democratic era. That infuriated the Saudis and Emiratis, who \u2014 though Sunni, like the Brotherhood \u2014 consider the group a threat to their own autocratic model. Qatar made another risky bet by financing Sunni rebel factions in Syria (including the local branch of Al Qaeda), hoping they would win the civil war and show gratitude to their sponsors. Instead, the Syrian war dragged on, the rebels grew more extreme and Qatar was tainted by its association with terrorist groups. In the end, Qatar managed to make enemies on both sides of the worsening sectarian divide.\n\nWithin days of the hunters\u2019 kidnapping, the Qatari government determined that the royals were almost certainly being held by a Shiite militia with ties to Iran. That effectively put their fate in the hands of a man who is perhaps the most powerful military officer in the Middle East: an Iranian general named Qassim Suleimani. An austere, hollow-eyed commander, Suleimani controls the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, along with a far-flung network of proxy forces and allies across the region. He reports directly to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is widely considered a more influential figure than the country\u2019s foreign minister or president. He has directed Iran\u2019s successful efforts to disrupt American policy in Iraq since the U.S. invasion in 2003; a 2012 magazine profile in Wired called him \u201cthe world\u2019s most dangerous\u201d man.\n\nSuleimani appeared to have little interest in ransom money. His top priority for years had been Syria, where Iran has fought hard to prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been a lifeline for Iran ever since the 1980s, when the new Islamic republic first began shipping weapons through Syrian territory to Hezbollah, which functions as Iran\u2019s external arm in Lebanon. When the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, that link was suddenly at risk. The region\u2019s great Sunni and Shiite powers leapt into the Syria crisis, transforming the democratic stirrings of the Arab Spring into a sectarian battleground. For the Saudis and their allies, sponsoring Syrian rebels was a golden chance to topple Assad, push Syria onto the Sunni side of the chessboard and isolate Iran. For Suleimani, who directed Iran\u2019s military forces in Syria, the civil war there became an existential struggle to sustain his country\u2019s only reliable ally.\n\nThe Qatari hostages were suddenly valuable pawns in this geopolitical game. Qatar had powerful leverage with the rebel factions it is believed to finance, leverage that could be useful to a strategist like Suleimani. His approach in Syria had shifted as the war ground toward a bloody stalemate. By 2015, Suleimani and his Hezbollah allies were looking for new ways to consolidate control over certain key areas near the Syrian capital: not just killing rebel fighters but expelling the Sunni civilian population that sustained and protected them. Ultimately, they hoped to repopulate those towns with less rebellious Shiite residents. It was a controversial and ambitious scheme, with dark overtones of ethnic cleansing. But if it worked, it could entrench Iranian influence in Syria for the long term.\n\nJust before the Qatari hostages were taken, Iran had begun a bold effort to make this demographic transfer happen. At a secret meeting in Istanbul facilitated by the United Nations in September 2015, an envoy from Suleimani\u2019s Quds Force proposed a symmetrical agreement that came to be known as the \u201cfour-towns deal.\u201d Hezbollah would end its siege of two Sunni rebel strongholds in Syria near the Lebanese border, Madaya and Zabadani, whose residents posed a continuing threat to the Assad regime in Damascus. In exchange, the Qatari-funded rebels would end their siege of two Shiite towns in the northwest, Fua and Kefraya. The four-towns deal would accomplish two goals for Iran: clearing out the rebel threat in a strategic area, while rescuing the imperiled Shiites up north, whose plight had been a persistent rallying cry with Hezbollah\u2019s Shiite base.\n\nThe details of the deal were vague at first, but at some point the Iranians even suggested that the residents could swap towns, with Sunni and Shiite Syrians literally trading places, perhaps inhabiting one another\u2019s homes. They presented this as a humanitarian gesture: Ending the two sieges would benefit people in all four towns. But the rebel spokesmen in Istanbul angrily rejected the whole idea, calling it an arrogant effort to reshape Syria\u2019s natural patchwork of diverse religions and ethnic groups with a crude sectarian calculus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith the kidnapped Qatari hunters, Iran acquired some very powerful leverage over those same rebels \u2014 or rather, over their chief benefactor in Doha. The plan for evacuating the four towns, left for dead after the talks in Istanbul, was back on the table.\n\nIt did not take long for Suleimani\u2019s proxies to spell all this out to the Qatari government. As their messenger, they used Hezbollah, the only group with trusted links to all the parties involved: Tehran, Doha and the Shiite militia that held the hostages in Iraq. Working through Hezbollah also allowed Iran to maintain some control over the ransom negotiations, which might otherwise have ended in a fast cash payment for the Iraqi kidnappers. Instead, Hezbollah sent a high-ranking emissary to Doha and made the conditions very clear: The captives would be freed in exchange for Qatar\u2019s help in making the four-towns deal happen.\n\nThe Qataris, less interested in the larger implications of the deal than the well-being of the royals, readily agreed to host a long series of talks involving the various parties to the four-towns deal: Hezbollah, the Iranians and the rebel militias. Tempting as it is to imagine these figures grouped around a table, they appear to have met separately with their Qatari interlocutors. Much of the negotiation hinged on logistics. Moving civilians in a fast-shifting war zone is not an easy business, and there were many differences to be worked out. Some of the rebel militias were fiercely opposed to the idea of a population transfer, and the Syrian regime \u2014 which was not party to the deal \u2014 was not keen on it either. The plan to exchange the four towns\u2019 Shiite and Sunni residents was abandoned as too ambitious; instead, they were to be moved to safe zones, with each town\u2019s future to be worked out separately. But that alone required some coordination among armed factions on opposing sides of the war. Money played a large role in smoothing out all these kinks. The Qataris\u2019 Sunni rebel allies were not going to advance an Iranian scheme for nothing.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut as the months wore on, there was still no timeline on freeing the hostages. The Qataris grew desperate and wondered if the Iranians would ever deliver. They began exploring other avenues, and a parade of dubious middlemen came to Doha offering rescue schemes in exchange for huge cash payouts. One of the Qatari officials I spoke to seemed sheepishly amused by the raft of shady offers that came in. \u201cI remember one Iranian guy said: \u2018I can get them out for $20 million,\u2019 \u201d the official said. A member of the Qatari ruling family paid $2 million to a firm called the Global Strategies Council, which is run by a Greek shoe salesman. None of it was useful. The Qataris got so frustrated, one former diplomat in Doha told me, that they considered a drastic solution: a military raid to free the captives. Qatar almost certainly lacked the know-how to pull it off. But the very fact that it was discussed suggests that the emir was under tremendous pressure from his small, clan-oriented population to bring the hostages home.\n\nIt took almost 16 months for the Qataris to finally find the man with the right clout and connections to close the deal. It happened in early April 2017, during the annual gathering of Arab interior ministers, held that year in Tunis. The Qatari minister was introduced to his Iraqi counterpart, Qassim al-Araji, a man with deep ties in the Shiite-militia world. Al-Araji, a square-faced 54-year-old, spent many years in exile in Iran and was twice imprisoned by American forces in Iraq a decade ago on suspicion of smuggling and distributing weapons to be used in attacking American troops. (He was released for lack of evidence.)\n\nAl-Araji said he knew who had the hostages, though he did not name the group. As it turned out, it was Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah, a Shiite faction formed in Iraq more than a decade ago that has mounted hundreds of attacks on American soldiers and was trained, funded and supervised by Iran\u2019s Quds Force. Al-Araji said he had a plan for freeing the hostages, according to a high-ranking Qatari official who recounted the conversation to me. But the plan came with an unusual condition. Al-Araji wanted authority to mediate the release personally, and he hinted that his Qatari counterpart should say nothing about the matter to anyone else in the Iraqi government, where sectarian and political divides create competing agendas. The Qatari agreed.\n\nMoney was part of the agreement, a kind of sweetener to be added to the four-towns deal. The Qatari official who described the meeting to me told me as much, and he went on to say that the money was meant to finance a new port and embassy in Baghdad. He looked so uncomfortable as he said it \u2014 his face hovering somewhere between a wink and a blush \u2014 that I didn\u2019t have the heart to say the obvious: that this was a painfully transparent cover story for an all-cash ransom payment.\n\nA week later, the Qatari negotiating team arrived in Baghdad with its 23 bags. They soon found that Qassim al-Araji had wildly oversold his power over the Iraqi government (and the Baghdad airport). In Baghdad, I saw photographs taken that night showing the blocked-out bricks of cash on the scanning machine and the angry Qataris standing in the V.I.P. lounge, surrounded by black duffel bags. When Iraq\u2019s prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, found out what the Qataris were up to, he was furious and decided to draw a defiant line in the sand for Iran and its proxies. He sent an armed counterterrorism team to guard the 23 bags of cash and make sure no one could spirit them off to the kidnappers. After the Qatari team finally gave up and made its way to Baghdad, Abadi eventually had the money transferred to a vault in Iraq\u2019s Central Bank.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The 23 bags of cash were supposed to be delivered at the same time that Qatar\u2019s rebel allies were executing the terms of the four-towns deal. That very day, Sunni militiamen were reluctantly shepherding Shiite civilians onto green buses and traveling with them on the road to Aleppo, where they were to be housed with the help of the Syrian regime. In parallel, 200 miles south, Hezbollah fighters were preparing to escort thousands of people out of Madaya and Zabadani.\n\nThe $360 million was not the only money at stake. To secure their support for the population transfers, Qatar had paid the Sunni militias \u2014 Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham \u2014 at least $50 million, I was told by a senior Iraqi official and by people close to the rebel groups.\n\nThe Qatari envoys spent much of their first day in Baghdad working the phones on two fronts. They had to monitor the ongoing civilian transfers in Syria, and they were desperate to recover their 23 bags of cash. They enlisted everyone they knew in Iraq to help, including the Shiite militias. They bolstered their pleas, several Iraqi officials told me, with a shameless campaign of bribery that would last a week, offering huge sums of money and luxury apartments in Doha and Dubai to officers, cabinet members and lawmakers. None of this succeeded in getting the $360 million away from Abadi and his circles of allies.\n\nBefore the end of the day, something happened that cast a sickening new light onto the cold calculations surrounding the four-towns deal. At about 3:30 p.m., a line of buses carrying civilians away from the two Shiite towns, Fua and Kefraya, stopped at a checkpoint in an area called Rashideen, just west of Aleppo. A dark blue Hyundai Porter truck pulled up and parked next to one of the buses. Moments later, it exploded.\n\nThe blast was unusually powerful. Images from the scene show a green-and-white bus, its windows blown out and its innards blackened by fire. All told, 126 people were killed in the blast, mostly civilian evacuees, including 68 children. Hundreds were injured. No one knows for certain who carried it out, but everyone I spoke to believed the bombing was intended to stop the four-towns deal, which was seen by many rebels and jihadi groups as a gift to Iran.\n\nThe images of the fire-blackened bus were a savage reminder that the four-towns deal was not just about back-room negotiations and bags of cash. The families on those convoys had been forced to leave their homes. The Qatari officials I spoke to believed they were taking part in a humanitarian rescue for victims of a siege, and some members of Ahrar al-Sham, the rebel group, told me the same thing. But many Syrians saw the transfers for what they were \u2014 forcible exile, to suit a scheme cooked up by foreigners \u2014 and were furious. This was especially true of those in the Sunni towns, Madaya and Zabadani. Most of the residents were reluctant to leave even after years of a siege that left hundreds dead from starvation and Hezbollah snipers.\n\nI spoke by video chat with a civilian named Ali Saeed who reluctantly fled from Madaya. He is 52, a small but squarely built man with a fleshy nose, close-cut hair and a look of stubborn defiance stamped on his face. He told me that Hezbollah\u2019s siege of Madaya had turned the town into a virtual concentration camp. \u201cFirst people ate through their reserves of dry food,\u201d he told me. \u201cThen they began eating leaves and grass.\u201d Ali Saeed held his cellphone up to the camera to show me photos of his children, one of whom fell on his head while running from a sniper and died soon afterward.\n\nBut it was the arrogance of the transfer scheme that consumed him during our call. After he learned about the four-towns deal, he confronted a Hezbollah commander at a checkpoint just outside Madaya. \u201cI was upset,\u201d Ali Saeed told me. \u201cI said, \u2018You are coming here to displace us, to dominate our land.\u2019 The Hezbollah officer told me, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree to leave, you can starve.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe population transfers resumed despite the bombing, and within a few days the four-towns deal was largely complete. One night, around the same time, the Qatari negotiating team in Baghdad slipped out of the Green Zone in an S.U.V. They changed cars repeatedly in a vain effort to avoid drawing the attention of Iraqi officials and ended up at a rendezvous with a Shiite militia in the Karada neighborhood. At their meeting, the Qataris were shown a proof of life \u2014 a recent video of the hostages. Then, abruptly, the Qatari team began packing their bags and asked their hosts for permission to leave the country. The 23 bags were still sitting in an Iraqi bank vault, but it seemed that the Qataris had somehow found another way to satisfy the kidnappers\u2019 demands.\n\nAlmost immediately, at the basement prison south of Baghdad, Abu Mohammed and the other members of the Qatari ruling family got a thrilling surprise from their guards: They would be receiving showers and haircuts. It was time to go. They were led upstairs and into the sunlight, their eyes smarting from the glare. They had spent 16 months in a windowless basement in southern Iraq, a few hours\u2019 drive from where they were kidnapped. Their meager prison diet had left them weak. They had spent the first half of their ordeal entirely cut off from the world, with only a single Quran to read. Later, the guard had given them a TV, and watching the news, they had seen reports about a political deal that was said to be brewing in Syria, involving hostages and population exchanges. \u201cWe suspected this was connected to us,\u201d Abu Mohammed told me.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe men were led outside and driven for two hours to a house on what looked like an opulent private ranch. Inside, waiting in a large reception room, were the nonroyal hostages, who had been held in a separate location. The men embraced and wept, and began trading stories. To their surprise, they discovered that the other group \u2014 apparently seen as blameless in their country\u2019s policies \u2014 had been treated much better than the Al Thanis during their captivity, with adequate food, showers and respectful guards.\n\nFor the next two days, the Al Thanis were once again addressed like royalty. Servants came and went, addressing them with elaborate courtesy. Meals were laid out. Instead of thin broth and rice, they ate the finest mazgouf, a traditional Iraqi dish of fish rubbed with spices and grilled on an outdoor fire pit. One night they were served an entire spit-roasted sheep. Their attendants repeatedly addressed them as \u201cour guests\u201d and apologized for their earlier mistreatment. On the morning of April 21, the Qatari hostages were driven to Baghdad and given a farewell reception at the Intelligence Ministry before their trip to the airport.\n\nAbu Mohammed told me that he and the other hostages feared some kind of snag right to the very end. \u201cWe felt complete relief only when the plane took off,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like a dream. A feeling of joy.\u201d The two-hour flight to Doha was full of giddy laughter. The men\u2019s relatives were waiting in the airport when the flight arrived that evening. Their joy was tempered by shock at the men\u2019s condition: They were gaunt and hollow-eyed. Abu Mohammed had lost 40 pounds. But the emir of Qatar was there, too, and he kissed them all, with tears in his eyes, as they stepped off the plane.\n\nThere remains an obvious mystery in the case of the kidnapped Qataris. How, with the $360 million impounded, were the hostages released? One senior Iraqi official gave me the following answer: The Qataris agreed to provide another delivery of cash, via Beirut, of roughly the same amount. (It was Qassim Suleimani himself, I was told by another official, who made the final call to release the hostages.) As far as the location for a money drop goes, this makes sense: Hezbollah maintains a firm control over the Beirut airport, and it would have no trouble ensuring that the cash would pass through. If this is true, it would bring the total amount Qatar paid for its hostages to at least $770 million, and probably substantially more. I heard reports of several other multimillion-dollar payouts to various middlemen that I was unable to confirm. There is also the $2 million that an Al Thani family member paid to the Greek shoe salesman, and the bribes the Qatari envoys supposedly paid during their week in Baghdad. It is easy to imagine a total approaching $1 billion.\n\nQatari officials deny making any payments apart from the cash in the 23 bags. They continue to insist that the money was intended solely for the Iraqi government, for various investments in Iraq and for \u201chelp in facilitating the release of the Qatari hostages.\u201d When I asked why the kidnappers went ahead with the release even after their $360 million payment was impounded, a Qatari official suggested (not very persuasively) that the cash was never that important.\n\nAlmost a year later, the effects of the Qatari ransom deal can still be felt, from Doha to Washington. The four towns in Syria are mostly empty \u2014 a few hundred stubborn people cling to their homes in the Shiite towns up north, and some remain in Madaya and Zabadani. The jihadi rebels in Syria also continue their battle, yielding a steady trickle of battlefield death and dismemberment. The deal appears to have deepened the divide between the rebels and the people they claim to represent. Ali Saeed, the exile from Madaya I spoke with, told me that the rebel militias\u2019 participation in a scheme to force people from their homes was a cowardly betrayal of the revolution against Assad. \u201cMay God destroy them,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the ransom deal\u2019s heaviest legacy may be back home in the gulf. The Saudis and Emiratis, who had long resented Qatar\u2019s sponsorship of the Muslim Brotherhood, were infuriated by the reports of heavy payments to Shiite militias. On June 5, they initiated a full-scale economic blockade. They issued a draconian list of demands, including the closing of Al Jazeera and a Turkish military facility, and financial reparations for years of supposed wrongs. Although the blockade had been talked about for months, the ransom deal provided a useful pretext.\n\nThe ransom also began to figure, often in highly distorted form, in a Saudi-financed P.R. blitz that portrayed Qatar as a fountainhead of terrorism. The anti-Qatar campaign was a patchwork of true and false or questionable claims that only muddied the waters around the ransom and Qatar\u2019s broader culpability in bankrolling Islamist groups. But it seems to have been effective with one very important audience: Donald Trump. Even as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson struggled to mend the rift between America\u2019s partners in the gulf, Trump undermined him in very public fashion, making clear that he sided entirely with his new Saudi friends. (Trump had been treated to a fawning reception during a visit to Riyadh in May, sword-dancing with the king and appearing in a photo-op with a bizarre glowing orb that generated an endless series of conspiracy theories.) Tillerson grew so frustrated with the interference of Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that he reportedly threatened to resign later in the summer, and had to be coaxed to stay by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John Kelly, now the White House chief of staff. Tillerson tried again to end the blockade during another visit to the gulf in October, but he got no further.\n\nHow much of the blame does Qatar deserve for all this wreckage? It has been involved in multimillion-dollar ransoms to free Al Qaeda captives before, including a Swiss woman held in Yemen in 2013. My friend Theo Padnos, who wrote about his two-year kidnapping ordeal in Syria for this magazine, was freed through Qatari mediation and possibly Qatari money. If the Qataris did pay nearly $400 million to Kata\u2019ib Hezbollah (a group that is listed by the United States as a terrorist organization), it would put a lot more blood on their hands. Furthermore, if the money was paid via Beirut, it is fair to assume that Hezbollah (also listed as a terrorist group) received a cut. The $50 million paid to Jabhat al-Nusra (yet another group on the terror list) and Ahrar al-Sham is also troubling, despite the fact that those groups now pose a threat mostly to the Assad regime and its allies and not to the West.\n\nBut in the end, it seems as if the Qataris were less villains than dupes, drunk on natural-gas money and blind to its fatal consequences. They threw cash around in clumsy efforts to manipulate the politics of a volatile region, only to find the tables turned. One Qatari official who worked on the kidnapping told me, with a plaintive look in his eyes: \u201cPeople accuse us of working with Hezbollah \u2014 but look what they did to us!\u201d\n\nThe ransom story\u2019s final mystery, at least for me, was its origin: Why did the hunters go to southern Iraq in the first place? They knew how dangerous it was. A big group like theirs, handing out gifts of cash to local Bedouins and camping in ostentatious luxury, was ludicrously easy pickings for a Shiite militia. The hunters had been warned about this from the beginning, even by their own government. The last warning came only a day or so before the kidnapping, when Qatari security officials discovered that a mysterious Iraqi blogger had posted the hunters\u2019 GPS coordinates online.\n\nWhen I spoke to Abu Mohammed, he confirmed that they had been profusely warned. \u201cBefore the trip, everyone said \u2018You\u2019re crazy, don\u2019t go\u2019 \u2014 my mother, my friends, my brothers,\u201d he said.\n\nWhy take the risk? I asked Abu Mohammed this in a majlis, the reception hall of a home that belongs to his uncle in Doha. A row of thronelike yellow chairs sat empty in the long, silent room, where a single server came periodically to refill our tea glasses. It is very rare for Western journalists to meet with members of the Al Thani family outside the context of a government interview. Qataris have a reputation for privacy and reserve, and in more than a decade of visiting Doha I have never once been inside a Qatari home. Their reverence for decorum is visible in their quiet manners and in the way they walk \u2014 a floating motion that foreigners often remark on. Abu Mohammed\u2019s bearing was poised and erect, and he scarcely moved during our entire talk, which lasted almost three hours.\n\nAbu Mohammed paused before answering my question, and then began explaining what falconry means to people of his generation. \u201cYou are away from phones, from business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are with nature. You feel free.\u201d And, he added, there was a deep cultural pull to consider. He looked toward the windows, where we could see the edges of Doha\u2019s hypermodern sprawl, studded with oblong skyscrapers and cavernous malls. When Abu Mohammed was born, in 1978, none of that existed. Photos from the time show a blank desert coastline with a cluster of shabby-looking buildings on its edge, the remnants of Qatar\u2019s days as a remote pearl-diving outpost. By the time he reached adulthood, money from natural gas had transformed Qatar inside and out. Its citizens are vastly outnumbered in their own country by foreign workers, and their culture \u2014 once rooted in thrift and self-reliance \u2014 is unrecognizable. Starvation has given way to obesity. Families routinely complain that their young men are adrift in a world of limitless consumption and pleasure. Many are able to buy Lamborghinis but unable to hold down a steady job.\n\nFalconry, Abu Mohammed seemed to be saying, is a remedy for the gulf\u2019s oil curse. Training a raptor can be a solitary, obsessive enterprise, enforcing a measure of self-discipline that is often lacking in such men\u2019s lives. There are many hours of patient habituation and repetitious work with glove and lure that form a bond between bird and human: The bird is training you, master falconers like to say. All this elicits passionate, even fanatical devotion. Risks are easily brushed aside. Money \u2014 even vast sums of money \u2014 seems meaningless. Abu Mohammed told me he was already planning trips to the desert to hunt the houbara again, despite the danger.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFalconry is addictive like a drug,\u201d he said, adding, with a subtle smile: \u201cIt\u2019s the sport of kings.\u201d", "title": "Kidnapped Royalty Become Pawns in Iran\u2019s Deadly Plot", "authors": ["Robert F.

She applies the goals of meditation to the office, not in a \u201csit on a cushion with your mantra and a vanilla candle\u201d kind of way but by knowing your own mind and heart. She talks about the three aspirational principles of the Tibetan system called dampa sum \u2014 making your actions good in the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end. You begin by writing your own mission statement and setting out your core values, continue with \u201cmeta-cognition\u201d (understanding how your daily work connects with your personal goals and those of your employer) and end with reflection and a process of \u201ccheck ins\u201d to collect feedback from your colleagues and see if you\u2019re meeting your own expectations.\n\nWeiss\u2019s approach to greater satisfaction and success at work is steeped in evidence-based science. And it\u2019s not just philosophical; there\u2019s plenty of practical advice. Consider, for example, her mental exercise intended to cultivate compassion for an officemate who drives you crazy. This multistep process includes: imagining her outside work, perhaps interacting with her children or taking a walk in the woods; imagining her insecurities, her disappointments; thinking about the people who care for her or a family member who needs her. \u201cCan you imagine meeting her for the first time and enjoying her company?\u201d Weiss asks gently. To which I could only answer: \u201cShe wears a MAGA cap and chews with her mouth open, so I still hate her. But thanks for asking!\u201d At least Weiss has given readers an approach that might be more help than the tiny voodoo dolls I used to keep for those special someones.\n\nGary Burnison\u2019s LOSE THE R\u00c9SUM\u00c9, LAND THE JOB (Wiley, paper, $30) is less about compassion in the workplace and more about scaring us straight. Burnison, the chief executive of Korn Ferry International, the world\u2019s largest executive recruiting firm, dedicates the book to \u201ceveryone who hates his or her job.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean for readers to actually ditch the r\u00e9sum\u00e9; he wants us to understand what a minor part of the job hunt it actually is, particularly now that so much job hunting is done electronically. Hit a button and you\u2019ve applied \u2014 and so have thousands of others, often without giving much thought to their qualifications or where they want to live or, essentially, who they are as workers. (Just because you like foosball doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re temperamentally suited for a start-up.) The point is not \u201cWhat can you do for me?\u201d but \u201cWhat can I do for your company?\u201d \u201cLose the R\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d breaks down every aspect of job hunting, explaining what matters and what doesn\u2019t. Did you know that as many as 25 percent of all applicants are deep-sixed by their dopey social media pages? \u201cIf you\u2019re not careful,\u201d Burnison advises, ominously and accurately, \u201cyou can tweet yourself out of a job.\u201d\n\nMuch of what\u2019s here we know instinctively, but it\u2019s very good to be reminded. \u201cNetworking poorly is worse than not networking at all,\u201d Burnison writes, as I flashed back to the gynecologist who, in the midst of examining me, asked if I could take a look at his collection of poems about menopause. We\u2019ve all been there \u2014 sometimes in stirrups.", "title": "Kill a Dead-End Job and Make the Leap to Career Happiness", "authors": []}

In a Kansas City courtroom, Mr. Kobach and his fellow true believers have struggled to defend a 2013 state law that requires prospective voters to prove their citizenship before they can register.\n\nIt has not gone well for Mr. Kobach. The lawsuit, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Kansas residents who were blocked from voting under the new law, contends that the legislation violates federal law, which requires only that prospective voters attest to their citizenship under penalty of perjury. Meanwhile, it disenfranchised tens of thousands of Kansans, who were disproportionately younger voters or voters with no party affiliation.\n\nAnd how many noncitizens did the law stop from voting? Squint really hard. One would think that after all these years, Mr. Kobach would have something to show for his dogged efforts. Yet according to his own witnesses, Kansas, which has 1.8 million registered voters, has identified 129 noncitizens it says registered or tried to register since 2000. Of those 129 people, 11 actually voted, and it\u2019s not clear how many of these cases represent intentional fraud, as opposed to honest mistakes or clerical errors. But Mr. Kobach is convinced, calling these findings \u201cthe tip of the iceberg.\u201d If so, the iceberg is melting fast.\n\nMr. Kobach\u2019s game may work with partisan lawmakers, but not with federal judges. At the beginning of the trial, Mr. Kobach, who is representing himself, tried to introduce what he said were new data on the number of Kansans whose voter registrations were suspended for lacking proof of citizenship. Judge Julie Robinson of Federal District Court said no, reminding him that the deadline for introducing pretrial evidence had passed the night before. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a trial by ambush here,\u201d the judge said when Mr. Kobach tried again a few days later.\n\nHow does it feel to have your papers out of order, Mr. Kobach?\n\nOf course, restrictive voting laws like these have never been about protecting electoral integrity. They\u2019re about keeping certain people away from the ballot box, often based on who they are \u2014 or are assumed to be. On Tuesday, one of Mr. Kobach\u2019s witnesses, a political scientist, Jesse Richman, testified that up to 18,000 noncitizens have registered or tried to register in Kansas. When the A.C.L.U.\u2019s lawyer asked him about his methods for analyzing the state\u2019s list of suspended voters, Mr. Richman said that, among other things, he flagged foreign-sounding names. What about a name like \u201cCarlos Murguia,\u201d the lawyer asked. Would he flag that one? Yes, Mr. Richman said.

But with his wife, Hannah, and their two young sons in tow, it has also been a chance for him to reset his relationship with Mexico, a soccer-crazed country where he may be more widely known than in the United States \u2014 though also widely loathed.\n\nFor years, as the soccer rivalry deepened between the neighboring countries, Mexican animosity toward the American team seemed to concentrate with laserlike focus on Donovan. He did not shy from this role, stoking the fires with provocative comments and once even urinating near the field at Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara before a practice, an act that was caught on video and has never been forgotten in Mexico.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring matches in Mexico, particularly at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, fans greeted every touch of the ball by Donovan with searing choruses of jeers and epithets, and they bombarded him with cups and coins and sometimes far worse as he set up for corner kicks.\n\nIn an interview in 2012, Donovan took some of the blame for this caustic relationship, admitting he had been \u201ca punk kid\u201d earlier in his career. \u201cI ran my mouth a lot and I said a lot of stupid things and I was very ignorant and I caused a lot of, probably, hatred toward me,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he was viewed by many in Mexico as a worthy adversary, with his playing prowess \u2014 and ability and willingness to conduct interviews in Spanish \u2014 earning him a grudging respect. Late in his career, perhaps in a sign of a softening in the relationship, Donovan appeared in a series of ads for the Mexican lottery that played off the country\u2019s distaste for him.\n\n\u201cMexicans hated him in a joyous way,\u201d said Robert Andrew Powell, author of \u201cThis Love Is Not for Cowards,\u201d a book about soccer and violence in Ju\u00e1rez, a Mexican border city. \u201cThey got a lot of pleasure out of hating him.\u201d\n\nDonovan has often said that he owes his career in part to Mexicans, specifically the immigrants and their children he played soccer with while growing up in Southern California. Had he grown up in a place where the sport was not a central part of the culture, he said, he might never have taken it up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, despite all the times he played in Mexico as a member of the United States national team, he said, he never really saw or experienced much of the country beyond its airports and hotels and the infernal caldron of its stadiums.\n\nThe Le\u00f3n offer, he said, was a chance to set aside a \u201cpretty simple and easy\u201d life of family and daily recreational tennis in California and really get to know the country in a deeper, more meaningful way.\n\n\u201cWhen this opportunity came up at first, it was a hard no,\u201d Donovan said in an interview this week.

He remained a shadow on the bench in a 2-2 draw against Lobos BUAP, a team from the city of Puebla, and avoided reporters by ducking onto the team bus afterward.\n\nPhoto\n\nDonovan acknowledged some irritation at his lack of playing time in the interview days later at the team\u2019s practice facility, a bare-bones compound, with three soccer fields and a weight room, at the end of an unmarked dirt road.\n\n\u201cI just want to help, and that\u2019s where it gets frustrating,\u201d he said. But his maturity, he said, has helped to keep his frustrations in check. Instead, he has been trying to help the club in other ways, providing guidance to younger players and setting an example on and off the field.\n\nAt the practice facility, he was unfailingly courteous to the grounds crew and other staff members, greeting everyone he encountered. An intern working for the team said Donovan, unlike most of the team\u2019s players, frequently stopped by the offices to say hello to the staff before heading to the locker room.\n\nHis schedule has been relentless: He did not have a day off until last weekend, and he seized the opportunity to take his family to San Miguel de Allende, a colonial city popular with tourists. There, as with everywhere else he has gone, strangers recognized him on the street and greeted him warmly, eager to talk about the team and soccer.\n\n\u201cHad I come here to live as a U.S. soccer player, it\u2019s different because they don\u2019t view you as one of their own,\u201d he said. But now that he had joined a Mexican team, he had, in essence, become a welcome part of Mexico\u2019s fabric.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Donovan and his family\u2019s home is in a guarded residential enclave, he said they tried to live their lives as normally as possible, venturing out often to eat at the city\u2019s restaurants and shop at its stores. Even his decision to take his family with him, rather than leaving them in San Diego, was a commitment to a fully immersive experience, despite his initial and very serious concerns about the country\u2019s reputation for violence.\n\nIt\u2019s also why his thoughts during an interview easily returned to the pineapple salesman, to the few moments of pleasantries exchanged at the roadside, to the 50 pesos left behind as a tip and a thank you. In a country that once cursed the mere mention of his name, Donovan is now revealing a kinder face, and receiving one in return.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hardworking, they\u2019re nice people, they\u2019re trying to do good, they\u2019re trying to support their families,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perception I would never have had if I had just gone to Mexico City, to the Azteca, back to the hotel and back to the United States.

The hope is that it will lead to a commercial network of flying taxis in New Zealand in as soon as three years.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe move is a big step forward in the commercialization of this technology, which even the most optimistic prognosticators had recently bet would take another decade to achieve.\n\nThe decision to embrace the commercial use of flying taxis offers New Zealand an opportunity to leapfrog many developed countries in this area, and perhaps give it a head start over Silicon Valley, where much of the most innovative work has been taking place.\n\nIn an email, Ms. Ardern said the decision to work with Kitty Hawk was \u201cabout sending the message to the world that our doors are open for people with great ideas who want to turn them into reality.\u201d She added, \u201cWe\u2019ve got an ambitious target in New Zealand of being net carbon zero by 2050,\u201d and given that the Kitty Hawk vehicle is fully electric, \u201cexciting projects like this are part of how we make that happen.\u201d\n\nBack here in the United States, the move stands as a major challenge for our regulators, in particular the Federal Aviation Administration. While the F.A.A. allows test flights of autonomous vehicles, there is no path to certify and commercialize them despite a constant stream of headlines about efforts from Uber, Airbus and others. Thus far, the agency, which oversees much busier skies than New Zealand and has long been underfunded, has been slow to adopt rules for new technologies.\n\nOther countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, have been more aggressive about allowing unmanned flights and appear willing to be some of the first places where this technology will be used. But those countries have never been seen as models for aviation regulators in the rest of the developed world.\n\nNew Zealand, on the other hand, has long been viewed as having a thoughtful and safety-conscious regulatory regime. That means that the rules it develops may become a template for other nations, including the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\nA number of rival companies have been laying the groundwork for air taxis. In November, Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences. Airbus made an investment two weeks ago in Blade, an aviation start-up in New York. Dubai formed a partnership with a Chinese company, EHang. And of course Uber has an entire division called Uber Elevate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor those who follow the progress in this field \u2014 technologists, flight enthusiasts and billionaires seeking to transform the skies \u2014 it was thought that Mr. Page had been testing flights of a new self-piloting plane only in Northern California; several reports and images revealed the existence of newfangled aircraft last year from a company based there, called Zee Aero, that was associated with Mr. Page.\n\nThe mystery of what has been going on in New Zealand has quietly created a stir among those in the know. Kitty Hawk set up Zephyr in 2016 and has been in discussions, under a nondisclosure agreement, with regulators there for the past 18 months. There has been some speculation about the origin of Zephyr because it lists its chief executive as Fred Reid, who had also been listed as president of Zee Aero.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Before that he was president of Delta Air Lines and president of Lufthansa Airlines, where he was co-architect of the Star Alliance.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Reid said the opportunity to use New Zealand as the first place to commercialize the autonomous taxi service was a step-change in the advancement of the sector. Kitty Hawk is already working on an app that would allow customers to hail one of its air taxis.\n\nThe aircraft, known as Cora, has a wingspan of 36 feet with a dozen rotors all powered by batteries. It can fly about 62 miles and carry two passengers. (Its code name had been Zee.Aero \u2014 hence all the speculation and confusion.) The plan, at least for now, isn\u2019t for Kitty Hawk to sell the vehicles; it wants to own and operate a network of them itself.\n\nBut before everyone gets too excited \u2014 or nervous \u2014 about this \u201cJetsons\u201d-like future, just know that virtually every prediction about how quickly air taxis would arrive has been wrong.

It\u2019s not figurative or representational, it\u2019s abstract, and she\u2019s constantly exploring form and color.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Ms. Selva caught sight of the designer wearing a striking pair of large amethyst earrings (appropriately called the Siren earrings) while walking around the Masterpiece Fair in London. She persuaded Ms. Adriana and Nicholas Briggs, her husband and business partner, to use the rest of their money for flights to New York and, in just a few days, Ms. Selva had sold all five pieces they brought with them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI turned to Nick and said, \u2018I think we have a business,\u2019 \u201d said Ms. Adriana, who until that point had been working part time at Tiffany\u2019s in Harrods and designing jewelry in her spare time.\n\nFor Phillips, Ms. Adriana\u2019s exhibition announces the house\u2019s ambitious plans to bring its jewelry department to the same level as its contemporary art and design business, and demonstrate to its young, urban clientele that jewelry also can be collectible.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHer work takes jewelry to its rightful place alongside our other categories,\u201d said Sarah O\u2019Brien, Phillips\u2019 international business development director of jewelry. \u201cPrecious stones are Lauren\u2019s material of choice, but her work\u2019s appeal transcends her material. It is all about design.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA case in point is one ring created specially for the exhibition (15 pieces were borrowed from their owners; the rest are available for sale, with prices on request).\n\nFormed of an exaggerated dome of chartreuse-colored chrysoberyl in an array of mustard and greenish-yellow shades, it was inspired by 18th-century Portuguese jewels in which slivers of stone were arranged in intricate compositions. \u201cI always looked at them and thought, \u2018Why does no one do this any more?\u2019 \u201d Ms. Adriana said. \u201cI finally found out why.\u201d\n\nIt took almost 10 months to find and cut all the natural-colored gems, which are faceted like old Mogul diamonds. And then came the further challenge of setting the thin pieces in such a complex, three-dimensional puzzle. Ms. Adriana said the result was worth the effort, however: \u201cWhen the sunlight passes through, it looks like it\u2019s glowing.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHer meticulous eye extends from painting detailed watercolors of each of her designs to traveling to Geneva each week to oversee their creation. She was similarly exacting about the design of the exhibition, down to ordering the precise shade of Yves Klein blue for the walls that she uses for her jewelry boxes, and shipping the paint from London to New York. (The boxes are individually created for each gem.)\n\nWhile Ms. Adriana is a self-confessed jewelry history geek, she is resolutely modern in her design approach, and her pursuit of intricate perfection is punctuated by wry humor. She is just as likely to name her creations after a childhood television show as she is to namecheck Fulco di Verdura or Andrew Grima.

Mario M. Cuomo of New York, as a vice president (before Mr. Russert became one of NBC News\u2019s top on-air personalities as the moderator of \u201cMeet the Press\u201d). And he had some successes, including \u201cToday\u2019s\u201d return as ratings leader among morning news programs and an increased regard for \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d which had risen briefly to No. 1 in the ratings in 1987 before falling to third place.\n\nBut after G.E.\u2019s acquisition of RCA, NBC\u2019s parent company, in 1986, Mr. Grossman fell out of favor with his new bosses \u2014 Jack Welch, G.E.\u2019s chairman, and Robert C. Wright, NBC\u2019s president, as well as with Tom Brokaw, the anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News.\u201d\n\nTo Mr. Grossman, corporate ownership of news divisions (Loews controlled CBS and Capital Cities had bought ABC) had increased the pressure to make a profit.\n\n\u201cIt was quickly apparent that the most costly thing in putting on nightly news programs is covering the hard news,\u201d he said in 2001 in an interview with Harry Kreisler of the Institute of International Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn his book \u201cThree Blind Mice\u201d (1991), Ken Auletta described awkward encounters between Mr. Welch and Mr. Grossman, like one in which Mr. Grossman pushed for a four percent budget increase for the news division, not the five percent cut he had been told to make.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHow dare you come in at four percent above 1986 when the word is out that you have to keep below the current budget?\u201d Mr. Welch shouted.\n\nAfter Mr. Grossman told him, \u201cThat\u2019s what we need,\u201d Mr. Welch reproved him, saying, as quoted by Mr. Auletta: \u201cYou guys spend more money! My kids could do better!\u201d\n\nThe next day, Mr. Welch, still angry, ordered Mr. Grossman to make the budget cut. But Mr. Grossman stayed for nearly two more years and supervised layoffs. He was forced out in 1988, replaced by Michael Gartner.\n\nIn an email on Friday, Mr. Brokaw wrote that NBC News had needed \u201can aggressive seasoned hand\u201d with experience in journalism and production to \u201cgo against Roone Arledge,\u201d the president of ABC News, \u201cand the CBS veteran team.\u201d\n\nHe added that Mr. Grossman had \u201cfailed to appreciate the change represented by the arrival of Jack Welch and G.E. Jack knew the department needed fresh ideas, but Larry failed to provide them.\u201d\n\nLawrence Kugelmass Grossman was born in Brooklyn on June 21, 1931. His father, Nathaniel H. Kugelmass, was a lawyer; his mother, the former Rose Goldstein, was a high school administrator. His father died when Lawrence was 3, and his mother later married Nathan Grossman, also a lawyer, who adopted him.\n\nAfter attending Midwood High School \u2014 where a journalism teacher opened his mind to the world of communication \u2014 he graduated from Columbia University, where he studied English and political science. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Alberta Nevler, who was attending Radcliffe.\n\nBut he left Harvard after a year and joined Look magazine in the promotions department. Hoping to be a journalist, he sent story ideas to editors there but found no takers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHired in the mid-1950s by CBS to do advertising and promotion for the news division during the era of Edward R. Murrow, he continued to hope for a journalism job but did not succeed.\n\nThen, at NBC, where he was a vice president of advertising from 1962 to 1966, he met Mr. Tinker, who was then in programming; their friendship would lead Mr. Tinker to consider only Mr. Grossman for the presidency of NBC News.\n\nBut that was still nearly two decades away. After leaving NBC for the first time, he opened an advertising, marketing and communications firm. PBS, one of his clients, hired him as its president in 1976.\n\nIn 1980, he refused to bow to pressure that PBS not show \u201cDeath of a Princess,\u201d a film based on a true story about a Saudi princess who had been publicly beheaded for adultery a few years earlier. Mobil Oil, a major PBS underwriter, protested. Some members of Congress spoke out. And Warren M. Christopher, the secretary of state, relayed a letter of concern from the Saudi Ambassador to the United States.\n\nMr. Grossman\u2019s stance \u201cwas the single most important thing he did at PBS,\u201d Richard Wald, a professor emeritus at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and a former NBC News president, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe created a sense in PBS that they were doing important work, and it caused PBS to stand up straighter. It was enormously important to how PBS conducted itself thereafter.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his granddaughter Ms. Grossman-Cohen, a marketing executive at The New York Times, Mr. Grossman is survived by his wife, who is known as Boots; three daughters, Susan and Caroline Grossman and Jennifer Grossman Peltz; a brother, Daniel; five other grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAfter leaving NBC, he wrote \u201cThe Electronic Republic: Reshaping Democracy in the Information Age\u201d (1995), about how interactive telecommunications of that era \u2014 faxed petitions, email lobbying and 900-number telephone polls \u2014 were providing citizens with more direct participation in politics and making them the \u201cnew fourth estate.\u201d\n\nIn her review in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote that Mr. Grossman expresses his ideas in \u201cstrong, clear language, eschewing both the na\u00efve optimism about technology that has colored so much American thinking in the past and the doomsaying of many contemporary critics.\u201d", "title": "Lawrence K.

{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "The emoluments case raises basic questions that have never been litigated. Even the specific definition of an emolument is unclear. During a January court hearing, Judge Messitte seemed to acknowledge that the case would ultimately be decided by a higher court than his.\n\nAlthough the president\u2019s critics are hoping that the judge will allow the plaintiffs to scrutinize the Trump Organization\u2019s financial records, perhaps even including the president\u2019s tax returns, it was not clear from Wednesday\u2019s opinion whether the judge would permit such discovery. The next stage of the case is expected to involve arguments about what constitutes an emolument.\n\nNonetheless, for the plaintiffs, the ruling that they have legal standing to challenge the president\u2019s actions is an important first step in their quest to show that Mr. Trump crossed a constitutional line. \u201cWe look forward now to proceeding to address the constitutional issues and demonstrate that the emoluments clauses forbid the things of value that are flowing into the president\u2019s pockets from governments foreign and domestic,\u201d said Norman L. Eisen, the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, who is serving as a co-counsel in the case.\n\nThe judge limited the scope of the suit to the Trump International Hotel, down the street from the White House, and businesses related to it that are owned by the Trump Organization. The president\u2019s other business interests \u2014 such as the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida \u2014 are not at issue, he found, because they have no clear effect on the plaintiffs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nJudge Messitte rejected the Justice Department\u2019s argument that it is up to Congress, not a court, to decide whether the president has violated the emoluments clauses. He noted that the domestic emoluments clause, which restricts economic benefits to the president from government entities in the United States, makes no mention of Congress. \u201cCongress has nary a say about it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nWhile the constitution does state that Congress can allow the president to accept gifts from foreign governments, he wrote, that does not rule out a lawsuit claiming violations. \u201cIf that were so, the Supreme Court would not have decided other cases involving constitutional provisions containing similar consent-of-Congress provisions,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHis opinion on that question contradicted that of a federal judge in Manhattan, who last year threw out a lawsuit in which different plaintiffs claimed similar violations. During oral arguments, Judge Messitte was dismissive of that judge\u2019s opinion, saying it seemed to lack rigorous analysis. He noted in his opinion that states are not ordinary litigants but have enhanced standing in cases involving the federal government. The plaintiffs in the New York case were nongovernmental.\n\nLawyers for the Justice Department argued that there was no proof that Washington or Maryland properties were losing customers to Mr. Trump\u2019s properties. Even if they are, they contended, that does not amount to a constitutional violation by the president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Judge Messitte found that the local governments \u201chave alleged sufficient facts to show that the president\u2019s ownership in the hotel has had and almost certainly will continue to have an unlawful effect on competition.\u201d\n\nHe noted that some foreign government officials had stated publicly that they chose to patronize the Trump International Hotel because the president\u2019s family owns it, and that some foreign governments had canceled reservations at other hotels and transferred their business to the president\u2019s.\n\nHe also noted that the governor of Maine, Paul LePage, stayed at the Trump International Hotel last year shortly before he appeared at a news conference at which Mr. Trump signed an executive order that could affect a park and national monument in his state. That suggests that officials from Maryland and Washington might feel \u201cobliged, i.e., coerced, to patronize the hotel in order to help them obtain federal favors,\u201d the judge wrote.", "title": "Lawsuit Over Trump\u2019s Ties to His Businesses Is Allowed to Advance", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere"]}

{"date": "2018-03-07 00:00:00", "text": "Americans now have a terrific new introduction to that story with the publication of Ronen Bergman\u2019s \u201cRise and Kill First: The Secret History of Israel\u2019s Targeted Assassinations.\u201d It\u2019s easy to understand why Bergman\u2019s book is already a best seller. It moves at a torrid pace and tells stories that would make Jason Bourne sit up and say \u201cWow!\u201d It is smart, thoughtful and balanced, and the English translation is superb. It deserves all of the plaudits it has already received.\n\nA word of warning: Bergman is properly focused on the narrow story of Israel\u2019s targeted killings. Other aspects of its lifelong counterterrorism struggle are largely absent. For instance, Israel\u2019s \u201csecurity barriers\u201d against the West Bank and Gaza, highly controversial and highly successful, are not even mentioned. For those looking for a more comprehensive account, try Daniel Byman\u2019s outstanding \u201cA High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism,\u201d or Ami Pedahzur\u2019s older but still insightful \u201cThe Israeli Secret Services and the Struggle Against Terrorism.\u201d\n\nYet the biggest thing (almost) left out of Bergman\u2019s book is that targeted killing offers no end to the terrorism. Targeted killings are a tactic, not a strategy. Only at the very end of \u201cRise and Kill First\u201d is this problem confronted, and only because Bergman himself puts it squarely on the table before finishing his narrative. That\u2019s a compliment, not a criticism of Bergman, because it reflects the inability of Israel\u2019s own national security community to solve this problem, and too often even to acknowledge it.\n\nWhat Bergman demonstrates is that targeted killing can be a highly effective tactic to neutralize terrorist cells and can be part of a powerful operational approach to cripple terror groups. Israel\u2019s internal security agency, known as Shin Bet, believes that every successful killing of a suicide bomber saves 16 to 20 Israeli lives.\n\nBut it does not offer a strategic answer to the problem of terrorism because it cannot defeat the broader movements that breed and feed the terrorist groups. Like some modern-day hydra, no matter how many heads Israel chops off, the beast always grows new ones \u2014 sometimes more dangerous than before.\n\nPhoto\n\nTerrorism is a form of insurgency, and the way that nations have learned to defeat it is by applying what we now call counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy. The core of a COIN strategy is to suppress the groups\u2019 military operations while addressing the underlying grievances that inspire the movement behind them. It is ultimately what is meant by the worn phrase \u201cwinning hearts and minds.\u201d\n\nIsrael has a big problem here. Targeted killings, barriers and other security activities can suppress terror attacks, but it is not at all clear that Israel can ever win the hearts and minds of the Palestinians, the crucial foundation for Palestinian terrorist groups. It had the same problem with the Shiites of Lebanon and their support for Hezbollah. That\u2019s because the Israeli occupation is a central grievance of the Palestinians, as it was for Lebanon\u2019s Shiites.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIsraeli military officers have devoured the vast literature on COIN warfare, eagerly adapting its tactics and operational methods. However, ask an Israeli soldier or general about the strategic aspects of COIN and they almost invariably insist that it\u2019s wrong. They will claim that they tried to win hearts and minds in Gaza and the West Bank and it just didn\u2019t work because it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nOnly a few will acknowledge that the problem is not with COIN strategy, but with Israel\u2019s ability to execute the strategy without doing something that is politically \u2026 hard. The deepest truth is that Israel so far has not tried the one thing that could address the underlying grievances that give life to its terrorist enemies, trading land for peace. Some of Israel\u2019s brightest counterterror minds know this. It is why the senior leadership of its defense and intelligence establishments are typically so committed to the peace process, as revealed by the 2012 Israeli documentary \u201cThe Gatekeepers.\u201d\n\nToday many Israelis are justifiably skeptical that they have a partner for peace. Many Palestinians are justifiably skeptical that Israel is a partner for peace.\n\nRegardless of whether you believe one side, the other, or both, it still means that the most obvious approach Israel might try to find a strategic end to the problem of terrorism is off the table. Israel\u2019s political right has insisted that there are one-state solutions that could address Palestinian grievances, but the plans they have presented so far seem fanciful, and the Israeli government has shown no inclination to try them.\n\nSome in the current Israeli government seem to believe that its new covert alliances with Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Iran will furnish a strategic path out \u2014 that the Arab states will persuade the Palestinians to give up and reconcile themselves to Israeli suzerainty. One can\u2019t be certain it won\u2019t work, but you shouldn\u2019t bet money that it will.\n\nSince Israel cannot or will not employ the core strategic approach of COIN, it is left with nothing but tactics, targeted killings high among them. It consigns Israel to endless repression, endless assassinations, endless criticism and endless racking internal debate like that which Bergman diligently recounts.\n\nAll of this holds inevitable lessons for the United States. The most successful counterterror campaigns in American history rested on strategic efforts to undermine the popular movements behind the terrorist groups. In 2006-8, in Iraq, George W. Bush\u2019s surge strategy crippled the Sunni Arab terrorist groups by helping Sunni Arabs defend themselves, granting them economic benefits and political power, and shutting down the ethnic cleansing campaigns of the Shiite militias. It was a virtuoso effort that eliminated the grievances of the Sunni community, at least until the United States and Nuri al-Maliki let them come roaring back after 2010.\n\nYet when it comes to fighting terrorism in places like Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Niger and Libya, the tactics \u2014 starting with targeted killing by drone \u2014 are all we seem willing to employ. It consigns us to the same kind of endless war that the Israelis seem ready to bear. Yet how sure are we that America\u2019s people and political system are as inured to the forever war as Israel\u2019s claim to be?\n\nBy the end of Bergman\u2019s book, targeted killing feels almost like a drug that Israel uses to treat the worst symptom (terrorism) of a terrible disease (Palestinian anger). It is a very effective drug, but it treats only the symptom and so offers no cure. It is also a very addictive one, in part because it is so effective at suppressing the symptoms.\n\nI fear that we are all becoming targeted-killing junkies, unable to kick the habit and unwilling to treat the disease that got us hooked in the first place.", "title": "Learning From Israel\u2019s Political Assassination Program", "authors": ["Kenneth M.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "Over the next few hours, L\u00f3pez and I remained in contact. With agents in the adjoining room, we spoke quietly and traded messages. A few minutes before 10 p.m., he was still uncertain what to expect. \u201cWe have asked what is happening,\u201d he said, \u201cand finally they told us that there is the possibility that they take me back to Ramo Verde.\u201d An hour later, little had changed. \u201cThey are still here,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the outcome is going to be. I don\u2019t know what is happening. I don\u2019t know if it was because they got the alert of the publication, or something else is happening.\u201d\n\nFor all its political repression, Venezuela is not yet North Korea or even Cuba. There are still remnants of the democratic institutions that once made it the envy of the region. The national Legislature, for example, was effectively dissolved by the Maduro government after opposition candidates won a majority in 2015 \u2014 but representatives of the National Assembly continue to meet and legislate in defiance of the administration. A handful of local and regional agencies have also maintained a semblance of independence, and when Sebin agents were still inside the house the following morning, L\u00f3pez and Tintori began to raise alarms with their political allies.\n\nBy midday, representatives of the National Assembly had gathered in front of the house to stage a protest. When journalists gathered to report on the scene, the police arrested half a dozen of them \u2014 but word was already spreading through the international community. Condemnation poured in from foreign leaders and organizations, including the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, who declared the invasion \u201cillegal, violating rights.\u201d The office of child-protective services visited the home and took a stand against Sebin, issuing a public order that the presence of armed guards in ski masks was a threat to the well-being of the L\u00f3pez children. Agents finally withdrew, taking up a position on the front sidewalk, where they remain in ski masks and tactical gear. How long they will stay, and what they are planning, is unclear. The agents have given no indication to L\u00f3pez, and the Venezuelan government has not responded to my inquiries.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome observers have suggested a direct connection between my article on L\u00f3pez and the raid. Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a prominent scholar of Venezuela, who served as the country\u2019s minister of trade and industry, captured this sentiment in a post on social media: \u201cIn reaction to this New York Times magazine\u2019s article, Maduro\u2019s political police is acting against Leopoldo L\u00f3pez and his wife.\u201d But many people close to L\u00f3pez have doubts. Agents entered the home several hours before my story was published, and friends of L\u00f3pez find it difficult to believe that, after spending the past six months either unaware or unconcerned by our interviews, the Maduro government finally noticed and objected, just when it was too late.\n\nThis weekend, I spoke with several people who suggested another possibility. They pointed out that the raid did not coincide merely with the article but also with an accelerating crackdown on his political movement.\n\nThe party that L\u00f3pez founded in 2009, Voluntad Popular, is by far the most confrontational element of the Venezuelan opposition. It was through Voluntad Popular that L\u00f3pez organized the widespread demonstrations that led to his arrest in 2014. I wrote about the day of his arrest \u2014 how he called for supporters to gather in a city plaza, dressed in white as a sign of peace, and delivered a speech before turning himself in to the National Guard, who placed him inside a military vehicle but could not find a way out of the crowd until L\u00f3pez, using a megaphone, persuaded his followers to clear a path. To describe that scene is one thing; to see it is another: This video offers a visceral sense of the energy and intensity of the movement L\u00f3pez leads, and the reason it could seem threatening to a ruling party.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nSince that day, even with L\u00f3pez in prison, Voluntad Popular has continued to be the most combative wing of the opposition. During an attempted negotiation this winter between opposition leaders and the Maduro government, Voluntad Popular was the first party to declare the process a failure and leave the table; Voluntad Popular was also the first major party to boycott this year\u2019s presidential race. In each case, the other major parties followed, and the Maduro government has now postponed the presidential election.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the government has also intensified pressure on Voluntad Popular. Nearly 90 members of the party have been arrested. One of them is Gilber Caro, a member of the National Assembly, who was recently transferred to an undisclosed location, where he is being denied access to legal counsel or any contact with the outside. On March 5, the United Nations commission on human rights condemned this treatment of Caro, demanding that his attorneys and family be \u201cimmediately informed of his whereabouts\u201d and classifying his captivity as an \u201cenforced disappearance under international law.\u201d Another member of Voluntad Popular, Freddy Guevara, is the vice president of the National Assembly. Guevara was traveling on the border with Colombia when he received word that the Maduro government was preparing to arrest him. The charges were never stipulated, but the threat was too serious to ignore, and he approached the government of Chile to obtain sanctuary at the embassy. When I spoke with Guevara a few days ago, he told me that he saw no other choice, and sees fewer now. \u201cThey wanted to use me as an example to the other congressmen, that no one is untouchable,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to give them that advantage, so I decided to assume this part of the struggle in an embassy, and not in jail. But I don\u2019t know when I will be out, when I will be free.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Feb. 15, Maduro commandeered the national airwaves to disparage Voluntad Popular, along with the other political party that Lopez helped to found, Primero Justicia, as \u201cviolent fascist groups\u201d that no longer have legal standing in Venezuela and exist \u201coutside the law.\u201d The leader of Primero Justicia, Julio Borges, has a long history with L\u00f3pez. In 1992, they founded Primero Justicia as a civil organization; in 2000, they converted the group into a political party; and in 2008 their paths diverged over a spate of differences about party management and political philosophy. A core distinction between them is that Borges leans considerably to the right, while Lopez is an elected member of the Socialist International. Even so, Lopez and Borges have resumed a close partnership over the past few months, with Lopez leading Voluntad Popular and Borges serving as president of the National Assembly. When Voluntad Popular withdrew from negotiations with the Maduro government this winter, Primero Justicia was right behind. When Voluntad Popular announced plans to boycott the presidential election, Primero Justicia did the same.\n\nAs a consequence, the risk to Borges has been steadily rising. In recent weeks, he has remained outside the country. When I caught up with him yesterday evening, he was adamant that Primero Justicia will no longer participate in the electoral process until there is international monitoring of fraud. This position has put his party and his life in jeopardy. \u201cI have been threatened both in public and in private, violently intimidated on multiple occasions, accused by Maduro on national television of all type of made-up stories and physically hit several times,\u201d Borges told me. \u201cThe weaker the government is, the more aggressive they get.\u201d\n\nIn light of the crackdown on opposition figures, many people close to L\u00f3pez suspect that the raid of his home was unconnected to my article. In fact, they wonder if the agents from Sebin learned about the story only when it appeared online in the middle of the raid, and if the article might even have complicated their plans to arrest him.\n\nFor his part, L\u00f3pez is unsure what to believe. What he does know is that the phalanx of secret police is still stationed outside his house, and the agents have given no indication of when they plan to leave. The prospect of going back to prison remains palpable and distressing, but L\u00f3pez said he is prepared for whatever comes. \u201cThat\u2019s the role of leadership in a situation like this,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not about campaigning, or fliers, or the best slogan, or political marketing. It\u2019s about talking to people and expressing ideas in a confusing situation.

Uber \u2014 which has a track record of arrogance \u2014 did the right thing by suspending driverless tests in Arizona and elsewhere until it understands what went wrong. It shouldn\u2019t focus only on the specific issues in the Tempe crash. The company should also ask what other lurking problems may exist.\n\nSecond, everyone \u2014 policymakers, the media, the public \u2014 should recognize how the Tempe crash may feed a dangerous pattern of irrationality: Human beings are quick to rationalize their own errors and quick to obsess over a machine\u2019s errors. As Cade Massey of the University of Pennsylvania told me yesterday, \u201cPeople punish the machine more harshly for mistakes than they do humans.\u201d\n\nWhen a machine makes an error, human beings are reluctant to use it again, as research by Massey and others has shown. When people make a mistake, they often persuade themselves that they know how to avoid repeating it \u2014 even when there is abundant evidence that they don\u2019t, and they will go on repeating it. Sometimes, machines are more reliable than people, but people still insist on being in control.\n\nHuman-driven cars kill more than 100 Americans on average each day. This country now has the most dangerous roads, per mile driven, of any affluent country. And less than 30 years ago, our roads were no more dangerous than those in any average affluent country.\n\nUber and the other driverless-car companies have a moral responsibility to make their products safer than they evidently are. The rest of us have a responsibility to realize that the status quo \u2014 human-driven cars killing 100 Americans each day \u2014 isn\u2019t acceptable, either. Vehicle safety was a crisis long before driverless cars came along. I\u2019m still hopeful that driverless cars are a big part of the solution. If they\u2019re not, or they\u2019re going to take a long time to go mainstream, we should take other steps to save lives.\n\nFor more: These two columns have some specific suggestions about improving vehicle safety.\n\nPuerto Rico update.

Plus, I found the brooms beautiful \u2014 the simplicity of their form (stick and grass bound together for a purpose) was alluring in a way that a decorative object could never be. This was partly thanks to the pride I discovered in making the broom. But it was also that, in doing so, I was able to see \u2014 and appreciate \u2014 something which was previously closed off to me.\n\nFOR THOUSANDS OF years and still today in many parts of the world, brooms were fashioned at home as needed from whatever brushy stuff was on hand: reeds, sticks or grasses, lashed together, often with a stick pushed into them. The British turned these round-bottom besoms, as they were called, into a trade with besom squires hawking their wares, but Americans created the broom as we know it today. Given this country\u2019s puritanical legacy and its conflation of godliness and cleanliness, it\u2019s not surprising that America\u2019s singular contribution to world handicraft would be the enhanced collection of dust from inaccessible corners.\n\nImage An 18th-century illustration featuring a traditional Japanese broom. While most manufactured brooms today are based on American innovations, the brooms handcrafted around the world are regionally distinct based on aesthetics, plant matter and tradition. Credit \u00a9Pictures from History/the Image Works\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, the story goes, a Massachusetts farmer decided to fashion a broom for his wife from the long seed tassels of Sorghum vulgare, a corn look-alike cultivated as animal feed. This so-called \u201cbroom corn\u201d captured dirt rather than just pushing it around, making it better suited to sweeping than any bundle of brush that preceded it. Today, it is still used in manufactured brooms around the world.\n\nBut the transformation of brooms from round to flat \u2014 their Copernican Revolution \u2014 was the brainchild of the efficiency-seeking Shakers. Soon after the widespread adoption of broom corn in the early 1800s, one of their brethren clamped the wayward bristles down with a vise and stitched them flat. This new, slender profile increased control and range, covering a greater area more quickly.\n\nThough nearly all brooms today are unremarkable objects mass-produced in Mexico, there are a small number of people in North America devoted to hand-crafting them. The makers run the gamut from Americana buffs to hippie holdouts, and the brooms are mostly minimalist Shaker or backwoods Appalachian in style (wonkily bent, bark-clad branches as handles and decorative braiding). While these brooms don\u2019t possess the delicacy of their Japanese counterparts, crafted with a sense of the poetry found in humility and imperfection, they do reflect American culture in the upright pragmatism of their aesthetic.", "title": "Lessons in the Humble Art of Broom-Making", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-14 00:00:00", "text": "One of my best teenage memories starts with a natural disaster. In January 1998, my parents and I returned to our home in Montreal to find that a giant tree limb had ruptured our living room. What would soon be known as the Great Quebec Ice Storm had struck. It was the most catastrophic in modern Canadian history. Accumulations of freezing rain had cracked our maple tree nearly in half. It shattered our front window, glass fringing the tree limb like a body outline in a murder scene.\n\nOutside, downed power lines sparked like electric snakes. More than a million Quebecers were left without power. Cars were crushed and impaled by fallen limbs. Because the ice could inflict violence at any moment, everyone retreated indoors, making for an oddly quiet state of emergency. Except for the distant beeps of electrical-crew trucks, all you could hear was the crack of trees buckling under the weight of the ice, day and night. Long after the sidewalks were cleared, we tiptoed past the eaves of tall buildings and kept our voices low, steering clear of icicles thick as baseball bats and sharp as spikes, primed to fall at any moment.\n\nFor seven days and seven nights, until the power returned, we lived by candlelight. We learned to be mindful of candles: how to stand them up, walk with them, nurture their light. At first it was maddening to cook dinner \u2014 to carefully carry a plate of candles to the cupboard, poke around for ingredients, then go off again in search of a knife, taking care not to drip wax into the cutlery drawer. I learned how to brush my teeth and bathe by candlelight; the light bounced off the mirrors, making the bathroom for once the brightest room in the house. In our bedrooms, we piled under blankets and read ourselves to sleep by the flickering flames.\n\nOutside, our neighborhood descended into darkness at twilight, but if I stared hard enough at windows blurred with ice, I could just make out little dancing lights. Decades later, no one in my family remembers what we talked about, or ate, or how we spent our afternoons that week. But we all remember the candles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI\u2019ve since settled in California, and last January events in the world left me with a hunger for silence. I adopted a strict information diet: no television news or social media. One evening, I didn\u2019t even bother to flick on the lights in my apartment. I walked quietly to the window and watched the last of the day, the darkness swallowing the trees along my street. Instinctively, I went looking for a book of matches in the back of the kitchen junk drawer. Opening a closet, I felt around until I discovered the remnant of a housewarming gift: a milk-white candle. I struck a match and lit the dusty wick. I commandeered a plate from the cupboard and set it on my coffee table. I nestled in a blanket, listening to the wind in the courtyard. Eventually, for the first time in too many days, I found myself surrendering to sleep.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I light a candle or two or three \u2014 enough to read a book by, or to just sit and stare at the flame, which, by drawing oxygen, reminds me I need to breathe, too.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "The promise of a modern sewage system is the freedom to forget that the waste goes somewhere. It\u2019s an indulgence that quickly hardens into abuse \u2014 which, in turn, hardens into something else altogether. Over the years, in London, millions of tiny droplets of cooking oil have been funneled down into the city\u2019s underbelly from the drains of fried-chicken shops and curry houses, slipping past grease traps in a swirl of wastewater. At the same time, in homes all across town, wet wipe after wet wipe has been flushed out of sight and into the mix, where their plasticized fibers formed a skeleton around which the fat could accrete. Slowly, the incipient mass began to trap tampons, condoms and often a discarded needle or two in its oily matrix, eventually growing into a monstrous subterranean clot the length of 22 double-decker buses with the weight of a blue whale: the Whitechapel Fatberg.\n\nThe fatberg was discovered in September 2017; just nine weeks later, it was gone. Utility workers clad in hazmat gear broke up the blockage with water jets and shovels before sucking it out into tanks and processing most of it into biodiesel. One large chunk was saved, however, at the request of the Museum of London, which opened a new exhibition in February titled, simply, \u201cFatberg!\u201d Its chief attraction is the chance to see, in person, this last remnant of the Whitechapel monstrosity. The week it opened, I lined up, elbowing past school kids and pensioners for the chance to gaze upon the shoebox-size lump.\n\nAt first glance, a fatberg is not very appealing. Its surface is disconcertingly soft-looking, a beige putty color, waxy in places and chalkier in others. Fatberg scientists \u2014 a lonely group \u2014 theorize that as cooking oil ages in the low-oxygen conditions of a sewer, it undergoes a process of saponification, hardening into a crumbly, soaplike substance whose nearest relation is the layer of \u201cgrave wax\u201d that can mummify a buried corpse in a shroud of its own exuded fat. The museum\u2019s head of conservation, Sharon Robinson-Calver, told me that when the fatberg first arrived, its most notable feature was its smell \u2014 a cocktail of rotting meat mixed with dirty diapers, its rancid base notes all but drowned out by an ammoniac tang. When the fatberg was fresh, she recalled, it was still sloppy, with reddish maggots visibly writhing beneath its glutinous surface. By the time I saw it, the fatberg had dried and begun to crumble, revealing the treasures concealed within: I spotted chunks of Styrofoam, as well as the distinctive orange-and-purple plumage of a Double Decker chocolate-bar wrapper.\n\nBeing superlatively revolting is, however, not enough to merit an object\u2019s display alongside the Museum of London\u2019s priceless collection of Roman ruins, Elizabethan jewelry and Art Deco ironwork \u2014 particularly when the thing in question risks infecting staff members with incurable diseases. Robinson-Calver said she kept the fatberg under observation in quarantine for several weeks, submitting it to chemical and X-ray testing before judging it admissible to the museum\u2019s public galleries. In part, the curators and conservators say they went to the trouble of acquiring, conserving and displaying the fatberg in the hope that a face-to-face confrontation with their creation will provoke the shock needed to change Londoners\u2019 habits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond its didactic value, a fatberg functions as a kind of collective self-portrait. Whitechapel High Street, under which the megafatberg was found, was recently named the unhealthiest in Britain thanks to its concentration of fast-food outlets. The wet wipe, which was first introduced to the general public by Colonel Sanders in the 1960s, has, in the past decade, become a luxury alternative to toilet paper in the United States and Britain. Together, reunited in the invisible infrastructure of disposal beneath our feet, they form a negative monument to our lives, in all their monstrous, destructive convenience \u2014 the grotesque byproduct of a culture in which fat is too abundant and cheap to bother reusing and even the plushest of toilet paper is no longer worthy of our butts. Below our gleaming, modern metropolis, the city\u2019s dirty secrets lurk, until a blockage ruptures the illusion, forcing Londoners to confront their Dorian Gray-like reflection in a lump of congealed fat and sanitary products.\n\nThese arguments for saving and studying the fatberg are compelling enough, to my mind, but the opportunity to gaze upon it within the museum context achieves something more. Just a few miles northeast of the Whitechapel Fatberg\u2019s underground lair lies the site of the work for which the sculptor Rachel Whiteread is best known: a concrete cast of the interior of a Victorian terraced house in London\u2019s East End. The resulting sculpture made visible the traces \u2014 the cracks, dents and stains \u2014 we leave on our environments by living.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Fatbergs", "authors": ["Nicola Twilley", "Letter Of Recommendation"]}

But N. David Charkes is wrong about who discovered nuclear fission. It was certainly the German radiochemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, at Christmastime in 1938. Their Austrian Jewish physicist colleague Lise Meitner was then in Sweden, having escaped Nazi Germany the previous July. The chemistry was clear if puzzling: Bombarding uranium with neutrons produced barium, element 56, about half as heavy as uranium, element 92. Hahn was skeptical at first but so was Meitner when Hahn wrote to her about the strange result, which she called \u201can extensive burst.\u201d\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year\u2019s, walking in the snowy woods with her physicist nephew, Otto Frisch, Meitner worked out the physical explanation for the strange radiochemical result: Under neutron bombardment, the uranium atom had split into two parts, forming barium and krypton, element 36 (56 + 36 = 92), with an immense release of energy as well.\n\nEarly in the new year, 1939, back in the laboratory in Copenhagen where he was working, Frisch asked an American biologist, William Arnold, what the English term was for cell division. \u201cBinary fission,\u201d Arnold told him.

The states that have adopted the safest teen-driving policies lean left, but only somewhat. Alabama, for example, passed new rules last year. Most states have gotten tougher in the last two decades, and deaths have fallen. But they haven\u2019t fallen nearly enough, because the laws are not tough enough.\n\nWherever you are on the political spectrum, you should be able to support a campaign to reduce teen-driving deaths. For gun-control supporters like me, it\u2019s part of a broader public-health effort. For N.R.A. supporters, it\u2019s a way to save lives that avoids the Second Amendment.\n\nWhat about teenagers who don\u2019t like the idea of losing freedom? Many may not actually be upset. Today\u2019s teenagers aren\u2019t as enamored with driving as previous generations.\n\nThe solution, experts say, revolves around a system called \u201cgraduated drivers licenses,\u201d in which teenagers slowly gain privileges as they gain experience. The reality is that most 16-year-olds aren\u2019t ready to operate a lethal 2,000-pound machine that can punish a few seconds of inattention with death, for the teen or someone else on the road. The fatal-crash rate for 16- and 17-year olds is about six times higher than the rate for people in their 30s and 40s. Teen driving kills a lot of people.\n\nThe ideal system would create three license tiers: first, a permit allowing supervised driving, starting at age 16 or later (not 15, as most states allow); second, an intermediate license, which forbids nighttime driving and distractions, like phone calls or other teens in the car; and finally, after many hours of driving, the full license.\n\nWithin this framework, states can still make different choices. Rural states \u2014 where driving matters more to daily life \u2014 might choose to have somewhat lower age cutoffs. New Jersey, the most densely populated state, makes people wait until age 18 for a full license. New York and Delaware, the two states with the best laws, according to Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, have sharply cut deaths in the last decade.\n\nNo set of laws can eliminate driving deaths. But it\u2019s clear that we can keep a lot more teenagers alive. The question is whether we care enough to do so. The students of Stoneman Douglas have held the country\u2019s attention in recent weeks because of the raw moral power of their plea: Stop letting children die, and start acting like adults.

In a well-practiced sleight of hand, the cashier had double-bagged in plastic a dozen eggs, which were already encased in two protective layers of plastic. I briefly contemplated appealing for the liberation of my groceries but chose the path of least resistance. The deed was done, and the purveyors of plastic had been victorious on this occasion.\n\nIt was not always thus. In the late 1970s, single-use plastic bags were seldom available in grocery stores. Since then they have become an omnipresent part of the exchange of merchandise for money, a \u201cfree\u201d offering to consecrate the ritual. An estimated one trillion bags are used each year globally, but they are so seamlessly ingrained into our daily routines that we hardly notice. It is difficult to imagine life without them.\n\nThe average American throws away about 10 single-use plastic bags per week, but New Yorkers use twice the national average. Some 23 billion are used across the state each year \u2014 more than enough, when tied together, to stretch to the moon and back 13 times. In the short trip from store to home the utility of these bags is spent, but the bags themselves can take millions of times longer to break down in landfill.\n\nYes, you are correct. This is crazy and entirely unnecessary. In Ireland, my home country, plastic bags were once an essential part of daily life. They were often found polluting waterways and littering the countryside, fluttering in trees and hedges. After a 15 euro cent fee was introduced in 2002, however, annual use dropped from an estimated 328 to 14 per person by 2014. Within a year of the fee\u2019s imposition, a national survey found that 90 percent of shoppers were using reusable bags; litter had also been reduced significantly.", "title": "Opinion | Let\u2019s Bag Plastic Bags", "authors": []}

The authority he challenged has already become history. The freedom he desired in his writings has become a way of life in Taiwan.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nLi Ao was born on April 25, 1935, in Harbin in what was then the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo. His father, Li Dingyi, was an educator and school principal who had eight children \u2014 six daughters and two sons \u2014 with Mr. Li\u2019s mother, Zhang Kuichen.\n\nWhen Li Ao was 2, the family moved to Beijing, where his father took a position in an opium-suppression bureau. In a memoir, published in 1998, Mr. Li recalled an incident in which his father was accused by his superiors of being a traitor to the party. Though his father\u2019s name was later cleared, it was Mr. Li\u2019s first taste of what would become a lifelong loathing for the Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party.\n\n\u201cTo be patriotic, you must follow the Kuomintang, and only the Kuomintang, forever,\u201d Mr. Li wrote. \u201cRegardless of how many contributions you may have made, the party is benevolent simply for not calling you a \u2018traitor.\u2019 This is a lesson my father learned painfully.\u201d\n\nFollowing the victory of the Communists over the Kuomintang in 1949, a teenage Mr. Li and his family joined the wave of defeated Nationalists retreating to Taiwan. Not long after, he began to make his name as a writer while he was a student at National Taiwan University.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1961, Mr. Li, then 26, had graduated and completed a brief stint in the Taiwanese military when he began writing for a popular, liberal literary magazine called Wen Hsing, or Apollo.\n\nAt the time, Taiwan was more than a decade into a nearly 40-year period of political repression known as the White Terror, during which the Kuomintang imposed authoritarian rule and arrested and tortured tens of thousands of Taiwanese accused of spying for Communist China. At least 1,000 were executed.\n\nDespite the immense pressures on intellectuals, the young Mr. Li emerged as a rare voice of dissent, railing against traditional Chinese culture and the Kuomintang government while advocating for the adoption of Western cultural values like liberalism and democracy. Under Mr. Li\u2019s editorship, Apollo became one of the most influential reformist magazines in Taiwan.\n\nIn 1965, Mr. Li made a daring decision to publish an essay in Apollo lambasting the Kuomintang propaganda chief. In response, the government shut down the publication.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cLi Ao was one of the first people in Taiwan to really speak out against the Kuomintang,\u201d said Chen Fang-ming, chairman of the Graduate Institute of Taiwanese Literature at National Chengchi University. \u201cHe helped foster the spirit of resistance in my generation. In the 1960s, before there were any movements outside the party, Li Ao \u2014 one man with a pen \u2014 helped pave the way for a new era.\u201d\n\nIn 1971, Mr. Li was arrested and charged with helping Peng Ming-min, a prominent dissident who advocated for Taiwanese independence, flee the country. After a court found Mr. Li guilty of attempting to subvert the government, he spent five years in prison, and his case drew wide international attention.\n\nWith Taiwan\u2019s transition toward democracy and freedom of speech in the late 1980s, the ban on Mr. Li\u2019s books was lifted. Soon after, dissenting voices like his were no longer so rare.\n\nIn his later years, Mr. Li was often criticized at home for supporting the reunification of Taiwan and mainland China. In 2000, he ran for president on a platform of reunification, openly calling for \u201cone country, two systems,\u201d but received only 0.13 percent of the vote.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2004, Mr. Li, then 69, was elected to Taiwan\u2019s legislature as an independent candidate. He often used the office as a bullhorn for his rabble-rousing anti-establishment positions. In one of a series of incidents in 2006, Mr. Li \u2014 clad in a mask and wielding a stun gun \u2014 discharged a canister of tear gas during a legislative committee meeting in an effort to block a debate on a deal to purchase arms from the United States.\n\n\u201cI am an old man and I can risk my life,\u201d said Mr. Li said at the time. \u201cSee who dares to pass the bill.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, Mr. Li was briefly married to the Taiwanese actress Terry Hu. In 1992, he married Wang Chih-hui. He is survived by Ms. Wang; their children, Lee Kan and Lee Chen; as well as a daughter, Li Wen, from a previous relationship.\n\nThough many at home disagreed with his pro-mainland positions, Mr. Li\u2019s deep disdain for the establishment often extended to the Chinese Communist Party. This was evident in 2005 when, in a speech before a packed auditorium of teachers and students at Peking University in Beijing, Mr. Li boldly criticized Chinese leaders for suppressing freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cAll over the world leaders have machine guns and tanks,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cSo I\u2019m telling you that in the pursuit of freedom, you have to be smart.

His father, also named Liam, played the fiddle, and his mother, Maisie, played the piano and organ. In an interview rebroadcast by RTE Radio One last week as a tribute, Mr. O\u2019Flynn recalled that his musical awakening came when his parents took him to a classical music concert when he was about 8.\n\n\u201cBefore the concert started, as was the case then, I guess, the orchestra played the national anthem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe audience rose, and the orchestra played, and the effect on me was extraordinary. I actually nearly fainted with the might and the beauty of the sound.\u201d\n\nThe instrument he fixated on, though, was not part of the traditional orchestra.\n\n\u201cAs far back as I can remember, there was something about the sound of uilleann pipes that just struck a chord very deep within me,\u201d he said.

Mr. O\u2019Flynn even shared a rental with Mr. Ennis for a time. When Mr. Ennis died in 1982, he willed Mr. O\u2019Flynn his pipes.\n\nIn a 1999 interview with thistleradio.com, Mr. O\u2019Flynn noted that, though people may have heard the pipes on recordings, they don\u2019t fully appreciate what goes into playing them until they see it done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great when someone comes up to you after seeing the uilleann pipes played for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be utterly amazed by all the things going on. You\u2019re pumping bellows, keeping pressure on your left arm, sending air into the instrument, and they also see something happening under the right wrist, where the regulators are. There\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d\n\nThe instrument had begun to fade from use in Mr. O\u2019Flynn\u2019s childhood, despite a few famed players, but in the 1960s he and others helped bring it back into the public eye and ear. A crucial moment came in the early 1970s, when the folk singer and guitarist Christy Moore asked Mr. O\u2019Flynn and two others, Andy Irvine and Donal Lunny, to play on an album he was making, titled \u201cProsperous.\u201d\n\nThe four realized that they had a unique sound and formed Planxty. Their first album \u2014 titled simply \u201cPlanxty\u201d but often called the Black Album because of its cover, an allusion to the Beatles\u2019 so-called White Album released a few years earlier \u2014 was a revelation.\n\n\u201cThe Planxty Black Album made traditional Irish music as powerful as rock and roll,\u201d Gwen Orel, publisher of the online magazine New York Irish Arts, said by email, drawing a comparison to a signature Rolling Stones song. \u201cThe passion and anger in Planxty\u2019s arrangement of the trad song \u2018The Blacksmith,\u2019 in which a girl is betrayed by her lover, is up there with \u2018Sympathy for the Devil\u2019 any day. It is explosive, scary, even feminist.\u201d\n\nPlanxty disbanded and re-formed several times over the years, but Mr. O\u2019Flynn pursued other projects as well.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Integration has also fallen out of favor because many of its practices fail to adequately consider the needs of black communities. For example, scores of black teachers were fired in the wake of Brown v. Board because some white administrators refused to allow black people to teach white students. This segregated teachers, and it cut off a pathway to a good career and the middle class.\n\nIn addition, poorly designed school-desegregation policies have scarred black students by focusing too narrowly on removing legal barriers to integration rather than creating inclusive school environments that value the abilities and dignity of all children. As a result, new discriminatory policies that cater to white parents, like tracking, as well as other policies that target black kids for punishment, have emerged in schools that are supposedly integrated.\n\nAnd so, school segregation endures. We can see its impact in poor academic and life outcomes and in the overlooked harms to white students who miss the chance to learn from and among black and Latino children. It\u2019s also a major driver of inequity in metropolitan areas dominated by racial divides. Segregation often undermines property wealth in black and Latino communities because of the close relationship between the demand for housing and the perceived quality of local schools. This has the effect of limiting the pool of available tax revenue for funding local school districts.\n\nToday, most people have come to assume that de facto segregation is \u201cjust the way things are\u201d and that our society is destined to remain deeply divided by race and class \u2014 forever separate and unequal.\n\nBut integration is possible. Lawmakers should redraw school district boundaries to include more diverse populations. They must end laws that require students to attend school where they live and instead work to create schools that bring together students from different neighborhoods and class backgrounds. They should also promote housing and land-use policies that eliminate residential segregation.\n\nIntegration would strengthen public schools. And it would move this country much closer to the democratic ideals that Linda Brown and so many others like her sought to achieve.", "title": "Opinion | Linda Brown and the Unfinished Work of School Integration", "authors": []}

He robbed the ball from Cesc Fabregas close to the midfield line, powered his way down the left side of the field, sailing past both Andreas Christensen and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, and then crossed to Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, who was unmarked on the other side of the field after a 60-yard sprint. The young French forward fired a thumping shot past Courtois. It was Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s first goal for Barcelona, confirming his return to form after a mostly frustrating debut season for the Catalan club in which he was long sidelined by injury problems.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo its credit, Chelsea didn\u2019t surrender to Messi and controlled the game for a long spell after Barcelona\u2019s second goal, with Willian, the Brazilian midfielder, displaying the acceleration and power that made him Chelsea\u2019s biggest threat in the first leg. England\u2019s reigning champions then came close to scoring from a set piece in the final seconds of the first half, when Marcos Alonso curled a free kick above Barcelona\u2019s defensive wall and past the outstretched arm of goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stengen. The ball clanked into the outside of the post.\n\nAt the start of the second half, Chelsea upped the pace and Alonso came close on two more occasions. In the 48th minute, he was stopped by a last-ditch, sliding tackle from Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and a minute later, he had a penalty appeal rejected by the referee, after he pierced Barcelona\u2019s defense and tumbled to the ground when challenged from behind by Gerard Piqu\u00e9, Barcelona\u2019s towering defender.\n\nAs Chelsea continued to push forward, however, it also left itself more vulnerable to another moment of brilliance from Messi. In the 63rd minute, the Argentine finished off a stunning counterattacking move, accelerating past Chelsea\u2019s defenders on the left side of the box before swiveling toward Courtois and hitting another low shot through the legs of Chelsea\u2019s hapless keeper.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Antonio R\u00fcdiger, the Chelsea defender, smashed a powerful header onto the crossbar in the 89th minute on Wednesday, but by then Messi had ended any chance of a Chelsea turnaround.\n\nAfter the final whistle, Antonio Conte, Chelsea\u2019s coach, walked onto the field and congratulated some of Barcelona\u2019s players. His longest embrace, of course, was for Messi. He then escorted Messi to the stadium tunnel, whispering into his ear. Afterward, Conte argued that Chelsea\u2019s exit from the Champions League was perhaps unfair, but settled by Messi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right to acknowledge when somebody is a super, super player,\u201d Conte told a news conference. \u201cI was happy to be able to tell Messi how well he played.

Around his neck were two rings on a silver chain. A double-looped black scarf grazed his sternum like a lei. Every so often he paused to adjust the scarf ever so slightly, as if confirming that it was still there. Hello, scarf.\n\nAt 68, Mr. Richie is as busy as he\u2019s ever been. There is \u201cIdol,\u201d of course. Beginning this month, there is also a return to \u201cAll the Hits,\u201d the residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, a place where a proven draw like Lionel Richie could conceivably fiesta forever. There is the home-goods line, whose Instagram feed features many photos of Lionel Richie\u2019s bejeweled hands touching jacquard towels and fine bed linens. There are also grandchildren, to whom the pop icon is Pop-Pop.\n\n\u201cFor a Gemini who probably has about 15 to 20 minutes of attention span,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cthis is pretty darn good.\u201d\n\nAlthough he has made cameo appearances on both \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cCanadian Idol\u201d (as well as their crosstown rival, NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d), his decision to join the judges\u2019 panel full time is a surprise. Like many artists whose achievements predate it, Mr. Richie has criticized the show over the years for promoting cookie-cutter talent. In 2009 he suggested to Blues & Soul magazine that \u201cIdol\u201d would have quickly sent Mick Jagger and James Brown packing.\n\nWhen reminded of these comments, Mr. Richie smiled and lowered his head until it was almost touching the table, as if he\u2019d just been ambushed with a cringeworthy childhood photo.\n\n\u201cWas I a fan of these shows?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely not. I was not.\u201d\n\nBut when he was asked to join the reboot \u2014 \u201cIdol\u201d is getting a fresh start on ABC after 15 seasons on Fox that ended in April 2016 \u2014 Mr. Richie said, he began thinking about how best to make use of the platform. For years, he said, he\u2019s watched an increasingly dysfunctional music business fail to mentor artists for the long haul.\n\n\u201cFor two days a week, Professor Richie is going to talk about the reality of what it takes to be an artist,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of sitting here moaning about how the world has changed since I started, I\u2019m going to tell them what it takes. You think it\u2019s just singing? No, it\u2019s not. What kind of style do you have? What kind of stamina do you have? How many times can you take \u2018No\u2019? How many times can you come back? That\u2019s an artist.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d executive producer, Trish Kinane, who worked on the Fox version of the show from Season 12 to 15, as well, said Mr. Richie genuinely wanted to share his expertise. \u201cI think the viewers can really smell it when people are fake, because they\u2019ve seen these shows so often,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it excited him to think that he could be helping more than one person, through this process, change their lives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Perry said she insisted Mr. Richie join the panel after running into him one night at the Sunset Tower and spending hours listening to him talk about his experiences in the music industry. \u201cIt was just jaw-dropping,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the producers and I put my foot down. I was like, Lionel Richie is the uncle, historian, the wisdom that we are missing on this show.\u201d\n\nHe has \u201cbountiful grace,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen he speaks, the whole room listens. He takes his time, he has patience, he doesn\u2019t feel the need to prove. He is Lionel Richie.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHAD \u201cIDOL\u201d EXISTED in the 1960s, when Mr. Richie was of auditioning age, he would have gone nowhere near it. As a young man, he was painfully shy. He likes to say he thanks God for the Commodores, because without them, he\u2019d never have discovered Lionel Richie.\n\nHe was born in Tuskegee, Ala., and grew up on the campus of Tuskegee University, a few doors down from the Oaks, Booker T. Washington\u2019s former home. He was a freshman economics major at Tuskegee when one of his future bandmates spotted him carrying a saxophone case and offered him a spot in the band that would become the Commodores.\n\nAt the time, Mr. Richie said, he\u2019d been contemplating dropping out of school to join the Episcopalian clergy. Then he did his first show with the band. The curtain rose, Mr. Richie heard the sound of young women screaming in delight, and there went his interest in the priesthood.\n\nAfter a nationwide tour opening for the Jackson 5, the Commodores signed to Motown, and Mr. Richie began to learn the lessons only experience can teach. Once, before a show, he decided to say hello to the members of Parliament-Funkadelic, whose dressing room was down the hall. \u201cThe door opens,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled, \u201cand that was when I realized, This is not Kansas, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d\n\nMr. Richie, who had been an Air Explorer Scout back in Tuskegee, spent about 30 minutes in P-Funk\u2019s lair that night. \u201cEverybody was talented, everybody could sing, and everybody\u2019s naked,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018This is the record business, man.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the Commodores, Mr. Richie co-wrote the deathless wedding-reception staple \u201cBrick House,\u201d but soon discovered he had a knack for ballads.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your James Taylor guy, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI was your Carole King guy. I was your Marvin Gaye guy. Very sensitive. One of the things I heard growing up was, \u2018Mr. and Mrs. Richie, the problem with Lionel is he\u2019s too sensitive.\u2019 And of course, all that meant was that I was a songwriter. I was not a football player, and I was not going to be a hunter. I\u2019m the guy that shot a bird one time and cried over the bird for the next two days, you know? That\u2019s just who I am.\u201d\n\nTuskegee was a bubble of black achievement in the pre-civil rights South, and Mr. Richie said he grew up insulated from many of the cold facts of race in America, including the de facto segregation of pop and R&B on commercial radio. When he began coming into his own as a writer he was almost willfully ignorant of those categories. His hits for the Commodores could be sentimental, even saccharine, but were also sneakily genre-defying. \u201cSail On\u201d is a lonely-loadout lament fit for a mid-70s Jackson Browne album; the 1977 smash \u201cEasy\u201d was pure country.\n\nIn 1978, the Commodores released the Richie-penned \u201cThree Times a Lady\u201d and many black radio stations drew the line, refusing \u2014 at the height of funk and disco \u2014 to play a waltz. Mr. Richie and the Motown promotion executive Skip Miller summoned a group of unconvinced D.J.s and program directors from around the country \u2014 \u201cMy biggest haters,\u201d Mr. Richie said \u2014 for a sit down at a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. There, with Kanye Westian bravado, the not-yet-30-year-old Mr. Richie announced his desire to be the greatest songwriter who\u2019d ever lived \u2014 as opposed to the greatest black songwriter \u2014 and then asked them personally to give his record a shot.\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ve got to play it for a week or two, just to make sure,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou can\u2019t put it on at 11 o\u2019clock at night. Put it on in drive time. If it doesn\u2019t go, I\u2019ll never bother you again.\u201d\n\nIt went. Mr. Richie\u2019s reputation grew. In 1980, Kenny Rogers called to commission a ballad, and Richie wrote, arranged and produced \u201cLady,\u201d the first record of that decade to top three different Billboard charts.\n\nAt Motown\u2019s urging he recorded a solo album, then another. He still assumed he\u2019d retire as a Commodore. He said everything changed after the 1984 Olympics. During the closing ceremony, in front of a worldwide TV audience, Mr. Richie performed \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d dancing on a mechanical riser like a single man atop a wedding cake.\n\nAt first, this didn\u2019t feel like a turning point. \u201cI left the house,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cwent and ran around this field for 20 minutes, got back in the car and left the stadium.\u201d\n\nThen he stopped at an intersection. \u201cI am three cars back from the red light,\u201d he said, \u201cand people are walking up to the car.\u201d He tapped the table urgently, imitating the manic energy of a swarm of excited fans. In that moment, he said, \u201cI became \u2018Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u2019 Lionel Richie All Night Long! Lionel Richie All Night Long! These people have just gotten off the plane from Taipei, but they know Lionel Richie All Night Long.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis period blurs together when he talks about it now. It wasn\u2019t all one year, but it feels that way. The Oscar nomination for \u201cEndless Love.\u201d The Olympics. Leaving the Commodores. Sitting with Michael Jackson, writing the USA for Africa charity single \u201cWe Are the World,\u201d and meeting Jackson\u2019s albino python Muscles, who slipped into the studio unnoticed and greeted Richie with open jaws. (\u201cLionel, he wants to say hello to you,\u201d Mr. Richie recalled Jackson said. \u201cWhy are you screaming?\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a natural workaholic the pace was addictive at first, but Mr. Richie said being a star on that level also brought with it \u201cunbelievable stress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the astronaut,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cand everything on planet Earth is falling apart.\u201d\n\nHe went home to Tuskegee to care for his dying father. Doctors found nodules on his vocal cords. His marriage grew strained, then imploded in tabloid-ugly fashion \u2014 in 1988, his first wife, Brenda, was arrested on an assault charge after catching Mr. Richie with another woman and kicking him in what newspapers referred to, perhaps politely, as the \u201cstomach area.\u201d\n\nBy the end of his most successful decade, Mr. Richie found himself at home in Tuskegee, living in his childhood bedroom. When he was at his lowest, a family friend dropped by, saying he\u2019d brought some inspirational music.\n\n\u201cAnd he brought my albums by,\u201d Mr. Richie said. \u201cHe\u2019d labeled which songs to listen to. He said, \u2018Be sure to listen to the lyrics.\u2019 He gave me my music back.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Richie sat in his old bedroom, where he\u2019d spent many nights grooving to Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cBand of Gypsys\u201d under black light, and listened to his own songs, the ones that had touched so many and brought them so much joy, so much comfort. He sat and cried and found the strength to go on.\n\nHe owns that house now, along with much of the land around it. Someday he wants to turn that land into a beautiful garden. And in that garden he intends to build another little house, where he\u2019ll keep all his memorabilia and awards. A kind of Lionel Richie museum, which visitors to Tuskegee might add to their itineraries along with Booker T. Washington\u2019s house and the field where the Tuskegee Airmen learned to fly.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt may go without saying that the house he means to build in that garden in Tuskegee will be a brick house, but Lionel Richie says it anyway.\n\nPhoto\n\nMR. RICHIE MAY BE the only pop star who has counted both Nelson Mandela and Muammar el-Qaddafi among his die-hard fans. Of course, both of them are gone now. So, too, are many of the artists Mr. Richie thought of as his contemporaries, including Jackson, Prince and Whitney Houston. In the time that Mr. Richie has been a public figure \u2014 and a parent to children who are also navigating public lives \u2014 the very nature of celebrity has been transformed by social media.\n\nMr. Richie\u2019s youngest daughter, Sofia, has been romantically linked to Scott Disick, the estranged partner of Kourtney Kardashian. Over dessert, Mr. Richie considered how the hubbub around this liaison compares to the early 2000s, when his daughter, Nicole, had her own moment of infamy while joined at the hip to Paris Hilton.\n\nMr. Richie said there\u2019s no comparison. \u201cI\u2019m a veteran now,\u201d he said, \u201cbut Nicole was the Gulf War. Nicole and Paris were Vietnam for me. Because I had no experience. What\u2019s happening now with Sofie is leaps and bounds easier, because I know how to approach it. With Nicole, it was like being shot in the head every morning. Did she get arrested? For what? We didn\u2019t know what was coming next.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. To hear Mr. Richie describe it, fatherhood is a job not unlike being the elder-statesman judge on \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d You\u2019re there to provide an example of constancy in an ever-changing world. The fact of your presence serves as a lesson unto itself.\n\n\u201cThere are moments where life should have scared me,\u201d Mr. Richie said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t. Why? Because I was 19 and my parents were the mountain. And I get it now. You know, one day I pulled out of that driveway with the Commodores, in a van with five guys with Afros the size of Kentucky. There was no Instagram, no nothing. They didn\u2019t know where we were until I called them again. I\u2019m sure it was not what they wanted. But I give them all the props in the world, because they faked it very well.\u201d", "title": "Lionel Richie Wants to Teach You How to Be a Real \u2018American Idol\u2019", "authors": ["Alex Pappademas"]}

Apartments only slightly bigger, and in much less desirable parts of town, go for more than $380,000. Living spaces have shrunk so much that a new term has emerged: \u201cnano flat,\u201d for apartments measuring around 200 square feet or less.\n\nMany Hong Kongers have been priced out of the housing market, including young people forced to live with their parents.

(Tickets for one recent show at a Brooklyn bar, the brothers said, sold out well in advance.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, and kind of scary,\u201d Rahiem said, noting the higher stakes. \u201cI think I battle more with stage fright now than I used to, now that it is sort of a living.\u201d\n\nAt any given moment, a subterranean symphony fills the trains, platforms and corridors of the New York City subway system, offering a wide selection of sounds (performed with varying levels of proficiency): the bongo drummers thumping away on the E train, the opera singer whose voice booms under Times Square, or the older man who shuffled onto Amiri\u2019s train on a recent morning crooning, \u201cI was born by the river.\u201d\n\nMany subway performers audition for a program organized by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which assigns them a sanctioned location in the subway system, but the Taylor brothers are among the free agents who have scouted out their own place.

It is a line of work that makes for a head-on collision between two distinctly New York traits in what just might be their most undiluted form: relentless hustle facing notoriously stoic commuters, gifted at tuning out as couples argue or as a \u201cshowtime\u201d dancer\u2019s sneakers whoosh by their head.\n\nBut the brothers have been able to break through. \u201cI think it\u2019s just something about the Beatles,\u201d Amiri said during a subway ride to 14th Street. \u201cYou can\u2019t not smile to a Beatles song.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAmiri and Rahiem, who grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, are identical twins; they looked so much alike when they were younger, Amiri said, that he would sometimes look at old photographs and could not tell who was who.

Their grandmother played Beatles records. When they were in high school, she bought them the Beatles version of the video game Rock Band, where they would play along with a controller modeled after a guitar.

{"date": "2018-03-09 00:00:00", "text": "Well, the first thing is that the high-profile contemporary auctions in London are only the glittery tip of the iceberg that is today\u2019s art market. And that tip isn\u2019t quite as glittery in London as it is in New York, where, last year, $110.5 million was given for a Basquiat and $450.3 million for a Leonardo da Vinci that had been offered in a contemporary sale.\n\nLondon, by contrast, has become the place to auction good quality \u201cmidmarket\u201d contemporary works priced at $20 million to $30 million. There was almost something routine about the moment when the 1986 Warhol work \u201cSix Self Portraits\u201d sold to a telephone bidder for an upper estimate \u00a322.6 million, the top result at Christie\u2019s. The dollar price, $31.3 million, was pretty much the same as it was when the seller bought the work at auction in New York in 2014, according to Artnet.\n\nBut other works demonstrated why, in the longer term, contemporary art has become such a compelling investment for wealthy collectors. At Christie\u2019s, the 1991 Peter Doig snow scene \u201cCharley\u2019s Space,\u201d which had been bought at a charity auction in 2006 for \u00a3820,000, was resold on Tuesday at \u00a310.9 million.\n\nMr. Doig\u2019s painterly landscapes have become one of the staple trophies of contemporary auctions. The following evening, his much larger canvas from the same year, \u201cThe Architect\u2019s Home in the Ravine,\u201d showing a house seen through a screen of frosted branches, proved the top lot at Sotheby\u2019s, selling for \u00a314.4 million. This was the fifth time the painting had appeared at auction; the first time, in 2002, it sold for $475,000 to the British collector Charles Saatchi.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Doig piece was one of no fewer than 21 works guaranteed by third parties in Sotheby\u2019s 58-lot event. The guarantees supported price levels and helped keep the tally of unsold works down to 5 percent. But several observers expressed mystification that an auction with so little energy in the room \u2014 and no noticeable activity from Asian bidders on the telephone \u2014 could raise \u00a3109.3 million.\n\nBrett Gorvy, co-founder and partner at the New York and London dealership L\u00e9vy Gorvy, said he was skeptical that new buyers were bolstering the market. \u201cThese are established people bidding,\u201d said Mr. Gorvy, who gave \u00a37.4 million at Sotheby\u2019s on behalf of a client for a 1974 Richter work, a color-chart piece called \u201c1025 Farben,\u201d one of the few lots to attract sustained competition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conservative market,\u201d said Mr. Gorvy, a former head of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s. \u201cPeople are looking for tried and trusted names with a track record.\u201d\n\nAnd Sotheby\u2019s provided those. Christopher Wool\u2019s swirling monochrome abstracts have become an obligatory addition to any serious collection. At Sotheby\u2019s, a much-admired 2007 example was bought for a client by Andrew Fabricant, director of the Richard Gray Gallery in New York, for \u00a310.4 million.\n\nPhillips, an auction house that was synonymous five years ago with the speculative market in emerging art, has embraced this new mood of conservatism. Its contemporary sales now include earlier 20th-century works, giving its auctions some historical gravitas \u2014 and some heftier price tags, which bolstered the week\u2019s numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe 48-lot Phillips sale of 20th-century and contemporary art on Thursday night included Picasso\u2019s remarkable, if sparse, 1932 oil and charcoal on canvas, \u201cLa Dormeuse,\u201d showing the artist\u2019s lover and muse Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter naked and asleep, floating across the sky like a cloud.\n\nWith the exhibition \u201cPicasso 1932 \u2014 Love, Fame and Tragedy\u201d having just opened at Tate Modern, there could hardly have been a better time to offer a picture of Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, particularly one that had never before been seen on the auction market. It had been in a collection in France for the last 25 years and was offered without a guarantee at what dealers viewed as an attractively low estimate of \u00a312 million.\n\nPlenty were wondering whether this was on the shopping list of Harry Smith, executive chairman and managing director of the London-based art advisers Gurr Johns. The previous week, Mr. Smith spent more than \u00a3110 million on behalf of a client, buying no fewer than 12 Picasso works at the evening Impressionist sales at Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, including the 1937 painting, \u201cFemme au B\u00e9ret et \u00e0 la Robe Quadrill\u00e9e (Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter),\u201d for \u00a349.8 million pounds\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Phillips said in an email that the buyer was a \u201cseasoned private collector\u201d not represented by Gurr Johns. One lot earlier, Henri Matisse\u2019s rare bronze sculpture from about 1908, \u201cNu Allong\u00e9 I (Aurore),\u201d had weighed in with a further \u00a314.9 million from another anonymous telephone buyer.\n\nAuction houses generally like to keep outsiders in the dark about who is selling and buying. But the former tennis star John McEnroe was named as the trophy seller of Mark Bradford\u2019s monumental 12-foot-wide mixed media painting, \u201cHelter Skelter I,\u201d from 2007. Capitalizing on the enhancement to Mr. Bradford\u2019s reputation of his having represented the United States at last year\u2019s Venice Biennale, the piece sold for \u00a38.7 million, an auction high for the artist.\n\nPhillips\u2019s final total of \u00a397.8 million was the highest the company has achieved for any auction.\n\nAll three auction houses traditionally start their contemporary sales with a first lot by a fashionable young name. Tellingly, this month, Christie\u2019s started its sale with Robert Mapplethorpe (1946-1989), Sotheby\u2019s with Christopher Wool (born 1955), and Phillips with Jack Whitten (1939-2018).\n\nThe established, the tried, the trusted and the dead.

Lhota, the chairman of the M.T.A., adding that the agency received 438 submissions from 23 countries. \u201cThey are great ideas, all of which have the potential to make the subway system operate more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\nTo underscore the agency\u2019s resolve, each winning entry came with concrete next steps and a process by which it can be tested and implemented on its way to possibly becoming a reality.\n\nOn their own, none of the eight winning entries in three categories are a magic solution to a system weighed down by mismanagement and neglect, whose crumbling infrastructure has made it unreliable and infuriating for the more than than five million riders who use it every day. But taken together, the ideas represent a concerted effort to address fundamental problems by improving the subway\u2019s communication systems, designing a better train car and figuring out high-tech replacements for an outdated signaling system, the backbone of the system and the root of many delays.\n\nIn the area of subway car innovation, there were three winners. Each proposed \u201cradically new approaches\u201d to addressing problems such as loading large crushes of passengers or mechanical breakdowns, according to an M.T.A. statement, while offering strategies that would result in new cars arriving faster and at a lower cost.\n\nPhoto\n\nAmong the winners sharing the $1 million prize were veteran transit companies like CSiT, which proposed software that could quickly diagnose and report train troubles, and CRRC, a giant train car manufacturer that pledged to invest $50 million to develop a new lightweight car.\n\nOne subway car idea came from an amateur transit enthusiast \u2014 Craig Avedisian, a lawyer from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, who proposed longer trains and a new passenger-loading procedure. Essentially, longer trains would mean not every car would open at every station, so passengers would have to be more attentive.\n\n\u201cIt feels very gratifying to just be a part of the story of the subway,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Avedisian said Friday, at a ceremony announcing the winners at M.T.A. headquarters in Lower Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s got such a long, storied history, even if I am just a footnote in that. And hopefully it ends up more than that; hopefully this will actually get implemented.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBy his own accounting, Mr. Avedisian\u2019s plan could cost more than $17 billion. The M.T.A. said the goal of the contest was not to put exact plans into practice, but to take principles that could guide future developments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the signals category there were four winners dividing a $1 million pot. Two, Ansaldo STS and Thales Group, both separately submitted a proposal for a system that would use onboard sensors and cameras to position trains as a way to reduce delays.\n\nTwo other winners, Metrom Rail and Robert James, a transportation engineer, each pitched a technology called ultra-wideband wireless that can precisely locate trains, allowing more to be sent down the tracks safely. The M.T.A. has been conducting ultra-wideband testing to determine its feasibility.\n\nMetrom\u2019s idea calls for installing thousands of nodes along the tunnel walls that can detect the speed a train is going, and where it is to within a few millimeters. \u201cGiven the size and scope and age of the system, it becomes more difficult to implement innovation and change,\u201d said Rick Carlson Jr., Metrom\u2019s director of business development. The M.T.A. has made overhauling its signals, some of which date back to before World War II, at the forefront of its agenda \u2014 a project that some estimates say could take five decades. \u201cIf anyone says 50 years, we can do it at the very least in 25, and probably within five to 10,\u201d Mr. Carlson said.\n\nBechtel Innovation won the communications category for proposing a robotic system that can install control and communication infrastructure inside subway tunnels by itself. Bechtel plans to use its $500,000 to create a working group within the M.T.A. to find ways to develop the robotic system.\n\nAndy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, said that when he first heard of the competition he was concerned it might be a waste of time. \u201cI worried that we would have to evaluate a whole bunch of things that would never see the light of day,\u201d he said. That changed once he saw the winning ideas, he said. Now Mr. Byford is convening eight separate teams within the agency to tackle each idea. Among Mr. Byford\u2019s first moves was setting aside an area of train track for more ultra-wideband testing.\n\nBut even if the eight ideas are never implemented, they have already made an impact, Mr. Lhota said. \u201cWhat the genius program did is light the competitive juices within everybody at the M.T.A. to raise their game, to do better,\u201d he said, \u201cto come up with ideas they may have kept to themselves.\u201d", "title": "Longer Trains, High-Tech Signals and Robots: Subway \u2018Genius\u2019 Ideas Announced", "authors": ["Sarah Maslin Nir"]}

Selling gas-guzzling cars and trucks might continue to drive short-term profit, as some in the auto industry believe, but abandoning the standards now in place would run counter to the longer arc of consumer demand, state regulations and international market forces. Looser standards now, when consumers and many states are demanding cleaner cars, would spell trouble for the auto industry.\n\nOne of the biggest speed bumps for this deregulatory effort will be California. The state has the unique, and congressionally mandated, right to set emissions standards for itself that are higher than federal limits. Under Section 177 of the Clean Air Act, around a dozen other states have adopted California\u2019s standards, which match the current federal requirements for fuel efficiency. Officials from those states have said they would go to court to challenge any effort by the Trump administration to weaken the current standards.\n\nThose states represent about a third of the American auto market.

Her death last week at 88 after a fall at her home in Washington cost Congress one of its unique personalities \u2014 a rare lawmaker who was respected, admired and held in great affection by members of both parties even as she served in one of the most partisan positions in the House.\n\nKnown universally to her colleagues simply as Louise, Ms. Slaughter was a remarkable figure in many ways. She was a trailblazer for women when entering politics was difficult and male counterparts could treat them with disdain and disrespect. She was a revered champion of women\u2019s rights. She was also recognizable for the lilt of her native Kentucky accent but still managed to get elected to her Rochester-centered district in upstate New York 16 times \u2014 a formidable achievement.", "title": "Louise Slaughter Set House Rules, and Played by Her Own", "authors": []}

Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. When the House defeated a 1989 measure to continue barring the District of Columbia from paying for abortions, she declared, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything worse for women in this country than to watch men in blue suits debating this issue.\u201d\n\nMs. Slaughter, who was known for speaking bluntly in her Kentucky drawl, also helped lead a successful effort in 1994 to enact the Violence Against Women Act, which included federal funds for domestic violence shelters and for training the police, prosecutors and judges to better understand and respond to violent crimes against women. She was also prominent in calling on the Pentagon to crack down on sexual assaults of women in the military.\n\nMs. Slaughter publicly regretted one success. In 1991 she was one of several congresswomen who marched to the Senate side of the Capitol to demand, successfully, that Anita F. Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas be heard during his confirmation proceedings after he was nominated for the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Ms. Slaughter and others believed Ms. Hill was treated harshly when testifying before a Senate committee, and after Judge Thomas\u2019s confirmation by the full Senate, Ms. Slaughter told The Boston Globe, \u201cI felt guilty I\u2019d ever asked them to go into it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ms. Slaughter voted against impeaching President Bill Clinton in the scandal over his sexual activities with a young White House intern, she did not hide her anger toward him \u2014 and not only for what she deemed his reckless behavior in that episode.

I run screaming when I see an Ayn Rand book creeping up the alley looking for victims.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time, or several simultaneously?\n\nBooks are like chocolate. Can\u2019t eat just one. I flip back and forth, or interrupt one for another, but feel codependent to that abandoned book and mount a heroic ride to save it against all odds after I\u2019m done cheating on it with Dave Robicheaux or Mary Oliver. Oh, and since you asked: PAPER PAPER PAPER.\n\nHow do you organize your books?\n\nAlphabetically. Though the collection spreads like a flood and then all bets are off. All the poetry is in one place. The rest are in many shelves all over the house.\n\nWhat kind of a reader were you as a child?\n\nVoracious. Word drunk. I came out of Tijuana \u2014 in that era, it wasn\u2019t easy to find books. My mom was a spectacularly misplaced New York City socialite fallen on magical realism strange times indeed. But once she got me into the United States, she took up arms against her newfound poverty and bestowed on me her greatest gift (aside from that Stingray bike in 1965) \u2014 a library card. It took us two bus rides to get to downtown San Diego from the barrio where we lived. It was a sacred ritual: Woolworth\u2019s for a hot dog and a visit with the pet parakeets and goldfish. Then away to the public library, where I maxed out my kid card every Saturday. I thought I was rich. I was rich. I never stopped haunting libraries all through my boyhood. Imagine my shock when I discovered Ambrose Bierce. But what really hypnotized me was Ray Bradbury. I was the border rat expert in Bradbury. He was the author who taught me to reread stuff as often as I wanted. \u201cDouble your pleasure,\u201d as the commercial said back then, \u201cdouble your fun.\u201d I felt that all would be revealed in his stories.\n\nYou\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?\n\nI would invite Lin-Manuel, because Lin-Manuel Miranda. And Mark Twain, because he needs to hear some rap. Guest of honor: Ursula K. Le Guin, forever. When the boys get too rambunctious, I will just bask in those looks she gave, and I would give anything to hear her say, \u201cOh, come on\u201d one last time.\n\nWhat do you plan to read next?\n\nWhat have you got?", "title": "Luis Alberto Urrea: By the Book", "authors": []}

(Insert American and Italian groans here.) But who knows? Nine M.L.S. clubs have won championships in the past 11 years, and only one has repeated in the past decade.

It will begin life with an established Mexican forward (Carlos Vela), a promising Uruguayan wing (Diego Rossi) and a coach, Bob Bradley, who led his last expansion team, the 1998 Chicago Fire, to the league championship. L.A.F.C. has more celebrity owners than anyone can count and, by the end of April, it will have a new $350 million stadium. L.A.F.C. was slow to build out its roster, and it was still adding players last week. Few would dispute that L.A.F.C. has got the team launch and branding parts of its job right. If it gets the soccer right, too, then the crosstown Galaxy \u2014 currently down on its luck \u2014 better worry.\n\nYear 2 in Atlanta\n\nAtlanta United broke attendance records in its inaugural season and then broke the bank this winter, signing the Argentine teenager Ezequiel Barco for a fee reported to be $15 million. You\u2019ll have to wait four to six weeks to get a look at Barco; he\u2019s out with a leg injury sustained in the final week of preseason. But adding him to an attack powered by Miguel Almiron, Josef Martinez and Hector Villalba suggests 2018 could be another welcome workout for the Mercedes-Benz Stadium scoreboard.

There is always a heavy police presence in part because the arena is in the heart of Midtown Manhattan and is built above Pennsylvania Station, the nation\u2019s busiest rail terminal. Fans attending events go through security screening that can include metal detectors, bag searches and explosive-sniffing dogs.\n\nThe use of facial recognition technology puts the arena in the vanguard of professional sports facilities. At least two other arenas have experimented with the technology, but teams and leagues are generally unwilling to discuss security protocols, so it is difficult to know for sure how widespread it is.\n\n\u201cNothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the fans, players, team and arena staff at our games,\u201d said Mike Bass, a spokesman for the N.B.A. \u201cThe league and our teams are exploring the use of all state-of-the-art technology, including facial recognition, to ensure that we have industry-best security measures to protect all those in our arenas.\u201d\n\nThe N.H.L. declined to comment.\n\nAlthough security is the most obvious use of the technology, some independent experts say it is less effective as a security measure for private businesses because they do not have access to various watch lists held by law enforcement agencies. In fact, some vendors and team officials said the customer engagement and marketing capabilities of facial recognition are even more valuable than added security for sports facilities.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have used facial recognition technology for many years, but some commercial entities have been wary. Walmart is among those that have experimented with it, to help identify shoplifters, drawing strong objections from privacy groups.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe software can be used to determine who is allowed into a building, like vendors or workers at a specified employee entrance. Companies may eventually be able to use the technology to increase customer engagement. In the case of an arena, a sports fan might sign up for a loyalty program with a team and attach his image and a credit card to the account. He could then park without paying an attendant, walk in without having a ticket scanned and pay for merchandise and concessions without ever taking out his wallet.\n\nEven without fans signing up for anything, the cameras can give teams a much better sense of who is attending a game.

Peter Trepp, the chief executive of FaceFirst, said \u201cvery, very few\u201d stadiums and arenas were using facial recognition technology.\n\nIn addition to Madison Square Garden, at least two other arenas are known to be experimenting with the technology. According to a Sacramento Kings spokeswoman, facial recognition is used to allow players and staff to enter the practice facility connected to the Golden 1 Center, but its use has not expanded to event attendees.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks have contracted with Suspect Technologies to experiment with facial recognition outside the team\u2019s locker room and throughout the American Airlines Center.\n\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban, however, said in an email the team needs to \u201cfind the right application that creates so much value people want to use it.\u201d He said that, for now, facial recognition doesn\u2019t improve his arena\u2019s ability to keep out unwanted patrons enough to justify its implementation.\n\n\u201cIn the private sector, facial recognition is really only as good as the database it is compared against,\u201d said Michael Downing, the former deputy chief of the Los Angeles Police Department and chief security adviser for the Oak View Group.\n\nThere is no federal law governing the use of facial recognition technology, though both Illinois and Texas have laws that restrict its use without informed consent.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "Did I love it? No. But I did love that other people love it. Here are my highs and lows.\n\nHIGH: Wall-to-wall entertainment\n\nOver the course of three nights, in addition to Meraux, I saw a juggler, street musicians, burlesque dancers and drummers from Zambia and South Africa on a hospitality exchange program with Animal Kingdom Lodge. (All performers are selected by talent search and well compensated, no tips requested.) But for my money, the highlight was catching a glimpse of Eddy Maserati, a local legend and retired lawyer and insurance broker. Mr. Maserati, originally from Positano, Italy, is known for dancing his heart out on public boardwalks around town; when I saw him, he wore a bedazzled Brazil soccer jersey and gold sneakers.\n\nHIGH: Adults who love Disney\n\nMore than its high-profile restaurants, what makes Disney Springs worth a trip is the chance to feed off the energy of adults who make it a priority to keep their inner kids alive and well. I felt immediate secondary joy talking to Adrienne LeBlanc, a diabetes care specialist who comes down from South Carolina eight to 10 times a year, has a Disney-devoted Instagram, and was decked out in a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt and black-and-white Mickey Mouse combat boots. \u201cUsually we\u2019d be in bed right now! Let\u2019s be real, Disney is for adults, not for kids!\u201d she said, as burlesque dancers sashayed before us at The Edison, a new 1920s-themed nightclub that goes adults-only at 10 p.m. on weekends. If I had time I would have gone \u201cdrinking around the world\u201d at Epcot with her and Sascha Vinson, whom I met coming back from doing just that. Ms. Vinson, a realty office manager, lives an hour away, but had been to Disney Springs three weekends that month. \u201cDisney is literally the happiest place on Earth,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing but good vibes.\u201d Though it does seem that the vibes are better if you go with girlfriends in the know.\n\nLOW: Being an actual adult\n\nAs a child of the Southwest, I\u2019ve been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., twice, but never to Disney World. So, \u201cI\u2019m going to Disney World!\u201d became a kind of mantra of this trip for me. By the time I got to Florida, though, stress and logistical needs had won out. I had three days in Orlando to get ready for two months in South America. That included setting up a new phone, buying new luggage, sending home my old luggage and trying to get a yellow fever shot in the midst of a yellow fever vaccine shortage. I was finding that sometimes this trip gets in the way of itself.\n\nHIGH: My hotel, water park included\n\nI had my heart set on staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge or Polynesian Village inside Disney World, but both were sold out (word to the Disney-wise: plan way, way ahead). So I instead headed to Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites - Waterpark. It was considerably cheaper (though beware the daily resort and parking fees) and I laughed and laughed when I found out that their standard room, even for a solo traveler, is a 2-bedroom suite with a set of bunk beds.

The goal would be to gain a practical understanding of a set, and an opportunity to make connections.\n\nI was taken aback. He had asked for this meeting.

I blurted out, \u201cI don\u2019t believe these programs teach you how to direct,\u201d and he immediately backpedaled. Of course, he said, that\u2019s not what he was saying.

He has seen his place come under threat from Scott McTominay, until recently a relatively unheralded graduate of the club\u2019s academy. He has been lectured on the field and, with just the thinnest of veils, criticized off it.\n\nVarious anonymous sources on both sides have been cited in a bid to work out exactly what the problem is: a power grab on the part of Mourinho, or a shortcoming on Pogba\u2019s? In some interpretations, the player ought to buckle down and do what is asked of him. In others, the manager needs to find a way to entice the best from his star. There is a lingering worry, stoked by those with an interest in it being stoked, that perhaps a common ground will not be found, and that at some point the player and the manager will have to part ways.\n\nIn light of what happened in Pogba\u2019s absence against Liverpool, it is tempting to wonder if the reality is more banal. Mourinho, necessity being the mother of invention, deployed McTominay and Nemanja Matic in central midfield, a towering barrier in front of his defensive line.\n\nPhoto\n\nMarcus Rashford, most often used as a substitute in recent weeks, started from wide on the left; Alexis S\u00e1nchez, still scratching around to find his best form after his move from Arsenal in January, played as a more orthodox No. 10. The result was a team, in shape and in inclination, that reflected the formula that has brought Mourinho such success over the last 15 years.\n\nIn the first half, as Mourinho\u2019s team raced into a two-goal lead, it did so because Liverpool\u2019s defense could not handle the combination of Romelu Lukaku and Rashford. That was the source of both goals: Lukaku overpowering Dejan Lovren in the air, and Rashford overcoming Trent Alexander-Arnold on the wing. It was the archetypal Mourinho attacking display: the ruthless, relentless exploitation of an identified weakness.\n\nAnd then, in the second half, as Liverpool surged back, United stood firm. An Eric Bailly own goal gave the visitors hope, and three penalty claims of varying legitimacy offered a grievance, but United was largely unfazed by a Liverpool attacking trio that ranks among the Premier League\u2019s most fearsome: Mohamed Salah was largely rendered an irrelevance; Roberto Firmino, so key to Liverpool\u2019s attacking intentions, was starved of space and time; Sadio Man\u00e9 was driven into ambushes.\n\n\u201cLiverpool controlled by having the ball, and United controlled by not having it,\u201d ran Mourinho\u2019s analysis of the second half.

As a kid today, a child of the 21st century, I can certainly say that growing up is no longer like that, not even remotely. I was born on August 24, 2001, not even a month before the attacks of 9/11.

Just like with the movements #MeToo and BLM, we are the future of social change.\n\nRyan Brooks from Danvers, Mass., like many other commenters, said social media has ultimately made life more difficult for teenagers today:\n\nI personally believe it is harder to grow up in the 21st century than it was in the past mainly due to social media and the internet. Although I obviously was not alive in previous centuries and therefore cannot compare personal experiences in each time period, I know for a fact that previous generations did not have the iPhones and social media platforms we have today. Many people argue the benefits of social media: being connected to distant friends and family, being caught up in world events, spreading positivity and protest, etc. However, the negative aspects of social media outweigh the positives for most teenagers growing up in the 21st century. Cyberbullying is a huge issue, and I have experienced it personally. In the past, if you were bullied, you would see the bully at school, but then you could retreat to the safety of your own home at the end of the day. Today, you are never safe from bullies thanks to social media. They can harass you through the phone even when you are at home. I\u2019ve had people prank call me, leave harassing text messages, post about me on Instagram and Snapchat, etc. It\u2019s torture. In earlier centuries, the technology for cyberbullying to take place on would not have existed and kids growing up back then would not have to deal with it.\n\nLizzy K. from New York eloquently summed up the concerns of her generation:\n\nWe grew up thinking that there was a finite number of years left on the earth because of exhausted resources and global warming. We grew up accustomed to the feeling of being left out because we are constantly aware of our friends activities. We grew up in a world where the offensive rhetoric of politicians and other supposed role models is almost expected. We grew up being accustomed to the news of shootings of children who seem eerily similar to us. We grew up where facts, something that is indisputably the case, are disputed. We grew up knowing that if not us, many of our friends would be sexually assaulted. And the worst part is, we grew up thinking that the world just was this way. There is complex web of unsolved social issues and utterly pessimistic views of the world that has created a thick cloud over our generation. With every new social movement from climate change, to religious equality, to racial equality, to women\u2019s rights, to sexual assault awareness, to gun reform, comes the recognition of this completely flawed and helpless world. So when people label us the generation of the iphone, the igen, or even the snowflake generation, they seem to be ignoring all of the awful events that occur so regularly in today\u2019s world. Maybe they didn\u2019t grow up with this list of horrible realities on constant replay. Maybe we will be the generation that makes actual change.\n\nNot everyone was convinced that this generation has it harder than others, though.\n\nJennifer Lopez from Patino High School thought that teenagers today were lucky:\n\nAs a young person growing up today, Mr. Brook\u2019s understatement about my generation does not fully apply to me. Yes, my generation will be known as \u201cschool shooting generation\u201d and we be known as a \u201cgeneration where we make dumb challenges.\u201d However, we are also known to be the first generation to express and accept any kind of sexuality and ethnicity. We are also a generation that \u201cdrives innovation\u201d and \u201cempowers others to fully accept who they are no matter what.\u201d These \u201cdefining challenge\u201d have always been around but never faced until now, which make it easier for a to \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d or even to talk to others even, though they may not be the same \u201crace or ethnicity.\u201d Teenagers are able to express who they without getting judge in schools or even online, although they are always going to be people who will criticizes their being. However, people like that will always be around to bring others down and we just have to accept that fact. Not to mention our generation has access to the \u201cinternet\u201d as a source to help us on anything whether it be homework, cooking, or learning how to play a instrument. We don\u2019t have to struggle researching in libraries or we don\u2019t have to worry about meeting with each other for a group project at a certain time at a certain place. We are able to make a group chat on almost any online platform, or we could also Skype each other without moving out of our comfort of our home. Therefore, is not as hard to grow up in the 21st.\n\nAva Daly from Danvers High School also had an optimistic outlook:\n\nWe may have lived through events in our life, but in this generation we have a chance to fix what we think is broken, where other generations have had to just live through it. Now, we can stand up for what we believe in and be the change we wish to see in the world. People growing up now are setting new boundaries and making a change in the world, where in the past we would not have had the voice. We have gone through a lot growing up in the 21st power, but with the right mentality it is what can make us stronger than any other generation if we take it to our advantage.\n\nOthers, like Isabelle Silva from Massachusetts, saw both positive and negative aspects to being a teenager today:\n\nFor me, childhood was filled with happiness and rarely doubt. Yet I didn\u2019t realize that it was my parents sheltering me. I was barely a year old when 9/11 happened. I was eight when the stock market crashed. I was in middle school when Hurricane Sandy tore through New Jersey. The Boston Marathon Bombing? Yeah I was alive for that too. All of these horrific events just scratch the surface on what I have grown up with. My mom would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I had homework, but never that much homework.\u201d My dad would say, \u201cWhen I was in school I was stressed, but never that stressed.\u201d My grandma remembers vividly that when she was younger, after a sport\u2019s season was over, it was over: it didn\u2019t continue for another four months and another $1,000 until it drained out you and your parent\u2019s bank account. Growing up in the 21st century is a new type of difficult, a new type of struggle. However, despite tumultuous times, I have also experienced things older or even future generations may never have the ability to. When I was one the first iPod came out. When I was 8 the first African-American president of the United States was elected. In 2012, Curiosity, a US rover, took a selfie \u2026 on Mars. And through all this time the New England Patriots had won four super bowl titles (and in 2016 they would make it five (obviously)). Both the good and the bad together have allowed me to appreciate how lucky I am to not only live somewhere amazing with an good support system but just to be alive.\n\nKatherine Y, from Rivendell, said every generation has its challenges:\n\nFor a middle-class kid in a developed country like the U.S., the fundamentals, physical needs of life are easily met. I don\u2019t have to worry about famine like my Chinese grandparents did. I don\u2019t even need to cook my own meals, like my mother did. We have vaccines and medicines for sickness. However, one can argue that the generations before lived in a simpler time. My mother often tells me how life now goes much faster than it did when she was growing up. With social media and the internet, information travels fast. We are constantly supplied with news, trends, pop culture. Kids nowadays know more, sooner. How young was I when I was first exposed to the idea of school shootings? With all this fast-moving media, kids must grow up faster, or be left behind. I feel like the mental aspect of growing has become more complicated, while the basic, physical aspect has become easier.\n\nNearly everyone, however, found one place in which to put their faith and hope for a better future: themselves.\n\nLola Calotychos from Providence, R.I., articulated this sentiment beautifully:\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to determine which generation has endured or is enduring the hardest times American society has ever seen, but because I am currently observing the social turmoil and sharing the outrage possessed by so many throughout this country, it is effortless for the abominable events of this century to be amplified in my mind to the point where their severity seems incomparable. I think that the aspect of this generation that has stood out so vibrantly to people, and therefore brought about this surge of attention, is its strength. The surplus of movements and awareness that have been enacted in order to advocate and oppose those in power has depicted a resiliency that defies the notion of America being an exemplary nation where everyone is \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cequal.\u201d In a country that hosts an array of nationalities, races, and ethnicities, a large sector of the population have come together to change the way their country is being run in hopes to cater to the American peoples\u2019 best interests as a whole, despite the inequitable executive orders coming from the monopolized institutions that hold seemingly all the power in our society. This generation is pushing to redefine this country\u2019s values; we are reshaping the way democracy, a system in which society is governed by the people, is constituted and implemented, and despite previous times, it doesn\u2019t look like we will ever take no for an answer.\n\nAnd Carolyn G from Virginia thought technology was helping help her and her peers make a difference:\n\nAs a teenager, I can absolutely say that it\u2019s not easy for my generation. These days, we have seemingly all the information we\u2019d ever need at our fingertips, and in some ways, that\u2019s made life better for us. We\u2019re more aware than past generations \u2014 for example, you hardly ever meet someone who doesn\u2019t have an opinion about Trump these days, teens and kids included. However, as a result of that, we\u2019re also more aware of the injustices of this world, which can be a tricky thing. On the one hand, it can create a fire inside the hearts and minds of young people trying to change the world they live in, like how victims of the Parkland shooting are actively campaigning to pass gun reform laws because the People in Charge simply won\u2019t listen to them. On the other hand, though, it can make us pessimistic. Now that we\u2019re so aware of the problems we\u2019ll have to face as adults, we worry not only about short-term things like applying to college (which is also worlds harder than it used to be); we also worry about the long-term issues we face, like a warming planet, which can be bad for our mental health. The good thing is that enough of us still have hope that we can make things better. We attend marches and protest online, we voice our concerns and make people listen if they don\u2019t hear us, we work hard even when our parents tell us we\u2019re lazy. Life is hard, even in this age of technology and general woke-ness, but we\u2019re trying, and I think that\u2019s really the most important thing.\n\nBut several students also felt burdened by the responsibility to \u201cchange the world.\u201d Jessica Lee from Wilmington, N.C., wrote:\n\nMany people believe that growing up in the 21st century is actually easier than it was in the past due to new technology. But with this, comes an abundance of consequences. Recently, new technology has paired with new data, and not all of it is good. Global warming, air and water pollution, icecap melting, ozone layer holes. They all say it\u2019s up to us to find a solution; it\u2019s up to us to save our world. And while they argue on whether or not we should arm teachers with guns (which, I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s even a question), numerous young minds are looking for something \u2014 anything \u2014 that will help us rescue our world from destruction. So, in this sense I believe Mr. Brooks is right by saying, \u201cthis is a generation with diminished expectations.\u201d I don\u2019t expect our predecessors to fix much. I expect things to get worse before they get better. I believe in our generation, who is actively trying to reverse climate change. Not the government, not anymore. All we have is us. And we can do it. Our generation is not like the past. We have big hearts and open minds. We are gay rights activists, we are environmental activists, we fight against school shootings, and for the lives of African-Americans. Our generation has a voice that is potentially louder than any other. This is why our generation has it harder than those in the past. And although we\u2019re growing up with a world\u2019s worth of information in the palms of our hands (literally), the question is: What are we going to do about it?\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur popular Picture Prompt \"Boys and Men,\" raised the questions, \u201cWhat does it mean to \u2018be a man?\u2019 and \u201cAre America\u2019s boys broken?\u201d\n\nPedro Chavez from Caruthers, Calif., thought a man should work:\n\nTo be a man you have to work hard to help your family out because if you don\u2019t and be lazy people are going to call you little girl and you won\u2019t become a man just by doing nothing you need to go out and do something not just stay home like everyone else.\n\nHeriberto from Caruthers thought a man needs to be responsible:\n\nTo be a man is someone who stands up for themselves and someone who is responsible. If you\u2019re a man you are going to man up and if you\u2019re a man you are going to be responsible and take consequences on your actions. A man is someone who protects his family. Sure girls can take care of their families but men are the ones who work and they are the ones who take responsibility of their family. Girls can also work but it is supposed to be the man who is in charge of all that stuff like the bills. That is my opinion of being a man.\n\nBang Bang from Caruthers thought a man should not act immature:\n\nI think that being man is to mature and not to act immature and when hard things come in your life you have to be a man. Being a man is being aggressive strong and is tough both physical and mentally, for example if you fall you have to be a man and take the pain\n\nBrooke Myers of King of Prussia said it is enough for a boy to try his best:\n\nSociety\u2019s version of men is that they are supposed to be good people who know right from wrong, who are supposed to never make mistakes, who are the \u2018perfect balance,\u2019 who are tough but soft at the same time. I agree with this for the most part but they don\u2019t always have to be perfect, they can make mistakes because that is the definition of humanity and men are humans. They don\u2019t have to get into fights or be all \u2018macho.\u2019 They are allowed to have feelings. A man is a imperfect person who is a good person, over the age of 15. If a boy tries his best, is not too young, and is a generally good person, he is a man.\n\nLola Byers-Ogle from Wilmington, N.C., was happy to see the messages her little brother was learning:\n\nI have a little brother who is almost 7-years-old. They are teaching him that masculinity is using your power in society as a male to stand up for women and others who don\u2019t have that power. It is being sensitive, kind, understanding, being articulate about your feelings, and most of all realizing that these characteristics are not weaknesses. I agree with this. Sadly, a lot of guys are raised with the idea that being a man means showing no weakness. The author of the article says \u201cAmerica\u2019s boys are broken,\u201d and I agree. Guys are taught to hide their feelings which can create aggression because they aren\u2019t getting the help that they need.\n\nMaddie Leber from Wilmington, N.C., replied to Lola, above, and said:\n\nI think it\u2019s great that schools have been introducing new ideas in masculinity into the systems. Boys are always taught that \u201cbeing a man\u201d means being detached from emotions, not showing your scared or upset, and being strong. I\u2019m glad that young boys are being taught a different definition of strong. I hope your brother grows to be sensitive, kind, and understanding, just like he is taught.\n\nEmiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., also thought about her little brothers:\n\nDespite not being a man, the concepts of masculinity and the ways it can become toxic are of great interest to me, and when reading about them, always make me think of my little brothers. Before this article was posted as a writing prompt, I read it and sent it to my mom, who sent it to the head of my brothers\u2019 middle school. I love my brothers and am always trying to protect them, and I know my mom is too. I want them to know that they don\u2019t always have to guard their emotions from the world, because they are human like anyone else. I want them to know that masculinity does not have to be aggression, or insensitivity, or anger. Instead, I want to teach them that it should be defined by courage, not only in the face of adversity, but in protecting those you care about, learning about and exploring the world we live in, and in asking for help when you need it.\n\nJocelyn Savard from Wilmington, N.C., saw the negative effects of social conditioning on boys and men:\n\nMan up. At what point did this common saying become a threat? Probably the first time it was uttered, if we\u2019re being honest. This picture says a thousand words, it tells the story of innocence and violence, calmness and assertiveness, understanding and a lack of understanding. The young boy still has large eyes: a trademark of innocence. His hand, cocked back signifies the expected aggression that has been forced upon him at a young age. After reading the article, my eyes were opened to the horrors that boys all over face each day. Not just boys who turn violent because of expectations but boys who turn their violence against themselves. Men die by suicide 3.53 times more than women. The article clearly articulates how men and boys are not allowed to show their emotions and the negative effects throughout their lifetimes. Recently, I caught my younger brother rapidly uncrossing his legs when we were out. It caused a commotion much larger than the normal uncrossing of the legs. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do that?\u201d I asked. His simple response was \u201cboys don\u2019t cross their legs.\u201d How terrible, to only be 11-years-old and to have been told you can\u2019t sit a certain way because of your gender. He\u2019s also been told that he can\u2019t have his fingernails painted nor wear heels and that he shouldn\u2019t like the color pink. Boys do not have to be assertive or aggressive, they do not have to hide their emotions, they can like the color pink, and they can cry. Let them be human. Do not let them \u201cman up.\u201d\n\nFrancesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., said no one should feel trapped in a particular identity:\n\nI think the gender binary has been way too excessively controlled by society. Toxicity has manifested in the ridicule and harassment people have suffered for nonconformity or for not adhering to specific rules concerning gender. Girls are being called \u201cdykes\u201d if they cut their hair too short; the words \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cgay\u201d are thrown around carelessly if a guy so much as sheds a single tear. How people should act based on their gender has become almost a topic of obsession, and it\u2019s weird how entitled people think they are to be the police officers of expression. I think it\u2019s wrong to control how boys should act and set a standard of masculinity based on almost emotional ignorance that is basically impossible to meet all the time. \u2026 Men deserve to have full access to the \u201clanguage that exists to discuss the full range of human emotion,\u201d as Black puts it, because no one should feel trapped within their own identity.\n\nVillagehome from Beaverton, Ore., wanted all genders remembered in the words we use:\n\nI would like to remind people that there isn\u2019t just men and women, some people don\u2019t want either of those genders, and their gender isn\u2019t determined by sexual organs. I just want everyone to be careful with what words you use.\n\nDenislav Kasaivanov from Wilmington, N.C., discussed his strong family culture and its influence:\n\nHaving grown up in a culture which expects strong masculinity from all men around, I would have to say that being \u201ca man\u201d is like being able to do a little bit of everything. To give you an example, in the Eastern European culture from which I have been raised in, a man is expected to carry his family financially, he is expected to produce strong, successful offspring, he is expected to be at the peak of his physical fitness, he is expected to be able to protect his family, cook, and additionally, a man is expected to follow older, gentleman-like civil standards; of which you may find in similarity with chivalry. Moreover, often when I feel a bit down, my grandmother (or \u201cbabushka,\u201d as I call it) will tell me to \u2018man up some more\u2019. If you haven\u2019t noticed, my birth society\u2019s common theme in masculinity is strength, be it ranging from mental to physical.\n\nEmily Lane Player from Hoggard High School said the issue needs addressing just as much as harmful treatment of young girls:\n\nAmerican ideas of masculinity are toxic, especially to young boy\u2019s ears. Common sayings like, \u201cbe a man\u201d \u201cgrow a pair\u201d \u201cman up\u201d \u201cboys will be boys\u201d and \u201cboys don\u2019t cry,\u201d can make young men feel like they can\u2019t be emotionally vulnerable. They fear if they are, they will no longer be seen as \u201cmanly,\u201d and be bullied for seeming more feminine. Often young boys who don\u2019t conform to gender roles by expressing themselves are put down and called \u201cgay.\u201d This is a pressing issue in America right now, and needs to be addressed just as much as the harmful treatment of young girls.\n\nNoah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., thought a man must be a decent person:\n\nI think that \u201cbeing a man\u201d is not about being aggressive and strong and it isn\u2019t about fitting into gender roles, but rather about being a decent person. A real man treats women with respect, he works a job to provide for his family, and he supports his children in their endeavors. A real man is the type of person that will protect those more vulnerable than he is in times of harm, and not be self centered or self indulgent.\n\nSydney, 13, from Oregon, said the key is to be a good human being:\n\nSociety has high standards for men. Men have to be muscular, tough, unfeeling, are always right, can have whatever they want in life. An interesting thing about this is that although society generally says that men don\u2019t (or shouldn\u2019t) have feelings, it tends to give them one. Anger. Violent anger. No sadness, though, nothing that will make them look \u201cweak,\u201d or worse, \u201cgirly.\u201d Girly is a stupid term. Men cannot be \u201cgirly\u201d; it\u2019s impossible! Absolutely ridiculous. My idea of a man is literally nothing. I have no ideas of men that are different from my ideas of women, other than the obvious bodily differences. Men and women both are human. Humans have emotions and feelings, and it\u2019s okay to show them. Men, you don\u2019t have to be \u201ctough\u201d or \u201cmanly.\u201d There is no \u201cmasculinity\u201d to preserve. You are a human. So act like one.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion question \u201cIs \u2018Black Panther\u2019 a \u2018Defining Moment\u2019 for the United States \u2014 and Particularly for Black America?\u201d inspired lively conversations across schools in the comments section.\n\nRachel Long from Wekiva High School thought it was a historical moment:\n\nThe movie \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was an incredible movie that I would recommend to anyone, no matter race or ethnicity, but especially to young black children in America because it is such a defining moment in America at this time. A movie that depicts black men as kings and princes and warriors with real emotions opposed to thugs or slaves or the butt of a joke, and a movie that depicts black women as the strongest among them and as smart and as true warriors is something that is so important for young black kids especially growing up in America today. I think that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is going to be the movie that opens the path to other majority black movies that depict black people I the same light and uplift and support opposed to tearing down.\n\nAs did Dante P. from Fresno, who compared it to the Harlem Renaissance:\n\n\u201cBlack Panther\u201d is such a powerful movie due to the fact that it breaks out of the stereotypes that black culture has mostly been confined to in Hollywood and media as a whole. The main concept is what would happen if an African country was never colonized and does an excellent job showcasing the history of intelligence and innovation in Africa that is not usually taught about in schools. The movie centers itself in a culture of African pride and excellence that is similar to the goals of the Harlem Renaissance. There is a certain feeling of pride, hope, and inspiration that people of African descent experience when they are able to go to a movie and see wildly successful black people achieve success without selling drugs, killing innocent people, etc. For many, this is the first film that makes them proud of their heritage, and then they check the credits and the film is almost entirely Black produced and so it verifies the feasibility of such a concept. The film also breaks gender stereotypes and the result is an Afro-futurism theme with many of the main characters being these powerful, strong women and intelligent women that promote women in STEM.\n\nNoah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central Wilmington, N.C., though, wondered whether its significance was overblown:\n\nI think that it is a bit far-fetched to say that a superhero movie is a defining moment in American history. When it comes to African-American history, defining moments were the civil war, the election of President Obama, and Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d Speech. I could imagine a film course talking about this movie 50 years from now, but I can\u2019t see an American history class talking about this movie 50 years from now.\n\nCheyenne Newkirk from Wilmington, N.C., replied, calling it a \u201clong overdue gift\u201d:\n\nI have personally yet to see the movie, but it definitely has made an impact in the black community. The moment the trailer came out, black people celebrated. It was almost as if we had received a long overdue gift that celebrates black people. While I think the movie has inspired many to take action such as the petition to release the black panthers from jail I also think that we as black people cannot stop at just this. We need to go out and make change happen in the real world. We need to fight for the equality and respect that we have struggled for. This movie is a movie that celebrates black people. But WE need to celebrate ourselves too. Every person had the capabilities to do anything, and we should come together to make the change happen.\n\nAnd Lauren Thornton from Providence, R.I., added interesting ideas to the thread:\n\nI definitely do believe that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is a defining moment for black America. Being a black American in the US you grow up not really knowing where you come from. All you know is that your ancestors were considered 60 percent of a person and always had to change themselves to be accepted. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is celebrating what black people have been shamed for for many years, and now in a time where the BLM movement and Black Excellence is so widespread, it gives black people a sense of pride and a sense of belonging, like we are more connected to our roots. Having an all-black cast where everyone is powerful, makes brown boys and girls feel like they can be powerful too. Even though other people might just see this as \u201canother superhero movie,\u201d I think it has sparked and will spark more conversation among black people, and forever be something we were glad we got to live through and see.\n\nMark Mormando from Wilmington loved the movie, but wasn\u2019t sure it had the power to change society:\n\nThis movie is easily one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces Marvel has created. From the creative ancient history of Wakanda, to how the civilization has grown over time with technologies the which we can only hope to achieve, this movie tells a great story through a great perspective. \u2026 Although this movie has a cast composed of many famous black actors, I don\u2019t think this movie is going to change anything. Sure, it boasts a cast comprised of a majority of America, but besides those actors who portrayed a comic-book story, I don\u2019t understand how this leads to something different happening in our country. I think it\u2019s a great thing that Marvel made this movie, but that\u2019s all it is, a movie. There are many other cinematic stories of struggles the black community has faced in America, and you don\u2019t hear about those movies being hailed as cinematic masterpieces, not so much so as \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d from what I\u2019ve seen. Why is that?\n\nRishi G. from Austin responded with detailed arguments:\n\nNot only is \u201cBlack Panther\u201d a watershed moment for black people, it even centers its focus into separate groups. It manages to portray black people as powerful without having to force their hand at the stereotypical guns or drugs, and although at the beginning it shows this, it is just acknowledging that there are still people who do, in fact, fit that stereotype, but that is just a very small minority. In Wakanda, it shows black people as they can be when allowed to grow to their full potential: powerful, prosperous, yet humble and generous. But it doesn\u2019t only focus on black people in general. In Shuri, T\u2019Challa\u2019s sister, we find a headstrong, intelligent, and funny woman who embodies the idea of women in STEAM. I think that the hype for this movie is well-deserved. Not only is the scenery and cast incredible, as well as the storyline causing you to not only get the hero\u2019s point of view, it allows you to see it from the other side. I think that the thing that really did it in for me when watching the movie, though, was the incredible soundtrack by Kendrick Lamar. The music represented a culture clash, but harmonized into some amazing raps and songs. They incorporate the ancient tradition of Wakanda, but technology is implemented well in the beat and lyrics. I think the reason that this movie specifically is portrayed as a defining moment as compared to other black struggle movies is because it doesn\u2019t show blacks as the sole victim. It portrays everyone as equal.\n\nJose Clase from Providence, R.I., expanded on those ideas:\n\nI believe \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to be a defining moment in America, especially in 2018. For the first time in America\u2019s history, a film that touches on issues like more black girls getting into STEM, black people being in positions of power, but most importantly, instead of showing the pain and hardships that black people have endured, it demonstrates the success that can be achieved if they are united. Personally, I\u2019m into comics and I\u2019ve always known about Black Panther but to see his character in a solo film where kids can someone like them be amazing, smart, and strong; it makes an impact in those young kids lives. That touches on why I believe the film is so popular today. There\u2019s so much social activism going on and with a generation of kids who are standing up for themselves , the film is a turning point into a more well-rounded America. I believe it to be a political stance but more importantly a message to the younger generation of black girls and boys; that they can grow up to be the a president or scientist or inventor, and so on.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion prompt, \u201cHave You Ever Changed Your Mind About a Hot-Button Issue?\u201d brought in many impassioned comments with thoughtful views.\n\nAngela from Rhode Island thought it is helpful to put yourself in another person\u2019s shoes:\n\nI have changed my mind on a controversial issue. I feel as though, what made me change my mind about it was actually being in the situation, where the topic had an effect on me. Many people choose a stance from the outside bubble and don\u2019t consider putting themselves in the shoes to know how they might be impacted.\n\nAryana from Rhode Island said people are more likely to change after experiencing things firsthand:\n\nIf someone challenges your position then you should look at both sides of the argument along with the actual facts, and if you\u2019re wrong then you should be flexible and change. It is better to right then to be wrong and stubborn.\n\nHee Yun Chung from California switched sides on gun control:\n\nI\u2019ve changed my mind over the controversial issue of guns over the past year. Before I really dove into politics, I believed that the Second Amendment was an outdated law must be repealed immediately in order to stop gun deaths. I firmly believed in this position before I saw arguments from the other side. After doing some research, I changed my mind and thought that guns should be left alone and that no action was required to solve the gun problem in the United States. The reason why I thought this was because statistically, gun violence incidents like mass shootings were as rare as terrorist attacks. It is very unlikely that an American can become a victim of a mass shooting. Secondly, repealing the Second Amendment would be like starting another drug war or Prohibition. Whenever America has banned something, it never seems to work. When drugs were banned and criminalized, black markets and drug cartels easily filled the gap and provided the drugs to people. Back in the 1920s when alcohol was illegal, Americans easily went underground and drank alcohol without the knowledge of the government. I thought this way until the continuous mass shootings that took place in Las Vegas and Parkland. That was when I changed my mind to support tough universal background checks and some form of gun control that makes it harder for people to get guns that have the capability to cause another massacre like the one in Parkland.\n\nRobert Yates from Wilmington, N.C., had become more open-minded:\n\nFor all of my life, I\u2019ve grown up around people that are emphatically conservative. As most kids do up until they reach high school, I used to mirror the political opinions of my family members. It was only when I started to be more open-minded to other ideas that I moved toward a more centrist/left-leaning political perspective. An example of a drastic change in my personal beliefs was when I came to acknowledge the merit of the LGBT movement. There\u2019s a member of my immediate family who\u2019s homosexual and was hesitant to come out to me and my other siblings due to the nature of our family\u2019s conservative beliefs. I felt bad about when I found out because it must be mentally taxing to hold back such a big secret so essential to someone\u2019s personal identity for so long. I believe that in order to be taken seriously in any kind of debate, one must be open-minded and willing to change their opinion when faced with fresh or important evidence.\n\nAnd Emily Ball from Wilmington, N.C., had changed her mind on the issue of abortion:\n\n\n\nMy parents also have a huge influence on my opinions and views, and one of the topics that my mind has been changed about because of my mom is the controversial issue of abortion. I remember taking a walk one day, trying to convince my mom that abortion is an act of evil and immorality, and how I was completely pro-life. I said to her, \u201chow could anyone be pro-abortion? Pro killing babies!\u201d she looked at me and said, \u201cNo one is pro-abortion, they are pro-choice, meaning that they support women having an option on whether or not they have an abortion.\u201d Although I still didn\u2019t agree with her, I was starting to see where she was coming from. Now, two years later, I am completely pro-choice. I feel that if a woman or girl feels that she is incapable of being an adequate parent, that she should have the right to an abortion. I respect others with the opposite view of that if the woman has the baby, that she will be helped by the government and churches to provide for the baby, and they actually carry out with that. The opinion that I do not respect is when the woman or girl is judged no matter what.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nWe loved reading the creative short stories and poems that students came up with for \u201cAstronaut and Spider.\u201d Here are some of our favorites:\n\nTucker G. Oakley from Wilmington, N.C., posted two comments in order to spin this fascinating tale:\n\nI pulled them both closer to my face, it read: Liliana Smitherman, spouse to Havel Smithman, deceased: May 3, 2204. The rest was a brief synopsis of how she died\u2026 None of that mattered. Why! Tears began to rush down my faces, causing my suit to warm up to regulate temperature. I left for my expedition 2203! How long has it been, why did it take so long? There were no answers here, there never was for humans. The pain shot from my heart to my back, then to everywhere else that had never sensed pain before. There is no possible way for me to describe my sobbing, but Tholum could. I could hear the clicking of long longs creeping down the hall, muffled by buckets of tears and snot. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see a nine-foot Arachonion gazing at me with his 22 pupilless eyes, and he began to open up his serrated mouth before my translator module kicked in. \u201cWhy is it that you cry, Havel. The last time you shed a tear is when we witnessed Jol-5 explode in the wake of the Fregerhiem Regime. \u201cYet it was not this bountiful.\u201d He said in a puzzled posh accent. \u201cWhy, you ask. Maybe because my wife, my beloved lily has willowed into the neverending firestorm of death. I\u2019ve been doing this for at least 18 years now \u2026Why is it that I just find out now she died one year after I was gone! When I could no longer hold her in my arms! That is why!\u201d Most of this was covered in layers of coughing and snot, but he clearly got the picture.\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cHavel, I can\u2019t sympathize with you, or tell you that it will be better tomorrow. But what I can say is that you are still alive, and yes of course it hurts, but wouldn\u2019t she want you to stay safe now?\u201d Tholum had both a way with words and slight telepathy to which he used to soothe my mind into a state of understanding. \u201cIf she was in your shoes right now and you were gone, wouldn\u2019t you want her to stay alive for you? Wouldn\u2019t her life be the center of the universe at that point? So just think about that.\u201d Everything stopped for a moment. What could he mean by that, to stay alive for her \u2026 Maybe, maybe this was true. She would have tried to stop me from touching that space station, but instead, she sent me off with a hug and a kiss. Gods, this will lumber over my shoulders for a while, but I just need to take what Tholum said into consideration. How many light years has it taken for her message to reach me, and to still hold he smile in my damp glove? For love is love, and for the sake of my Lily, I swear I will make this life of travel worth your love. \u201cYeah. You know what Tholum, drinks are on me, Thank you.\u201d I never thought my best friend would be a giant spider monster, but he made this shuttle more of a home than my own planet. Pvt. Havel Smithman, signing out.\n\nBronwyn Williams from Wilmington, N.C., created a stream-of-consciousness for the astronaut:\n\nIt\u2019s empty. It\u2019s all empty out here, there\u2019s no sound but my thoughts and I can\u2019t escape my thoughts unless \u2026 No, there\u2019s no way, I can\u2019t. And leave her alone? And leave behind thousands others waiting for my return for another step for mankind? I\u2019ll stay here, I have to hold on but \u2026 it\u2019s getting harder. I\u2019ve begun to see things, things I don\u2019t want to. Things uglier than, things worse than \u2026 these things are just the manifestation of my thoughts, my paranoia \u2026 I think, God I hope. And no matter how fast I run I can\u2019t outrun my mind unless I render it unable to move \u2026 myself unable to move but I CAN\u2019T, I\u2019m telling you I can\u2019t and-God what is that sound? I can\u2019t stop my head from whipping around in every direction and I hear it again. Scraping \u2026 oh God awful scraping I can\u2019t breathe, it\u2019ll find me \u2026 I\u2019ll find me and lose myself again. The shadows in every corner they\u2019re moving, I swear they\u2019re moving I need help, I NEED HELP. I hear it, I heard it, \u201cnobody\u2019s around to help.\u201d A saccharine whisper, the bitter cold reminder, but I already knew. I already know I\u2019m alone, it\u2019s only me on this mission after all...just my thoughts after all. \u201cAnd what if you\u2019re not alone \u2026 what if we\u2019re all waiting to end you? What if everything you know is false? What if you die out here all alo\u2014\u201d STOP it God please stop it I can\u2019t stop thinking and I didn\u2019t notice when but my face became wet and the monster drew closer, cold metal appendage in my hands, now through my chest. I\u2019m sorry.\n\nBrooke Myers from King of Prussia imagined the astronaut\u2019s backstory:\n\nJustin launched off into space for his first big space adventure. While getting onto the ship, the reporters were launching questions, cameras flashing, people questioning whether he was afraid. \u201cWhy would he be afraid?\u201d he asked himself. He wasn\u2019t afraid of space, he wasn\u2019t afraid of heights, he trained for this. He was doing this for his family, his wife, his daughter. He wanted to be a hero. He launched off and when he looked around, he saw the huge luminous moon looming over him. He found it quite peaceful in space, for days he happily watched the earth and stars until one day he saw a space station that seemed to be a bar. He landed unsurprisingly confused. When he space walked into the building, there were ladies all around, luring ladies, that sweet talked and made him cheat on his beloved wife, his only fear. He feared to be like his father who teared his parents\u2019 marriage apart by cheating and there he was thousands of miles away, long distance if you say, doing the same thing making his fear as real as his wife\u2019s fear of spiders.\n\nHailey R. from Caruthers wrote about heartbreak:\n\nHe misses the girl who has his heart. He is in a place of the unknown and he longs for her warmth. The blackness around him shows so sympathy or empathy and the evil thats overcoming him is overwhelming. He want to be with her. He needs to be with her \u2026 She is all he ever thinks about and she is his everything. He is in a place that bounds no direction except into more deeper darkness and to \u2026 home, but there is a force of evil and something else keeping him form finding his way home to her, to his love. He will do anything ti find her again and to be with her. He is searching for his home again but for now all he can feel is coldness and surrounding darkness.\n\nBella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., closely read the image as inspiration for a poem:\n\nSpinning through the black abyss Bursts of light dot the universe outside my window My heart longs for your light I steer ahead into the route of the unknown The thoughts of you cloud my head Like the clouds I see below me My heart wants to be home A web of dread tangles my thoughts Wraps up my happiness Consumes it in one bite My heart wants to be free I am left with my own bitter sorrow For someone planets away For someone all alone My heart wants to be with you After reading the article, I found that Jakub, the astronaut, was having marriage issues with his wife, Lenka, down on Earth. He is trapped for thirteen weeks on the ship, concerned about their relationship. I thought it was strange, but the spider is an alien creature brought to remind him of Lenka and his troubles, leaving him more than miserable. I feel like that doesn\u2019t incorporate well into the serious matter of the issues between him and his wife. I thought the spider was more of a symbol of his lost ability to concentrate on anything but his wife, and the web it was spinning to block all other thoughts.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nAre there any \u201cdumb\u201d devices \u2014 or devices not connected to the internet \u2014 that you think are better than some \u201csmart\u201d devices? We asked students that in our Picture Prompt \"Alarm Clocks,\" and got some great answers:\n\nLeah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., thought older things were built to last:\n\nCan I just say, that as a 16-year-old I still cannot wrap by head around the idea of Amazons \u201csmart device,\u201d Alexa. It\u2019s just creepy. As for \u201cdumb devices,\u201d I am really into cooking and one of the best kitchen gadgets I\u2019ve used is the simple mortar and pestle. Some of the best guacamole, pesto, and humus I\u2019ve ever had came from the ancient device. Not from last years newest food processor. I think one of the reasons I prefer old fashioned devices, not just kitchen devices, over new ones is because they were built to last.\n\nElliott O\u2019Deen from North Carolina agreed:\n\nI completely agree with this standpoint. Old devices were made to last unlike new ones that last a year or two. The Amazon Echo was not meant to last 30 years. It was made to last until the next new one comes out. In our kitchen we have timers that are 25-years-old. Yes they need battery replacements but they still work. I own an apple watch and it\u2019s not really that great. It\u2019s nice for replying to texts and doing simple math but personally, I like a regular old watch. I think it looks nicer and the batteries last for a really long time.\n\nEmily Sause from Wilmington, N.C., cherished a particular old-fashioned device:\n\nSitting on the third shelf of my bookcase is a small wooden jewelry box from a small consignment shop years ago. Inside the box is a bellerina standing in an arabesque. When I wind up the small piece in the back of the box and let go, magic happens. The ballerina turns slowly and a soft lullaby plays. The box seems very simple, but the music is actually coming from precise markings on a metal cylinder. The music box is my favorite device and I will always cherish mine \u2026 I could listen to the same pitchy song on repeat for hours and hours.\n\nBabs from Richmond, Va., cited an 80-year-old family device:\n\nI LOVE my dumb fan. My phone app provides a noise, but it does not create a simple, cooling breeze. We own a fan that came free with a fridge in 1939; it still works perfectly. I challenge anyone to find some new \u201csmart technology\u201d that will still work perfectly and provide the exact same utility 80 years from now!\n\nLisbeth Garcia from Rhode Island found advantages and disadvantages to smart devices:\n\nI think it\u2019s not that easy to say there are \u201cdumb\u201d devices that are better than some \u201csmart\u201d devices because there are advantages and disadvantages to both devices. I myself, for example, like to use my phone and its reminder app, rather than a planner or agenda. My phone is a more convenient piece of technology because it is always on me and it gives me the option to set an alarm for that an option, rather than writing my reminders into a planner or agenda, where I\u2019d have to take it out, open it, and look for what I needed to be reminded on.\n\nMaddie Leber from Wilmington N.C., said some new tech isn\u2019t worth the hassle:\n\nThere are so many things out there that seem so much fancier, but are just a hassle when it comes down to it. One of the things that affects my life the most is my fitbit. I like to keep track of my steps, and it\u2019s easy to use as a stopwatch and just for checking the time, but with most electronic devices, it has its flaws. Just like the article stated about the apple watch, you have to tilt the fitbit at a certain angle for the time to pop up on the screen, and sometimes I have to violently shake my wrist back and forth until I give up and press the button on the side of the fitbit. This can be extremely annoying when I\u2019m doing something time sensitive or have my hands full. Just last week I was taking a math test and trying to see how much time I had left, when the time would not come up. I wasted about 40 seconds just trying to check how much time I had leftTechnology is amazing, and is designed to make our lives better, but sometimes those little inconveniences, such as the time not popping up when I move my wrist, can add up. Those devices that were designed to help you, just end up hurting you in the long run.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents\u2019 interpretations of our \u201cGraduate\u201d Picture Prompt were almost universally negative about the role of data in education.\n\nEllie Hannum from Wilmington, N.C., suggested it showed how schools reduce students to numbers:\n\nAccording to the image, we are NOT unique because of what we look like, our personality, or our ability to problem solve and think critically. The education system ingrains one simple fact into our developing brains throughout our entire education career: grades, test scores, GPA, and class rank are the ONLY things that will make you unique, define you as a person, and ultimately determine your future. The image defines the high expectations that universities hold to their students in a colorful, cheerful, and simple pie chart. However, these expectations are far from simple. That simple little pie chart completely covers the student\u2019s face, which could symbolize how filling these expectations takes up all of a student\u2019s time and effort.\n\nAmy Jean from Providence, R.I., agreed, and shared her own experience:\n\nFrom my perspective, this image is commentary on how the grades students get in class and on assessments define them in the eyes of the school system. This is symbolized by the numbers and graphs surround the graduate student and the pie chart obscuring the student\u2019s face. I often feel as though I am not really learning anything in most classes, that all that matters is whether I past the tests or not. \u2026 I feel like the person in this image, obscured by numbers.\n\nNick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., made a connection to a class discussion:\n\nWhen I first saw this image it reminded me of a discussion my class had. The graphs and binary code made me think that the article would have been about students prioritizing the STEM fields while the arts take a back seat. I interpreted that the grey background as another hint that students were coming out of college with knowledge in the STEM fields but were unable express themselves and were just blank.\n\nKasey Kiser, who is from not just Wilmington, N.C., but \u201cUnited States, Earth, Milky Way, Observable Universe,\u201d analyzed the illustration\u2019s color and symbols:\n\nIn my initial analyzation of this image, I looked merely at the lack of color. I believe this is representative of monotony and repetition in the subject of this picture. As I honed in on specific details, I saw an abundance of analytical symbols, anything from graphs to raw binary code. So much so, that the graduate is engulfed by the sheer amount of information. I perceive this as the battle for academic success, a harmful motivation for today\u2019s students driven by universities. I, myself, have previously fallen victim to this war, continuously checking my grade and class rank, or staying awake for unhealthy amounts of time to perfect an assignment that neither interests me nor helps my future. However, this struggle to attend the dream college could be all for nothing, especially with more occupations being self-taught or even self-created.\n\nCatherine Brunzos from Providence, R.I., like many, connected it to the college admissions process:\n\nAs soon as I saw this picture, I noticed that the figure\u2019s face is covered by a pie graph. The numbers, residue of statistics, and lack of overall color. In recent years, the college admission process has become much more stressful, and competitive. The media has influenced our society to place so much importance on tier one universities, so, teenagers have a lot of added pressure to get into these schools, and graduate in the top percentage of their class. This picture really represents how getting a college education has changed so drastically, that the importance is not even placed on the actual education anymore. I go to a very competitive, college prepatory high school, and they place getting into the university of your choice at the highest tier- sometimes over emotional well-being.\n\nClay Krupp from N.C. read it this way:\n\nWhen looking at this photo my mind immediately thought that today\u2019s college graduates are only being taught definitions and facts. They aren\u2019t given any experience in today\u2019s workplace. Students are taught what they need to know but not how they need to do it. In the article Margret spellings says that \u201cEmployers report repeatedly that many new graduates they hire are not prepared to work, lacking the critical thinking, writing and problem-solving skills needed in today\u2019s workplaces.\u201d This statement sums up college. People shouldn\u2019t be categorized by their test scores but rather there ability to be effective in the workplace.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion question \u201cWhat Would Your Ideal City Look Like?\u201d yielded many creative ideas and well-envisioned plans. Students went well beyond the obvious, with detailed thoughts about the happiness and well-being of the citizens of their future cities.\n\nAlex Vang from \u201cWakanda, Africa,\u201d said residents would live dream lives:\n\nThe ideal city that I would love to see is a city where transportation is free and eco friendly like electric scooters and fresh beach breeze. Having light everywhere even in the night lighting up the streets creating an environment where people can feel safe. There will be no homeless because everyone will be provided a home and a job. No scary dark alley ways that you don\u2019t want to go through. Food will be grown in the city, the best of the best, and people will never starve. Everyone will live their dream life.\n\nNoemi from Fresno, Calif., said equal treatment for all would be one ingredient:\n\nMy ideal city would look like greatness. I would like for everyone to be treated equally with no need to shame other of their race or color. We would all have open minds because when we have open minds everyone can see beyond just the normal. As for the city I would like a city with skyscrapers for work and also for apartments. Houses would also be there as an option in case you don\u2019t like apt. and prefer houses. As for the transportation there can be cars, taxis, or bikes. I feel like my ideal city is more based off the people that are going to be living there that make it great.\n\nKaleigh Xiong from Fresno, Calif., said people would be free:\n\nMy ideal city would be something like Los Angeles minus the bad traffic. The arts, urban streets, different cultures spread wide. In my city no one is homeless. You may not have money but you would have a place called home. It will be a city where people dance down the sidewalk, singers singing in the streets. A place where people can be free.\n\nKenny Chang Williams from New England, said he would live \u201clike a king\u201d:\n\nMy ideal city would be one where I could live like a king. My ideal city would be one where the citizens surrounding me are rich with personality and experience, people who aspire to find the depth behind all things, subjects who have a clear sense of their self purpose and wants. My ideal city has waters flowing from the sparkling waterfalls, where us humans are seen gliding across the rich landscape, filled with soft soil to take drink from the clear waters like zebras do. Flowing with life the water gives to not only my zebras, but my city, as the rivers run crashing into grand water mills that give breath to the very being of movement \u2014 for my city is a wandering nomad built upon a gigantic robot with defence systems challenging that of the United States Air Force. The transportation system in my city will be completely streamlined and automated by smart roads and street lights, enabled by driverless vehicles conceptualized by google and tesla. The robot city, dubbed \u201ciCity\u201d will be the cleanest city in the world regarding all aspects of cleanliness that a city should as iCity would be completely powered on green energy. If all cities predating iCity were to be flip phones, then the iCity is a Samsung Galaxy S9.\n\nPhilip W. from North America said to build up, instead of outward:\n\nI believe that as time passes by, cities will need to constantly renovate their infrastructure, and technology in order to keep up with current technology. However, there are many challenges that are to be faced before we can do this. As time passes, cities will grow larger, and it will require more resources and money to \u201cupgrade\u201d the city. In addition, big metropolises such as New York City, or Beijing, upgrading the whole city will be a challenge because of the vast number of people who live there, and not all of them are willing to make a change for the better. I support the idea of improving the infrastructure and renovating \u201cold\u201d cities, but I believe that our society must become more accepting or organized in order for us to truly achieve this goal.In my opinion, my \u201cideal city\u201d would build up instead of out to increase living space, and pollution would be kept to a minimum to increase air quality. The roads would also have to be wider to decrease traffic congestion, and there would also be a lot of trees, and grass, etc. On the technology aspect of the city though, my ideal city would have simple, yet efficient technology so people aren\u2019t confused.\n\nTimosha Fesenko from Rhode Island wrote a comment that prompted an interesting exchange:\n\nMy ideal city would be one where the euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%. This city must be incredibly environmentally friendly and squeaky clean. Communities should play a big role in the social life of the city as the people living in it should choose what happens within it. I believe public events allow everybody to mingle and enjoy themselves and boost inspiration. If there were a fair every month where such events could take place then it\u2019d be an ideal place for artists, craftsmen, musicians, singers, etc. to become known among the community and even have some lucrative opportunities come their way. Public transportation is a must for cities, especially if said transportation is reliable and eco-friendly. In this ideal city, the energy needed to run it would come from a completely reliable an inextinguishable source, the sun. With solar panels on every rooftop, the energy needed would be reliable and plentiful.\n\nJillian Lancaster from Wilmington, N.C., replied:\n\nI like your idea regarding the eco-friendly energy sources for your ideal city. The public events you plan to have also sound very nice. Your city certainly sounds cultured and it sounds like a place where people can enjoy themselves.However, what do you mean by \u201cthe euphoria in citizens never falls below 50%\u201d? I took this as each citizen\u2019s happiness level never falls below 50%, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it allows for a very wide range of human emotions. It is necessary sometimes for humans to be sad, embarrassed, or even angry (within reason). Personally, I wouldn\u2019t like a city to limit my emotional range.\n\nAnother back-and-forth -took place involving Grant Holland, from Wilmington, N.C.:\n\nI believe that cities can be old, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they are bad. Just because a flip phone is out of date does not mean that it cannot call like the smart phone. Old cities have separate and different histories from others and it would be a shame to whip that all away to make something shiny and new. Even though I disagree with completely changing a city, it doesn\u2019t mean I disagree with improving a city. For example, the city that I live in which is Wilmington, North Carolina, has new and developing side of town while we keep the historic side of downtown Wilmington. It is more of an addition than redesigning. If I would have a city, I would first focus on trying to balance the rich and the poor. Even though San Francisco is known to be very wealthy it also has a humongous poor class of the homeless. Having a big gap between classes would be an issue so I would try my best to balance the classes. I would also develop homes into well-spaced lots unlike crammed skyscrapers where multiple people live are living in one building. I would also use the tax money for public services for people to enjoy. My city would be manly focused on family living and happy health.\n\n\u2026 and Noah Q. Berg from Southwest-Central in Wilmington, N.C., who replied:\n\nHow would you \u201cbalance the classes\u201d? If you tax the wealthy to much then they would likely find another city to live in that benefits them more, and they would take the jobs and economic output they create with them.\n\nGrant Holland clarified and explained:\n\nWhen I said balance the classes I meant to decrease the gap. There should not be one side of a city of people that are covered in piles of wealth while another side is dirt poor.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Unretirement is becoming more common, researchers report. A 2010 analysis by Nicole Maestas, an economist at Harvard Medical School, found that more than a quarter of retirees later resumed working. A more recent survey, from RAND Corporation, the nonprofit research firm, published in 2017, found almost 40 percent of workers over 65 had previously, at some point, retired.\n\n\u201cWe definitely see evidence that retirement is fluid,\u201d said Kathleen Mullen, a RAND senior economist and co-author of its American Working Conditions Survey. \u201cThere\u2019s less of the traditional schedule: work to a certain age, retire, see the world. We see people lengthening their careers.\u201d\n\nA Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics supports that observation. It reported that the proportion of Americans over age 65 who were employed, full-time or part-time, had climbed steadily from 12.8 percent in 2000 to 18.8 percent in 2016. More than half were working full time.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven more people might resume working if they could find attractive options. \u201cWe asked people over 50 who weren\u2019t working, or looking for a job, whether they\u2019d return if the right opportunity came along,\u201d Dr. Mullen said. \u201cAbout half said yes.\u201d\n\nWhy go back to work? We hear endless warnings about Americans having failed to save enough, and the need for income does motivate some returning workers. But Dr. Maestas, using longitudinal data from the national Health and Retirement Study, has found that the decision to resume working doesn\u2019t usually stem from unexpected financial problems or health expenses.\n\n\u201cIt looks like something people are doing intentionally, instead of an oh-my-god response: \u2018I\u2019m running out of money; I have to go back to work,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more about a choice.\u201d\n\nLonger lives, better health and less physically taxing jobs than in previous generations help provide that choice, Dr. Maestas pointed out. \u201cYou hear certain themes: A sense of purpose. Using your brain,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd another key component is social engagement.\u201d Earning money, while welcomed, rarely proved the primary incentive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichelle Wallace, who lives in Broomfield, Colo., learned about purpose over 20 frustrating months. After decades in telecommunications, she said, she retired abruptly from a project management position in 2013, when her workplace turned chaotic and hostile.\n\nShe\u2019d saved enough to feel economically secure. But without a job, \u201cI felt like I was free-floating, bobbing along on the ocean,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt very ungrounded.\u201d Friends noticed her becoming more reclusive; her doctor increased her anti-depressants.\n\nIn 2015, she took a part-time job with a small business that supports government researchers. Now 69, she has no interest in retiring again. \u201cAs long as somebody wants me, I have a lot to contribute,\u201d she said.\n\nMost retirees who returned to work told researchers they had long planned to re-enter the work force. But among those who expected to remain retired but then changed their minds, Dr. Maestas has identified a subgroup going through \u201cburnout and recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people have a lot of stress, pressure and physical demands\u201d in their jobs, she noted. \u201cTheir interactions with people at work could be strained or hostile.\u201d After a restorative break, they can find work that suits them better.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Well Newsletter Get the best of Well, with the latest on health, fitness and nutrition, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

She retired at 63, because \u201cthe job was killing me.\u201d\n\nFor 18 months, she gardened and biked, took pottery and quilting classes, felt lonely but figured she would adjust. Then a chance conversation at the local senior center turned toward work. \u201cIt hit me like a thunderbolt, how much I missed social work,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s who I was.\u201d\n\nOnline, Ms. Christian quickly learned that the Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center needed on-call social workers, giving them the flexibility to set their own hours. Once hired, she tried various combinations and settled on working Mondays and Fridays.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cTwo days a week doesn\u2019t feel like work,\u201d she said, now 66. \u201cIt\u2019s an addition to my life.\u201d\n\nResearchers note that older workers have different needs. \u201cYounger workers need the paycheck,\u201d Dr. Mullen said. \u201cOlder jobseekers look for more autonomy, control over the pace of work. They\u2019re less concerned about benefits. They can think about broader things, like whether the work is meaningful and stimulating.\u201d\n\nOf course, workplaces present challenges, too. Nearly as many older workers face repetitive tasks or physical demands as younger ones, the RAND survey found, and they report slightly less support from bosses and cooperation from colleagues.\n\nClass and education matter, too. \u201cPeople with less education are in more taxing jobs,\u201d Dr. Maestas said. In the RAND survey, 60 percent of older college graduates who had retired said they would be interested in returning to the workforce for the right job. Just 40 percent of those without degrees felt the same way.\n\nStill, two-thirds of older workers report satisfaction in work well done, a majority that includes Sue Ellen King.\n\nNow 69, she puts on her scrubs twice a week, providing nursing education on the night shift from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. She feels needed, but not overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI get the ego reinforcement of having people appreciate what I do.

The Herd say they play \u201cHillbilly ball,\u201d which means they spread the floor, run and take as many 3-pointers as possible. Sound familiar, N.B.A. fans? Did we mention that the coach, Dan D\u2019Antoni, is the brother of the Houston Rockets\u2019 coach, Mike? Also, Wichita State\u2019s defense is not what it used to be, and that will be a problem.\n\nWhile the Times doesn\u2019t actually predict that No. 16 Penn will upset No. 1 Kansas, it says the game is worth watching.\n\nThe Quakers won the Ivy League, which had a down year but is still a more formidable conference than No. 16s typically come from; are expert at defending the 3-pointer; and are coached by Steve Donahue, who took Cornell to the round of 16 several years ago.\n\n\u2022 Jay Bilas of ESPN has established himself as one of the most prominent college basketball experts in the country.

No. 12s beat No. 5s.\n\nThis is the most celebrated first-round upset pick, because it nearly always happens once: Only twice since 2000 has a No. 5 seed not lost to a No. 12 seed. But over all, since 1985, the No. 5 seeds have won nearly two-thirds of their opening-round games. If you are picking all four No. 12s to win, you are probably doing it wrong; the numbers say pick one or two at most. Slightly more No. 11s have beaten No. 6s.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "But at Jazz Standard on Wednesday, there was no way to avoid thinking about paternal inheritance. Performing with a trio, Mr. Coltrane welcomed a special guest, Tomoki Sanders, a fellow tenor saxophonist and the son of Pharoah Sanders, who performed with John Coltrane in his final years and carried the spiritual-jazz mantle after Coltrane\u2019s 1967 death. Clearly, the risk of a disappointing gimmick would seem to be running high. But Mr. Coltrane is allergic to glib gestures, and it quickly became clear that Tomoki Sanders was there for the right reasons.\n\nAt 23, Mr. Sanders cannot even be called a new face on the New York scene yet: He spent his teenage years living in Tokyo and is currently finishing his degree at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. But you\u2019ll be hearing from him soon. There are few saxophonists in jazz today as silvery and deft as Ravi Coltrane, who blew a handful of melted-ore solos throughout the evening, bending in all sorts of directions without slurring the notes themselves. But Mr. Sanders kept up with him handsomely. He played some keen, beboppish solos of his own, always keeping track of the pocket and never losing his command.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Mr. Coltrane had the snugger rapport with his rhythm section \u2014 Dezron Douglas on bass and Allan Mednard on drums \u2014 but Mr. Sanders was keyed in and constantly listening. On the opening of \u201cFifth House,\u201d just seconds into the performance, he and Mr. Coltrane came together to play a drone, melding comfortably. When the tune neared its end, the two saxophonists threw out little, charmlike notes and dashes. Mr. Sanders was quick and light of touch, finding the spaces between Mr. Coltrane\u2019s tones. Ultimately the two horns became locked in an unlikely harmony, just one note apart, embracing the fertile space between them.\n\nMr. Coltrane\u2019s trio plays at Jazz Standard through Sunday, without Mr. Sanders.\n\nOMER AVITAL AND QANTAR Bar Lun\u00e1tico, March 12\n\nPhoto\n\nThe bassist Omer Avital makes big-boned, ebullient, swinging music with a spine that\u2019s equal parts 1950s Blue Note records and timeless Middle Eastern modes. He manages to play small-group jazz in a way that\u2019s bracing and direct enough to sound fresh and engaging, but has no interest in self-conscious postmodernity. His combinations feel naturally unified, not like a synthesis. Just as important, he puts joy and abandon out front; his authorship is affirmed moment to moment over the course of a performance, rather than through the building of a conceptual identity.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

Onstage at Bar Lun\u00e1tico in Brooklyn, performing with a new quartet called Qantar, a smile tended to reign over his entire face as he pushed his band mates into a variety of propulsive patterns. He was born in Israel to parents of Moroccan and Yemeni descent, and his songwriting often balances desert languor with cosmopolitan urgency.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn \u201cJust Like the River Flows,\u201d he started with a dark bass solo, then moved into a sauntering, minor-key shimmy. A few songs later, on the dashing \u201cKnow What I Mean,\u201d the tenor saxophonist Asaf Yuria took a swift, skittering solo; then the pianist Eden Ladin took over, cooling and remolding things by way of unexpected harmonic interjections, never letting up on the fast tempo. By the time Mr. Ladin crescendoed, he was moving on many levels at once, free of friction but in touch with a vast history.\n\nOmer Avital\u2019s new album, \u201cQantar,\u201d will come out on April 15.\n\nDIVA JAZZ ORCHESTRA Dizzy\u2019s Club Coca-Cola, March 29\n\nPhoto\n\nIngrid Jensen is now one of jazz\u2019s most reputed trumpeters, but a quarter century ago she was a young musician just getting her bearings in the newly formed DIVA Jazz Orchestra. That group\u2019s leader, the drummer Sherrie Maricle, has kept it together over the years by holding on to some longtime members while welcoming a steady stream of young talents when those like Ms. Jensen move on to other things.\n\nAs female instrumentalists have increasingly claimed space in jazz\u2019s male-centric spotlight, DIVA has served as a proving ground for some of the music\u2019s rising voices.\n\nMs. Jensen is a testament to that. She has a distinctive, hazel-hued tone and a restless improviser\u2019s style, in contact with the influence of Freddie Hubbard but less inclined to clean landings. On Thursday, in the first set of DIVA\u2019s four-night run at Dizzy\u2019s, she joined the orchestra as a special guest. (This weekend\u2019s shows are a celebration of the group\u2019s 25th anniversary, and the release of its new album.)\n\nThere are few jazz orchestras with a tighter machinery or a more sweeping repertory of original music. The set began with \u201cEast Coast Andy,\u201d a shuffling composition by the baritone saxophonist Leigh Pilzer, with a Count Basie bone structure and a Bob Brookmeyer musculature. That was followed by \u201cMiddle Ground,\u201d a folklike lament by the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Janelle Reichman, and a medley of tunes by Noriko Ueda, the bassist. The set closed with \u201cThe Rhythm Changes,\u201d a blues extension written by Ms. Maricle, with the trombones, trumpets and saxophones unified in a full-throated declaration.\n\nThe DIVA Jazz Orchestra plays at Dizzy\u2019s through Sunday.\n\nJONATHAN FINLAYSON SEXTET The Stone, March 3\n\nJonathan Finlayson stood onstage at the Stone\u2019s new home in a theater at the New School, almost ready to start his set. His body was angled halfway toward his band mates, his trumpet held at his side. He muttered a few words to his rhythm section, the bassist John H\u00e9bert and the drummer Craig Weinrib, and hesitated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA little voice shot up from the back row: \u201cI\u2019m waiting!\u201d It was Mr. H\u00e9bert\u2019s toddler son, who in all fairness had been exercising extreme patience for about 30 whole seconds. Mr. Finlayson smiled, put the horn to his lips, and got going with the set\u2019s first song, \u201cTap Tap.\u201d But that didn\u2019t solve the problem entirely. Mr. Finlayson\u2019s music is all about waiting: for pieces to fit into place, for a melody to gain lift, for the ship to dock. That\u2019s by design, and it creates a constant feed of generative precarity.\n\nMr. Finlayson was introducing a new sextet, which headed into the studio soon after this show to record an album. On \u201cTap Tap,\u201d he and the pianist Matt Mitchell gave chase to the chord changes, baiting them and tackling them, while the tenor saxophonist Brian Settles played fewer notes, seeming to live inside the harmonies as they moved. Steve Lehman, on alto saxophone, was a picture of total command \u2014 rhythmically goading the rest of the band and pulling the drummer Craig Weinrib into a bodily exchange.\n\nThe combination of openness and complexity in this music spells a certain kind of possibility: Mr. Mitchell took a solo that was almost entirely eighth notes, with nearly no rests, and still seemed to create rhythmic suspense at every turn.\n\nJonathan Finlayson\u2019s most recent album, \u201cMoving Still,\u201d was a New York Times best album of 2016.", "title": "March in Live Jazz: 5 Standout Shows", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"]}
{"date": "2018-03-28 00:00:00", "text": "I don\u2019t want to wring my hands about this attitude\u2019s corrosive effect on our politics, because it seems to me that once conservatism surrendered to Donald Trump, arguments about corrosion became a bit irrelevant. Rubio shouldn\u2019t be in politics if he can\u2019t handle vehement attacks, and the president that the Florida senator endorsed is as consistently ad hominem as the young school shooting survivors with rather less excuse.\n\nBut there are things that you can risk or lose when you fight the way Rubio\u2019s critics seem to want to fight. For instance, one reason that the Dreamer amnesty was an executive decision that Donald Trump could simply reverse, landing us in our current immigration stalemate, was that the Obama White House deliberately chose to make it one, pre-empting an effort by, yes, Marco Rubio to craft bipartisan legislation. That was a good example of smash-mouth liberalism, albeit substantive in that case rather than just rhetorical and driven by fear of Rubio rather than the current spirit of contempt: Don\u2019t let a Republican politician make nice with Latino voters, don\u2019t let Republicans disguise their anti-immigrant views with modest bipartisan maneuvers, create a clear contrast so that voters will reward you even if doing so requires pushing certain constitutional limits on your power.\n\nAnd it didn\u2019t work out particularly well. Indeed if anything Obama\u2019s executive action contributed to Trump\u2019s victory by helping to radicalize conservative voters, and now several years later the Dreamer cohort is back in limbo because the executive move lacked bipartisan support and legislative form. Maybe in the longer run the whole debate will help smash the G.O.P. as liberals believe it deserves to be smashed \u2014 but not just yet.\n\nOr another example, this one in the Trump era itself: During the debate over the Republican tax bill it was, again, Marco Rubio who made an extended effort to move the bill in a more middle-class-friendly direction by adding and then enlarging a child tax credit. The push was opposed by many of his Republican colleagues, but for a time Rubio thought that he could get an amendment in with Senate Democrat support. But in the end, presumably on the grounds that modestly improving a Republican bill makes it harder to attack it later, only nine Senate Democrats voted for the Rubio proposal, and it went down to an easy defeat.\n\nAgain, maybe this was an example of tough liberals brilliantly playing hardball: Don\u2019t let Rubio have any kind of victory for his slightly more popular flavor of Republicanism, so that he and his party will be easier to crush in 2018 and beyond. But in the interim it meant that Senate Democrats gave up a chance to move real world public policy in a direction many of them support, in order to pursue an as-yet-hypothetical larger victory that may not, like the Hillary Clinton presidency before it, actually materialize.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to say whether this dynamic will repeat itself with the post-Parkland gun control debate. Again, the activists\u2019 anti-Rubio zeal might actually help the progress of legislation, by holding him to his newfound promises. Or there might be no point in making a deal unless he\u2019s willing to accept something closer to the full list of activist demands. Or no bargain of any sort might be possible so long as Republicans hold the Senate, or even so long as they hold seats in states like Florida \u2014 in which case the hate for the senator is just a necessary path to his eventual retirement.\n\nI am personally agnostic on all of these points. For all his various bipartisan efforts, it\u2019s true that Rubio has not proven that he can actually deliver the votes for major compromises. And having watched the Trump G.O.P. hold power with a largely negative agenda and an ugly rhetorical style, I can certainly believe that a no-quarter liberalism will gain power eventually in its turn.\n\nBut I can also believe that the obvious pleasure to be found in demonizing the Republican most likely to do outreach could deliver liberalism more of what it has already been earning for itself these last few years: the satisfaction of self-righteousness as a compensation for the absence of political or policy success.", "title": "Opinion | Marco Rubio Must Be Destroyed", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "After World War II, the United States helped build an international economic order on the assumption that free and fair trade benefits all partners. During the postwar years, the American economy was unmatched by any other country. The postwar boom was fueled not just by thriving domestic demand but also by trade, which opened a flow of wealth from the world\u2019s consumers to American workers. Trade made America and our partners more prosperous and secure.\n\nThis basic case for trade still stands. When we exchange goods with other nations on equal terms, both countries benefit. Maintaining the conditions that make this possible is the purpose of the international economic order that we took great care to nurture. We need to take violations of this economic order seriously. We must enforce the rules. China, in pursuit of its goals of economic and regional dominance, has been among the most egregious rule breakers.\n\nWhen China acceded to the World Trade Organization in 2001, the United States supported that decision for two reasons: We hoped to promote better access to China\u2019s consumer markets for American companies immediately and, eventually, political liberalization within China.\n\nNeither has materialized. While the Chinese people have pushed for a somewhat more open society, the Chinese government is becoming even more autocratic. And since peaking in 2003, imports of manufactured goods into China as a share of gross domestic product have steadily declined.", "title": "Opinion | Marco Rubio: To Fight China on Trade, We Need More Than Tariffs", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-03-21 00:00:00", "text": "Zuckerberg: The first thing is, I really wanted to make sure we had a full and accurate understanding of everything that happened. I know that there was a lot of pressure to speak sooner, but my assessment was that it was more important that what we said was fully accurate.\n\nThe second thing is, the most important thing is that we fix this system so that issues like this don\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t going to be other different kind of things we\u2019ll also have to fix. But when there\u2019s a certain problem, we have a responsibility to at least make sure we resolve that problem.\n\nSo the actions here that we\u2019re going to do involve first, dramatically reducing the amount of data that developers have access to, so that apps and developers can\u2019t do what Kogan did here. The most important actions there we actually took three or four years ago, in 2014. But when we examined the systems this week, there were certainly other things we felt we should lock down, too. So we\u2019re going ahead and doing that.\n\nEven if you solve the problem going forward, there\u2019s still this issue of: Are there other Cambridge Analyticas out there, or other Kogans who, when the platform worked a certain way in the past, were there apps which could have gotten access to more information, and potentially sold it without us knowing, or done something that violated people\u2019s trust? We also need to make sure we get that under control. That\u2019s why we spent a lot of time figuring out, O.K. here\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to do a full investigation of every app that got access to a large amount of information before we changed the platform policies to dramatically reduce the data access that developers had. For any app that we uncover that has any suspicious activity, we\u2019re going to go do a full forensic audit, and make sure we have the capacity to do that, to make sure that other developers aren\u2019t doing what Kogan did here.\n\nThe third thing is, it\u2019s really important that people know what apps they\u2019ve authorized. A lot of people have been on Facebook now for five or 10 years, and sometimes you signed into an app a long time ago and you may have forgotten about that. So one of the steps we\u2019re taking is making it so apps can no longer access data after you haven\u2019t used them for three months.\n\nBut it\u2019s also just really important to put in front of people a tool of, here are all the apps you\u2019ve connected to and authorized, here\u2019s an easy way to deauthorize them, to revoke their permission to get access to your activity.\n\nKevin Roose: Is Facebook planning to notify the 50 million users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: Yes. We\u2019re going to tell anyone whose data may have been shared.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a question of whether we have the exact record in our systems today of who your friends were on that day when there was access three and a half or four years ago, so we\u2019re going to be conservative on that and try to tell anyone whose data may have been affected, even if we don\u2019t know for certain that they were. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll build a tool like we did with the Russian misinformation investigation, that anyone can go to it and see if their data was affected by this.\n\nRoose: Do you have a preliminary estimate of how many apps you\u2019ll be investigating?\n\nZuckerberg: It will be in the thousands.\n\nFrenkel: Were those app developers notified that you\u2019ll be investigating this yet?\n\nZuckerberg: Just when I posted. And we\u2019ll be reaching out in the near term.\n\nFrenkel: Are you going to be hiring people to help conduct those investigations?\n\nZuckerberg: Yes, I would imagine we\u2019re going to have to grow the team to work on this.\n\nRoose: You mentioned a contract that developers will have to sign in order to ask anyone for access to broader profile information. What will be the terms of that contract, and what will be the penalties for violating it?\n\nZuckerberg: So, the important thing there is that it\u2019s a high-touch process. The specific point we were trying to make is that it\u2019s not going to be some terms of service that a developer can sign up for just on their computer when developing something. I guess technically, that would be a contract as well.\n\nThe point of what we\u2019re trying to do here is to create a situation where we have a real person-to-person relationship with any developer who is asking for the most sensitive data. That doesn\u2019t mean that \u2014 if you\u2019re a developer and you want to put Facebook Login on your website, you can do that. If you want to get access to ask people for their religious affiliation, or their sexual orientation, for data that could be very sensitive, we want to make sure we have a clear relationship with those people.\n\nFrenkel: We understood that Cambridge Analytica had reached out to Facebook and asked that its ban on the platform be reconsidered. Are you giving any thought to allowing Cambridge Analytica back in?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: The first thing we need to do is conduct this full forensic audit of the firm, that they don\u2019t have any people\u2019s data from our community and that they\u2019ve deleted anything, including derivative data, that they might have. We\u2019re working with the regulator in the U.K. on this, so our forensic audit was actually paused in the near term to cede the way for the ICO there to do their own government investigation. We\u2019re certainly not going to consider letting them back onto the platform until we have full confirmation that there\u2019s no wrongdoing here.\n\nRoose: There were reports as far back as 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had access to this data set. Why didn\u2019t you suspend them then?\n\nZuckerberg: So, we actually heard, I think it was at the end of 2015 \u2014 some journalists from The Guardian reached out to us and told us what you just said. And it was not just about Cambridge Analytica, it was about this developer, Aleksandr Kogan, who had shared data with them.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

An error has occurred. Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWe took action immediately at that point. We banned Kogan\u2019s app from the platform, we demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica and a couple other parties that Kogan had shared the data with would legally certify that they didn\u2019t have the data, and weren\u2019t using it in any of their operations. They gave us that formal certification. At the time, they told us they never had gotten access to raw Facebook data, so we made that decision.\n\nFrenkel: In retrospect, do you wish you had demanded proof that the data had been deleted?\n\nZuckerberg: Yes. They gave us a formal and legal certification, and it seems at this point that that was false.\n\nAgain, we haven\u2019t done our full investigation and audit yet so I can\u2019t say definitively that they actually have data. I\u2019ve just read all the same reports that you have, including in The New York Times, that says that journalists have seen evidence that they have the data, which is a strong enough signal for us to go on, and take action here.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic driver behind us now needing to go and do a full investigation into any app that had access to a large amount of data before we locked down the platform policies in 2014. Just having folks tell us that they were using the data correctly, I think, does not satisfy our responsibility to our community to protect their data.\n\nFrenkel: Are you actively looking at some of these dark web data brokers that have been in news reports recently, that say that other independent researchers are potentially trading in this data?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: Yes, we\u2019re investigating that too.\n\nRoose: Are you worried about the #DeleteFacebook campaign that\u2019s been going around? Have you seen meaningful numbers of people deleting their accounts, and are you worried that will be a trend?\n\nZuckerberg: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a meaningful number of people act on that, but, you know, it\u2019s not good. I think it\u2019s a clear signal that this is a major trust issue for people, and I understand that. And whether people delete their app over it or just don\u2019t feel good about using Facebook, that\u2019s a big issue that I think we have a responsibility to rectify.\n\nFrenkel: We\u2019re now heading into the 2018 midterms. Could you speak about what Facebook is going to do ahead of the 2018 midterms to make people feel more confident that the platform won\u2019t be used this way again?\n\nZuckerberg: This is an incredibly important point. There\u2019s no doubt that in 2016, there were a number of issues including foreign interference and false news that we did not have as much of a handle on as we feel a responsibility to for our community.\n\nNow, the good news here is that these problems aren\u2019t necessarily rocket science. They\u2019re hard, but they\u2019re things that if you invest and work on making it harder for adversaries to do what they\u2019re trying to do, you can really reduce the amount of false news, make it harder for foreign governments to interfere.\n\nOne of the things that gives me confidence is that we\u2019ve seen a number of elections at this point where this has gone a lot better. In the months after the 2016 election, there was the French election. The new A.I. tools we built after the 2016 elections found, I think, more than 30,000 fake accounts that we believe were linked to Russian sources who were trying to do the same kind of tactics they did in the U.S. in the 2016 election. We were able to disable them and prevent that from happening on a large scale in France.\n\nIn last year, in 2017 with the special election in Alabama, we deployed some new A.I. tools to identify fake accounts and false news, and we found a significant number of Macedonian accounts that were trying to spread false news, and were able to eliminate those. And that, actually, is something I haven\u2019t talked about publicly before, so you\u2019re the first people I\u2019m telling about that.\n\nI feel a lot better about the systems now. At the same time, I think Russia and other governments are going to get more sophisticated in what they do, too. So we need to make sure that we up our game. This is a massive focus for us to make sure we\u2019re dialed in for not only the 2018 elections in the U.S., but the Indian elections, the Brazilian elections, and a number of other elections that are going on this year that are really important.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrenkel: The Times reported that [Facebook chief security officer Alex] Stamos will be leaving toward the end of this year. Is there a broader plan for how Facebook is going to structure security on its platform ahead of all these important elections?\n\nZuckerberg: Sure. One of the important things we\u2019ve done is, we want to unify all of our security efforts. And you reported on a reorg around Alex Stamos, and I\u2019ll say something about him in a second. He\u2019s been a very valuable contributor here and was a really central figure in helping us identify the foreign interference with Russia. And I think he has done very good work, and I\u2019m hopeful he\u2019ll be engaged for a while here on that.\n\nOne of the big things we needed to do is coordinate our efforts a lot better across the whole company. It\u2019s not all A.I., right? There\u2019s certainly a lot that A.I. can do, we can train classifiers to identify content, but most of what we do is identify things that people should look at. So we\u2019re going to double the amount of people working on security this year. We\u2019ll have more than 20,000 people working on security and community operations by the end of the year, I think we have about 15,000 now. So it\u2019s really the technical systems we have working with the people in our operations functions that make the biggest deal.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019d add on this. Take things like false news. You know, a lot of it is really spam, if you think about it. It\u2019s the same people who might have been sending you Viagra emails in the \u201990s, now they\u2019re trying to come up with sensational content and push it into Facebook and other apps in order to get you to click on it and see ads. There are some pretty basic policy decisions we\u2019ve made, like O.K., if you\u2019re anywhere close to being a fake news site, you can\u2019t put Facebook ads on your site, right? So then suddenly, it becomes harder for them to make money. If you make it hard enough for them to make money, they just kind of go and do something else.\n\nRoose: Is the basic economic model of Facebook, in which users provide data that Facebook uses to help advertisers and developers to better target potential customers and users \u2014 do you feel like that works, given what we now know about the risks?\n\nZuckerberg: Yeah, so this is a really important question. The thing about the ad model that is really important that aligns with our mission is that \u2014 our mission is to build a community for everyone in the world and to bring the world closer together. And a really important part of that is making a service that people can afford. A lot of the people, once you get past the first billion people, can\u2019t afford to pay a lot. Therefore, having it be free and have a business model that is ad-supported ends up being really important and aligned.\n\nNow, over time, might there be ways for people who can afford it to pay a different way? That\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve thought about over time. But I don\u2019t think the ad model is going to go away, because I think fundamentally, it\u2019s important to have a service like this that everyone in the world can use, and the only way to do that is to have it be very cheap or free.\n\nRoose: Adam Mosseri, Facebook\u2019s head of News Feed, recently said he had lost some sleep over Facebook\u2019s role in the violence in Myanmar. You\u2019ve said you\u2019re \u201coutraged\u201d about what happened with Cambridge Analytica, but when you think about the many things that are happening with Facebook all over the world, are you losing any sleep? Do you feel any guilt about the role Facebook is playing in the world?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nZuckerberg: That\u2019s a good question. I think, you know, we\u2019re doing something here which is unprecedented, in terms of building a community for people all over the world to be able to share what matters to them, and connect across boundaries. I think what we\u2019re seeing is, there are new challenges that I don\u2019t think anyone had anticipated before.\n\nIf you had asked me, when I got started with Facebook, if one of the central things I\u2019d need to work on now is preventing governments from interfering in each other\u2019s elections, there\u2019s no way I thought that\u2019s what I\u2019d be doing, if we talked in 2004 in my dorm room.\n\nI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s possible to know every issue that you\u2019re going to face down the road. But we have a real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up, and work with experts and people around the world to make sure we solve them, and do a good job for our community.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that, over the course of Facebook, I\u2019ve made all kinds of different mistakes, whether that\u2019s technical mistakes or business mistakes or hiring mistakes. We\u2019ve launched product after product that didn\u2019t work. I spend most of my time looking forward, trying to figure out how to solve the issues that people are having today, because I think that\u2019s what people in our community would want.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Reckoning: \u2018This Is a Major Trust Issue\u2019", "authors": ["Kevin Roose", "Sheera Frenkel"]}

The move to get Fultz, considered the best player in his draft class, was supposed to be the finishing piece of a team-building puzzle that had come to be known as The Process during Sam Hinkie\u2019s years as the team\u2019s general manager.\n\nThe Process has come to fruition, with Philadelphia\u2019s former lottery picks, Joel Embiid (drafted in 2014) and Ben Simmons (2016), being far and away the best players for a team that has improved from 10-72 just two seasons ago to being 43-30 after Monday\u2019s game. But the improvement has come without any help from Fultz.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFultz was a fantastic shooter in his lone collegiate season at Washington, connecting on 41.3 percent of his 3-point attempts, but he had a brutal start to his rookie season for the 76ers, turning in completely ineffective performances in his first four games. He did not even attempt a 3-pointer \u2014 none of his shots were from even 16 feet away from the basket \u2014 and he averaged just 6 points a game. He was then sidelined with what the team called a scapular imbalance in his shoulder.\n\nOnline debates ran wild over whether Fultz was dealing with a shoulder injury or a case of the yips, with several videos surfacing of Fultz badly missing jumpers in the gym while trying to regain his form. Before Monday\u2019s game, 76ers General Manager Bryan Colangelo said that Fultz had been cleared medically for some time and that it had been up to him as to when he would try to get back on the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about him being comfortable and him being in the right situation to be in a position to help us and help his teammates out there,\u201d Colangelo said.\n\nHe added, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t feel this was putting him in the right situation we wouldn\u2019t have him out there.\u201d\n\nWith nine games remaining in the regular season, the 76ers will be trying to evaluate if Fultz can help the team during its long-anticipated playoff run.

Why do you think it hasn\u2019t been shown more often?\n\nGJ: I don\u2019t honestly know. The studio was enormously shocked by it because they were thinking it was going to be another \u201cMidnight Cowboy.\u201d And they didn\u2019t know how to sell it.\n\nMG: It doesn\u2019t date a bit, even though it\u2019s a pre-AIDS movie.\n\nGJ: It\u2019s not really about sex, is it? It\u2019s about love \u2014 about the capacity to love both genders.\n\nMG: How would you define yourself as an actor in the British tradition?\n\nGJ: I benefited from that huge change in British theater otherwise known as [playwright] John Osborne. When I left drama school, the director said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t expect to work much before you\u2019re 40, because you\u2019re essentially a character actress.\u201d And that was a very accurate assessment, because the British theater then was still essentially a middle-class world. Then Osborne wrote \u201cLook Back in Anger\u201d (1956), and the whole thing just exploded.\n\nMG: I saw \u201cStevie\u201d (1977) in the West End in London [starring Jackson as British poet Stevie Smith]. I adore her work, and she is just tough as an old boot. Funny, but looks at the darkest things. As Emily Dickinson said, \u201cTell the truth but tell it slant.\u201d\n\nGJ: I\u2019m so pleased you said that, because I\u2019m a big fan of Emily Dickinson. The view of both Stevie and Emily Dickinson seems to be that here were these two solitary, depressed, lonely women, but they lived in these fantastic worlds!\n\nMG: They\u2019re great, greater than anybody around at that time. But their forms are small. And so, female gets defined as minor. Some of American women writers\u2019 best work was done in the form of the short story: Flannery O\u2019Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Stafford. I think what\u2019s funny is around the same time that Emily Dickinson wrote, \u201cI\u2019m nobody!

This woman went back to Oxford to speak at her college. There\u2019d been a big upsurge in women going to university, but it was very rare that a woman had a first-class degree. So she asked her old professor why, and this professor \u2014 also a woman \u2014 said because their examiners are still in the main men, and they like a lot of flash and filigree, whereas women go to endless lengths of attribution and details.\n\nMG: I teach at a women\u2019s college, Barnard, across the street from Columbia, which used to be male for donkey\u2019s years, and I say to my students, \u201cDo not speak into your collar when you tell me your name. There are men across the street saying things of immense stupidity at the top of their lungs!\u201d\n\nGJ: When I was in Parliament we had meetings of schoolchildren, and the girls almost invariably were at the back of the hall. Every single meeting at some point I would say, \u201cIs there no girl who has a question?\u201d\n\nMG: But you can\u2019t win for losing, because if you do open your mouth \u2014\n\nGJ: You\u2019re a ball-buster.\n\nMG: Men can write the most disgusting things about women\u2019s bodies and that\u2019s considered fine. I wrote a line in my first book, which was, \u201cHe played with her breast as if he were making a meatball.\u201d And the male critics said, \u201cShe obviously hates men.\u201d It\u2019s very hard to say, \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to say what I have to say.\u201d You have to get a little older for that.\n\nGJ: Quite right. And I still find it astounding that male creative writers don\u2019t find us that interesting. We\u2019re hardly if ever the dramatic engine \u2014 although in \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d we are. There was a period where I was doing films where the female character was there to prove the hero wasn\u2019t gay. It\u2019s just bizarre.\n\nMG: And look at what happened to Hillary Clinton. But it seems to me you had a moral imperative for going into politics. You wanted to change something.\n\nGJ: Certainly anything I could have done that was legal to get rid of Margaret Thatcher \u2014 she said there is no such thing as a society, and it made me so furious I walked into my French windows and nearly broke my nose.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We\u2019ve been in worse situations. I\u2019m probably optimistic. If I\u2019m not optimistic I\u2019m nihilistic, and I\u2019m certainly not nihilistic. I was raised by women during the war, when the men were all away fighting for us. They dealt with what life delivered with no small grace and a great deal of humor.\n\nMG: I was raised by women too. My mother had polio at the age of 3, was the oldest of nine. My grandmother may have had a third-grade education, but she was brilliant \u2014 tough, not warm and fuzzy. But when she died all nine children fell apart, including my mother, who ended up an alcoholic with Alzheimer\u2019s. So it worked for a while and then life became too hard.\n\nGJ: But you\u2019re here. You\u2019re here! This is the thing isn\u2019t it?\n\nMG: I am. And I wouldn\u2019t have a career if it weren\u2019t for the women\u2019s movement.\n\nGJ: Right, so how can you be despairing? The women\u2019s movement came about through women who hadn\u2019t had a women\u2019s movement. However bleak and awful it may be, there will be opportunities for people to move forward in a different way, a better way.\n\nMG: I hope so. My students are marvelous, and my daughter\u2019s wonderful. But with #MeToo ... while I think it\u2019s great that suddenly people have woken up to the crap that women have had to put up with, it\u2019s a little bit unnuanced for my taste.\n\nGJ: Well, the Weinstein thing is really not about the women\u2019s movement. In my country two women die every week at the hands of their partner, usually male, and that is not a front-page story.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMG: I don\u2019t want to be critical because they\u2019ll make their own way and God bless them, but the focus on date rape and gender identity, at a time when women can\u2019t get access to abortion \u2014 I find it a kind of privatistic focus. I had this talk with my students. I was teaching this story by Mary McCarthy called \u201cThe Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt.\u201d And I said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m 150 years old, but my generation, we didn\u2019t want to be looked at as sex objects. You all go out wearing shirts cut down to your navels and skirts up to your nose. Why does that feel good to you?\u201d They said, \u201cIt\u2019s fun, we get to do it and it\u2019s men\u2019s problem.\u201d And I said, \u201cO.K., just make sure you don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nGJ: It\u2019s a somewhat careless attitude. Sometimes they choose the wrong battles. You have to choose the battles that are actually going to \u2014 win, lose or draw \u2014 make some kind of step forward.\n\nMG: I do think that maybe a new generation of men has to learn it\u2019s not O.K. But to go back to Alex\u2019s line in \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday,\u201d which I went around saying as much as I possibly could in 1971: \u201cI\u2019ve had this business: Anything is better than nothing. There are times when nothing has to be better than anything.\u201d Women need to risk being unlovable. I think that\u2019s a great fear for women, that if they don\u2019t have the approval, protection and love of a man, there\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m a widow now, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to end up in a cardboard box eating dog food out of a can, but I think many women are terrified of being alone, particularly as they age.\n\nNow you live, if I may get personal, downstairs from your children?\n\nGJ: Yes, and I think it\u2019s convenient for all of us.

And you know you were a romance for me \u2014\n\nGJ: Don\u2019t lay it all on me, lady!\n\nMG: No, but I wanted to be that kind of woman. You were sexy, you were smart, you were tough but you had warmth, and that was a romantic new way of being a woman for me.

The St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriff\u2019s Office said its investigation had found that Mr. Rollins fired one shot at Jaelynn, 16, and then one more into his head at the same time Deputy Gaskill fired his weapon.\n\nDeputy Gaskill\u2019s shot missed Mr. Rollins but struck his handgun, the sheriff\u2019s office said.

Deputy Gaskill was unharmed in the exchange.\n\n\u201cHe pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter,\u201d Sheriff Timothy K. Cameron of St. Mary\u2019s County said. The officer, he said, then \u201cfired a round at the shooter; simultaneously the shooter fired a round as well.\u201d\n\nBut it was not immediately clear, the sheriff said, whether Deputy Gaskill\u2019s shot had struck Mr. Rollins. And while Sheriff Cameron initially suggested that Mr. Rollins had shot both the 16-year-old and the 14-year-old victims, he said later that he was unable to confirm who had injured the 14-year-old, who was transported to a hospital in stable condition.\n\nNeither victim was identified by the authorities. Sheriff Cameron said it seemed a \u201cprior relationship\u201d had existed between the gunman and the female victim, although he did not say what it was.\n\nThe sheriff said she was in the intensive care unit \u201cwith life-threatening critical injuries.\u201d\n\nThe F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sent agents to the school and were conducting a trace on Mr. Rollins\u2019s weapon, Sheriff Cameron said.\n\nDeputy Gaskill\u2019s intervention could increase calls for more schools around the country to add school resource officers, who play hybrid roles sometimes described as part security guard, part educator and part counselor. Currently, at least 30 percent of schools in the United States are believed to have such officers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut some opponents argue that a police presence in schools increases the chances students will be arrested unnecessarily for minor infractions.\n\nThere are few statistics on the effectiveness of school resource officers, although the Alabama-based National Association of School Resource Officers pointed to other instances in which it credited the presence of the officers for saving lives.\n\nIn a 2013 shooting at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., that resulted in one student\u2019s death, for example, a school resource officer was credited with preventing more carnage after pursuing the gunman into the school library, where he killed himself, according to Mac Hardy, chief of operations for the association.\n\nGreat Mills High, like so many other schools across the country, was already reckoning with school violence in the aftermath of the Florida shooting. There had been new discussions about school safety. There was an ominous Snapchat posting about a possible threat, which stirred worry but was found to be a hoax. Last week, there was a walkout by students calling for stronger gun control measures.\n\nAnd then, shortly before 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the authorities said, Mr. Rollins pulled out his weapon and opened fire.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Smith, the superintendent, said Great Mills High and other schools in the district did not have metal detectors, although officials had discussed the possibility of getting them after the shooting in Parkland.\n\n\u201cThere is an associated cost related to that, as well as staff,\u201d Mr. Smith said.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, described the shooting as a call to action. As states around the country considered new gun control and school safety measures in recent weeks, Mr. Hogan proposed putting $125 million into school protection and $50 million to pay for school resource officers. He complained that the State Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, had not passed legislation to do so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous to me that we haven\u2019t taken action yet on something so important as school safety,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.\n\nAlexandra Hughes, chief of staff for Michael E. Busch, the speaker of the state House of Delegates, called the governor\u2019s complaints \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said the Legislature had included $30 million for school safety measures. She said Mr. Hogan had filed the school safety measure late in the session, but that lawmakers had advanced other measures, including a ban on bump stocks, an \u201cextreme risk\u201d law that would allow judges to take weapons away from dangerous persons, and legislation to remove guns from domestic abusers.\n\nBack in Great Mills, some students and parents said the shooting had pushed them to get involved in coming protests for stricter gun control.

Charlie Baker, a moderate Republican \u2014 says it wants to use the same tools that have been widely employed by commercial insurers. State officials want to establish a list of covered drugs \u2014 what they describe in their proposal as \u201ca commercial-style closed formulary with at least one drug available per therapeutic class.\u201d\n\nWith the ability to exclude drugs, the state said, it will be able to negotiate better deals with drug manufacturers, guaranteeing them additional sales for the drugs it does cover, in return for larger discounts, or rebates.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cState officials want to be able to exert the market leverage they believe they should have as a very large purchaser of prescription drugs, without being constrained by what they see as arcane and obsolete federal rules,\u201d said Tom Dehner, a former Medicaid director in Massachusetts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMassachusetts said it also wanted to \u201cuse its own rigorous review process\u201d to identify new drugs whose clinical benefits have not been proved. In this way, it said, \u201cthe state could avoid exorbitant spending on high-cost drugs that are not medically necessary.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget for the coming year includes a legislative proposal for a Medicaid demonstration project that would allow five states to \u201cdetermine their own drug formularies,\u201d much as Massachusetts wants to do.

Wimmer, the chief executive of the American Lung Association. The possibility of making available just one drug in a therapeutic class is a real threat to patients with lung cancer or asthma, who often need more than one medication, he said in a letter to federal health officials.\n\nNonprofit groups that help people with diabetes, epilepsy and cystic fibrosis echoed that concern.\n\nSharon Torgerson, a spokeswoman for the health and human services office in Massachusetts, said that Ms. Sudders, the head of the agency, and Daniel Tsai, the state Medicaid director, would not comment on such criticism because the state was discussing its proposal with the federal government.\n\nThe objections from drugmakers are remarkably similar to the concerns expressed by patient advocacy groups.\n\nThe Massachusetts proposal \u201cwould dramatically limit access to lifesaving therapies for the poorest and most vulnerable patients,\u201d Wayne M. Sichel, a pharmacist and lawyer at Bristol-Myers Squibb, said in comments sent to the Trump administration.\n\nDr. Joshua J. Ofman, a senior vice president of Amgen, said the proposed Medicaid waiver \u201cwould tear apart the basic bargain\u201d enacted by Congress in 1990. Under the proposal, he said, Massachusetts would renege on its obligations, but would expect drug manufacturers to continue providing the price concessions required under the law. That, he said, is \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts officials said they were targeting certain costly new drugs that had received \u201caccelerated approval\u201d from the Food and Drug Administration.

{"date": "2018-03-01 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nAt its most fundamental, a dinner party is an act of generosity: Come to my place; share my bounty. Of course, it\u2019s rarely that simple. Historically, the powerful have used these gatherings to flaunt their resources; social and political intimidation in the guise of hospitality. In the potlatch \u2014 a ritual practiced during precolonial times by indigenous tribes of the Northwest Coast, including the Tlingit and the Kwakiutl \u2014 the high-ranking host plied guests with enormous amounts of food (like fish oil served via quart-size spoons), often until they threw up. Then he extravagantly gave away his most prized possessions \u2014 or destroyed them in a bonfire, just to show that he could. To save face, a guest from a rival village might counter with an even bigger feast.\n\nIn the hermetic kingdom of the dining room, the host is at once benefactor and dictator. Alfred Hitchcock planted whoopee cushions on seats, dyed food blue and reversed the order in which courses were served, beginning with dessert, all to toy with guests. Less whimsically, during the Renaissance, the aristocratic Borgias were rumored to poison them. Even without the threat of assassination, a dinner party can feel like a series of psychological tests: the table set with tiny implements of inscrutable purpose, the small talk like needles through the eyes. \u201cThe Oxford Dictionary of Psychology\u201d by Andrew M. Colman includes a listing for deipnophobia, fear of dinner parties \u2014 defined as \u201cirrational,\u201d although I\u2019d argue it\u2019s a defensive response to our divided modern times.\n\nFor if, as some have argued, dinner parties heralded the dawn of civilization, in this brawling era they might soon hasten its end. Anxiety over forced commingling may explain why the trope of the nightmare feast has taken hold in the imaginations of contemporary artists. In the filmmaker Sally Potter\u2019s recent farce \u201cThe Party,\u201d guests are at each other\u2019s throats before they down a single hors d\u2019oeuvre. Shattering revelations bring a whiff of hell: \u201cI smell burning,\u201d a guest says. \u201cThe vol-au-vents,\u201d the hostess sighs, momentarily distracted from her disemboweled marriage. Thomas Ad\u00e8s\u2019s opera \u201cThe Exterminating Angel,\u201d which had its American premiere this fall, revisits the surrealist Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s 1962 film of the same title, in which socialites at a posh soiree can\u2019t muster the will to leave. They stay, trapped by their own ennui, until food and drink run out, until the mask \u2014 of who they strive to be in the presence of others \u2014 slips, and they wind up slaughtering a sheep and roasting it over a burning cello. (In uncanny synergy, Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s vision has likewise infiltrated both a musical-in-progress by Stephen Sondheim and David Ives, and Darren Aronofsky\u2019s vexed 2017 horror movie, \u201cMother!,\u201d which ends in cannibalism and an ugly subversion of the Last Supper.)\n\nWhy, then, does it seem as if everybody is throwing dinner parties again? We could glibly dismiss it as an offshoot of the current obsession with food; amateur chefs looking to unleash their inner Yotam Ottolenghi on a captive audience. But these days, when our greatest intimacy is with our iPhones and the spectral kinship of social media has supplanted the immediacy of analog conversation, the true hunger is for earnest connection. And so a new strain of dinner party dispenses with formality in favor of sincerity. Gone are the napkins tortured into swans and the postprandial triage that shunted women to the drawing room while men dealt business. Instead, tables might be strewn with tea lights bought by the hundred at Ikea and dessert might be Klondikes from the corner bodega. In a communal, nigh utopian spirit, guests share in the labor and often bring dishes of their own, rehabilitating the idea of the potluck \u2014 which has nothing to do, etymologically, with potlatch: It derives from the 16th-century English pot-lucke, in which unexpected guests made do with whatever was already in the pot. For every dinner party that leaves family bonds and lifelong friendships in smoldering ruins, there is another that unites and reaffirms: Yes, we really like each other.\n\nThis might be easiest to achieve by inviting only like minds. Simone Beck, the co-author, with Julia Child and Louisette Bertholle, of \u201cMastering the Art of French Cooking,\u201d once insisted that in France, a guest list should be composed of people \u201con the same social rung, and who share the same way of life and religion.\u201d (She added, acidly, \u201cThe melting pot works in the United States but not in this country.\u201d) Framed that way, the desire to retreat from the world and seek solace among familiars can appear suspect. How will we ever understand one another? So while some choose to replenish their beliefs in the company of those certain to uphold them, others are opting for a different kind of gathering, one that rebuffs both Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s tableau of enervated privilege and social isolation and Mao Zedong\u2019s 1927 declaration that \u201ca revolution is not a dinner party.\u201d Such events are expressly devoted to the kind of conversations once considered off-limits in polite society (and deftly maneuvered out of by a vigilant hostess). One initiative, Salvage Supperclub, hosts meals in actual dumpsters to address the issue of food waste; another, the People\u2019s Supper, invites guests with divergent political views to share dinner in private homes across the country. The Nigerian-born chef Tunde Wey travels from city to city pairing dodo (fried plantains) and ayamase (green-pepper stew) with pointed discussions on blackness in America, the rise of anti-immigration sentiment and the unequal distribution of wealth. As these diners break bread, they, too, make a connection; if they can\u2019t agree, there is at least some hard-won acknowledgment of common ground: I am here, and I hear you. No, a dinner party is not a revolution. But in the right hands, it might start one.", "title": "Mastering the Art of the Tense Dinner Party", "authors": ["Ligaya Mishan", "Notes On The Culture"]}

Built in 1881, ten years before Grant Wood was born, it changed hands several times over the years, falling into disrepair after a long stretch of vacancy.

I was headed east on Highway 34, when I saw the brown-and-white road sign designating a national monument \u2014 \u201cAmerican Gothic House, 6 Miles.\u201d In a spontaneous move, I took the exit and followed signs through a maze of Eldon\u2019s threadbare streets, until finally, tucked back in a parklike setting on a sprawling grass lawn, there it was.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI laughed when I saw it. It was exactly as Grant Wood had depicted it, his brush strokes capturing every last intricate detail of \u201cthe world\u2019s second most famous White House\u201d \u2014 the front porch and its carved posts, the screen door, the vertical lines of its board and batten siding, the roof shingles, and, of course, the churchy window. In real life it was so much cuter than I expected. At 700 square feet, it was the ultimate Tiny House, like a beach cottage with a view of a cornfield instead of an ocean.\n\nPhoto\n\nA visitor center with a museum and gift shop had been built next door in 2007, with construction funds raised in true rural Iowa fashion: by holding bake sales. I went inside and learned that the house was for rent. Upon hearing the rent was the same price I was paying for my storage unit in Portland, Ore., \u2014 $250 a month \u2014 I decided I wanted to live in this house, in the country, and I followed through on my fantasy.\n\nAs meticulously as Grant Wood portrayed the outside of the American Gothic House, I can, with great intimacy, describe every quirk of the inside. And the quirks are many.\n\nTake the upstairs Gothic window, for starters, reaching nearly six feet from floor to ceiling. It is bolted shut, unlike the identical Gothic window on the back side of the house, which is hinged to allow the top half to fold down and then swing open in order to move furniture in and out. Even at 5 foot 5, I had to duck when climbing the stairs.\n\nPhoto\n\nI eventually got used to being woken by laughter and high-beam headlights shining toward it in the middle of the night when travelers wanted a photo. Sometimes I would turn on the light and give them a scare \u2014 who would expect anyone to be living there?\n\nBy day, a steady stream of tourists came, posing for pictures (and peeking in the windows) dressed in the free costumes provided by the visitor center \u2014 calico smocks with cameos, overalls and black jackets, even the spectacles \u2014 and wielding pitchforks of all sizes. They brought their own props, which included a prized Harley Davidson, a fleet of Stanley steam cars, and a herd of llamas. It was the centerpiece of a Klingon calendar shoot, a bare-chested rock band\u2019s album cover, a marriage proposal, a family reunion \u2014 a gamut of creativity daily.\n\nOf the 15,000 visitors the house sees each year, a handful were bold enough to walk inside if I left the door unlocked. The hassles were the reason the rent was so low, and also the reason the lease had a special clause reminding its tenant to \u201calways treat the public in a friendly manner.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nI was friendly, most of the time, especially during the summers when I ran the Pitchfork Pie Stand out of the living room. I also taught pie classes, which included a tour of the house. I pointed out the odd half-length bathtub in the sliver of a bathroom, an improvement from the original outhouse. I warned guests to watch out for the square nails poking up from the floorboards, the reason I kept a hammer at the ready.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNails were the least of my worries. I was terrorized by tornado warnings, lightning strikes, clanking pipes and, worst of all, six-foot-long bull snakes living in its recesses (there were close encounters in the bathroom and the basement). They are nonvenomous, excellent mouse catchers, and they are illegal to kill in Iowa. If you can catch them.\n\nBut one can only live in a tourist attraction for so long. I moved on, to Los Angeles for six months and then traveled around the world for three, but my experience in Eldon had changed me.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile I would have loved to return to the American Gothic House, it is no longer rented as a private residence. (The good news is that it is finally open to the public, and can be rented for special events.)

That was where Woods\u2019s go-for-broke approach was his undoing.

Beauty, Ms. Bilbao said, is \u201cvery subjective.\u201d Then she qualified her assertion. \u201cI do think there is a certain set of values that are universal that define beauty: proportion, light, scale. This is universal.\u201d\n\nThe granddaughter of the Basque architect Tom\u00e1s Bilbao, who fled to Mexico after the Spanish Civil War, Ms. Bilbao, 45, grew up in Mexico City and studied architecture there at Ibero-American University.\n\nShe is part of a generation of younger Mexican architects who have moved away from iconic, mannered work, said Miquel Adri\u00e0, an architect and director of the architectural magazine Arquine, and adopted a more inclusive approach based on dialogue.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She argues that architects can learn from Latin America\u2019s informal housing, where people construct according to their needs and their capacities. \u201cWhy are we not there supporting that and giving them the tools to make those spaces better with the same conditions instead of imposing our vision?\u201d she asked.\n\nHer own model for affordable housing overturned a myth that shapes Mexico\u2019s housing landscape \u2014 a flat roof ready to add a second floor when there is enough money.

In response, Ms. Bilbao designed a modular structure that can grow in volume, rather than height. It can be adapted to different materials, including recycled shipping pallets, and different climates. Three years after the houses in Ciudad Acu\u00f1a were built, Ms. Bilbao plans to return this year to talk to their inhabitants.\n\nShe has also been working with other architects to help people rebuild in the towns close to the epicenter of September\u2019s devastating earthquake. The houses that collapsed were constructed incorrectly, she said, but to her frustration many people rejected professional advice and simply rebuilt according to longstanding traditions.\n\nFor a long time, Ms. Bilbao, who has two young daughters, bristled at being identified as a woman \u2014- as different \u2014 in a field dominated by men. But she has learned to accept it, although with some discomfort, and acknowledged that it has brought her more exposure.\n\nAt the same time, she said, she no longer has to play a man\u2019s role, like successful women before her. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m in the middle of a meeting \u2014 if they call me to tell me that my little one is sick \u2014 \u201d she said. \u201cCiao.\u201d\n\nShe finally realized that she could no longer shrug off her identity as a woman architect when a friend asked her if there was a woman in Mexico she could look to as a model \u2014 the way architects around the world looked to Zaha Hadid, a London-based architect born in Iraq who was the first woman to win the highly sought Pritzker Prize in 2004.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI understand that things right now are changing and I need to be addressing the topic\u201d so that the women architects who follow will no longer have to face questions about whether their work is somehow different,\u201d she said. \u201c I understand that this is something that fell on me \u2014 and I have to address it.\u201d", "title": "Matching Architecture to People\u2019s Needs, by Listening to Them First", "authors": ["Elisabeth Malkin"]}

We can\u2019t codify it with an arbitrary threshold.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nUnderlying the debate is a fundamental dilemma: how to curb access to the addictive drugs while ensuring that patients who need them can continue treatment.\n\nThe rule means Medicare would deny coverage for more than seven days of prescriptions equivalent to 90 milligrams or more of morphine daily, except for patients with cancer or in hospice. (Morphine equivalent is a standard way of measuring opioid potency.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAccording to Demetrios Kouzoukas, the principal deputy administrator for Medicare, it aims to further reduce the risk of participants \u201cbecoming addicted to or overdosing on opioids while still maintaining their access to important treatment options.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that about 1.6 million patients currently have prescriptions at or above those levels. The rule, if approved as expected at the end of a required comment and review period, would take effect on Jan. 1, 2019.\n\nDr. Stefan G. Kertesz, who teaches addiction medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, submitted a letter in opposition, signed by 220 professors in academic medicine, experts in addiction treatment and pain management, and patient advocacy groups.\n\nHis patients include formerly homeless veterans, many of whom have a constellation of physical and mental health challenges, and struggle with opioid dependence. For them, he said, tapering opioids does not equate with health improvement; on the contrary, he said, some patients contemplate suicide at the prospect of suddenly being plunged into withdrawal.\n\n\u201cA lot of the opioid dose escalation between 2006 and 2011 was terribly ill advised,\u201d Dr. Kertesz said. \u201cBut every week I\u2019m trying to mitigate the trauma that results when patients are taken off opioids by clinicians who feel scared. There are superb doctors who taper as part of a consensual process that involves setting up a true care plan. But this isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nSome two dozen states and a host of private insurers have already put limits on opioids, and Medicare has been under pressure to do something, too. Last July, a report by the inspector general at the Department of Health and Human Services raised concerns about \u201cextreme use and questionable prescribing\u201d of opioids to Medicare recipients. In November, a report from the Government Accountability Office took Medicare to task, urging greater oversight of opioid prescriptions.\n\nIf the rule takes effect, Mark Zobrosky\u2019s experience could be a harbinger for many patients. Mr. Zobrosky, 63, who lives in the North Carolina Piedmont, takes opioids for back pain, which persists despite five surgeries and innumerable alternative treatments. He has an implanted spinal cord stimulator that sandpapers the edge off agony, and has broken four molars from grinding because of pain, he said. He receives Medicare as a result of his disability, including a private plan that pays for his drugs.\n\nHe submits to random urine tests and brings his opioids to his doctor to be counted every month. To prepare for mandatory reductions, his doctor has tapered him down to a daily dose equivalent of about 200 milligrams of morphine.

When the dose is flagged, the pharmacist or patient alerts the doctor.\n\nBut it falls to pharmacists to be the bad-news messengers. James DeMicco, a pharmacist in Hackensack, N.J. who specializes in pain medications, said that negotiating opioid insurance rejections for patients was already \u201cbeyond frustrating.\u201d He spends hours shuttling between doctors and insurers. \u201cMy heart goes out to patients because they feel stigmatized,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Anna Lembke, an addiction medicine expert at Stanford, sees merit in the intent of the proposed rule, if not its design.\n\n\u201cThe C.D.C. declared a drug epidemic in 2011, which they unequivocally and rightly attributed to overprescribing,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout external limits, I do not believe that prescribers will be able to limit their prescribing to the extent necessary to address this public health crisis.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, Medicare also needed to establish a reasonable grace period to allow patients on high doses to taper down safely.\n\nAccording to a draft of the rule, when a high-dose prescription is rejected, a doctor can appeal, asserting medical necessity \u2014 although there is no guarantee that the secondary insurer covering the drugs under Medicare would relent. A pharmacist may fill a one-time, emergency seven-day supply.\n\nOpponents of the new limit say that doctors are already overwhelmed with time-consuming paperwork and that many will simply throw up their hands and stop prescribing the drugs altogether.\n\nA delay or denial would put chronic pain patients \u2014 or those with inflammatory joint diseases, complex shrapnel injuries or sickle cell disease \u2014 at risk of precipitous withdrawal and resurgence of pain, doctors said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Medicare proposal relies on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that say doctors should not increase an opioid to a dose that is the equivalent of 90 milligrams of morphine.\n\nBut experts say that Medicare misread the recommendations \u2014 that the C.D.C.\u2019s 90-milligram red flag is for patients in acute pain who are just starting opioid therapy, not patients with chronic pain who have been taking opioids long-term. The acute pain patient, the guidelines say, should first be offered treatments like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. A short course of a low-dose opioid should be a last resort.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t take a specific position on people who were already on high doses,\u201d said Dr. Lewis S. Nelson, the chairman of emergency medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and University Hospital, who worked on the guidelines.\n\n\u201cWe did say that established, high-dose patients might consider dosage reduction to be anxiety-provoking, but that these patients should be offered counseling to re-evaluate,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a difference between a C.D.C. guideline for doctors and a C.M.S. hard stop for insurers and pharmacists.\u201d\n\nDr. Erin E. Krebs recently released a comprehensive study showing that patients with severe knee pain and back pain who took opioid alternatives did just as well, if not better than, those who took opioids. Nonetheless, she and seven others who worked on the C.D.C. guidelines signed the letter opposing the Medicare rule.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that our results could be used to justify aggressive tapering or immediate discontinuation in patients, and that could harm people \u2014 even if opioids have no benefit for their pain,\u201d said Dr. Krebs, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cEven if we walk away from using opioids for back and knee pain, we can\u2019t walk away from patients who have been treated with opioids for years or even decades now,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have created a double tragedy for these people.\u201d", "title": "Medicare Is Cracking Down on Opioids.

Of Greer\u2019s interest in language, Wolitzer \u2014 a noted bard of middle-class malaise \u2014 writes, \u201cAll written words danced in a chain for her.\u201d And the same could be said of the author herself, who writes in warm, specific prose that neither calls attention to itself nor ignores the mandate of the best books: to tell us things we know in ways we never thought to know them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf all the political threads that permeate \u201cThe Female Persuasion,\u201d the one that interests me most is the challenge of intergenerational feminism. This reviewer must confess to having met Wolitzer, through our mutual mentor Nora Ephron, whose humanity and specificity can often be felt in Wolitzer\u2019s work \u2014 here, particularly in the woeful characters who populate the student lounge at the fictional Ryland University, like the girl who needs help deciding whether diarrhea constitutes a medical emergency. (It is no wonder the first feature film Ephron directed, \u201cThis Is My Life,\u201d was based on a Wolitzer novel.) This connection is a reminder of what can be nurturing, inclusive and essential about the interweaving of ideas between women of varying ages, of how feminism expands rather than shrinks, while also sometimes forgetting to make room for what doesn\u2019t resemble itself.", "title": "Meg Wolitzer\u2019s New Novel Takes On the Politics of Women\u2019s Mentorship", "authors": ["Lena Dunham"]}

If that spending falls markedly as a percentage of revenue, United States taxpayers may have reason to feel taken advantage of.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nTrump\u2019s populism is proving bad for deal making.\n\nThe Trump administration seems to have taken a more activist role in mergers and acquisitions than past administrations.\n\nOn Monday, President Trump blocked Broadcom\u2019s hostile bid for Qualcomm. The move came just over three months after President Trump\u2019s Justice Department drew plenty of attention for suing to block AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nThat\u2019s roughly $200 billion worth of transactions.\n\nBut the administration\u2019s oppositions to M.&A. activity goes further, especially when it comes Chinese acquirers.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the other deals that ran into problems securing approval from the United States government:\n\n\u2022 In March, Changnong, a unit of Beijing Dabeinong Technology, scrapped plans to buy Waldo Farms after it failed to obtain United States government approval.\n\n\u2022 In September, the Trump administration blocks China\u2019s Canyon Bridge Capital Partners\u2019 $1.3 billion bid for Lattice Semiconductor over national security concerns.\n\n\u2022 In November, Cowen Group called off its deal for CEFC China Energy, a Chinese conglomerate with big investments in oil in Central Africa, to take a 20 percent stake in the New York boutique investment bank, blaming delays and \u201cuncertainty\u201d in securing Cfius approval.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 In January, MoneyGram and Ant Financial, the Chinese electronic payments company, canceled their $1.2 billion deal after failing to win approval from a Washington panel that reviews foreign purchases of American companies.\n\nThis approach to deals is a reversal from the stance of past administrations on deal making. Writes Matt Levine of Bloomberg Views:\n\nIf the shareholders would rather take the money and leave the business\u2019s fate to the acquirer, the governmental reaction has traditionally been \u201cehh, what are ya gonna do, capitalism.\u201d But now, maybe, not so much? With (selectively) reinvigorated antitrust enforcement, reinvigorated CFIUS review, and a president who sure seems happy to block mergers for political or personal-offense reasons, there are just a lot more ways to stop a merger, if that\u2019s what you are looking to do.\n\nThis day in financial crisis history.\n\nA decade ago, Bear Stearns was facing a grave liquidity crisis. Its stock had plummeted more than 20 percent in just days. Investors, as well as clients and broker-dealers, had pulled back from the firm, fearing that their continued exposure to plunging real estate assets threatened their solvency.\n\n\n\nAmid the chaos, the co-head of Goldman\u2019s investment bank, David Solomon, reached out to an executive at Bear Stearns:\n\nThe call left Sam Molinaro, Bear\u2019s C.F.O., feeling uneasy. \u201cWhen Goldman calls and offers their assistance, it's usually a moneymaking opportunity for them,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said.\n\nOf course, within days, JPMorgan, with the backing of the Federal Reserve, had stepped in and agreed to acquire Bear for $2 a share.\n\nMr. Solomon, meanwhile, was anointed the heir apparent at Goldman yesterday.\n\nHow companies are planning on spending their tax savings.\n\nWhen President Trump signed the sweeping tax overhaul into law late last year, he said, \u201cCorporations are literally going wild over this.\u201d We\u2019re not ones to judge whether that\u2019s an overstatement, but a new study has found that, at the least, many plan on going shopping.\n\nHere\u2019s what a survey of 500 American companies with sales of at least $500 million by EY found:\n\n\u2022 42 percent of respondents intend to use their tax savings on acquisitions\n\n\u2022 73 percent of executives said that they will accelerate their M.&A. planning for the year in any case\n\n\u2022 69 percent of respondents say that they\u2019re likely to bring back more cash from overseas under the new tax code\n\nThe responses to survey suggest that many of the predictions for how companies would use the proceeds from the tax overhaul may prove correct. Though many firms garnered headlines for doling out bonuses to employees or raising hourly wages, analysts and economists largely predicted that corporate America would turn to deal-making, dividends or share buybacks as ways to spend their money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, tax is not a driver of M.&A., but it certainly is a key element,\u201d Bill Casey, EY\u2019s Americas vice chair of transaction advisory services, told me. He added that the removal of uncertainty about taxes, as well as the potential benefits from the overhaul, appears to have lifted companies\u2019 deal-making spirits.\n\nNot that M.&A. has been bad so far this year. Announced transactions in the United States for the year to date are up 55 percent from the same time last year, according to Thomson Reuters. And Mr. Casey pointed out that companies already have access to plenty of cheap financing to pursue acquisitions.\n\nBut for mid-market companies especially, extra money in the pocket can help provide an extra shot of confidence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more capital being fueled by tax reform, and that will ultimately lead to a better deal market,\u201d Mr. Casey said.\n\nOther findings from the survey\n\n\u2022 75 percent of respondents said that they are likely to grow their United States manufacturing base in some way\n\n\u2022 89 percent said that they planned to \u201cenhance compensation\u201d because of forthcoming tax benefits\n\n\u2022 38 percent of mid-cap companies plan to create new jobs, compared to only 19 percent of large-caps\n\n\u2022 66 percent are likely to pass some tax savings onto customers\n\n\u2014 Michael de la Merced\n\nHow Trump blocked the biggest-ever tech takeover\n\nFew deal makers that Michael has spoken to since last night can recall such a dramatic scenario: The president intervening in a hostile takeover, citing national security reasons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPresident Trump essentially salted the earth for Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm.

Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.\n\nAnd in an interview with the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson last month, Mr. Solomon suggested that Goldman \u2014 which has added consumer lending to its stable of services \u2014 \u201ccould move in your direction a little bit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe succession race was Wall Street\u2019s most closely watched, with Mr. Solomon, the outsider investment banker, squaring off against a Goldman lifer and veteran trader, his fellow co-president Harvey Schwartz.\n\nFrom Kate Kelly of the NYT:\n\nLate last year, Mr. Schwartz approached Goldman\u2019s lead director, the private-equity executive Adebayo O. Ogunlesi, with an ultimatum, according to people familiar with the exchange. Mr. Schwartz said that unless he was tapped as chief executive in the coming months, he would resign. Mr. Ogunlesi was noncommittal, these people said.\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: Morgan Stanley has arguably done more than Goldman to diversify away from trading into more stable businesses like wealth management.\n\nA stumble for Goldman\u2019s deal business: It\u2019s fifth in Thomson Reuters\u2019s global league tables, behind Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lazard.\n\nLarry Kudlow may head back to the White House\n\nAs the current front-runner to replace Gary Cohn, the CNBC commentator would become the White House\u2019s top salesman for its economic policies \u2014 and one of the top internal supporters of free trade, when protectionism is ascendant.\n\nWhy Mr. Kudlow, whose last formal Washington job was in the Reagan administration? From Maggie Haberman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT:\n\nMr. Kudlow, who advised Mr. Trump during his campaign and after he became president, is someone with whom Mr. Trump has a rapport, and he is a media personality whom the president enjoys watching on television, according to aides.\n\nJust in time: Mr. Kudlow and Stephen Moore have an op-ed in today\u2019s WSJ on the economy. From the piece: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s tax-cutting and deregulatory policies are already pushing out the supply curve, creating real growth that isn\u2019t inflationary.\u201d\n\nMore context: The apparent discarding of the previous front-runner, Chris Liddell, is another blow to Jared Kushner, for whom he worked.\n\nThe political flyaround\n\n\u2022 While some Senate Republicans have introduced bills to block President Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs, G.O.P. leaders are unlikely to take them up.

The greater need is for people to understand that periods aren\u2019t something shameful and best kept hidden. When menstruation is treated as normal, it becomes more than a nuisance, a punch line or a weapon wielded to keep women in their place.\n\nOur aim must be to transform the revulsion into respect, to shift from \u201ceww\u201d to \u201coh.\u201d We need to redirect resources toward promoting innovative, inclusive and culturally sensitive community-based education about the menstrual cycle.

That\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo, who was elected to Congress in 2010 in the Tea Party wave, has been especially outspoken on Iran. He shares Mr. Trump\u2019s view that the nuclear agreement with Tehran is deeply flawed. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Pompeo wrote on Twitter, \u201cI look forward to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world\u2019s largest state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d\n\nHe has not moderated his messaging at the C.I.A.

In Afghanistan, the agency has sent small teams of highly experienced officers and contractors alongside Afghan troops to hunt and kill Taliban militants across the country. This marks a shift for the C.I.A. in Afghanistan, where the agency had primarily focused on Al Qaeda and on helping the Afghan spy services.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t perform our mission if we\u2019re not aggressive,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said last fall in a speech in Texas. \u201cThis is unforgiving, relentless.

He was an outspoken critic of Hillary Clinton on her handling of the terrorist attack on the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya, and co-wrote an addendum to the House Benghazi committee\u2019s report because he felt it did not go far enough. He has said that Edward J. Snowden, who gave an archive of secret National Security Agency documents to journalists, should get the death penalty.\n\nMr. Pompeo brought a taste of America\u2019s domestic culture wars into the agency, laying plans to hire chaplains for the agency, which until now has typically treated religion as a private matter.

He described how the artist kept a single 18-foot-wide canvas in his studio that he put paint on \u201cjust to keep busy.\u201d What started out blue became heavily encrusted with white paint from many hundreds of tubes, the canvas ultimately weighing more than 300 pounds.\n\n\u201cNew Bride\u201d pointed the way toward enormous paintings, built up from many hues that coalesce into monochromatic fields, that the artist produced though the 1970s \u2014 widely considered Resnick\u2019s finest works.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMilton often said, \u2018When people aren\u2019t looking, that\u2019s when you show what you can really do,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Dorfman, noting that by the 1960s the art world\u2019s attention was shifting from the Abstract Expressionists to the Pop artists. \u201cHis abstractions were tied to the idea of peripheral vision. They\u2019re epic proportion but intimate at the same time. They\u2019re mystical experiences, the best ones.\u201d\n\nThe foundation will keep a core of Resnick\u2019s paintings permanently on view in the soaring brick-walled sanctuary space with glorious arched windows that was the artist\u2019s primary studio. Other floors will host temporary exhibitions, including a Passlof retrospective in 2019, as well as poetry readings, concerts and the couple\u2019s archives.\n\nA windowed closet on the mezzanine, where Resnick set up a tiny studio near his bed when arthritis crippled him, will be staged with his easel and quasi-figurative works on paper he made after abandoning image-less painting in his last decade. The room will be exactly how Resnick left it on the day he took his life, according to Mr. Dorfman.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMilton is an underserved member of the New York School that has always been bigger than it exists in critical accounts,\u201d said Robert Storr, the former dean of the Yale University School of Art.

Resnick\u2019s family fled Russia and landed in Brooklyn in 1923 when Milton was 6. He entered the American Artists School in Manhattan at 16, committed to becoming a fine artist, and was cut off by his father.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhen Milton started, it was very much a New York thing, either immigrants or sons of immigrants, a couple of women but not many,\u201d Mr. Dorfman said. \u201cEverybody was poor and knew each other. Milton had a romantic view of the artist\u2019s mission and purpose. Everything else was tangential.\u201d\n\nResnick\u2019s career suffered from that. He refused to participate in the 1951 \u201cLife\u201d magazine photo of his peers, including de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko that helped enshrine the pecking order of the nascent Abstract Expressionist movement.

What makes establishment-aligned Republicans even more nervous is the prospect that former Representative Mike Espy could emerge as the other candidate in the runoff.\n\nMississippi\u2019s first black congressman since Reconstruction, Mr. Espy has deep ties to both Democrats and Republicans in the state.\n\nStill, if Ms. Hyde-Smith\u2019s partisan history could make her vulnerable on the right, it could conceivably appeal to moderate voters and even Democrats.\n\nWhat could prove most problematic for Ms. Hyde-Smith, though, is if additional Republicans enter the race, making it easier for Mr. McDaniel to emerge as the party\u2019s top vote-getter in the first balloting.\n\n\u201cI think the mood is of some apprehension because everybody understands how high the stakes are,\u201d said State Representative Greg Snowden, the second-ranking Republican in the Mississippi House, who repeatedly expressed his support for the governor. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is under an illusion that it\u2019s going to be an easy race.\u201d", "title": "Mississippi Governor Defies White House With His G.O.P.

{"date": "2018-03-30 00:00:00", "text": "Some of the procedures outlined by the 1995 law protect harassers more than they do victims. Before those complaining of sexual harassment can pursue a lawsuit or an administrative hearing, the law requires them to undergo counseling that typically lasts about a month, followed by a roughly 30-day mediation process, then to wait at least another month. The reform bill before the Senate, which the House already passed, would streamline that process by eliminating the counseling and mediation requirements.\n\nThe female senators also complained that while the House passed a resolution in February under which it would pay for legal representation of harassment victims there, victims in the Senate would get that benefit only if the reform bill passed.\n\nThe reforms are apparently being held up because Mr. McConnell does not like a provision that would require lawmakers to use personal funds to settle sexual harassment complaints, rather than taxpayer money, as is now the case.\n\nThat\u2019s right. For years, the American public has been paying for the misconduct of individuals on Capitol Hill. Between 2008 and 2012 alone, the federal government spent at least $174,000 to settle such claims in the House. Mr. McConnell reportedly formed his opposition to the provision, which he denied after the letter was released, after listening to the concerns of some of his Senate colleagues.\n\nWhile Mr. McConnell once took a tough stance on sexual misconduct, including within his own party, he has also led congressional Republicans in closing ranks around President Trump, who has bragged about sexually assaulting women, and Mr. McConnell holds dangerously misguided views about the challenges women face in society.\n\n\u201cI could be wrong, but most of the barriers have been lowered\u201d for women, he said in 2014. He was, in fact, wrong \u2014 women continue to face a wide range of inequalities, including a high likelihood of being sexually harassed at some point in their lives.

The heirs have even enlisted a high-profile ally, a former German culture minister, Michael Naumann.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn a letter last fall to the mayor of Krefeld, Mr. Naumann described the history of the paintings as \u201can unspeakable piece of knavery by the museum\u2019s management since the end of the war in 1945.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, many museums have worked to trace the histories of pieces they own, particularly those that may have changed hands during the war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cMuseums should have done provenance research on all the paintings in their collection,\u201d said Sally Yerkovich, who teaches a course on museum ethics at Columbia University in New York. \u201cIf they have items of unclear provenance, they should publish these gaps.\u201d\n\nThe city of Krefeld said it is planning a comprehensive examination of the provenance of its collection and, in the case of the Mondrians, will be commissioning its own expert to research their history.\n\nMondrian created the four works during a period when abstraction had taken hold. The researchers for the heirs, who are known as the McManus Holtzman Irrevocable Trust, tracked the paintings to an exhibition in Frankfurt in 1929.\n\nThe exhibition was called \u201cThe Chair,\u201d and 19 Mondrians, including the four now held by the museum, were offered for sale and displayed above metal tubular chairs, according to Ms. Tatzkow\u2019s research.\n\nA curator planning a show at the Krefeld museum the same year then inquired as to whether some of the Mondrians could be lent to its own exhibition, according to correspondence Ms. Tatzkow found.\n\nThe heirs believe at least eight Mondrians were lent to Krefeld as a result, a view supported by a 2010 email from a Krefeld museum curator, Sabine R\u00f6der, to the art historian Walter Grasskamp.\n\n\u201cThey presumably arrived at the museum in 1930,\u201d Ms. R\u00f6der wrote, \u201cwhen the director at the time, Max Creutz, was planning an exhibition of international avant-garde artists that never actually took place.

From there, he traveled to New York where he died in 1944. Ms. Tatzkow says Mondrian never found out what had become of his paintings and believed all his works in German museums had been destroyed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbstractions like those created by Mondrian indeed held no power for the Nazis who campaigned against modern art. Two of Mondrian\u2019s works, seized from museums in Hanover and Essen, were shown in the infamous \u201cDegenerate Art\u201d exhibition that opened in Munich in 1937, the year Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister, orchestrated a mass seizure of modern art in all German museums.\n\nThe Kaiser Wilhelm Museum, which was founded in 1897 and now focuses on postwar art, was among those that had many pieces confiscated. But the Mondrians are not on any list of the seized works, perhaps Ms. Tatzkow and Mr. Schnabel argue, because, as loans, they were not on any official inventory.\n\nWhat is clear is that the Mondrians were at the museum by 1950, when the postwar director, Paul Wember, said they had surfaced under what he described as \u201cmysterious circumstances.\u201d Mr. Wember described the discovery in his 1973 book \u201cKunst in Krefeld\u201d (Art in Krefeld) but did not elaborate.\n\nFour of the eight Mondrians were then sold or bartered by Mr. Wember in the early 1950s to acquire other important works of classical modernism. (The heirs are seeking restitution for all eight of the paintings.)\n\nThe four remaining paintings first appeared in the museum\u2019s inventory in 1954 \u2014 10 years after Mondrian\u2019s death.\n\nKrefeld city government says the heirs have no proof that the works were loans. \u201cThe pictures in question could also have found their way to the museum as a gift\u201d from the artist, the mayor\u2019s office wrote in an emailed response to questions, \u201cand this is what the city of Krefeld assumes.\u201d\n\nThe city, while asserting it has legal title, has argued that in theory any claim by the heirs would be invalid because of statutes of limitation.\n\nMs. Tatzkow said: \u201cThe theory that these were a gift is completely absurd. There is no way that Mondrian would have given eight of his pictures to a museum that had nothing to do with his art at a time when things were going badly for him and he urgently needed to sell. And why wasn\u2019t this so-called gift inventoried?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMondrian\u2019s trip to New York in 1940, when London was under bombardment, was arranged by Harry Holtzman, an artist and friend who became his sole heir. Mondrian\u2019s will stipulated that he was bequeathing all of his works to Mr. Holtzman, \u201cwheresoever situated.\u201d Ms. Tatzkow says Mr. Holtzman never knew of the existence of the Krefeld Mondrian paintings.\n\nThe McManus Holtzman Irrevocable Trust, set up to manage Mr. Holtzman\u2019s estate and run by his widow and three children, said it became aware of the Krefeld works when Joop Joosten\u2019s catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Mondrian\u2019s works was published in 1998.\n\nIn 2011, the trust approached the museum asking for information on how the paintings came to be in its collection. The heirs say Ms. R\u00f6der responded that she could give no more information than what was in the catalog, which reported their path to Krefeld as unknown. She did not mention, they say, the other four paintings that Mr. Wember had sold, which the heirs were unaware of at the time.\n\nThe city of Krefeld rejected any suggestion that museum employees have kept the history of the paintings secret. The mayor\u2019s office pointed out that since they were comprehensively restored, the works have been shown at the Tate Liverpool in 2014, at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin in 2015 and in Utrecht and Herford in 2017.\n\n\u201cPaul Wember and his successors Gerhard Storck and Martin Hentschel carried out extensive research into the unexplained origins of the pictures,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe author of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 was frequently in Krefeld to research and exchange information with the directors.\u201d\n\nIt warned that \u201cthe defamation of former and current employees of the city of Krefeld will be forcefully repudiated.\u201d", "title": "Mondrian\u2019s Heirs Stake Claim to Four Paintings in a German Museum", "authors": ["Catherine Hickley"]}

She pointed out that men outnumber women on many of the most powerful boards of New York, including its major hospitals, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Real Estate Board of New York. \u201cI\u2019m on the board of Mount Sinai, so I can get your cousin in to see the best doctor,\u201d she said, describing the currency of board membership for some wealthy men.\n\nMany women I interviewed said they viewed money as a means to help others rather than to increase their own profile. Those attitudes, admirable as they may be, have helped fuel a power gap that separates men and women.\n\nOf course, many recoil at the idea that women should pursue money and clout just the way men do. That flies in the face of increasing political anger about inequality. There\u2019s a longstanding rift in the women\u2019s movement and beyond: Does the path to power require acting more like men, or can women wield influence in ways that are different but just as effective?\n\n\u201cThere are men for whom there is no amount of money that is enough,\u201d Ms. Godfrey said. \u201cThe quest of more, bigger, better has taken this planet to a place of unsustainability. It seems to me that women are making different choices. And those choices may be healthier for all of us.\u201d\n\nDiana L. Taylor has spent years on Wall Street, in state government, and on corporate and philanthropic boards. That experience, as well as being the partner of a former New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has given her a close-up view of both political power and great wealth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen she graduated from Dartmouth in 1977, she said, her father refused to pay for business school. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why bother?\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2018You\u2019ll just get married and have kids.\u2019\u201d So she paid her own way through business school, won over her father and landed in investment banking. She left one firm to start another one in the late 1980s when she learned she was being paid less than men at her level.\n\nWomen have long been active philanthropists, but Ms. Taylor observed that women tend to give to smaller organizations that might not offer the flashiest rewards for donors.\n\nResearch suggests that men continue to set priorities and reap more direct power from philanthropy than women. Ms. Chang found that women were more likely to use their wealth to help other people, and men to advance their influence, such as naming a building or donating to a college. \u201cWomen have not been socialized to brag and have their names on things,\u201d said Debra Mesch, director of the Women\u2019s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University.\n\nHowever they exercise it, more women appear to be awakening to the power wealth can endow.\n\nMale political donors like Tom Steyer on the left and the Koch brothers on the right have been able to force issues they champion onto their parties\u2019 agendas. There are far fewer women with the kind of wealth that buys impact on that scale \u2014 although more are mobilizing. Among those women is Rebekah Mercer, who has deployed her family\u2019s fortune to press the causes she wants Republicans to embrace.\n\nIn 2017, nearly four times the number of women donated to political campaigns than in the two years of the previous midterm cycle, according to preliminary results analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics. More women have given money to congressional campaigns in this cycle than men, primarily to Democratic candidates, according to a Crowdpac analysis.\n\nEven if they are ambivalent about the pursuit of money, women are increasingly fed up with persistent pay gaps and are demanding that they be paid as much as men for the same work. Carrie Gracie shamed the BBC by quitting when she saw the gap between her salary as China editor and those of men she considered peers. Out of the limelight, many women are sharing details of their salaries, breaching taboos against honest talk about money.\n\nSarah Elliott is a 33-year-old advertising sales executive in an entertainment and gaming company who looks to Ms. Britt, the former Fortune 500 executive, as a mentor. She said when she entered advertising as a research analyst, she was following her interests rather than focusing on her salary. About five years in, she realized that she was providing research to help close deals but was earning far less than her colleagues in sales. \u201cWhy am I not getting the financial benefits of all this work?\u201d she recalled thinking. \u201cIn sales, the harder you work the more money you make.\u201d\n\nNow she belongs to a network of women her age who exchange salary information. She is investing in Plum Alley, one of several networks of women-owned businesses that are attracting female investors. And this is the first year she\u2019s considered political donations, inspired by the number of women running for office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Glen, the deputy mayor, said the young women in business she mentors are growing impatient with the slow, halting climb to the top of corporate America and are choosing entrepreneurship instead. \u201cYoung women aren\u2019t looking toward Wall Street but toward billion-dollar I.P.O.s,\u201d she said.\n\nBut not, at least for now, her own daughter. Set against women\u2019s growing boldness about money is a resentment over inequality and corporate influence. Ms. Glen\u2019s daughter, a college senior, told her mother that she had no intention of working at a for-profit company. \u201cI get why she feels that way,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cBut I want to make sure she\u2019s not disempowering herself. I want her to be a badass.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, many women who believed they were on the cusp of electing the first female president took their daughters with them to the polls. Outrage on the left at Donald J. Trump\u2019s election drove many women toward political activism and to run for office themselves.

The trick is to be honest with how much you want to spend from the start.

No connection has been found between the disease and what is inside the implants \u2014 salt water or silicone. Nor is the lymphoma associated with breast cancer: It is just as likely to occur in women who chose implants for cosmetic reasons as in those who received them during reconstructive surgery after breast cancer.\n\nTextured implants have roughened surfaces that may act as an irritant in some women, provoking inflammation that can lead to lymphoma, researchers say. Another theory is that the texturing might trap bacteria, and that a chronic infection could also bring on the cancer.\n\nDoctors and patients sometimes prefer textured implants because they are less likely to shift out of position than smooth ones, as tissue grows into the roughened surface and holds the implant in place. In the United States, most implants are smooth; textured ones are more popular in Europe.\n\nThe lymphoma \u201cappears to currently develop exclusively in women with textured implants,\u201d according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.\n\nBut the F.D.A. said it could not state conclusively that textured implants were the sole cause of the disease, because there was not complete information in every case on what type of implants were used. Implants often have to be replaced, and if a woman with lymphoma has had both types of implants it may be hard to tell which is to blame.\n\nA \u201cconsumer update\u201d by the F.D.A. on Wednesday describes the lymphoma but makes no mention of texturing or its role in the disease. An agency spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said the F.D.A. would \u201ctake another look at\u201d the update, adding, \u201cOur goal is not to gloss over anything, but to be consumer friendly.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He also said that on Jan. 1, Allergan changed the warranty on its textured implant to cover treatment for Allergan patients who received a diagnosis of the implant-associated lymphoma on or after that date, regardless of the implantation date.\n\nA request for comment to the other major manufacturer of breast implants, Mentor, was not answered in time for publication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe case count is uncertain, the agency said, noting that the F.D.A. depends on voluntary reporting that \u201cmay contain incomplete, inaccurate, untimely, unverified, or biased data.\u201d Indeed, a registry called Profile, being compiled by professional societies in plastic surgery, is reporting higher figures \u2014 about 500 cases worldwide, and 16 verified deaths, including five deaths in the United States.\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Binita Ashar, director of the division of surgical devices in the drug agency\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that the Profile registry might include data that the F.D.A. had not yet received, and that the agency and professional groups were collaborating to obtain more accurate information about the disease.\n\nCompared with the number of women with breast implants, the number of lymphoma cases is very small. In the United States, about 300,000 women a year get implants for cosmetic reasons, and another 150,000 for reconstruction after cancer surgery. Worldwide, about 10 million women have implants.\n\nDr. Ashar said that in response to concerns expressed by women who have had the lymphoma, the F.D.A. has changed the language on its website to refrain from calling the disease \u201crare.\u201d Instead, the agency gives the odds that it will occur in a woman who has textured implants: from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 3,817.\n\n\u201cIt is a broad range but we\u2019re trying to be transparent in what we know,\u201d Dr. Ashar said, describing the disease as \u201cvery uncommon.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for women with the disease, who have met several times with F.D.A. officials, said they had hoped that the agency would discourage the use of textured implants.\n\nBut Dr. Ashar said that although the F.D.A. wanted women to know that the lymphoma was more likely to occur with textured implants, there was not enough data for the F.D.A. to advise against them.

Mr. Greenberg was not punished for what the three-person arbitration panel deemed was defamation because the statute of limitations had expired, the panel said in its decision.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn December 2006, Mr. Greenberg was charged with harassment and criminal mischief, according to court papers and a police blotter item in The Lake Oswego Review. He had violated a restraining order taken out by his ex-girlfriend, the second woman to ask for protection against him, according to the court papers. Mr. Greenberg eventually pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespass and agreed to limitations on his movements, according to a plea deal reviewed by The Times.\n\nAnd eight years later, Mr. Greenberg was charged with violating another restraining order taken out by a different ex-girlfriend. The woman, Anne Cost, had obtained the order against Mr. Greenberg after, she said, he threatened to burn down her house. Now, she told the police, Mr. Greenberg was menacing her again, trailing her in his car.\n\n\u201cYou could have placed a pizza box between her back bumper and Mr. Greenberg\u2019s front bumper he was so close to her,\u201d a Lake Oswego police officer, John J.

The posts did not name Mr. Greenberg, but there was little doubt about whom she was referring to. Her friends commented on the posts and criticized Mr. Greenberg by name. And a lawyer for Mr. Greenberg complained about the posts to Ms. Williams\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAmong the commenters was Alex Burlingame, a Morgan Stanley manager in Seattle who had worked with Mr. Greenberg for years.

{"date": "2018-03-13 00:00:00", "text": "The surge in imports, mostly from Latin America and Canada, flows from many other changes during the last 40 years, starting with improvements in roads, containerized shipping and storage technology. Horticulturists developed varieties and growing practices adapted to warmer climates \u2014 enabling, say, blueberries and blackberries to be grown in central Mexico.\n\nGrowth in American incomes spurred greater demand for fresh produce year-round. Immigrants brought tastes for the foods of their homelands, and in some cases (like avocados and mangoes) these tastes have became mainstream. Foreign growers took advantage of lower labor costs. International trade agreements reduced tariffs and other obstacles to imports, while many American farmers, facing regulatory hurdles at home, have responded by shifting production abroad, mainly to Mexico.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne crucial part of the story is little known: Over the past two decades, the United States Department of Agriculture has issued roughly 100 new rules allowing specific crops to be imported from certain countries \u2014 like peppers from Peru. Crops that previously would have not been approved because they might introduce invasive pests and diseases were allowed in through new \u201csystems approaches\u201d that manage those risks by combining methods like orchard inspections, sprays and bagging of fruits.\n\nMany foreign crops have recently been approved for importation using these protocols, including Chinese apples and Colombian avocados. Some are still in the rule-making process (Chinese citrus, European apples), and others are under study (Brazilian citrus, Mexican guavas).\n\nAs a result, the proportion of the imported fresh fruit eaten in the United States rose to 53.1 percent in 2016, from 23 percent in 1975, according to the Agriculture Department\u2019s Economic Research Service. Fresh vegetable imports rose to 31.1 percent from 5.8 percent. (Still, the United States remains a net agricultural exporter, with grains, soybeans, meat and nuts accounting for most of the trade surplus.)\n\nGreater availability has led to a huge increase in per-capita consumption of many crops, including mangoes (up 1,850 percent from 1975 to 2016), limes, avocados, grapes, asparagus, artichokes and squash. Yet consumption has fallen for other crops \u2014 like peaches, oranges, cabbages and celery \u2014 that are still primarily grown in America.\n\nImports vs. Homegrown\n\nFor consumers, the chief advantages of the import boom are the increased availability and variety of fresh produce, particularly in winter, when imported berries, grapes and stone fruit now compete with citrus and stored apples.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to criticize food that comes from far away,\u201d Mr. Pollan said. \u201cBut if the question is whether this is good for your health or not, in general it is.\u201d\n\nMany imports cost less than domestically grown equivalents, and competition from imports keeps prices down for domestic produce.\n\nPhoto\n\nImported produce is also sometimes fresher than the domestic equivalent. In spring, newly harvested Gala apples from New Zealand may be crunchier than the same variety from American orchards, which were picked the previous fall. And some imports are simply superb, like flavorful pink seedless muscat grapes from Chile, now in season.\n\nBut unlike imported furniture or washing machines, produce is perishable and may suffer from transport. It may be picked less ripe. Varieties may be selected for durability at the expense of flavor, and treatments mandated to kill pests (hot water for mangoes, cold temperatures for citrus) can degrade flavor or texture.\n\nIn many fruits, acidity drops over time, and off flavors develop; weeks-old cherries, for example, may still look fine but taste flat. Vegetables, too, can decline. Domestic asparagus, grown mostly in California, Michigan and Washington, tends to be plumper, juicier and more flavorful than the more fibrous and rubbery imports from Mexico and Peru.\n\nIt might seem logical that older produce is also less nutritious, and for some compounds such as vitamin C, levels do decline with time. But there does not appear to be any evidence that the overall nutrient content degrades significantly. From a public health standpoint, the benefits of increased availability and consumption of imported produce outweigh any such worries, nutritionists say.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt might also seem that imported fruits and vegetables are more likely than domestic produce to cause food-borne illness, but there\u2019s no evidence that this is so. \u201cI don\u2019t think that produce grown outside the United States is less safe,\u201d said Bill Marler, a lawyer in Seattle who often represents consumers in food-borne illness cases.\n\nOf some concern is a 2015 report from the Food and Drug Administration that found that 9.4 percent of imported fruit samples violated federal standards for pesticide residues, compared with 2.2 percent of domestic samples. (For vegetables, the figures were 9.7 percent for imported and 3.8 percent for domestic.) But that\u2019s probably not enough to justify avoiding imported produce.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201c\u2018Eat your veggies\u2019 is good advice no matter what,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. \u201cThe benefits of plant-based diets are better established than the harms of pesticides.\u201d\n\nReports of fraud from countries like China and Costa Rica have raised a concern: Is imported produce labeled organic as reliably free of pesticide residues as domestic equivalents?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nNo published scientific studies have directly addressed that topic. Jessica Shade, director of science programs at the Organic Center, a nonprofit organization that provides information about organic food and farming, said all certified organic produce, foreign or domestic, is subject to residue testing and on-site farm inspections by certifiers.\n\nEven so, Mr. Pollan said, \u201cI generally have more confidence in domestic than imported organic.\u201d\n\nThen there are environmental issues: Because imported fruits and vegetables typically travel farther than domestic produce from farm to table, they cause greater harm from carbon emissions and pollution. That\u2019s especially true for produce arriving by air, which is likely to be fresher and cost more than produce arriving by ship.\n\nBut transport miles are just one component of environmental costs, and in some cases fruits and vegetables grown in a suitable climate overseas may require fewer resources for farming and be more generally sustainable than off-season domestic produce \u2014 cultivated, say, in heated greenhouses.\n\nDrug cartels looking to launder money and diversify their operations control or extort some of the production and packing of certain export crops from Mexico (the largest exporter of produce to the United States), including avocados, mangoes and limes. Growers and militias have fought back, but the implications of cartel control for the quality, cost and healthfulness of the produce remain unclear.\n\nThe Harvest for Farmers\n\nFor American farmers, too, imports have had mixed consequences. The increased international trade in produce has benefited many of them (including growers of Northwestern apples and California citrus) but harmed others (producers of Florida tomatoes and California asparagus).\n\nMost growers\u2019 organizations maintain that trade accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement have helped American produce farmers on balance.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNafta over all has been positive, and we oppose U.S. withdrawal from the agreement,\u201d said Ken Gilliland, director of international trade for Western Growers, which represents produce farmers in Arizona, California, Colorado and New Mexico. \u201cEliminating Nafta and implementing tariffs would have a negative impact on our members\u2019 ability to export.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost of the advantage from exports, however, has gone to large growers.\n\n\u201cClearly the larger shippers have benefited more from the globalization of produce,\u201d said David Runsten, policy director of the Community Alliance With Family Farmers, a California group that advocates for small farms. \u201cSmaller organic produce growers in California are feeling the effects of increasing imports.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration is likely to worsen the shortage and high cost of labor, a serious threat for many American farmers. \u201cThe United States needs immigration reform and a stable labor force if it wants to continue to grow most of its own produce,\u201d Mr. Runsten said.\n\nAn onslaught of invasive pests and diseases such as spotted wing drosophila and citrus greening has cost farmers, and ultimately consumers, many billions of dollars for control measures and lost crops. Did any of those plagues arrive with commercially imported produce, or, as is generally thought, did they come in through other pathways such as smuggling of produce and plants by individuals?\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to conclusively determine whether a pest introduction came through a regulated or unregulated route,\u201d Philip Berger, executive director of the Agriculture Department\u2019s Center for Plant Health Science and Technology, wrote in an email. \u201cCompared to other possible pathways of introduction, U.S.D.A.-regulated imports of produce for food use have a lower risk of introducing new pests.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, however, scientific studies have found that trade agreements and resulting increased produce shipments may have contributed to the movement of invasive species into the United States. So far no one has fully connected the dots, or estimated the costs for American farmers of pests and diseases attributable to imported produce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that our investment in inspection resources has kept pace with the increase in trade,\u201d said Michael R. Springborn, an associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of California, Davis, who studies invasive species.\n\nWill Produce Go the Way of Fish?\n\nWhatever the drawbacks or advantages, imports are likely to continue growing. According to a recent Agriculture Department report, fresh produce imports will rise 45 percent from 2016 to 2027, implying that a decade from now, three-quarters of our fruits and almost half of our vegetables will be imported.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn other words, we could end up getting our produce as we do our fish \u2014 more than 80 percent of which is imported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t grow the products here, we\u2019re going to have to import them,\u201d said Kathy Means, vice president of industry relations for the Produce Marketing Association, which represents both supermarkets and growers. \u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable with that at all.\u201d\n\nThe federal government is focused on the economics. Jason Hafemeister, trade counsel to the secretary of agriculture, said in an interview that increased trade has generally benefited farmers and consumers. The Trump administration seeks to ensure a level playing field in trade for American farmers, he added, but wants to let consumers choose what matters to them in produce, whether price, freshness or origin.\n\nMr. Pollan, not surprisingly, does worry as imports climb. \u201cI think it would be a tremendous loss if we weren\u2019t growing a significant percentage of our produce, for reasons having to do both with quality, and with the knowledge of the environment that farmers bring to a society,\u201d he said.\n\nConsumers who agree can vote with their dollars by prizing local and domestic produce when available, and staying alert for decreased quality in less-fresh imports. The next decade or two will determine whether Americans can enjoy the advantages of an increasingly globalized supply without losing the very real benefits of domestic produce.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the ritual of eating seasonally, the pleasure one can have as fruit comes into the market,\u201d Mr. Pollan said.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Ms. Ortega worked in the afternoon, helping to pick up and drop off the children, and was paid at least $500 a week.\n\nOn the day of the slayings, Ms. Ortega woke on time for work, sent her son to school, sent him a text to confirm he had arrived, got rid of her cellphone and left her identification and insurance card with her sister.

One measure backed by Donald Trump Jr. would legalize silencers, which have been rigorously controlled since the 1930s. Advocates had the gall to call it the Hearing Protection Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about safety,\u201d Trump Jr. explains in a video. \u201cIt\u2019s about hearing protection. It\u2019s a health issue, frankly, for me.

They warn that it would let a stalker, domestic abuser or suspected terrorist from a low-regulation state tote concealed weapons at will around the country.\n\nAll this is infuriating.

In January, he ordered the president\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, to appear before a grand jury. Mr. Mueller dropped the subpoena after Mr. Bannon agreed to be interviewed by investigators.\n\nMr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump\u2019s business outside ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family\u2019s finances beyond any relationship with Russia.

The argument helped propel him to the White House, but the Trump Organization has been a magnet for criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and some Republicans, who expressed concern that he remained vulnerable to conflicts of interest because he did not separate from the company.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump was sworn in, he pledged that he would stay uninvolved in his businesses while in office but insisted it would be too punitive for his business partners for him to divest from the company altogether.\n\nAmong the Trump Organization\u2019s holdings are golf clubs, hotels and licensing agreements for the use of the Trump name on properties and other products. While its holdings are complex, the company has always been run like a small, family-owned business; Mr. Trump brought in his three eldest children to help run the enterprise.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Trump Organization is not publicly held, making it difficult to determine where it receives its money and invests it. The company has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow.\n\nIn 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, Felix Sater, emailed Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 and discussed it at least three times with Mr. Cohen.\n\nA revealing comment about Russia by Eric Trump, the president\u2019s middle son, also drew scrutiny when it emerged last year. James Dodson, a longtime golf writer from North Carolina, said offhand in a radio interview that Eric Trump, who oversees the golf courses for the Trump Organization, told him in 2013 that the Trumps relied on Russian investors to back their golf clubs. Eric Trump has denied those remarks.\n\nMr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry.\n\nA month later, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation.\n\nMr. Mueller is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller\u2019s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview, but the president has said he wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators\u2019 questions.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet T.

(The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.)\n\nThe Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.\n\nMr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.\n\nMr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.\n\nAt the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower.\n\nThe Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev\u2019s divorce.\n\nMr. Rybolovlev\u2019s wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied.\n\nHe has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market. The spokesman also said that the property was acquired by a family trust \u201cspecifically and explicitly for investment purposes,\u201d and that depending on the sale price of the final lot, the investment might \u201cend up yielding a decent return.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThere Were Boasts That Russian Money Helped Pay for Golf Courses and Other Projects\n\nIn the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery.

He also lobbied the president to meet privately \u201cin an informal setting\u201d with the Emirates\u2019 military commander and de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan; to back the U.A.E.\u2019s hawkish policies in the region; and to fire Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.\n\nA copy of Mr. Broidy\u2019s memorandum about the meeting was provided to The New York Times by someone critical of the Emirati influence in Washington.\n\nMr. Trump has closely allied himself with the Emiratis, endorsing their strong support for the new heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia, as well as their confrontational approaches toward Iran and their neighbor Qatar. In the case of Qatar, which is the host to a major United States military base, Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement of an Emirati- and Saudi-led blockade against that country has put him openly at odds with his secretary of state \u2014 as well as with years of American policy.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Nader, 58, made frequent trips to the White House during the early months of the Trump administration, meeting with Stephen K. Bannon and Jared Kushner to discuss American policy toward the Persian Gulf states in advance of Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, according to people familiar with the meetings. By some accounts, it was Mr. Bannon who pushed for him to gain access to White House policymakers. Others said Mr. Kushner backed him.\n\nReached by phone last month, Mr. Nader said he had dinner guests and would call back. He did not, and attempts to reach him over several weeks were unsuccessful.

Axios first reported Mr. Mueller\u2019s questioning of Mr. Nader.\n\nMr. Nader has long been a mysterious figure. In the 1990s, he presided over an unusual Washington magazine, Middle East Insight, which sometimes provided a platform for Arab, Israeli and Iranian officials to express their views to a Washington audience.\n\nOn the magazine\u2019s 15th anniversary, in 1996, a West Virginia congressman praised Mr. Nader on the floor of the House, calling him a \u201crecognized expert on the region\u201d and pointing out that the magazine had been a showcase for prominent figures such as President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, and Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\n\u201cHe always struck me as a person who really thought he should be in the eye of the storm trying to make things happen,\u201d said Frederic Hof, a former top American diplomat who knew Mr. Nader in the 1990s.\n\nLate in that decade, Mr. Nader convinced the Clinton administration that he had valuable contacts in the Syrian government and took on a secretive role trying to broker a peace deal between Israel and Syria. Working with Ronald S. Lauder, the American cosmetics magnate and prominent donor to Jewish causes, Mr. Nader shuttled between Damascus and Jerusalem, using his contacts in both capitals to try to negotiate a truce.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn the 1990s, George was a very effective under-the-radar operator in the peace process,\u201d said Martin S.

He developed close ties to national security officials in the Bush White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nErik Prince, the founder of Blackwater USA, the private security company now known as Academi, at one point hired Mr. Nader to help the company generate business deals in Iraq. In a 2010 deposition that Mr. Prince gave as part of a lawsuit against the company, Mr. Prince described Mr. Nader as a \u201cbusiness development consultant that we retained in Iraq\u201d because the company was looking for contracts with the Iraqi government.\n\nMr. Prince said that Mr. Nader was unsuccessful in getting contracts, and that senior Blackwater officials did not work directly with him.\n\n\u201cGeorge pretty much worked on his own,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the beginning of the Obama era, Mr. Nader tried to parlay his ties to the Syrian government into access to senior members of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy team, while also seeking to advance business deals with former advisers to President George W. Bush.\n\nBy the time of the 2016 election, he had become an adviser to Prince Mohammed of the U.A.E. According to people familiar with the relationship, it was around Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration that Mr. Nader first met Mr. Broidy, the Republican fund-raiser, who is a California-based investor with a strong interest in the Middle East.\n\nMr. Broidy\u2019s security company, Circinus, provides services to both United States agencies and foreign governments. Run by former American military officers, Circinus promises on its website that it \u201ccan employ personnel worldwide to provide physical force protection to individuals, groups or facilities within austere, hostile environments,\u201d as well as conducting \u201cspecialized operations, infrastructure protection and training.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy, 60, had once stumbled into legal trouble over payments to a political figure. In 2009, he agreed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge for providing $1 million in illegal gifts to New York State pension authorities, including trips, payouts and a secret investment in a film called \u201cChooch\u201d that was produced by an official\u2019s brother. In exchange for the gifts, the state pension fund invested $250 million with an Israeli-based investment management firm that Mr. Broidy had founded. He reimbursed the pension fund for $18 million in fees.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the inauguration, Mr. Nader became friendly with Mr. Broidy and introduced him to Prince Mohammed. Circinus then signed contracts with the United Arab Emirates worth several hundred million dollars, according to people familiar with the arrangement.\n\nBy Oct. 6, Mr. Broidy had evidently become close enough to both the prince and Mr. Nader to send a detailed memorandum to an encrypted email address used by Mr. Nader recounting his advocacy on the U.A.E.\u2019s behalf during the meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office amid an afternoon of stops throughout the White House.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn ally of the White House involved in one of the initiatives discussed \u2014 a counterterrorism task force \u2014 said Mr. Broidy sent the memorandum because he had been asked by the crown prince to seek the president\u2019s views on the idea. Mr. Broidy believed that the creation of the task force would aid American security, this person said.\n\nAccording to the memo, Mr. Broidy repeatedly pressed Mr. Trump to meet privately with Prince Mohammed, preferably in an informal setting outside the White House.\n\n\u201cI offered that M.B.Z. is available to come to the U.S. very soon and preferred a quiet meeting in New York or New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Nader, using the crown prince\u2019s initials. \u201cPresident Trump agreed that a meeting with M.B.Z. was a good idea.\u201d\n\nMr. Broidy wrote that he had twice told Lt.

Maybe because I was old enough, at 15, to understand, maybe because I was insistent and inconsolable about Birmingham and Dallas, but my father told me about his wartime experiences, and showed me his medals and dog tags, along with my parents\u2019 wedding photo taken June 4, 1944, two days before D-Day, my dad looking young and cool in his Army uniform, about to be shipped out.\n\nWith one exception, my father answered my questions about the war. First, why? Because we were attacked; the Japanese bombed our ships in Pearl Harbor. They attacked us; we didn\u2019t start the fight. They were fascists, he said. Dictators, tyrants. They ruled by fear, enslaving and incinerating millions of Jews and many others thought to be different by a racist ideology. Racism. I understood that word. \u201cNever again,\u201d he said, would that be allowed to happen. Never would it be forgotten. My father refused to tell me how many people he killed during the war, no matter how many times I asked. No, he said. You know enough.\n\nMy parents, as first-generation Americans, were very much the children of their own parents. All four of my grandparents arrived in our country as refugees fleeing religious and political persecution, running for their lives. They were penniless and spoke no English, but were determined to make a better life for their children and children\u2019s children (me). This was the family story, and even though I didn\u2019t speak their language, I got the message.\n\nOn April 4, 1968, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. On hearing this news young people ran into the streets in spontaneous grief and rage against the killing of a beloved leader. A month later thousands of my classmates at Columbia barricaded ourselves inside campus buildings, angry at the university\u2019s decision to build a private gym for students in a small public park separating the campus from Harlem, and protesting the university\u2019s involvement in Vietnam War research for the military. The unending violence of the war, the point-blank murders of civilians that we saw on TV, the murder of an African American hero: With our bodies we said \u201cenough.\u201d I was arrested with about 800 other students in April 1968 for criminal trespass in a campus building.\n\nWhat we did at Columbia wasn\u2019t the first major student strike of that era; Howard University students deserve credit for being the first. But we were both early to student antiwar activism, which grew into an enormous movement of young people that eventually helped end the Vietnam War.\n\nIt took way too long. Nearly 60,000 American soldiers died. Three million Vietnamese were killed. More bombs were dropped on Vietnam than in the entirety of World War II. Why? For what? Who attacked whom? What ever happened to \u201cnever again?\u201d\n\nMaybe we students should have done more to end the war sooner. More demonstrations, more sit-ins, more tying up traffic and bringing normal life to a standstill until the war stopped. We were young and idealistic; we said \u201cenough\u201d to the slaughtering of innocents in our name, and raged against the politicians who were too timid or too corrupt, to stand up for what was right. Who refused to learn. Our country was awash in uncontrollable violence, and unable to change.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it did, eventually.

Virginia did not just have a bad day. The Cavaliers were exploited by an aggressive and hot-shooting Maryland-Baltimore County team that capitalized on Virginia\u2019s few perceived vulnerabilities. One could only think that Villanova had to look closely at itself a couple of times before taking the court on Saturday.\n\nIn the end, the Wildcats were fine against ninth-seeded Alabama, winning handily, 81-58, and advancing to the round of 16 out of the East Region.\n\nThey had gone into halftime ahead by 5 but started the second half by going 8 of 11 from 3-point range, blowing open the game.

There have been concerns about its size, its interior physicality and its ability to defend against 3-point attempts. It has quietly answered some of those questions, holding opponents to an average of just 66 points on 30 percent 3-point shooting in the last seven games (all wins).\n\nIn that sense, the Wildcats appear better balanced than the offensively challenged Cavaliers, whose pace and discipline on offense came back to bite them, particularly when they were facing a second-half deficit. They were fifth in the nation in 3-point attempts, and if those shots do not fall on a given day, it can haunt them.\n\nBut Villanova passed the first test on Saturday: It became the first No. 1 seed to reach the second weekend so far.

But the door was certainly left open for future debate.\n\nIn the simplest terms, a player has to catch the ball, land in bounds, and then do something that demonstrates he has control of the ball.\n\nThe new definition is similar in spirit to what was previously on the books, but both the main rule and its attached notes were rewritten significantly in hopes of clarifying things for players, officials and fans. The terminology now states that a catch will have occurred if a player, who is in bounds:\n\n(a) secures control of the ball in his hands or arms before the ball touches the ground; and (b) touches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands; and (c) after (a) and (b) have been fulfilled, performs any act common to the game (e.g., tucks the ball away, extends it toward or over the goal line or the first-down line, takes an additional step, turns upfield, or avoids or wards off an opponent), or maintains control of the ball long enough to do so.\n\nThe N.F.L. removed the stipulation that a player who has satisfied those three criteria must also survive \u201cgoing to the ground\u201d with the ball.

Twice the visitors have claimed it, with the Cubs taking the middle crown, in 2016, and then following up with a long-awaited World Series victory. Last season was more of a struggle \u2014 the Cubs had a losing record at the All-Star break and fell by 11 wins over all, to 92-70.\n\nYet they took over first place for good in late July, outscored their opponents by 127 runs in the second half, and outlasted Washington in their division series. Now they look even better, with three starters who were not with the team a year ago: Yu Darvish and Tyler Chatwood, who arrived as free agents, and Jose Quintana, who thrived after a midseason trade from the White Sox. Brandon Morrow has replaced Wade Davis as the closer.\n\nIf Maddon\u2019s buzzword is art, Theo Epstein\u2019s is stuff.\n\n\u201cWhile the league has been getting more and more stuff \u2014 more velo, more ridiculous breaking stuff \u2014 we\u2019ve been regressing toward more average stuff,\u201d said Epstein, the Cubs\u2019 president of baseball operations. \u201cWe have really talented pitchers, but just in terms of raw stuff, we haven\u2019t quite kept up with the competition. That\u2019s not the be-all, end-all \u2014 there\u2019s a big difference between stuff and pitching \u2014 but you don\u2019t want to get too big a gap there. If you look at all of them, Darvish, Chatwood and Morrow all have excellent stuff, among other things they bring, so I think that\u2019ll help us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the lowest E.R.A. in baseball over the last three years, but we haven\u2019t done it with dominant, overwhelming stuff. Especially the last couple of years, it\u2019s regressed a little bit. I think it\u2019ll just be nice to have a little more stuff, a little bit more margin for error, and then try to pitch and execute game plans, disrupt timing, hit our spots and everything else.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs hired Jim Hickey, formerly of Tampa Bay, to be their pitching coach, and Chili Davis, formerly of Boston, to be their hitting coach. If Hickey can harness the pitchers\u2019 raw stuff, and Davis can coax more contact from an offense that finished second to Colorado in runs scored in the N.L. last year, the Cubs should return to the World Series.\n\nEven so, their Central division rivals will not make it easy. The St. Louis Cardinals seem poised to return to the playoffs after an excruciating absence of two whole years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cNot being able to go to the postseason the last two years, you see the hunger that everyone has,\u201d said pitcher Alex Reyes, whose return from Tommy John surgery, perhaps by May, will boost the staff. \u201cThat\u2019s what the organization expects from us.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals tried to persuade Giancarlo Stanton to accept a trade to them. When he passed, they dealt for a different Miami outfielder: Marcell Ozuna, who has started in the last two All-Star Games. He instantly gives St. Louis the middle-of-the-order threat it was missing.\n\nThe Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers were the only teams in the majors last season to have a winning record but fail to qualify for the playoffs. The Brewers added outfielders Lorenzo Cain and Christian Yelich, who must help on offense and defense because the rotation still looks shaky beyond Chase Anderson and Zach Davies.\n\n\u201cWe talk about the run prevention unit, so part of that is pitching, and part of it is defense,\u201d General Manager David Stearns said. \u201cWe think our defense got better with our acquisitions, and we think frankly our pitching got better with some of our acquisitions.\u201d\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates are not exactly starting over, but they traded their best hitter (Andrew McCutchen) and best starter (Gerrit Cole), so it\u2019s hard to expect a winning season. The Cincinnati Reds made no changes to a rotation that contributed to the N.L.\u2019s worst earned run average (5.17) last year, so a fourth consecutive 90-loss season seems likely.\n\nThe West\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have a better streak to preserve: They have won the N.L. West five seasons in a row, and should do so again. It\u2019s easy to forget just how close they came to beating the Astros in the World Series. Consider these unlikely events: Kenley Jansen blowing a save in Game 2, Clayton Kershaw squandering a four-run lead in Game 5 and Darvish getting shelled in both of his starts.\n\nBaseball 2018 Predictions Tyler Kepner makes his picks for the season. Teams are listed in predicted order of finish. American League East: Yankees, Orioles (wild card), Red Sox, Blue Jays, Rays A.L. Central: Indians, Twins (wild card), Royals, White Sox, Tigers A.L. West: Astros, Angels, Athletics, Mariners, Rangers National League East: Nationals, Phillies, Mets, Braves, Marlins N.L. Central: Cubs, Cardinals (wild card), Brewers, Pirates, Reds N.L. West: Dodgers, Diamondbacks (wild card), Rockies, Padres, Giants World Series: Astros over Cubs A.L. M.V.P.: Carlos Correa, Astros A.L. Cy Young: Chris Sale, Red Sox A.L. Rookie of the Year: Shohei Ohtani, Angels N.L. M.V.P.: Paul Goldschmidt, Diamondbacks N.L. Cy Young: Stephen Strasburg, Nationals N.L. Rookie of the Year: Ronald Acuna, Braves\n\n\u201cSometimes you just have to tip your cap to the opposition,\u201d General Manager Farhan Zaidi said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the greatest, maybe only, solace in the whole World Series experience: We lost to a very deserving team.\u201d\n\nThe Dodgers do not have as much rotation depth as they did last season, and losing Justin Turner to a broken wrist late in spring training will clearly hurt. But with their ingenuity and money \u2014 and the contributions, at some point, of the rookie right-hander Walker Buehler \u2014 the Dodgers should figure it out.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies both earned wild cards last season, feasting on the lowly San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants, who both improved over the winter. Despite a few departures, one of the two \u2014 probably Arizona \u2014 should claim a wild card again.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Diamondbacks lost the majors\u2019 leader in slugging percentage, J.D. Martinez, and it\u2019s hard to expect their rotation to be as sturdy as it was last season, when all five starters made at least 25 starts. But the new outfielders Steven Souza Jr. and Jarrod Dyson should somewhat make up for losing Martinez, as catcher Alex Avila should for the loss of Chris Iannetta, who joined the Rockies.\n\nWith Charlie Blackmon, the majors\u2019 leader in total bases, facing free agency after the season, Colorado should feel an urgency to return to the playoffs. The Rockies\u2019 wild-card loss to Arizona gave them an intoxicating whiff of the postseason.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We expect to be in the playoffs. We\u2019re built really strongly and we have a lot of depth.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies spent lavishly to maintain a strong bullpen, giving a combined $106 million to Wade Davis, Bryan Shaw and Jake McGee for the next three years. Those veterans must maintain their durability to again ease the burden on a young rotation, no sure thing in an unrelenting atmosphere.\n\nThe Padres \u2014 yes, the Padres \u2014 made the largest commitment to a single free agent in the off-season, signing first baseman Eric Hosmer for eight years and $144 million. He should start seeing some of the Padres\u2019 \u201chot talent lava,\u201d as the agent Scott Boras put it, make an impact in the majors, though San Diego does not have the pitching to contend.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Giants, meanwhile, would be the easy pick to win the World Series, if only this were 2012. They won\u2019t lose 98 games for a second straight season, but they added two more over-30 boldface names \u2014 McCutchen and Evan Longoria \u2014 to a roster that already has too many.\n\nThe East\n\nIn the East division, the Washington Nationals should run away with their fifth title in seven seasons. Dave Martinez signed on as their fourth manager in that span, but the Nationals\u2019 problem in escaping the first round of the postseason just might be their players \u2014 or plain old bad luck. Still, while Washington\u2019s well-rounded roster looks all but flawless, we can\u2019t expect this team to break through to the N.L.C.S. until we finally see it.\n\nTo emphasize the idea of getting over the hump, Martinez \u2014 a former bench coach for Maddon who shares his old boss\u2019s creativity \u2014 imported three camels from a nearby petting zoo to inspire the team one morning in spring training.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy message to them is, \u2018Hey, when we get there, it\u2019s just playing one more game,\u2019 \u201d Martinez said. \u201cOne more game. It\u2019ll be Game 163, 164, 165, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re good enough to finish this out. They know that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies lost 96 games last season, but they liked what they saw in late summer from young players like Rhys Hoskins, Scott Kingery, J.P. Crawford, Nick Williams and Jorge Alfaro. A team that had just one player signed to a long-term contract then added four through free agency: starter Jake Arrieta, first baseman Carlos Santana and relievers Tommy Hunter and Pat Neshek. The message was clear.\n\n\u201cIf the young players really do take a step forward this year,\u201d General Manager Matt Klentak said, \u201cwe\u2019ve invested in areas that support them.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Phillies probably lack the rotation depth to finish much higher than .500, and who knows what kind of rotation the Mets will have. As usual, the talent is there but the health history is concerning. The new manager, Mickey Callaway, will modernize the team\u2019s approach to pitching and injury prevention, which makes sense. But counting on a roster with such a dubious health history \u2014 and questionable defensive skills \u2014 does not.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves enter the fourth year of their rebuild, and the first under a new general manager, Alex Anthopoulos, who will use this season to evaluate the team\u2019s young players. Soon, the Braves must start adding talent to maximize the prime of their star first baseman, Freddie Freeman. But that time is not now.\n\nOne thing is certain this season: The longest N.L. playoff drought will continue. The Miami Marlins, who haven\u2019t made it since 2003, actually outscored the Dodgers last season. But with a threadbare pitching staff and farm system, the Marlins\u2019 new ownership revived the franchise tradition of slashing payroll and trading for prospects.\n\nThe chairman, Derek Jeter, never experienced a losing record in his 20 seasons starring for the Yankees. He knows how things look in Miami, but concedes nothing.\n\n\u201cPeople just automatically assume that we\u2019re not going to win,\u201d Jeter said. \u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018rebuild\u2019 because there\u2019s a negative connotation to that. We\u2019re building something. You never put in the mind of your players or your teammates that it\u2019s O.K. to lose. It\u2019s not O.K. to lose. You go compete.\u201d\n\nWhatever their record, Jeter insisted, the Marlins will reflect his values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play the game the right way, we\u2019re going to be professionals, we\u2019re going to play hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of the Marlins, you will be proud of the players that we put on the field.\u201d", "title": "N.L.

He has had 11 interceptions in his career.\n\nAt least one player was eager to have Mathieu as a teammate:\n\nSam Bradford and Teddy Bridgewater Headed in Different Directions\n\nWhere they went: All three of the Vikings\u2019 quarterbacks are on their way to new teams. Besides Case Keenum going to the Broncos (see below), multiple media sources say Teddy Bridgewater will sign with the Jets and Sam Bradford with the Cardinals.\n\nBridgewater was once an ascending star who was expected to lead the Vikings to the promised land and, when his knee exploded before the 2016 season, Bradford was the quarterback Minnesota traded two draft picks to acquire.\n\nWhat that means: Bradford, 30, has occasionally shown signs of why he was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft, but he has also dealt with fairly serious injuries. He inherits a Cardinals team that was a contender with Carson Palmer on the field over the last few years but fairly bad without him. If Bradford can stay injury-free, there is the potential for a good fit, but it will be an uphill climb in the competitive N.F.C. West. The stakes are lower for the 25-year-old Bridgewater, who has attempted just two passes in the two seasons since his devastating knee injury (both fell incomplete). He looked great in 2015, and has youth on his side, but the Jets are also bringing back Josh McCown, and have enough question marks on the team\u2019s roster to ease the pressure on Bridgewater\u2019s comeback.\n\nJoe Thomas Retires\n\nOne of the best left tackles in N.F.L. history, Joe Thomas of the Cleveland Browns, has chosen to retire after 11 seasons. The decision is not entirely unexpected, as he sustained a devastating injury to his triceps last season and has nothing left to prove on the field, but there is now a gaping hole on the offensive line of a team that has been making serious moves to get back to respectability this off-season.\n\n\u201cMy mind is good, but my body is not willing,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nWith six first-team All-Pro selections, and 10 Pro Bowl appearances, as well as a reputation as one of the most durable linemen to ever play the game, Thomas is nearly a lock for Hall of Fame induction as soon as he is eligible.\n\nPhoto\n\nMalcolm Butler Headed to Titans\n\nWhere he went: Malcolm Butler appears committed to joining the Titans after four years in New England. A 28-year-old cornerback, he will be paid like a top defensive back even after a rocky end to his career with the Patriots.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat that means: Butler was once the hero of a Super Bowl victory thanks to a last-minute interception and had developed into one of the game\u2019s better cornerbacks in just his third year, but a poor end to the 2017 season and a bizarre demotion to the bench for last year\u2019s Super Bowl made him a bit of a wild card heading into free agency. Butler is not old enough to have lost a step, and the Titans clearly believe he just needed a change of scenery. But the Patriots are known for getting rid of players at just the right time \u2014 if occasionally a year early \u2014 so he is far from a sure thing to succeed.\n\nJerick McKinnon to 49ers\n\nWhere he went: The 49ers were quick to announce that running back Jerick McKinnon, formerly of the Vikings, had agreed to join the team. ESPN has reported that his deal will be worth up to $30 million over four years.\n\nWhat that means: McKinnon will replace Carlos Hyde, who is signing with the Cleveland Browns.\n\nDrafted by the Vikings in the third round out of Georgia Southern in 2014, McKinnon started his career as a backup to Adrian Peterson. Last season, he got a chance for a bigger role when the rookie Dalvin Cook was injured and responded with his best season, 570 yards rushing and 421 receiving, both career highs.\n\nAlong with Latavius Murray, he provided an effective rushing attack that helped send the Vikings to the conference championship game, and the 49ers have added some protection for him on the offensive line with the signing of Weston Richburg, a center and guard who had previously been with the Giants.\n\nPhoto\n\nJordy Nelson Out, Jimmy Graham In for Green Bay\n\nWhere he might go: It is too soon to know which teams Jordy Nelson might be interested in joining, since the Packers did not announce his release until 5 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday, but there will surely be suitors lined up for the 32-year-old wide receiver. The New England Patriots were immediately identified as a potential destination by several pundits.\n\nWhat that means: After a down year in which he had just 53 catches for 482 yards, Nelson became expendable to the Packers. The fact that his release will give the team $10.2 million in cap space was certainly the deciding factor considering the respect he commands in an out of the Packers organization. In the announcement of Nelson\u2019s release, Packers General Manager Brian Gutekunst said \u201cJordy will always be a member of the Packers family and we look forward to his eventual induction into the Packers Hall of Fame.\u201d Nelson is expected to put off that induction by signing with another team, and just a year removed from a season in which he had 1,257 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns, it is reasonable to think that he still has something to offer.\n\nWith some money freed up, the Packers are believed to have reached an agreement with Jimmy Graham, a five-time Pro Bowler at tight end, who had 57 catches for 520 yards and 10 touchdowns last season with the Seattle Seahawks. The 31-year-old was a favorite target for Drew Brees in New Orleans, had a good rapport with Russell Wilson in Seattle, and will now get a chance to catch passes from another top-shelf quarterback in Aaron Rodgers.\n\nPhoto\n\nKirk Cousins Could Be Vikings\u2019 Franchise QB\n\nWhere he went: The team has yet to issue a formal announcement, but Kirk Cousins, the 29-year-old quarterback, has chosen the Minnesota Vikings as his new home after having entered unrestricted free agency following a few years of being kept in Washington thanks to the franchise tag. After three full seasons as a starter for the Redskins Cousins was a unicorn of sorts as a franchise quarterback in his 20s who was able to choose to play wherever he\u2019d like. As a result, his asking price was extraordinarily high, with multiple media reports indicating he has agreed to a three-year deal for $84 million, all of which is guaranteed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat that means: The Vikings nearly made the Super Bowl with Keenum as their starting quarterback. Cousins, who has thrown for more than 13,000 yards and 81 touchdowns over the last three seasons, represents a fairly substantial upgrade. There are those who point toward Cousins\u2019s 26-30-1 career record as a starter as a potential warning sign, but he has consistently played on a team with a subpar defense, and that will not be a problem in Minnesota. Cousins would also enjoy a deeper supporting cast on offense, with a pair of star receivers in Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, a rock solid tight end in Kyle Rudolph, and a potential star in Dalvin Cook, a second-year running back who had a good start to the 2017 season before missing the final 12 games of the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTrumaine Johnson Chooses Jets\n\nWhere he went: Trumaine Johnson, a 28-year-old cornerback, is walking away from the Los Angeles Rams after six seasons and will be part of the rebuilding process with the Jets.\n\nWhat that means: It is slightly surprising for one of the biggest prizes of the off-season to end up with the Jets, a team that had to overachieve to go 5-11 last season. But the Jets should certainly benefit from adding a defensive back squarely in his prime who has 18 career interceptions, three of which he returned for touchdowns. The question is if they can be a contending team while he is still at the top of his game.\n\nCase Keenum Out to Prove Himself With Broncos\n\nWhere he went: His regular season success, and a postseason touchdown throw that will be remembered for decades, were not enough to earn him the full-time job in Minnesota, so Keenum agreed to terms with the Denver Broncos to take over as that team\u2019s starting quarterback, with the signing officially announced by the team on Wednesday.\n\nWhat that means: The Broncos won the Super Bowl as recently as the 2015 season, but the retirement of Peyton Manning after his second Super Bowl title left the team without a reliable starting quarterback. That led to two years of missing the playoffs as the once-terrific defense slowly withered away. Enter Keenum, who had been stamped with the label of journeyman backup until last season, but will now be asked to prove that his 11-2 record as a starter in 2017 was not a fluke. There is plenty of statistical evidence to show that Keenum earned his success last season, but stepping away from the talent-ridden Vikings could make him suddenly appear far more pedestrian.\n\nDrew Brees Staying in New Orleans\n\nWhat that means: The 17-year veteran lasted a few hours as a free agent before the Saints did what everyone expected, bringing him back on a two-year deal that will most likely ensure that he finishes his career in New Orleans. While Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara both had fantastic seasons, leading to much more diversity in the Saints offense, Brees was still the team\u2019s engine, throwing for more than 4,000 passing yards for the 12th consecutive season. His 23 touchdown passes were the fewest he had thrown since 2005, but the 39-year-old can still get the job done.\n\nPhoto\n\nAndrew Norwell Upgrades Jacksonville\u2019s Line\n\nWhere he went: Several news media reports indicate that Andrew Norwell, a guard, will sign with the Jaguars on the largest contract ever for a player of his position. He is also expected to break records for average money per season and guaranteed money.\n\nWhat that means: The Carolina Panthers were unwilling to pay money more typically associated with offensive tackles to a guard, but the Jaguars saw a good fit for the first-team All-Pro player. He immediately upgrades Jacksonville\u2019s line and should make life considerably easier for Leonard Fournette, the team\u2019s rookie running back who had 1,040 rushing yards and nine touchdowns as a rookie despite inconsistent work from the team\u2019s interior linemen.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAllen Robinson, on the Comeback Trail, Leaves Jaguars\n\nWhere he went: It is expected that Allen Robinson, a 24-year-old wide receiver, will sign a three-year deal with the Bears, where he will try to aid in the development of the team\u2019s young quarterback, Mitchell Trubisky.\n\nWhat that means: Robinson was well on his way to being considered a top-flight receiver after he finished the 2015 season with 80 catches for 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns. He slowed down some in 2016, and missed all but one game in 2017 because of a torn A.C.L., but he is still young and, at 6 feet 3 inches and 220 pounds, he provides a big target for Trubisky.\n\nPhoto\n\nSammy Watkins Makes the Speedy Chiefs Even Faster\n\nWhere he went: All signs are pointing toward Sammy Watkins, the 24-year-old wide receiver, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs after just one season with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nWhat that means: He has not quite lived up to the hype generated by his sophomore season in 2015, but Watkins had bursts of production for the Rams last season, and he gives the Chiefs another burner on offense alongside Tyreek Hill and Kareem Hunt. Kansas City\u2019s offense may be fairly inconsistent as Patrick Mahomes gets used to the starting quarterback job, but the strong-armed Mahomes should not have to worry about overthrowing many players this year.\n\nDanny Amendola Leaving Patriots\n\nWhere he went: Danny Amendola, an undersized 32-year-old wide receiver, is on the verge of signing with the Miami Dolphins, where he is expected to be one of two additions to a new-look offense along with Albert Wilson, formerly of the Chiefs.\n\nWhat that means: Amendola was a fan favorite and a frequent target for Tom Brady in the passing game, but the oft-injured receiver has never had production that matched his level of fame. Last season was just the third time in his nine seasons that Amendola played in as many as 15 games, but he did well with that opportunity, catching 61 passes for 659 yards. The highlight of his season was putting up 152 receiving yards in New England\u2019s loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LII. The thought of a breakout season at this point for the former Texas Tech star is a little unrealistic, but he can make a big play on occasion, which could prove useful for Miami. Wilson, at 25, has more potential for career growth, but he is also much less of a sure thing.\n\nRichard Sherman Joins 49ers\n\nWhere he went: As has been known for a few days, Richard Sherman, the 29-year old cornerback who has starred for the Seattle Seahawks for the last seven seasons, is headed to San Francisco to bring a veteran presence to a youthful team.\n\nWhat that means: Sherman is working his way back from a tear of his Achilles\u2019 tendon, but the 49ers must have been confident that he can regain his explosiveness since they have agreed to pay him $13 million in 2018. The contract is structured to help the team if Sherman does not perform, but he will bring intelligence and swagger to a defense that is still firmly in rebuilding mode.", "title": "NFL Free Agency Updates: Tyrann Mathieu, Jordy Nelson, Kirk Cousins and More", "authors": ["Benjamin Hoffman"]}

But they remain divided on more difficult issues, including rules for the auto industry. Given that impasse, the talks appear likely to drag on.

What\u2019s next?\n\nAnxieties in the stock market re-emerged last week, after President Trump\u2019s promise on Thursday that he would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But at the same time, the slip in the stock market boosted prices for safe bonds, keeping a lid on yields. Those rising yields had spooked the stock market in early February, when data showed wages rising at a faster-than-expected pace. Another jobs report is coming out this week, and it may show whether those wage pressures continued to build in February. That could reignite fears of inflation and a quickening pace of rate increases by the Federal Reserve, providing another reason for stocks to fall.

The defendants include current and former oil executives, among them Claudio Descalzi, Eni\u2019s chief executive. The case stems from a long-running investigation by Italian prosecutors into a payment the companies made to the Nigerian government in 2011 to settle a legal dispute over a potentially lucrative tract in the Atlantic Ocean known as OPL 245.

{"date": "2018-03-06 00:00:00", "text": "Involuntary commitment laws balance the rights of people with mental illness and protection of the public, and the standard for commitment is that the person presents an \u201cimmediate danger to self or others.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet the immediacy criteria.\n\nThere\u2019s debate over this provision. In New York, we have a law \u2014 Kendra\u2019s Law \u2014 that allows for broader inclusionary criteria so that, for example, commitment can be based on a person\u2019s history of noncompliance in treatment.

These were reasonable decisions from her point of view, because she saw herself as the star student and not as mentally ill or a substance abuser.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe minute anyone said, \u201cYou need treatment,\u201d they got onto the list of people she\u2019d never engage with again.

I\u2019m being pragmatic. If commitment is the right thing to do, then let\u2019s do it, take the person to Bellevue, and get meds \u2014 that\u2019s fine. But many people in these circumstances need other options.\n\nWhy do so many people like this end up homeless or in jail? Is it the lack of beds, or the law?\n\nThere is overrepresentation of people with serious mental problems on streets who then end up in jail. If someone has a mental illness and they\u2019re not working, and they lose their housing \u2014 then unless they have someone to help, they\u2019re at high risk for homelessness. Once you\u2019re broke and on the street, there\u2019s no way you can come up with the first month\u2019s rent and a security deposit for an apartment. You\u2019re not getting back into housing.\n\nAnd yet many programs that try to help require treatment first, before anything else. In this case, if you managed to get her to a hospital for treatment, or involuntarily committed \u2014 well, as soon as she\u2019s out, that\u2019s the end of that relationship.\n\nUnder New York law, what is the procedure by which a person like Ms. Williams, who\u2019s putting herself at risk, could be treated involuntarily?\n\nYou would have to make the case by petitioning the mental health court in a hospital. This can be a family member, or a member of a treatment team \u2014 one of the mobile teams, who have been trying to get her treatment \u2014 would have to make that case that she\u2019d been noncompliant with the treatment and is a danger to herself.\n\nAnd sometimes that kind of intervention is effective. The order allows you to bring the person back into the hospital if they\u2019re not taking their meds. On the risk side, it creates an adversarial relationship. You\u2019re supposed to be helping this person, and yet you have the authority to yank her back to the hospital when things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nIs there a better way to balance people\u2019s right to make their own choices and their health?\n\nI would ask: Why do we have homelessness to begin with? Why is it that even this woman, a graduate of Williams, ends up on street? How is it that we don\u2019t do something about that first? More mental health treatment is not going to help people find a place to live.\n\nThe idea of choice is intimately connected to radical acceptance of another person\u2019s point of view: whose choices matter most, and whose are most effective in solving this problem.\n\nPeople can\u2019t imagine this woman living in her own apartment. But she stayed with a friend in Brooklyn, on the couch, and did fine. And she navigated her way to California, and to Washington D.C.

During her two-season tenure with that team, there was some speculation that she might be an heir apparent for Karl, but after two leaves of absence, which were not explained by the team at the time, she went back to her broadcasting career.\n\nDespite some reports of turmoil with the team, Lieberman credited the ownership and coaches with being willing to follow the lead of the San Antonio Spurs, who had hired Becky Hammon as an assistant.

(He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)\n\nMost ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.\n\n\u201cI would have to see who\u2019s running,\u201d said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.\n\nAnd on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who\u2019d prefer to clear out the party\u2019s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers \u2014 the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.\n\nAnd Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a woman at the table,\u201d she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.\n\nPhoto\n\nDemonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.\n\n\u201cI am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.\n\n\u201cIf I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,\u201d she said.\n\nEven as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.\n\nYet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.\n\n\u201cA lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,\u201d Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: \u201cShe\u2019s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she\u2019s really been above it all.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHaving Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,\u201d said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi \u201churts our candidates\u201d in competitive districts.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that \u201cI have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.\u201d\n\nMs. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as \u201csoon to be speaker again.\u201d\n\nMr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him \u2014 a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was \u201cfocused on taking back the House.\u201d\n\nPart of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi\u2019s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the leverage of party leaders,\u201d Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.\n\nThe most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.\n\n\u201cI think it will be left up to the new membership,\u201d said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should \u201cwork their will.\u201d That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb\u2019s approach.\n\nAt least three of the Democrats\u2019 \u201cred to blue\u201d candidates \u2014 recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. \u2014 have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a \u201cnew generation of leadership.\u201d In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said \u201cthere\u2019s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was \u201cbadly needed\u201d and lamented leaders who are \u201ctoxic in this part of the country.\u201d\n\nBut there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi\u2019s \u201cinability to express a vision for the party.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.\n\n\u201cI have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo matter what candidate you are, it\u2019s not necessarily a bad message.\u201d", "title": "Nancy Pelosi Wants to Lead.

{"date": "2018-03-27 00:00:00", "text": "The standard is so difficult to meet that few defendants who present an insanity defense win at trial, even when they have long, documented histories of psychosis. Only six people were found at trial to be not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect between 2007 and 2016, out of 5,111 murder cases, according to the state Division of Criminal Justice Services. The state does not track how often the defense is raised.\n\nProsecutors typically argue that the insanity claim is a ruse invented after the crime and seize on any evidence of a cover-up, or that the killing was planned, to argue the defendant knew it was wrong.\n\n\u201cProsecutors are very adept at showing that the defendant engaged in some rational behavior, that they planned the attack in some way, or they did things to escape detection or made up a story,\u201d said Peter L. Arenella, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who studies insanity cases. \u201cThis shows that even if they were mentally ill, they still understood what was wrong.\u201d\n\nDefense lawyers typically focus on the defendant\u2019s history of mental illness, stressing his irrational worldview and the inexplicable nature of the crime.\n\nIn the end, the trials become battles between mental health experts hired by both sides, who, using the same set of facts, come to opposite conclusions about the defendant\u2019s capacity to understand his acts at the moment of the crime.\n\nThe first salvo came on Tuesday, when a psychiatrist for the defense, Dr. Karen Rosenbaum, testified that Ms. Ortega told her in a series of interviews that the devil was \u201cpossessing her more and more\u201d in the months before the killings. She said Ms. Ortega also heard voices that \u201ctold her to kill people, to kill herself and, eventually, to kill the children.\u201d\n\nAs a rule, jurors tend to be skeptical of insanity claims like Ms. Ortega\u2019s, because they worry about being duped and releasing a dangerous person into the world, experts on the defense say.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrederick L. Sosinsky, a Manhattan defense lawyer who has argued insanity in two murder cases, said jurors often had a preconceived notion of what a person experiencing psychotic episodes looks like, expecting him to be \u201cincoherent, mumbling, almost catatonic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look anything like that,\u2019 he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on in the mind.\u201d Often, he said, the most important factor for jurors is how the defendant strikes them in the first videotaped police interrogation.\n\nIn Ms. Ortega\u2019s case, even before the start of trial, potential jurors struggled with the idea of having to determine her state of mind at the time of the murders. One prospective juror said she could not understand why Ms. Ortega \u201cwould try to kill herself without knowing she did something wrong.\u201d\n\nAnother said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t decide someone\u2019s sanity or not. How could you ask me?\u201d\n\nThe hurdles facing the defense were evident in court on Monday, when a neighbor of the Krims, called by the defense to testify about seeing Ms. Ortega with the children just before the murder, suddenly shouted, \u201cI am angry because this is not a case of mental illness.\u201d\n\nOnce in a while the defense is persuasive. In 2015, a Manhattan jury determined that Alejandro Morales, who had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia, was not criminally responsible for the 2010 fatal stabbing of a 9-year-old boy inside of his mother\u2019s Upper West Side apartment.\n\nMr. Morales had delusions that he was being chased by giant rats and gang members in the days before the murder. Jurors agreed he lacked the capacity to know that killing the boy was wrong, even though, as prosecutors pointed out, he fled the apartment, hid the knife and lied to the police. He was later committed to a secure psychiatric hospital.\n\nJurors more often opt to convict in cases with defendants with serious mental illnesses. David Tarloff was a schizophrenic man from Queens who suffered from delusions about communicating with God and had been committed to a mental hospital numerous times. He was found guilty in 2013 of killing Kathryn Faughey, a Manhattan psychologist, with a mallet and a knife during a robbery attempt. He had told doctors the Lord had sanctioned the robbery.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

He had attempted suicide several times and was on medication for depression and schizophrenia.\n\nMr. McLean\u2019s lawyer, Lynn Calvacca, said her client was clearly mentally ill, but the prosecution focused on evidence that he covered up the crime, hiding his mother\u2019s remains and telling police he did not know where she was. The jury determined Mr. McLean knew he was committing an immoral act, even if the brutality of the murder reflected a diseased mind, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere is no way a reasonable person could say that what this guy did was sane,\u201d Ms. Calvacca said. \u201cHe cut off his mother\u2019s head and took a selfie with it.\u201d\n\nJurors often have trouble finding a person \u201cnot responsible,\u201d for a horrific act he admits committing, defense lawyers said. Many jurors also balk at sending a defendant to a mental hospital rather than prison, fearing he might eventually be released on a doctor\u2019s recommendation.\n\nIn practice, judges typically send such defendants to one of the state\u2019s two secure psychiatric hospitals, where they are ordered to be held until doctors deem them no longer to be dangerous, and a judge agrees. Many judges and mental health professionals are loath to free a known killer, and the majority spend more time locked up than they would have served had they pleaded guilty to manslaughter or second-degree murder.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very tough to get out,\u201d said Charles P. Ewing, a forensic psychologist and law professor. \u201cIt rarely happens. They don\u2019t want the responsibility of releasing someone who goes out and commits another offense.\u201d\n\nStill, some murder defendants who were found not responsible by reason of insanity do eventually earn release to outpatient care, state health officials said. According to the state Office of Mental Health, 416 defendants charged with a homicide offense but found not responsible have been released from the state\u2019s maximum-security hospitals to highly supervised outpatient care since 1980.\n\nThe modern insanity defense has long been polemical, and the legal standards vary from state to state. Kansas, Montana, Idaho and Utah have abolished the defense altogether. Other states have adopted a \u201cguilty but mentally ill\u201d verdict. But most states, among them New York, use a variation of the legal test derived from the 1843 case of Daniel M\u2019Naghten, an English lunatic who killed a secretary to Prime Minister Robert Peel.\n\nIn the United States. the insanity defense sparked a national uproar after a jury acquitted John Hinckley Jr. in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan. In response, Congress in 1984 shifted the burden of proving insanity to the defense in federal cases, and a majority of states, including New York, followed suit, making it much harder for defendants to prevail.\n\nIn Ms. Ortega\u2019s trial, the prosecutors, Stuart Silberg and Courtney Groves, have argued that there is little evidence Ms. Ortega experienced anything more serious than mild depression and anxiety before the murders.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, the prosecution has asserted that Ms. Ortega killed the children because she was angry at their mother, Marina Krim, for giving her additional housework and for asking her to work part time for a friend.\n\nThey have highlighted statements Ms. Ortega made to a psychologist three days before the murders and to a psychiatrist the week afterward, complaining about her workload and how Ms. Krim treated her.\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2012, Ms. Krim returned home to her apartment at about 5:30 p.m. with her middle child in tow and discovered her other two children stabbed to death in the bathroom. Ms. Ortega plunged a knife into her own neck when Ms. Krim opened the door.\n\nBut Ms. Ortega\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Van Leer-Greenberg, contends Ms. Ortega has suffered from depression, psychotic thinking and hallucinations since her teens, and never received treatment until after her arrest.\n\nTwo of Ms. Ortega\u2019s sisters have described in court how she went into deep depression twice, the first time in 1978 after another sister died unexpectedly and again in 2008 after a cousin shot himself on the balcony of her family home. She became a paranoid shut-in for months, hiding under the bed whenever a dog barked, they said.\n\nMs. Ortega was unraveling in the month before the murders, the sisters, Miladys Garcia and Delci Ortega, testified. Three days before the killings, she woke up in the middle of the night and began throwing pots and pans around the kitchen, but later had no recollection of it, Delci Ortega said.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s testimony, Dr. Rosenbaum said Ms. Ortega would bang on pots and pans to dispel her hallucinations about the devil possessing her. She never told the Krims of her visions or of the voices telling her to hurt people, the doctor said, because she feared being fired and \u201cdidn\u2019t want people to know she is crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe struggled \u2014 she didn\u2019t want to carry out the plans,\u201d Dr. Rosenbaum said.

She went on to say Ms. Krim had prevented her from keeping an appointment with a psychologist.\n\nDr. Dubin said Ms. Ortega said nothing about having visual hallucinations or hearing voices during that first interview, nor did she suggest she had delusions.\n\nYet over the next three weeks, he said, as Ms. Ortega recovered from surgery and started taking antidepressants and antipsychotic medication, she did start to report to psychiatrists that she was hearing disembodied voices. On Nov. 16, she reported that those voices told her \u201cwe are going to kill a lot of people,\u201d according to hospital records. She also started expressing a paranoid belief that people in the hospital were trying to kill her.\n\nDr. Dubin said he finally gave Ms. Ortega the diagnosis of \u201cmajor depression with psychotic features\u201d after a second interview on Nov. 20.

She looked overwhelmed at times by Osaka, and particularly helpless against those W.W.S.D. serves, both out wide and down the middle.\n\nOsaka scored six of her seven aces in the second set and saved the only two break points Williams could muster in the match. Williams had several egregious unforced errors, capped by her driving an easy forehand approach shot well long.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter the loss, Williams skipped a mandatory post-match news conference. It is uncommon for players, including Williams, to skip such duties after a match, even after a lopsided loss, and Williams could face a fine for her absence.\n\nBut Osaka was more than happy to discuss a win that had so much meaning for her.\n\nShe said her goal was merely to impress Williams, which she most likely did, and said she would have been happy to force Williams to yell out, \u201cCome on,\u201d at least once, an indication that Williams was engaged in a tense competition with a worthy opponent.\n\n\u201cSometimes she plays matches where she doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Come on,\u2019 at all, and that\u2019s a little bit sad, because you think, \u2018Do you think she\u2019s trying?\u2019\u201d Osaka said.\n\nBut Williams\u2019s effort on Wednesday was clearly not enough, and fans were hoping for a more competitive match at what was Williams\u2019s final appearance at the Miami Open on Key Biscayne.

She also had beaten four former Grand Slam champions on her way to the final: Sloane Stephens, Caroline Wozniacki, Angelique Kerber and Venus Williams.\n\nBut she said she never had felt more nervous.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why in Charleston I was able to go on court and forget about these things, but today was a different story,\u201d Kasatkina said.\n\nHer internal battle was not immediately apparent. Both players showed flashes early of the form that had brought them this far. When Kasatkina was serving at 3-4, her topspin forehand suddenly become a liability. She made five errors off that wing in the next seven points, and Osaka soon had the first set in hand. She broke Kasatkina again to start the second.", "title": "Naomi Osaka Wins at Indian Wells for Her First WTA Title", "authors": []}
