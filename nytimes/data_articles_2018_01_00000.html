{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "A counterargument to the idea that young women ought to just extricate themselves from sexual situations in which they aren\u2019t having any fun soon circulated, maintaining that the culture conditions them to acquiesce, to prioritize the needs of others before their own. \u201cIt feels paralyzing to assert ourselves,\u2019\u2019 Jill Filipovic wrote in The Guardian in reaction to all of this. And yet when I look around at millennial women, problems with inhibition or the ability to hang on to a healthy sense of entitlement are not the ones I am quickest to identify.\n\nA few days before the Ansari controversy erupted, some number of young women had taken to eviscerate the writer Katie Roiphe on Twitter, for a piece she was writing for Harper\u2019s Magazine, related to the movement against harassment, but still weeks away from publication.\n\nThis week, when the HLN television host Ashleigh Banfield called out Babe for the Ansari story, claiming that it threatened to dilute the crucial work of #MeToo and that Grace had merely endured a \u201cbad date,\u201d the writer of the piece, Katie Way, 22, lashed out in an email that Ms. Banfield read on air. It called her \u201ca second-wave feminist has-been,\u201d who \u201cI\u2019m certain no one under 45 has ever heard of,\u201d and went on to ridicule her hair and lipstick. And yet, Ms. Banfield suddenly had a currency she hadn\u2019t had in years.\n\nThe quiet treatment of Mathilde Krim, when stacked up against the ubiquity of Grace, ultimately reveals a strain of internet sexism that we are all complicit in perpetuating and barely address \u2014 the bestowing of outsize rewards, measured in publicity, for certain female narratives over others, for stories that invite judgments and counterjudgments, nearly always about sex and domestic complexity. Just a few days ago, a young writer, Moira Donegan, found herself anointed in the wake of a well-crafted and thoroughly absorbing essay she wrote for The Cut, in which she announced that she was the woman who had created the fabled list meant to steer women away from potentially dangerous men in the media. And yet this kind of success isn\u2019t scalable. It is nearly impossible to imagine a similar reception for a 25-year old woman who composed a powerful piece about how she came to believe in the moral necessity of, say, congestion pricing.\n\nIn the course of her career, the academic Anne-Marie Slaughter had written two books and countless scholarly articles about foreign policy, but it wasn\u2019t until she wrote a cover story in 2012 for The Atlantic \u2014 \u201cWhy Women Still Can\u2019t Have It All,\u201d about her decision to leave the State Department and spend more time at home \u2014 that she became widely known.", "title": "#MeToo and the Marketing of Female Narrative", "authors": []}

I wanted to shake her, and say, \u2018You know how this goes. Knock it off.\u2019\u201d\n\nSandy said that Betsy, who completed a highly structured treatment program and underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, seemed more motivated than Patrick to quit.\n\nAnd Betsy, who started using drugs at 19, said she suspected that Patrick had a harder time quitting because he had started when he was 14. A Surgeon General\u2019s report in 2016 said that the younger people are when they start taking drugs, the more likely they are to become addicted long-term. \u201cHis brain is still that young,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cAs intelligent as he is, this is his only coping mechanism.\u201d\n\nIt was especially difficult getting clean while her brother was still using, Betsy said, as she cuddled a frisky mutt outside the animal shelter. Now, Patrick stays with his father and Betsy lives with her mother; everyone is wary that if the siblings lived together, they could drag one another down.\n\nPhoto\n\nPatrick said Betsy had succeeded where he had not because she had found passion in her work. She saw glimpses of herself in the shelter dogs and their painful pasts; when she was 8, her parents divorced and her father was drinking. She said she sometimes had to take care of him.\n\n\u201cShe loves those dogs,\u201d Patrick said.\n\nHe said that during periods when he has been clean, he tends to take on too much, as he did last year when he signed up for multiple coding courses at community college. He said the heavy caseload left him frustrated, with failing grades. That preceded the relapse in May when he overdosed four times in a single afternoon.\n\nLike many parents in families torn apart by drugs, Sandy has blamed herself. For a time, she wondered if she was too permissive, even as she reported her children to the police and kicked them out of the house.\n\nAt Al-Anon sessions for families of alcoholics, Sandy learned what are known as the four C\u2019s \u2014 \u201cYou didn\u2019t cause it, you can\u2019t control it and you can\u2019t cure it, but you can contribute to it.\u201d She said she came to understand that she had been an enabler. \u201cEven though you think you\u2019re helping them, you\u2019re not,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow, Sandy sounds almost fatalistic about addiction.\n\n\u201cYou could be the best parent in the world, but if it\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what walk of life you come from.\u201d\n\nPatrick lives with his father, but he often feels crowded by him and visits his mother a lot, usually for supper.\n\nAs a late fall day turned to dusk, Patrick lounged on an overstuffed chair in her living room.

They drew nods of recognition when they said they finally understood why their teaspoons were vanishing from their kitchens (powdered opioids are heated in a spoon with water to convert them to a liquid that can be injected).\n\nUnlike some of the other parents, Sandy seemed battle hardened, like one who had been immersed in a war for a long time.", "title": "1 Son, 4 Overdoses, 6 Hours", "authors": ["Katharine Q.

Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter here.\n\nThe Sundance Film Festival started Thursday in Park City, Utah, where through Jan. 28 many of the year\u2019s most anticipated indie films will be making their debuts. The festival is also prohibitively expensive to attend, difficult to navigate, and is usually blisteringly cold and slushy. Opting for the couch instead? Host your own film festival, featuring these popular and influential movies from Sundance festivals past.\n\nFrances McDormand in \u201cBlood Simple.\u201d USA Films Movie Blood Simple Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 1985 Sundance was still known by its original moniker, the U.S. Film Festival (though its operation had just been assumed by the Sundance Institute), when the Coen Brothers\u2019 debut film won the Grand Jury Prize for a drama in 1985. A delightfully inventive and deliciously scuzzy riff on the classics of film noir, it takes the genre\u2019s stock characters \u2014 the honorable private eye; the femme fatale; the innocent man, wrongly accused \u2014 and turns them upside down, all while showing off the kind of razzle-dazzle visual style that has helped define their work ever since (and the work of director Barry Sonnenfeld, who was their cinematographer). And it was the film debut of Frances McDormand, who is both earnest and ruthless as the female lead.\n\nPeter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo in \u201cSex, Lies, and Videotape.\u201d Miramax Films Movie Sex, Lies, and Videotape Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 1989 Steven Soderbergh\u2019s feature debut \u2014 which won the Audience Award and went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes \u2014 was, in many ways, the quintessential Sundance movie: small in scale and intimate in scope, consisting mostly of four people talking in rooms. But the subject of that talk (sex, and the lack thereof) and the intensity and candor of that talk were what made the movie so singularly compelling, along with the deftly observed performances of its four lead actors (Andie MacDowell, James Spader, Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo). Its subsequent acquisition and commercial success helped make studios aware of how much money could be made by these small-budget movies they were showing up in the mountains.\n\n0\n\nFrom left, Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi in \u201cReservoir Dogs.\u201d Miramax Films Movie Reservoir Dogs Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 1992 In 1991, Quentin Tarantino made use of the Sundance Institute Lab Program \u2014 which pairs novice directors with experienced mentors \u2014 to workshop his screenplay about a jewel heist gone awry. (Among Tarantino\u2019s most important mentors there was the director Terry Gilliam.) The next year, he returned to Park City with the finished feature, which notoriously failed to win at Sundance but went on to blow through the indie world like a tornado. Assembling an enviable ensemble cast of hard-boiled character actor types, Tarantino shook up the clich\u00e9s of the heist movie: He skipped over the robbery itself entirely, focusing instead on the assembly of the crew and their frayed nerves at a meet-up afterward, keeping viewers off-balance with a scrambled chronology that revealed new complexities of plot and character with each scene.\n\nJason Mewes, left, and Kevin Smith in \u201cClerks.\u201d View Askew Productions Movie Clerks Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 1994 Two years later, another scrappy, movie-crazy kid brought this chatty, low-budget debut to Sundance and took the town by storm, winning a filmmakers\u2019 trophy for dramatic features. But unlike his predecessors on this list, that filmmaker, Kevin Smith, wasn\u2019t trying to impress anyone with the slickness of his debut feature; he embraced the low budget, shooting his grubby, grainy movie during late nights at the convenience store and video shop where he worked (and which inspired the events of the film). Ultimately, its surveillance-camera aesthetic worked to the picture\u2019s benefit; it captured a particular kind of pop-culture-obsessed slacker, and became a defining ode to Generation X.\n\nMichael Williams in \u201cThe Blair Witch Project.\u201d Artisan Entertainment Movie The Blair Witch Project Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 1999 The audience at the midnight premiere of this 1999 entry by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez was particularly lucky, as it was the only audience to see it entirely unspoiled \u2014 and thus, left to stumble out into the snow at 2 a.m., unsure whether they\u2019d just witnessed a kind of snuff film or a very clever mockumentary. That thin line between stylistic fact and narrative fiction continued to compel and confuse audiences well past that first late-night screening, turning \u201cBlair Witch\u201d into the first Sundance film to gross over $100 million when it hit theaters that summer \u2014 and reminding moviegoers that the tension of peering into the darkness could prove far scarier than scenes of blood and gore.\n\nMichelle Rodriguez in '\u2018Girlfight.\u201d Andrea Morini/Screen Gems Movie Girlfight Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 2000 By the end of the 1990s, Sundance had become the target festival for American independent filmmakers \u2014 and industry types had begun to descend on Park City every January to pluck out the Next Big Thing. They found two of them in this 2000 drama (which won a directing award and tied for the Grand Jury Prize): director Karyn Kusama, who crafts this story of a take-no-prisoners female boxer with a verisimilitude and frankness that transcends sports movie clich\u00e9s, and Michelle Rodriguez, whose leading performance is equal parts tough and tender. Both later found success in much bigger pictures, but they\u2019ve rarely found such perfect expressions of their singular voices.\n\nAdepero Oduye in \u201cPariah.\u201d Focus Features Movie Pariah Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 2011 In the years since \u201cGirlfight,\u201d Sundance\u2019s programmers have clearly attempted to widen the scope of the stories its filmmakers tell, complementing their always noteworthy world-cinema programming by increasing the number of works by women and people of color in the domestic selections. One of the best of the recent crop is this intimate character study from the writer-director Dee Rees (who went on to direct and help write \u201cMudbound\u201d), which concerns a young Brooklyn lesbian\u2019s voyage of self-discovery. The story may not be earth-shattering, but the approach is: Rees renders her story with an insider\u2019s eye, filling her frames with characters we rarely see in mainstream cinema and approaching them with the kind of empathy and honesty that\u2019s just as rare.\n\nEmayatzy Corinealdi in \u201cMiddle of Nowhere.\u201d Participant Media Movie Middle of Nowhere Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 2012 Director Ava DuVernay and her \u201cSelma\u201d star David Oyelowo first collaborated for this keenly observed and deeply moving drama about a kindhearted young woman (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who begins to question her dedication to her incarcerated husband when she meets a warm and winning bus driver (Oyelowo). DuVernay dramatizes these lives of quiet desperation with subtlety and grace, and the performances are remarkable; Corinealdi is particularly skilled at putting across the emotional urgency of her character\u2019s situation and the questions it prompts about who she is and who she wants to be. DuVernay won the directing award for a domestic drama for \u201cMiddle of Nowhere,\u201d making her the first African-American woman to take that prize.\n\n0\n\nTessa Thompson and Brandon Bell in \u201cDear White People.\u201d Lionsgate Movie Dear White People Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like Class of 2014 Justin Simien won a special jury award for breakthrough talent for this fiercely funny and wickedly provocative take on race and gender relations on college campuses, which hit Park City like a lightning bolt in 2014. Wittily orchestrating the attempts by several characters to fit in or call out their contemporaries, Simien\u2019s scathing screenplay is both socially conscious and blissfully entertaining \u2014 a kind of hybrid between intellectual debate and sketch comedy. And he provides a showcase for a star-making performance by Tessa Thompson, who burns with the rage of a campus activist and slowly reveals the complex allegiances that motivate her.", "title": "10 Breakout Films of Sundances Past, and Where to Stream Them", "authors": ["Jason Bailey"]}

Ruby Namdar\u2019s \u201cThe Ruined House\u201d is an intense novel about Jewish life that won Israel\u2019s most lucrative literary award. And Laszlo Krasznahorkai\u2019s \u201cThe World Goes On\u201d is full of the sprawling sentences for which the Hungarian writer has become known. In nonfiction, a wide array of subjects: threats to democracy, ancient crafts, strategy during the Vietnam War, Ezra Pound in confinement and the Nobel Prize winner J. M.

The second novel in Smith\u2019s projected seasonal cycle is an insubordinate folk tale, with echoes of the fiction of Iris Murdoch and Angela Carter. In it, four characters gather in a big rambling house and have at each other. Our critic Dwight Garner says that the book\u2019s elastic structure, like that of the previous novel, \u201cAutumn,\u201d \u201callows Smith the freedom to write as if improvising a bedtime story. The combination of dreaminess and acuity is what gives these books their tang.\u201d\n\nPASSING, by Nella Larsen. (Penguin Classics, $14.) BLACK NO MORE, by George S. Schuyler. (Penguin Classics, $16.) Racial passing is the central concern of both of these influential, if woefully under-read, American classics, which have been reissued in handsome new editions in time for Black History Month. \u201cFor their wildly differing approaches, the novels are both curious about what it means to feel, as well as be, truly free, and how freedom and safety might be at odds,\u201d our critic Parul Sehgal writes. \u201cThey are derisive about fantasies of racial purity, black or white. They are unsparing on the madness of racial classification but frank, and very beautiful, on the lure of racial belonging.\u201d\n\nHOW DEMOCRACIES DIE, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt. (Crown, $26.) In this \u201clucid and essential\u201d guide, two political scientists write about the norms that have sustained American democracy, and argue that President Trump has tried to eviscerate more than one of those norms. Our critic Jennifer Szalai, summarizing the book\u2019s circumspect conclusion, writes: \u201cThere is no democratic paradise, no easy way out. Democracy, when it functions properly, is hard, grinding work.

Langlands is a sort of method archaeologist, unearthing the various ways that humans used their hands for thousands of years and taking it upon himself to do things like cutting hay, building a drystone wall and making a skep for beekeeping. Our reviewer Michael Bierut writes: \u201cLanglands, surprisingly unsentimental for someone who made his fame doing historical re-enactments, resists the pull of nostalgia.

Doesn\u2019t it seem as if the world were conspiring to push us all into our living rooms to watch more TV? Luckily, January has arguably become a more important month in the TV calendar than September, with some of the most popular and ambitious shows now arriving in what used to be called midseason.\n\nThis January has TV adaptations of best-selling crime novels, cult comic books and the short stories of Philip K. Dick. We\u2019ll also see the return of one of the most beloved shows of the \u201990s, and one of the most acclaimed of 2017 \u2014 and the debut of Dylan McDermott\u2019s cheesy new pilot\u2019s mustache. There\u2019s a lot to talk about this month; here\u2019s a taste of what\u2019s ahead:\n\nFOX\n\n\u2018LA to Vegas\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 2, on Fox.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA mustachioed Dylan McDermott plays a weathered airline pilot who leads his eccentric crew on weekend jaunts back and forth from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, in this snappy sitcom that\u2019s part workplace comedy, part \u201cLove Boat\u201d-like compendium of travel anecdotes. Creator Lon Zimmet previously wrote for shows like \u201cHappy Endings,\u201d \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d and \u201cSuperstore.\u201d \u201cLA to Vegas\u201d promises to be every bit as fast-paced and loony, with an unending string of passengers to keep the story ideas coming.\n\n\u2014\n\nFreeform\n\n\u2018grown-ish\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 3, on Freeform.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe likable young actress Yara Shahidi transfers her \u201cblack-ish\u201d character, Zoey Johnson, to a new sitcom, set at a typical modern college where the students are actively engaged both inside and outside the classroom. If the backdoor pilot that aired on its parent show last season is any indication, expect \u201cgrown-ish\u201d to deal with the changing politics of academia and Zoey\u2019s efforts to establish her own social and racial identity.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nONE Media\n\n\u2018The X-Files\u2019 Season 11\n\nStarts: Jan. 3, on Fox.\n\nJan. 3, on Fox. Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nLast year\u2019s abbreviated six-episode season of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d couldn\u2019t measure up to the classic episodes of the late \u201990s, but a few strong episodes were sprinkled into the mix. And for fans, just seeing David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson investigating the supernatural again as the F.B.I. agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully was reason enough to tune in. A sizable viewing audience for Season 10 all but assured a Season 11. This time, the band\u2019s back together for 10 episodes, some of which will follow the continuing mystery of Mulder and Scully\u2019s missing son, others of which will be stand-alone adventures, penned by the longtime \u201cX-Files\u201d writers Darin Morgan, Glen Morgan and James Wong.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Chi\n\n\u2018The Chi\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 7, on Showtime.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAt a time when Chicago\u2019s gang violence has become a political talking-point on the right and left, Lena Waithe, the Emmy-winning writer-actress from \u201cMaster of None,\u201d looks to offer a more complex view of her home city with \u201cThe Chi,\u201d an ensemble drama about a family and its friends, who are pushing to get ahead while living on the South Side. Jason Mitchell (so good in \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and \u201cMudbound\u201d) stars as an aspiring restaurateur, whose skills and opportunities are often outweighed by his obligations to the people he grew up with.\n\n\u2014\n\nPrime Video\n\n\u2018Philip K. Dick\u2019s Electric Dreams\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 12, on Amazon.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe short stories and novels of visionary science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick have been adapted into such movies as \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d \u201cTotal Recall\u201d and \u201cMinority Report,\u201d as well as the TV series \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d For this anthology series, Ronald D. Moore (a writer and producer for \u201cBattlestar Galactica\u201d and \u201cOutlander\u201d) enlisted Steve Buscemi, Anna Paquin, Terrence Howard, Bryan Cranston, Geraldine Chaplin and others to play out some of Dick\u2019s more provocative stories.

Greg Berlanti and the veteran husband-and-wife writing team Mara Brock Akil and Salim Akil have cast Cress Williams as an older version of the hero, who\u2019s drawn back into crime-fighting years after hanging up his costume. At the moment, the new series isn\u2019t intended to be part of the fictional universe shared by several of the CW\u2019s superhero shows \u2014 known to fans as the Arrowverse \u2014 though if it does well, we could someday see crossovers with the likes of \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cSupergirl.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFX Networks\n\n\u2018The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u2019 Starts: Jan. 17 on FX.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIt\u2019s going to be tough for the second season of FX\u2019s anthology series \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d to top its award-winning first run, \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson\u201d \u2014 especially since its original creators, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, are no longer on board. Still, the producer and director Ryan Murphy has assembled a good cast to tell the story of the fashion designer Gianni Versace\u2019s death at the hands of the serial killer Andrew Cunanan. Edgar Ram\u00edrez plays Versace, while Ricky Martin plays his boyfriend, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz plays his sister Donatella and Darren Criss is the killer who preyed on wealthy gay men.\n\n\u2014\n\nTNT\n\n\u2018The Alienist\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 22, on TNT.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nCaleb Carr\u2019s best-selling historical crime novel \u201cThe Alienist\u201d followed a winding path to the small screen. A movie adaptation stalled in the \u201990s, then a parade of A-list writers and directors (including John Sayles and Cary Fukunaga) took a shot at whittling the grim book into something more audience-friendly for TV. Now, TNT is finally set to air the result of that collaboration, which stars Daniel Br\u00fchl as an 1890s psychologist and police consultant in New York, who uses controversial methods to track a serial killer \u2014 at the behest of the new police commissioner, Teddy Roosevelt. Dakota Fanning and Luke Evans also star in this dark mystery that doubles as a look at turn-of-the-century America.\n\n\u2014\n\nHBO\n\n\u2018Mosaic\u2019\n\nStarts: Jan. 22, on HBO.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe relentlessly experimental director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Ed Solomon introduced their murder mystery, \u201cMosaic,\u201d back in November as an interactive iOS and Android app, turning the story into an elaborate \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d game. The HBO version of \u201cMosaic\u201d eliminates the branching element, delivering a more straightforward narrative about a children\u2019s book author (played by Sharon Stone), the man accused of killing her, and the amateur sleuths looking into what really happened.\n\n\u2014\n\nNetflix\n\n\u2018One Day at a Time\u2019 Season 2\n\nStarts: Jan. 26 on Netflix.\n\nJan. 26 on Netflix. Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe TV year got off to a great start in 2017 with this reimagining of Norman Lear\u2019s long-running \u201970s-and-\u201980s sitcom \u201cOne Day at a Time.\u201d Now, just a few weeks into 2018, the writer-producers Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett and Mike Royce revisit working-class Los Angeles and the Cuban-American Alvarez family, as they lovingly argue about everything from global politics to contemporary gender roles.

I called and asked if their neurofeedback program could help a healthy brain achieve a better balance between the noisy frequencies that fill my mind with chatter and the quieter, more calming ones. They said it might, and I decided to participate in a few sessions.\n\nI followed a therapist to a soundproofed room, where electrodes were attached to various parts of my head and connected to a computer that measured the electrical patterns of my brain. The therapist\u2019s objective was to invigorate neurons that were less active \u2014 the rarely quiet part of my brain \u2014 while dimming those firing more vigorously. After six sessions, I had no idea if my mind attained a healthy equilibrium between chatter and calm.\n\nI do know I emerged determined to find in my daily life the tranquillity I experienced in that room. While I\u2019ve meditated for years, the peace I feel during 30 minutes of mindfulness is quickly eclipsed by noise in the street and in my head. I had to begin replacing the dramas playing in my mind with the quiet needed to reflect on how I was going to spend the time remaining to me.\n\nI\u2019m trying to break other habits in far more conventional ways. As in many long marriages, my wife and I enjoy spending time with the same friends, watch the same television programs, favor the same restaurants, schedule vacations to many of the same places, avoid activities that venture too far from the familiar.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWe decided to become more adventurous, shedding some of those habits.

He added exercises I had never attempted, pedaling and running in brief bursts of intensity, lifting weights while balancing on one foot, focusing more on reaching and lifting movements that mimic the functions of everyday life, countering the stiffness accompanying aging by stretching, bending and leaping. The workout I now follow is mentally and physically taxing but within the capabilities of someone my age, and I regard it as part of my intention to ask more of my mind and body in these remaining years.\n\nNone of these efforts to break old habits will add one day to my life.

The plea was sealed until this week when it was made public as part of an unrelated pending corruption case on Long Island.\n\nThe guilty plea was won by federal prosecutors in the Eastern District, which covers Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s ties to Mr. Singh and several other campaign donors for whom he did favors were investigated by federal prosecutors in the Southern District, which includes Manhattan. They decided not to bring charges against Mr. de Blasio or his aides \u2014 but in doing so, last year, they issued a cutting statement raising questions about the mayor\u2019s ethics and making it clear he had done favors for donors.\n\nA similar case arose with the other donor, Jona S. Rechnitz, who made campaign contributions and gave money to a nonprofit group the mayor created to support his City Hall agenda.\n\nIn return, Mr. Rechnitz got access to Mr. de Blasio, calling and emailing him. The result was personal attention when Mr. Rechnitz, a real estate investor, had problems with the city. A friend\u2019s water bill overcharges got quickly resolved.

In the ruling, the court determined that making introductions or setting up meetings, even in exchange for gifts or financial benefits, did not constitute a crime.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAs a consequence, several prominent corruption convictions were set aside, and prosecutors have become more cautious in taking on such cases.\n\nFurthermore, bribery cases against elected officials based on campaign contributions are rare, the legal experts said. That is in part because the Supreme Court has drawn a clear distinction between a legal contribution to a political campaign and other kinds of payments like cash, gifts or other benefits that in effect go into the pocket of a public servant.\n\nIt may also have been that it was simply easier for prosecutors to bring charges against the person buying access, because the men admitted guilt, in the face of abundant evidence, as part of plea deals in which they agreed to cooperate with the government against other defendants. Mr. Singh is a witness in corruption trials on Long Island; Mr. Rechnitz testified against a labor official who was accused of steering millions of dollars of officers\u2019 retirement funds into a hedge fund in exchange for promised kickbacks.\n\nNonetheless, the outcomes seem incongruous: Mr. Singh pleaded guilty to bribing the mayor, charges brought by the Eastern District prosecutors, while those in the Southern District examined the same conduct and chose not to charge the mayor. But current and former federal prosecutors and defense lawyers said there could be several explanations.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s an allegation that money has changed hands,\u201d said Paul J. Fishman, who served as the United States attorney in New Jersey for more than seven years, \u201csometimes the issue is whether the transaction actually occurred.

Michael Shannon plays the F.B.I. hostage negotiator, and while the performances are all strong, the series on the whole feels a little spiritless, as if it were preserved behind glass. It starts at 10 p.m.\n\nFinally, on Thursday, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d is back on VH1 at 8 p.m. with another all-star season. It\u2019s a 90-minute episode, so plan accordingly. Thursdayalso features new episodes of \u201cTop Chef\u201d and \u201cProject Runway\u201d (Bravo at 10 p.m.and Lifetime starting at 7:54 p.m.), as well as this season\u2019s penultimate episode of \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d at 8:30 on NBC.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "2) How big will it really be?\n\nThe effort focuses on the United States employees of JPMorgan Chase, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. Together, the companies have nearly one million employees (a portion of those, though, are outside of the United States.) That\u2019s a lot of employees but relatively small when compared with 157 million people who had employer health care plans at the end of 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Would the venture be able to scale up? Some experts are skeptical about that. Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor of international business at Brandeis, wrote: \u201cMy bet is that JPMorgan and Amazon\u2019s employees have pretty good health coverage, with plans that rank among the richest that the industry has to offer. If so, will these lead users be anxious to find a more cost-effective model? Will they even be willing to experiment with their coverage? And, beyond that \u2013 if they do develop a new approach, will it be helpful to the masses of employees at lesser companies, or, worse, the unemployed and uninsured?\u201d\n\n3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don\u2019t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire\u2019s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company.\n\n4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs?\n\nMuch depends on whether the effort can address the main reason that health care spending has gone up in the United States versus other countries. A recent Upshot column showed how much of the rise is a result of more being done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, or that they are charged more for those services. One way to assess the brash new initiative from Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon is whether it does anything to address this dynamic.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\n\u2018A hungry tapeworm on the American economy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation\u2019s \u201cballooning costs of health care\u201d Tuesday.\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway announced it is teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon to form an independent health care company to serve their employees in the United States.\n\nThe three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s concern about rising health care costs is not new, nor is his use of \u201ctapeworm\u201d to describe them. Mr. Buffett\u2019s statement Tuesday echoes other recent comments he has made on the subject. He trotted out the tapeworm metaphor to describe rising medical costs during television interviews in 2010 and 2012, MoneyBeat\u2019s Ben Eisen and Erik Holm point out.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he said: \u201cMedical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least.\n\nMr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: \u201cInflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.\u201d\n\nThen in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: \u201cCitizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.\u201d\n\nTurbulence ahead?\n\nThe smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch.\n\nVolatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt.\n\nThe S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn\u2019t happened since mid-December.\n\nLow interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing.\n\n\u2014 Matt Phillips\n\nPhoto\n\nFrom Amex to venture capital to help start-ups mature\n\nDespite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore interesting is why he\u2019s taking the job, Andrew writes in his latest DealBook column. He\u2019s hoping to be the adult in the room for the next generation of start-ups, after the troubles at Uber, SoFi and more.\n\nHere\u2019s what he told Andrew:\n\n\u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u201d Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d \u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201d\n\nOch-Ziff has picked a new C.E.O.\n\nIn selecting Rob Shafir \u2014 previously the head of Credit Suisse\u2019s American operations \u2014 as the successor to Daniel Och, the hedge fund has apparently laid to rest questions about its leadership planning.\n\nA reminder: Before Mr. Shafir, Mr. Och\u2019s chosen successor was James Levin. Then the two men had a falling out.\n\nMr. Och\u2019s statement:\n\n\u201cRob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm. His distinguished career of over 30 years leading global financial institutions and asset management businesses brings unique experience that will benefit Oz significantly.\u201d\n\nAnd a statement by Mr. Levin, who had weighed quitting \u2014 but was identified in today\u2019s statement as still being Och-Ziff\u2019s co-chief investment officer:\n\n\u201cOz is a tremendous firm with a talented and creative team that works each day to identify and execute on the most compelling investment opportunities around the world. I am excited about the future and look forward to welcoming Rob.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael J. de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nWho will succeed Jamie Dimon?\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase chief said yesterday that he plans to stick around another five years. So who will eventually pick up the baton?\n\nIn the short term: It could be Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank, or Gordon Smith, the head of its consumer bank. They were named co-presidents yesterday \u2014 but Mr. Pinto is 55 and Mr. Smith is 59.\n\nIn the longer term: It could be one of the other executives named in the firm\u2019s statement:\n\n\u2022 Mary Erdoes, 50, who runs the asset and wealth management arm\n\n\u2022 Doug Petno, 52, who runs the commercial banking division\n\n\u2022 Marianne Lake, 48, the C.F.O.\n\n\u201cThe board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,\u201d JPMorgan said in its statement. But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years.\n\nThe political question: Mr. Dimon has said publicly that he isn\u2019t going to run for president.

Democrats are opposed, and the next shutdown deadline is Feb. 8.\n\n\u2022 Will he touch on health care, given that Republicans have so far rolled back only a small portion of the Affordable Care Act?\n\nThe Washington flyaround\n\n\u2022 Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a contentious memo alleging improprieties in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.

He worked on InBev\u2019s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American\u2019s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E.

I basically have beaten any player that has been playing that is on tour right now. This was the only thing missing, and it means something extra even that it took a little longer, but I still made it here.\u201d\n\nHalep, a Romanian, will lose her No. 1 ranking to Wozniacki on Monday, and knows all too well about delayed gratification. She is now 0-3 in major single finals and has lost all of them in three sets.\n\n\u201cMaybe the fourth time will be with luck,\u201d she said in remarks to the crowd at Laver Arena, before leaving the court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she said later. \u201cI cried, but now I\u2019m smiling. Is just a tennis match in the end. But yeah, I\u2019m really sad I couldn\u2019t win it. It was close again, but the gas was over in the end. She was better. She was fresher. She had actually more energy in the end.\u201d\n\nThis much-anticipated final was tight and tense from the beginning. The spectators sounded as divided as tennis fans in general, with roughly equal support being expressed for \u201cCaro!\u201d and \u201cSimona!\u201d\n\nThe match turned into a grueling fitness test, with both finalists breathing hard, even on the changeovers. Eventually each took a medical timeout.\n\nExtended rallies were the rule. There were 50 exchanges that lasted nine shots or more, 50 others that lasted from five to eight shots.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis was no surprise in light of the speed and defensive skills that both women possess, but it made for quite a challenge.\n\nMomentum shifted repeatedly. Wozniacki took a 3-0 lead to start before Halep reeled her in to force a tiebreaker that Wozniacki \u2014 playing aggressively, particularly down the line \u2014 was able to dominate.\n\nPhoto\n\nHalep won the second set despite taking a medical timeout when leading, 3-2, because of dizziness and a headache. She looked woozy even while closing out the set.\n\nBoth players were able to cool down before the third set, with a 10-minute off-court break allowed because of the heat.\n\nThe match kept tossing and turning. Wozniacki went up, 3-1, in the third set only to lose three straight games. But just when it seemed that Halep might definitively have the edge, Wozniacki, down, 3-4, took a medical timeout to have her left leg taped below the knee.\n\nAfter play resumed, she did not lose another game.\n\nNeither Halep nor her coach, Darren Cahill, cried foul over Wozniacki\u2019s break, even though Halep had to wait longer than usual to serve.\n\n\u201cMaybe those three minutes were a little bit tough,\u201d Halep said. \u201cBut you know the rule is the rule. I don\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\nWith Halep serving at 4-5, 30-30, Wozniacki won one of the match\u2019s best rallies: an 18-shot duel that forced her to sprint from corner to corner and come up with a tightly angled backhand on the run that allowed her to take control and finish the point with a forehand winner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat was a crazy point,\u201d Wozniacki said.\n\nIt gave her match point, and in light of the way this tournament had gone, the big surprise was that Halep did not find a way to save it.\n\nWhen Halep\u2019s backhand hit the net, Wozniacki hit the deck, immediately throwing her racket in the air and then crying as she lay on her back with her hands covering her face.\n\n\u201cI never cry, but today is a very emotional moment,\u201d Wozniacki said to the crowd as she cradled the Cup that she was already calling Daphne.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was an incredible match, incredible fight, and again, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nShe sounded as if she meant it.\n\nSuch a happy ending for Wozniacki looked highly unlikely in the second round of the tournament, when she faced two match points and a 1-5 deficit in the final set against unseeded Jana Fett of Croatia.\n\nWozniacki escaped and went on to win six consecutive games.\n\n\u201cI think that match really helped Caroline with the feeling that she was playing a little bit with house money \u2014 that\u2019s how we kept putting it,\u201d said her fianc\u00e9, David Lee, a retired N.B.A. player who was courtside for all of her matches in Melbourne. \u201cI was sitting there planning what I was going to say to her after the match to help cheer her up, and next thing you know you are moving on \u2014 so it was really, really special.\u201d\n\nWozniacki and Lee became engaged in Bora Bora in November. Both she and her father and coach, Piotr Wozniacki, have said that feeling happy and settled in her personal life has helped her on the court.\n\n\u201cObviously sport and life are all connected,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re happy off the court, I think that makes a difference, and she\u2019s got that stability. She knows that whatever happens in tennis, she\u2019s got a great support system, and I\u2019m happy to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nSaturday was, perhaps above all, a father-daughter moment. High-profile coaches have come and gone in the Wozniacki camp, but Piotr has been a constant in her tennis career.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think we both deserve this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just special that when I started playing tennis at 7 years old, he was there. It was training at 11 p.m. or 10 p.m. when I was 10 years old. My dad was there. When it was raining. When it was hot. He was always there by my side, and I think this means a lot to both of us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHalep had saved match points of her own, five in total over two matches: her third-round victory over the American Lauren Davis and her semifinal victory over the former No. 1 Angelique Kerber.\n\nShe also sprained her left ankle in her first-round victory. It all took a physical toll, and she said she had been unable to practice for more than \u201c15 minutes\u201d between matches during the tournament. Cahill said much of the pain ended up in Halep\u2019s right foot because she was compensating for her left ankle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s swollen, my right one,\u201d Halep said. \u201cBoth of them are dead. That\u2019s why I need a break.\u201d\n\nThis was the first Grand Slam final in the Open era between women who had both faced match points in the tournament.\n\nWozniacki and Halep had also both lost their previous two major finals. But Wozniacki is now the first player from Denmark to win a major singles title.\n\nShe lost the 2009 United States Open final to Kim Clijsters and the 2014 United States Open final to Williams. Both opponents were aggressive base liners, with power in abundance, and they took the initiative against the more defensive-minded Wozniacki.\n\nShe said she briefly considered retirement in 2016 when recurring physical problems, particularly a severe ankle injury, contributed to her drop in the rankings. Wozniacki was at No. 74 before the 2016 United States Open, but reached the semifinals and has now made it all the way back to the top.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe has changed her game in recent seasons and improved her serve and forehand. Wozniacki still relies on her outstanding coverage and consistency from the baseline, but she has added a dose of risk to the mix.\n\nIt helped her win the WTA Finals \u2014 the elite, eight-women, season-ending championship \u2014 last year. That was her most significant title until Saturday\u2019s.\n\nIt has been quite a process. Though Wozniacki is just 27, this was her 43rd appearance in a Grand Slam singles tournament. Flavia Pennetta, Marion Bartoli and Jana Novotna are the only women to have played in more before winning a first major trophy.\n\nThe first time Wozniacki played the Australian Open, as a 17-year-old in 2008, she reached the fourth round. She rose to No. 1 in October 2010 and \u2014 with the exception of one week \u2014 held the top spot until January 2012.\n\nShe faced questions all through that run about her inability to win a Grand Slam title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m No. 1 in the world. I\u2019m 20 years old, so I think I\u2019m doing fine,\u201d she said in an interview in May 2011. \u201cObviously, of course, I\u2019d like to win a Grand Slam, but I don\u2019t put pressure on myself. Next year. This year. In three years.\u201d\n\nIt took nearly seven, and it was sweet.

The New York theater is obligingly presenting a host of deliberately disorienting productions from an international array of artists this month, in works designed to rearrange your mind and shake up your senses. Fixed notions of nationality, gender and race are being deconstructed and detonated in one of the liveliest lineups of brave new plays in many a season. Here, a quintet of iconoclastic eye-openers to help you focus on the future.\n\nPanorama\n\nFor the Italian troupe Motus, boundaries aren\u2019t made for crossing, but for erasing altogether. Two years ago, this genre-blending company confounded and elated downtown audiences with \u201cMDLSX,\u201d a mixed-media meltdown of gender-specific identity. Motus returns to one of its favorite haunts, La MaMa in the East Village, to consider the possibility of a world unfettered by nationalism \u2014 and, heck, even nationhood \u2014 in the sprawling performance piece \u201cPanorama,\u201d which suggests that to migrate is simply to do what comes naturally.

In \u201cBallyturk,\u201d two nameless friends swap stories of the rural village of the title, which may well exist only in their feverish, mutually dependent fantasies.

This inspired group portrait of high school teachers planning a fund-raising telethon brings back all the self-help-seeking klutziness of the decade, with a jargon-laden vocabulary (and wince-making cultural references) to match. Created by the Mad Ones and first staged at the Bushwick Starr in 2016, \u201cMiles for Mary\u201d crosses the river into Manhattan with its original director, the excellent Lila Neugebauer, and blissfully bonded ensemble, which fans the frictions that emerge during a seemingly endless series of conferences into a bonfire to remember.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTickets: playwrightshorizons.org\n\nPhoto\n\nHe Brought Her Heart Back in a Box\n\nNow there\u2019s an evocative title for you, conjuring dread, romance and a tragic surrealism all at once. Such is the distinctively poetic and terrifying universe of Adrienne Kennedy, a playwright\u2019s playwright of slender output and immense influence.

A Theater for a New Audience production, directed by Evan Yionoulis at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn, Ms. Kennedy\u2019s phantasmagoric drama takes a treacherous sentimental journey into the Georgia and New York City in the 1940s, when the specters of Nazism and Jim Crow cast Jacobean shadows on an interracial romance.\n\nTickets: tfana.org\n\nAt Home at the Zoo\n\nEdward Albee was one of the great pioneers of the drama of melting identity, starting with \u201cThe Zoo Story,\u201d his reputation-making portrait from 1958 of the feral darkness beneath civilized surfaces. In the early 21st century, Albee wrote an enriching companion piece to \u201cThe Zoo Story\u201d called \u201cHomelife,\u201d and the two works were staged in tandem at Second Stage Theater a decade ago.

They pilloried the move as a big-government intrusion that would outlaw children from doing their chores. The proposals \u2014 which would have exempted children on their parents\u2019 farms \u2014 were quickly dropped.\n\nThese days, researchers say, it is even hard to know how many children are getting hurt, and how and where. Some public health groups and universities collect news clippings of farm accidents, but the federal government stopped running its own surveys in 2015.\n\nOn the Schachtschneider farm, the boys started learning early. Their father, Caleb Schachtschneider, 36, said he taught his two older sons, Maric and Kholer, by letting them sit in his lap as he drove the tractor or skid steer across the farm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an extension of you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re around it, you\u2019ve got to teach them.

But accidents still happened. Two years ago, when Kholer struck Maric with the skid steer, Maric spent a week in the hospital and came home in a wheelchair, said the boys\u2019 mother.\n\nMs. Smith, 34, said she hated seeing her children drive the yellow machine squatting beside the barn. Sometimes she fantasized about ramming it with her car or maybe selling it off. But she also defended allowing the boys to do work that would otherwise require hiring help the family could not afford. Seeing her children bottle-feed calves and milk full-grown cows was a source of pride. Farmwork taught them how to take care of themselves, she said.\n\n\u201cIf we were to just leave and not let our kids continue to grow up like this, what are they going to have?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat are they going to learn?

James Lenhard, medical director of Christiana Care Health System\u2019s Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., agreed that making it fun is paramount.\n\n\u201cSome people like to chop wood, others like walking, others like peeling vegetables,\u201d Dr. Lenhard said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it is, find something you really like so you can stick with it.\u201d\n\nAnd don\u2019t get discouraged if you fall off the wagon.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have good weeks and bad weeks,\u201d Dr. Freedhoff said. \u201cDo as much as often as you can enjoy. Some is good, more is better, everything counts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGet enough sleep.\n\nOne third of Americans don\u2019t get enough sleep, but it\u2019s impossible to overstate how essential sleep is to good health. It affects your immune system, hormones, appetite, weight, thinking, energy, concentration, temper, mood \u2026 even life expectancy. Luckily, there are ways to get a better night\u2019s sleep.\n\nConsider the effects of poor sleep on mental health: \u201cPeople who have impaired sleep or insomnia symptoms are significantly more likely to develop clinical depression,\u201d said Dr. Britney Blair, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct clinical faculty at Stanford University. If you are coping with depression and impaired sleep, you are much more likely to have thoughts of suicide. In fact, several studies have shown how just treating sleep problems in those with depression can improve the depression symptoms too, she said.\n\nHow much sleep each person specifically needs varies \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s as unique as your fingerprint,\u201d Dr. Blair said \u2014 but it ranges from seven to nine hours for most people. But quality matters too. If you\u2019re feeling tired or having disrupted sleep, find out if you have a sleep disorder and treat it if you do.\n\nSleep apnea is an extremely underdiagnosed condition that increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and early death, such as Carrie Fisher\u2019s. Take the STOP-BANG questionnaire to see if you have the symptoms. For those with insomnia, a specific cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment. Following good \u201csleep hygiene habits\u201d can actually make insomnia worse for some people, Dr. Blair said, so find a provider who specializes in insomnia through the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine.\n\nDon\u2019t smoke.\n\nThis one is a no-brainer, and not just because smoking can cause lung cancer, emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n\u201cSmoking is associated with virtually all diabetes complications,\u201d Dr. Lenhard said, and it\u2019s a leading cause of heart disease. \u201cCigarette smokers with diabetes are virtually certain to get cardiovascular disease,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not if they get it, it\u2019s when they get it.\u201d\n\nMost smokers don\u2019t need reminders of these facts.\n\n\u201cAbout 80 percent of smokers want to quit and about half have tried to quit in the last year, but success is low,\u201d Dr. Hurst said. \u201cIf people will use nicotine patches and medications with a behavioral plan, they can increase their chances of quitting five or six times. There are more effective treatment options when you use all the tools.\u201d\n\nAnd e-cigarettes or vaping? We just don\u2019t have the evidence yet on their toxicity or ability to help people quit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe bulk of evidence is that they are less toxic than cigarettes, though the bar is low there,\u201d Dr. Hurst said. \u201cBut long-term effects are less well known.\u201d And data on whether it actually helps people quit is contradictory. Anecdotal evidence shows they definitely help some people, but it\u2019s not clear who, why, how or how often.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Smarter Living Newsletter A weekly roundup of the best advice from The Times on living a better, smarter, more fulfilling life.

Does it mean you add a weekly lunch with a friend to your schedule? Join a local club or sports team? Plan a monthly date night with your partner? Eat meals at the dinner table with your family more often? Make Saturdays family days without distractions?\n\nYou decide, but don\u2019t underestimate the importance of those activities to good health and well-being. The need for attachment starts in infancy and never goes away.\n\n\u201cIt transitions from a parent or primary caregiver to our spouse, our children, our friends,\u201d Dr. Blair said. \u201cFostering loving, connected attachment and close relationships is the single most important thing you can do for happiness.\u201d\n\nEat more fruits and vegetables.\n\nVegetables offer more benefits than fruits in terms of vitamins and minerals with fewer calories, but fruits are a place to start if you don\u2019t get much of either. The best way to get more fruits and veggies is to cook more meals at home with unprocessed foods. This also decreases sodium, sugar and calorie intake, said Dr. Freedhoff. \u201cIf you focus on cooking more with fresh whole ingredients, that will lead to an increase in fruits and vegetables,\u201d he said.\n\nStart with cooking just one more meal a week than you do now. If time, finances or other reasons make home cooking difficult, add an extra vegetable to dinner each night or replace a snack with an apple or orange. Frozen vegetables are time savers with the same benefits as fresh ones, and canned fruits are fine if they\u2019re not packed in syrup, Dr. Freedhoff said.\n\nJust don\u2019t drink your fruits or rely on dried fruits. \u201cAny concentrated form of fruit sugars is not as helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cThose both pack a lot more calories and add up faster.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCooking at home also offers benefits beyond healthier meals, Dr. Freedhoff added. It can save you money, gives you a skill to pass on to children and grandchildren and encourages family meals at the table.\n\nGet vaccinated.\n\nA hundred years ago, the top 10 causes of death in the United States were nearly all infectious diseases that vaccines can prevent today.\n\nA major reason cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic conditions top today\u2019s list is that people now live long enough for those to develop. Before vaccines, thousands of children never reached adulthood. Even today, thousands of adults die from the flu.\n\nSo the advice here is straightforward: Vaccines can save lives, so keep up with and follow the recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSpend time in the sun, but not too much.\n\nNot everyone has this option year-round, especially in northern latitudes, but take advantage of what you can. Light helps your sleep and mood, being out in the sun increases your likelihood of physical activity and sunlight is the only natural way to get vitamin D.\n\n\u201cBright light is incredibly important for healthy sleep,\u201d said Dr. Blair. \u201cOur sleep system evolved when we were sleeping outside,\u201d so not getting enough light during the day can hinder sleep. And again, healthy sleep helps mental health too.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that those in higher latitudes have lower vitamin D levels, but how much vitamin D people need, how to measure it and how it affects health remain unanswered questions. It\u2019s an essential vitamin nonetheless.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost no disease state that has not been associated with vitamin D deficiency,\u201d Dr. Lenhard said, \u201cbut association is not cause and effect.\u201d We don\u2019t know how much vitamin D contributes to or prevents certain health problems, but we know many people don\u2019t have enough, especially if they\u2019re overweight or have diabetes, Dr. Lenhard said. If your levels are low, raising them with more sunlight exposure or supplements has few downsides if you don\u2019t go overboard.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, too much sun isn\u2019t good either. The sun\u2019s UV light is a leading cause of skin cancer, so protect yourself with sunblock, hats and clothing too.\n\nEat and drink less sugar.\n\nThis recommendation is controversial given existing research, said Dr. Lenhard, but there are still reasons to watch how much you consume.\n\n\u201cThe data on how sugar consumption affects the body and development of diabetes is still unclear, but there\u2019s a fair amount of calories in it,\u201d he said. Whether the culprit is sugar or increased calories isn\u2019t known, but both decrease when you cut out extra sugar. The easiest place to start? Drinks. Switch that soda or sugary drink to water instead.\n\nStaying hydrated maintains your energy and prevents headaches and other dehydration effects. But don\u2019t go overboard: No evidence supports the \u201ceight glasses of water a day\u201d claims, Dr. Freedhoff said. \u201cThe notion that there\u2019s a magical amount that will improve your health is mythology,\u201d he said. But evidence does support choosing water over soft drinks, alcohol and other calorie-dense beverages.\n\n\u201cIf you drink when you\u2019re thirsty and you drink water preferentially, you\u2019re good,\u201d Dr. Freedhoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s about limiting drinks you love the most thoughtfully. What\u2019s the smallest amount that will satisfy me?\u201d\n\nDecreasing your alcohol intake not only reduces calories, it also reduces the risks associated with excessive alcohol use.\n\nAnyone of any age, size or gender can begin working on these back-to-basics behaviors. And focusing on adding one or two small, daily positive habits to your routine removes the intimidation of otherwise lofty New Year\u2019s goals. If you miss a day, start fresh the next day.

King James\u2019 free agency choice is the story line that will lord over the whole league in 2018, but I tend to believe he\u2019s still months away from knowing what he wants to do, despite the persistent chatter that he\u2019s Hollywood-bound.\n\nAs his longtime business partner and confidante Maverick Carter stated rather clearly in a November radio interview with Rich Eisen: \u201cWhen you win as an athlete, that matters the most.\u201d Consider that a pretty decent hint that James is liable to take a long look around to see which franchise can offer him the best hope of challenging Golden State and adding to his three championship rings, whether that\u2019s the Lakers, Houston, Philadelphia, Team X that hasn\u2019t even been mentioned as a possible destination \u2014 or, yes, his hometown Cavs.\n\n\u2022 Markelle Fultz won\u2019t play another game in his rookie season.\n\nThis is the old reverse jinx trick sportswriters love. That\u2019s right: I\u2019m openly hoping I\u2019m wrong here, that just writing this leads to a Fultz comeback after the All-Star break and a stream of I-told-you-sos from angry Philadelphians. But the reality is that it\u2019s near impossible now to envision Fultz playing again before at least summer league, thanks to the mysterious evaporation of the shooting mechanics that helped make him the No. 1 overall pick last June.", "title": "8 Fearless N.B.A. Predictions: LeBron, Boogie and the Blazers\u2019 Backcourt", "authors": []}

Once the holiday season\u2019s tidal wave of blockbusters and prestige pictures has receded there\u2019s not much action beyond the awards season itself. Releasing only chaff during the first two months of the year has been a studio tradition so longstanding that nobody seems to remember the rationale. But even for awards mavens, now is a good time to catch up and explore.\n\nDuring the last week of 2017 I was out of New York, visiting relatives, and one evening circumstances left me alone in their house with a few hours to kill. I ended up using my phone to watch \u201cS\u00e9rie Noire,\u201d a grimy 1979 French crime thriller that I saw maybe 20 years ago, via a pretty grimy-in-itself 16 -millimeter print, and had no expectation to see again. Directed by Alain Corneau, the movie is an adaptation of the novel \u201cA Hell of a Woman,\u201d by the American genre writer Jim Thompson. (Mr. Corneau wrote the screenplay with Georges Perec, the French literary genius who wrote \u201cLife: A User\u2019s Manual.\u201d)\n\nThe story line of \u201cS\u00e9rie Noire\u201d is jaw-droppingly squalid \u2014 less than 10 minutes into the movie an abusive aunt is pimping her young niece (Marie Trintignant) to a feckless traveling salesman (Patrick Dewaere) \u2014 and the movie\u2019s setting, an impoverished Paris suburb in the depths of a drippy winter, is depicted with such rigor that you suspect the film stock itself of carrying mold. Not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, obviously, and not to make light of trigger warnings, but this movie could conceivably be eligible for at least a dozen of them. But I\u2019ve long found it unnerving and fascinating, and when a friend on social media mentioned that it was available on FilmStruck, I was genuinely surprised.\n\n[ See the best 100 movies currently on Netflix. ]\n\nOne comes to expect at least a certain amount of the unexpected on a carefully curated site like FilmStruck. That\u2019s less true of Netflix. Still, I\u2019ve always thought the commonly propagated complaint about the dearth of \u201cclassic\u201d films on Netflix something of a straw man. The streaming service has never advertised itself as a curated haven of greatness. People perhaps confuse Netflix\u2019s DVD rental service, which offers a wide variety of older and critically elevated films, with the streaming service, on which you cannot watch \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d or \u201cCasablanca.\u201d\n\nMy own complaint about the service is more about the presentation of the movies they have than the quality of the movies themselves. It\u2019s no secret that Netflix doesn\u2019t do a great job letting consumers know what more recent critical favorites are available, so if you\u2019re on that site and looking for hidden gems, you\u2019re not going to find them gathered under a category.

Mr. Ebiri had first seen it at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017, and after that it dropped from sight. As it happens, it is on Netflix. Another 2017 Sundance favorite, \u201cI Don\u2019t Feel at Home in This World Anymore\u201d turned up on Netflix very shortly after it played the festival. But these streaming premieres were hardly big Netflix events. A big Netflix event is \u201cBright,\u201d a sci-fi fantasy film widely mocked by reviewers that garnered sufficient viewership on the service to justify a sequel.

The lease requires that the Port Authority \u201cmust use reasonable efforts to cause other providers to cease their provision of the exclusive services.\u201d\n\nThe project was financed with a combination of conventional loans and tax-free bonds, with Ark responsible for all payments.\n\nThe heart of the Ark\u2019s business is supposed to be horses coming from Europe, which must be quarantined for at least three days in order to prevent the spread of equine diseases.\n\nThe Ark\u2019s primary competitor is the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s 40-year-old operation in Newburgh, N.Y., about 90 miles north of Kennedy Airport.\n\nPhoto\n\nMost of the hundreds of birds and more than 3,500 horses that enter the United States at Kennedy every year are still put onto trailers for the 2-\u00bd-hour ride to Newburgh, even though the cargo planes could practically pull alongside the Ark, where the horses could be transferred to a dolly and wheeled into a stall moments after landing.\n\n\u201cI watch them go by my door every day,\u201d Mr. Cuticelli said, \u201ctrucked up to Newburgh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to me why the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A. and all the other agencies involved in the creation of this facility are not supporting its use,\u201d Mr. Cuticelli said. \u201cI entered into a technically, legally binding contract with exclusivity. Otherwise, I never would have done it.\u201d\n\nThe Port Authority and the Department of Agriculture declined to discuss the lawsuit.\n\nJoelle Hayden, a spokeswoman for the U.S.D.A., did say that her agency \u201cdoes not mandate use of any one import quarantine facility, airline or animal handling service. We support the use of all approved entities and services.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd a spokesman for the Port Authority said in a statement that the \u201climited exclusivity provision enables the private veterinary clinic to provide the first-class facility and services that J.F.K. requested.\u201d\n\nCritics, mostly shipping agents and transporters, said that the privately owned Ark was too expensive and unnecessary, given the existence of the Newburgh operation.\n\nBut Dr. Scarlette Gotwals, a veterinarian and director of flight operations for Horse America, a shipping agent, said she was mystified as to why Ark has not been embraced by the horse industry.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what we\u2019ve been looking for,\u201d said Ms. Gotwals, the first shipper to bring horses to the Ark in September. \u201cIt\u2019s a world-class facility.

Thomas Bosco, then director of aviation for the Port Authority, recommended that the authority\u2019s board approve the lease, saying that the \u201cArk does not provide quarantine services.\u201d It was a puzzling statement given that Ark had signed a lease requiring it to provide that service.\n\nBefore construction could begin, Ark had to wait for the Port Authority to remove the heart of the airport\u2019s Perimeter Intrusion Detection System, a high-tech system of cameras, radar and sensors.\n\nArk also had to comply with various regulations and requirements imposed by the Port Authority, the U.S.D.A., the Center for Disease Control, state and local health departments and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe delays and requirements drove the cost of the project from $48 million to $65 million, Mr. Cuticelli said. He obtained private financing, put up $12 million of his own money and New York City provided a $35 million bond.\n\nArk opened in January 2017, although the U.S.D.A did not approve the equine quarantine for imported horses until September. Business was slow.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Cuticelli said he does not know whether he has stumbled into some bureaucratic nightmare with the Port Authority, a turf war between government agencies, or is the object of a boycott by livestock shipping agents and transporters.\n\n\u201cThere are two big issues,\u201d said Matt Haug, general manager for IRT Transport, which transports livestock internationally. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t acquainted with them. The other issue is the traffic difficulties at Kennedy Airport.

They\u2019ll never recoup their money.\u201d\n\nA Port Authority official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, blamed federal officials. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the U.S.D.A. has not been friendly to this facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThe official said the Port Authority was trying to work out the issues with the U.S.D.A.\n\nArk\u2019s lease does appear to give it exclusivity, which is also generating friction with the horse racing industry.\n\nThe New York Racing Association, which operates several tracks including Aqueduct and Belmont Park near Kennedy Airport, has built its own U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barns for international horse races, enabling the horse to compete right after it leaves quarantine. The 40 or so racehorses a year that fly into Kennedy from Europe, Japan and elsewhere for races within two weeks of landing represent only a fraction of the total expected volume.\n\nIn December, Dora J. Delgado, a senior vice president of racing and nominations for the Breeders Cup, sent a letter to the U.S.D.A. expressing its concerns about the Port Authority\u2019s plans to require \u201cinternational equine athletes\u201d to use Ark, rather than the U.S.D.A.-approved quarantine barn at Belmont.\n\nAlison McGowan, who runs Ternary Performance Horses on Long Island, was importing two show horses from Belgium and Holland in September. She said she told her shipper \u2014 whom she declined to name \u2014 on numerous occasions that she wanted the horses taken to Ark.\n\nThe day before the horses were to leave Amsterdam, she discovered that the shipper planned to take them to Newburgh.\n\nShe canceled the flight and hired a new shipper, Ms. Gotwals, who brought the horses to Ark.\n\n\u201cFor me as a horse owner,\u201d Ms. McGowan said, \u201cI would never ship horses halfway across the world on a long flight and then put them on a trailer for 2.5 hours to quarantine. The Ark is outstanding. I\u2019d rather have a state-of-the-art facility providing the best care.\u201d\n\nMr. Cuticelli said he may not be able to wait much longer.\n\n\u201cWhat sense does it make to build a multi-, multmillion-dollar state-of-the-art facility to, among other things, mitigate the risk of hoof-and-mouth disease contamination, and then do what they are doing,\u201d said his lawyer, Stephen B.

Of $1.1 billion in annual premiums, 95 percent goes for salaries, bonuses and expenses. That, includes, of course, buying the actual insurance (which, Ms. Vullo said, is 15 percent of the cost) and the research on the titles.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso driving the premiums are gimmicks like renting Citi Field and paying Mets players for a meet-and-greet with real estate lawyers.

In response, lobbyists besieged the legislature in hope of extinguishing the new rules. They are making some headway. A bill sponsored by Sen. James L. Seward, a Republican from the Ithaca area, was passed by the State Senate. The Assembly insurance committee is considering a version sponsored by its chairman, Assemblyman Kevin A. Cahill, a Democrat who represents parts of Ulster and Dutchess counties.\n\nIt says that no matter which rules are enacted, nothing prohibits the companies \u201cfrom undertaking any usual and customary marketing activity aimed at acquainting present and prospective customers with the advantages of using a particular title insurer or title insurance agent.\u201d\n\nThe core language reads like a 96-word loophole, but Ms. Vullo put it in stronger terms. \u201cIt would give a license to bribery,\u201d she said.\n\nAt a hearing earlier this month, representatives of the industry argued that their practices were essential to building relationships with the people they described as their \u201cclients\u201d \u2014 the real estate intermediaries, not the home buyers.\n\nMr. Cahill suggested that marketing directly to the consumers would hurt home buyers inexperienced in shopping for title insurance. \u201cIs it ethically appropriate to go over the head of the experts?\u201d Mr. Cahill asked.

One reason you should use them is that they all share an important feature: automatic backups. (Note: You\u2019ll find this feature on other services, as well.) \u201cYou can never predict when a crash will happen or your phone will be stolen,\u201d says Jill Duffy, a contributing technology editor who covers productivity for PCMag.com.\n\nEach also offers free versions to back up your photos, although it\u2019s generally just a small amount of storage space. You\u2019ll also want to be sure to drill down and examine the details of each service to find additional pros and cons. For example, the pricing model is very different on just these four services (not to mention other photo backup apps). Take Apple iCloud. It\u2019s very well known, but it provides just five gigabytes of free storage to start for those with Apple devices, and just one GB if you don\u2019t own one. For more space, you\u2019ll pay a monthly fee: $0.99/month (50 GB), $2.99/month (200 GB), or $9.99/month (two terabytes). Apple lets you share storage space on the 200-GB and two-TB plans with your family. If you\u2019re accustomed to Apple devices (and the service integrates nicely with Apple products) and are willing to splurge for a monthly fee, iCloud might serve your needs. But if you own an Android device, it might not be the best solution.\n\nBy contrast, you get free, unlimited photo storage on Google Photos, allowing you to automatically back up all images from your phone, computer and other devices. Google also recently updated its app for desktop computers, which now can automatically upload photos directly into Google Photos when transferring images from your camera to your computer, which is very convenient.\n\nHowever, Google Photos has limitations as well. If you shoot photos with a resolution larger than 16 megapixels, they\u2019ll be downsized, which some photographers find unacceptable. At this time, smartphones mostly capture 12- or 16-megapixel photos, which won\u2019t be affected, but some models already exceed that limit, as do many digital cameras.\n\nBoth Amazon Prime Photos and Dropbox have their pros and cons, too. If you have an Amazon Prime account, Prime Photos can be a great option, since, like Google Photos, you get free, unlimited storage, which includes the ability to store RAW images, which are those high quality files for photo editing on an image editor. But you need to pay for an Amazon Prime account.\n\nDropbox has long been a popular backup option for many photographers; it is easy to use and works well on many platforms, but you get only two GB of free storage, and additional storage is pricey ($9.99/month or $99/year for one TB).\n\nFor serious photographers who shoot lots of photos, there are additional options: Some shutterbugs splurge for robust photo-organizing software packages, including apps by ACDSee, Mylio and Adobe, which, for a fee, include online cloud storage. In fact, Adobe recently updated its professional photo organizer, Lightroom, and expanded its cloud-storage plans, which are available at various prices.", "title": "A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Backing Up Photos", "authors": []}

And he is no easy character for Democrats to ignore: From his headquarters in a San Francisco office tower, Mr. Steyer, 60, has built a sprawling political operation with more than 200 staff members around the country, mostly employed by his flagship group, NextGen America, which focuses on climate change.\n\nMr. Steyer has amassed a mixed win-loss record over the years, along with a mercurial reputation among Democratic strategists. But he is nearly alone among Democratic donors in his willingness to spend money on a titanic scale. In 2016, Mr. Steyer spent more than $90 million supporting Democrats, and his checkbook may be critical to their efforts to capture Congress.\n\nSeparate from the impeachment drive, Mr. Steyer, who made his fortune as a hedge fund investor, announced this month that he would spend $30 million on mobilizing young voters in 2018. He has already quietly funneled nearly $2 million into a union-backed effort to capture seven Republican-held seats in California, three strategists directly involved in the campaign said.\n\nBut on impeachment, Democrats in Congress have made no secret of their skepticism. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leaders in the House and Senate, have called it a premature proposal. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a hero of the left, said Democrats should avoid \u201cjumping the gun\u201d on such a drastic action.

The new Irish Free State, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, fell under the social control of the bishops, and prostitution was driven underground. On March 12, 1925, the police raided Monto and closed down what remained, aided by volunteers from a Roman Catholic relief agency, the Legion of Mary.\n\nSince then, almost all the old Monto buildings have been demolished and replaced with public housing or private developments. According to a local historian, Terry Fagan, who does walking tours of the old Monto, the Gloucester Street site is among a handful of buildings left from that era. Even the street names have mostly been changed \u2014 Gloucester Street is now Sean MacDermott Street, named after a hero of the 1916 uprising.\n\nWhile poverty has been greatly reduced, the area remains relatively deprived, the center of a heroin epidemic that exploded in Dublin in the 1970s. Addicts and dealers haunt corners and squares where prostitutes once plied their trade.\n\nToday, the Monto area has faded into folklore, along with the names and lives of its women. One half-remembered streetwalker, Lily of the Lamplight, used to sing to herself under the streetlight where she waited for custom.

Fortunately, there\u2019s a more relaxing option a streetcar ride away in the Garden District. The 18-room Henry Howard Hotel, a historic double-gallery townhouse, was built by the acclaimed architect Henry Howard in 1867 as a mansion for Edward Conery, a steamship owner and ship chandler, that he later bestowed to his two daughters. After years as a rundown inn, the New York-based Fitzgerald Hotel Group modernized the property while maintaining structural elements for its opening in February 2016. Local culture is tastefully celebrated throughout, from snare drums used as coffee tables in the ground floor parlor to the second line brass instruments hanging above beds in each guest room. The designer Lauren Mabry of Hunter Mabry Design pulled inspiration from both the building and the city\u2019s past for a stunning interior overhaul that is both fun and elegant, and unlikely to date itself.\n\nLocation\n\nLocated in the lower Garden District, only a 10-minute taxi ride from the French Quarter, the hotel sits a block away from St. Charles Street (also known as the Mardi Gras route).

But it was a cramped fit for two people. The dressing table was small but helpful in the absence of a closet large enough to properly store our luggage (there was only hanging storage).\n\nThe Bathroom\n\nThe bathroom was perched on the mezzanine level of our room, which was a nice separation from the main living space, but given its small size, there was limited room to place our toiletries.

That changed when Criterion teamed up with Turner on the FilmStruck site. \u201cThe show fits really well with what the site does; it\u2019s a very happy home for it,\u201d he said.\n\nOnce the determination was made, Mr. Pierson was slightly surprised that the site insisted on putting up all 66 episodes over a period of time.\n\nWhile the show is, by definition, of a certain age, it\u2019s not as dated as it might have seemed, in part because Mr. Pierson rarely did segments based entirely on time-specific pegs. And almost all the individual films and filmmakers he focused on turned out to have staying power. (In this sense, the series is a good companion to \u201cCin\u00e9astes de Notre Temps,\u201d the French TV documentary series that ran from 1964 to 2009; right now three episodes of that show are on FilmStruck\u2019s Criterion site.)\n\nWhen I spoke to Mr. Pierson on the phone from his home, where he says he\u2019s keeping busy cooking for his wife while she prepares the slate for the next SXSW, I asked his veteran\u2019s view of what streaming is doing for indie movies today. He expressed some skepticism. \u201cAs someone who began as a sales agent, I\u2019m an empiricist. So I find it frustrating to have no idea of how many people are watching anything across the streaming spectrum. Back in the day, if someone said, \u2018Hey my film\u2019s doing great,\u2019 you could verify if they were delusional or right. Now, who knows?\u201d\n\nStreaming services don\u2019t gauge their success according to ratings, or box office numbers, because they don\u2019t need to. But Mr. Pierson sees in this business model not just great potential for exposure, but great potential for anonymity. \u201cWhat\u2019s notable to me, too, is that you once could gauge things to the degree by which they got traction in the general cultural conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you could have any newspaper in America riffing in headlines on \u2018sex, lies, and videotape\u2019 or \u2018Slacker,\u2019 and \u2018Do the Right Thing,\u2019 you could feel how those filmmakers are penetrating the culture.

Campbell, Weusi \u2014 a 6-foot-10 center \u2014 played on scholarship at Long Island University. He wore No. 44, the same one Johnson wears now. He was also the father to eight children and stepfather to two more. One of those was Keith Fruster, Clarence\u2019s father. Weusi renamed him Pamoja, Swahili for \u201ctogetherness.\u201d In the Cage \u2014 the cramped basketball courts at West Fourth Street \u2014 they called him something else.\n\n\u201cHe was 6-5, slender, muscular, could definitely finish above the rim,\u201d Clarence Fruster said of his father, who died when Clarence was young. \u201cWhen he was coming through, you got out the way. He\u2019d part the lanes.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why they called him Moses.\n\nWhile Weusi was busy consulting with activists and politicians, like Al Sharpton and David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, it was up to Pamoja to pass the game on to his brothers and sisters. He would sign them up for three-on-three tournaments, cajole them on weekend mornings to run laps around the high school track and have them practice layups for hours at a time.\n\nPhoto\n\nKojo Campbell, another of Weusi\u2019s sons, played on scholarship at Stony Brook and \u201cwas a freakishly good street ball legend in his own right,\u201d Fruster said.

But it strikes me that Cristina Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cHere in Berlin\u201d is one of the most interesting new works of fiction I\u2019ve read.\n\nIt\u2019s billed as a novel, but there are few (if any) novels that take a similar form. In 35 separate monologues, plus five italicized sections describing the unnamed Visitor who elicits these interview statements, Garc\u00eda presents a portrait of the city that is at once true and imaginary. The Visitor herself \u2014 a middle-aged Cuban-American woman who has gone through two divorces, has a grown daughter, intensely dislikes her own mother and has acquired German during a previous stay in Frankfurt \u2014 bears an acknowledged resemblance to the author, but this book is not a personal travel diary. Referring to herself in the third person, the narrator chooses, as she says, to \u201cindulge the luxury of a more distant perspective.\u201d Only the Berliners she speaks with have an explicit \u201cI,\u201d and it is through the mosaic of their perspectives that we learn the true character of Germany\u2019s ghost-filled capital, in which the remembered or purposefully forgotten past seems as alive as the present.\n\nThe voices are remarkably distinct, and even their linguistic mannerisms \u2014 with interpolations of bits of German, multiple ways of rendering or evading the facts and direct addresses to someone who is variously referred to as \u201cKind Visitor,\u201d \u201cDear Visitor,\u201d \u201cLiebe\u201d and \u201cSch\u00e4tzchen\u201d \u2014 mark them out as separate people. They include a tango-dancing lesbian, a flower-seller from Vietnam, a nurse, a lawyer, an antique dealer, an ophthalmologist born in Africa, a number of former Nazis, several women raped by Russian soldiers, a limping ballerina, an East German cultural official assigned to invent a pop-dance craze and a photojournalist with amnesia. There are overlaps among their stories \u2014 three or four are patients of the Angolan eye doctor and many of them seem to inhabit the same old-age home or haunt the same cemetery \u2014 so the novel does begin to cohere as the stories accumulate. But it never arrives at a fixed definition, either of the city or its inhabitants, and that is partly what makes it so accurate a portrait of both.\n\nImage\n\nGarc\u00eda\u2019s version of Berlin contains perhaps a disproportionate number of Cubans, brought to Germany mainly through the Havana/East Berlin Communist nexus and introduced to the narrator through her own Cuban connections. But that too is characteristic of the general experience. Arriving in this city of exiles, the foreign visitor inevitably encounters a number of erstwhile compatriots, so it is no surprise that this Cuban-born writer should find others of her kind. And in fact she was led to Berlin in the first place by a fellow Cuban she calls A., an appealing character in his own right:\n\n\u201cA. had been gratefully (his word) married to the same German woman for 20 years. Her family hailed from Hoyerswerda, and never forgave A. for taking their daughter away. They called him \u2018the Negro\u2019 and \u2018the Mexican\u2019 and once sang the Horst Wessel Song in his presence. \u2018The family is a police state,\u2019 the Visitor said, describing how minuscule stages lit up inside her, repeating key scenes from her life. \u2018Do people remember only what they can endure, or distort memories until they can endure them?\u2019 After a long silence, A. said: \u2018Childhood is a city you never leave.

{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "The statistics in the recent gerrymandering cases were more complicated, but not by much. Just as comparing registration rates between black and white voters yielded a \u201cracial gap,\u201d comparing the voting power of Republican and Democratic voters yields what the challengers in the Wisconsin case called an \u201cefficiency gap.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe efficiency gap is a measure of the consequences of the two basic ways of injecting partisan politics into drawing legislative maps: packing and cracking.\n\nPacking a lot of Democrats into a single district, for instance, wastes every Democratic vote beyond the bare majority needed to elect a Democratic candidate. Cracking Democratic voters across districts in which Republicans have small majorities wastes all of the Democratic votes when the Republican candidate wins.\n\nThe difference between the two parties\u2019 wasted votes, divided by the total number of votes cast, yields an efficiency gap.\n\nAt the argument of the Wisconsin case in October, Chief Justice Roberts mocked the efficiency gap, referring to it by its initials, and suggested that it was fiendishly complicated.\n\n\u201cThe answer is going to be because E.G. was greater than 7 percent, where E.G. is the sigma of party X wasted votes minus the sigma of party Y wasted votes over the sigma of party X votes plus party Y votes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the intelligent man on the street is going to say that\u2019s a bunch of baloney.\u201d\n\nPart of Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s point was that a mathematical formula is not a legal standard, and that is true. In the early stages of the litigation, the challengers suggested that a gap of more than 7 percent was legally significant, which does seem arbitrary.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the three-judge Federal District Court panel in Wisconsin that struck down a state legislative map there did not base its decision on the efficiency gap, relying instead on a more conventional legal test that considered discriminatory intent, the map\u2019s partisan effects and whether they were justified by other reasons. The efficiency gap, the court said, was evidence that corroborated the majority\u2019s conclusions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe same was true in the Shelby County opinion. Chief Justice Roberts did not contend that a particular racial gap proved a constitutional violation, but only that his numbers were good evidence of powerful changes. (This was probably just as well, as a recent ProPublica article suggested that there were flaws in the chief justice\u2019s methodology.)\n\nThe Supreme Court has not hesitated to use social science to explore disparities between two groups. In 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, for instance, the court cited studies from psychologists and others to show the negative effects of segregation in public schools.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In addition to the Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, the court has also taken up one from Maryland, Benisek v. Lamone, No. 17-333.\n\nOne way or another, the Supreme Court is very likely to issue a landmark decision on political gerrymandering by June. Judge Wynn\u2019s 190-page opinion surveyed many topics, but its most striking passages seemed addressed to justices who had majored in the humanities.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution does not require the federal courts to act like Galileo\u2019s Inquisition and enjoin consideration of new academic theories,\u201d Judge Wynn wrote.\n\n\u201cThat is not what the founding generation did when it adopted a Constitution grounded in the then-untested political theories of Locke, Montesquieu and Rousseau,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is not what the Supreme Court did when it recognized that advances in our understanding of psychology had proven that separate could not be equal.\u201d", "title": "A Case for Math, Not \u2018Gobbledygook,\u2019 in Judging Partisan Voting Maps", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"]}

The protagonist of David Szalay\u2019s first novel, \u201cLondon and the South-East,\u201d Rainey leads a team at a telephone ad sales company in Holborn; for years, he has worked with the kind of puffed-up men who admire Alec Baldwin\u2019s character in the 1992 film version of the play \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross,\u201d which Rainey thinks depicts salesmanship as both \u201cmythic\u201d and \u201csweatily desperate, duplicitous and soul-destroying.\u201d Playing a wealthy motivational trainer assigned to scare a group of real estate agents into closing deals, Baldwin embodies the white-collar alpha male. But unlike his colleagues, Rainey \u2014 a 39-year-old \u201cshortish, plump,\u201d alcoholic chain-smoker with a history of depression \u2014 has never been able to relate to Baldwin\u2019s role. Deep down, he places himself among the \u201closers\u201d Baldwin torments.\n\nHe thinks this \u201cmay be significant,\u201d and he\u2019s right. Like a career in ad sales, \u201cLondon and the South-East\u201d is built on \u201cinnumerable moments\u2026[of] humiliation\u201d that begin when Rainey loses a deal he believes is guaranteed. He responds by getting so drunk that he imagines a cute young bartender is interested in him, then falls off a train. As he is lifted \u201clike a dead weight\u201d off the tracks, young people laugh and pelt him with bits of kebab.\n\nThe blooper, its detail artfully meted out in bursts of hung-over reflection, sets the tone for a character portrait that is no less heartbreaking because it is funny, or because Rainey\u2019s loserish qualities are shared by almost every other figure in the book. (A larger-than-average percentage of characters in this novel are seen vomiting, for example.) Soon, an elliptical set of betrayals that most resemble those of sociopathic teenage girls leaves Rainey unemployed and, in his characteristic grim self-awareness, questioning his agency \u2014 \u201cHow pathetic he must have seemed,\u201d he reflects, \u201cto take what had happened as if it were simply his due. He did not understand why he had acted like that.\u201d Seizing the opportunity to escape the tedious yet all-consuming power dynamics of office life, he decides his new job should involve \u201cuseful simple manual work\u201d and ends up on the night shift stocking shelves at a grocery store. He bungles everything from the routine smoking of a spliff to his relationship with his long-suffering partner, Heather.\n\nAs the title suggests, Rainey\u2019s pathetic nature is infused with a particularly British wetness, both unremarkable and unrelenting; though Szalay is Hungarian-Canadian, he betrays his London upbringing in a prose infused with self-deprecating cheek (the list of pubs Rainey associates with better days is nearly a page long). As a result, the novel, which begins in 2004 and was published in Britain in 2008, has taken a while to reach American readers.\n\nBut the lag makes surprisingly little difference. Despite having been written before the global economic recession and the ongoing so-called crisis of masculinity, \u201cLondon and the South-East\u201d may resonate more now than when it first appeared. Clever but never cruel, Szalay renders male pain as few writers have managed, without veering into sexism or caricature. The inevitable pity you feel for Rainey is yet another insult, but Szalay\u2019s knack for the matter-of-fact can elevate observations of the unexceptional to moving poignancy: \u201cIf it is hyperbolic to talk about \u2018tragedy,\u2019\u201d he writes of Rainey\u2019s brief snooker career, \u201ca sad sense, at least, of something squandered.\u201d Later, he simply notes, \u201cIt is all so sad.\u201d\n\nIn the 10 years since publishing this novel, Szalay has written three books, including last year\u2019s Man Booker-shortlisted story collection, \u201cAll That Man Is.\u201d Having recently claimed a \u201cdisaffection with the novel form,\u201d today\u2019s Szalay himself may find that his debut, conventional in plot and structure, reads a little stale. But for me, \u201cLondon and the South-East\u201d was like the porridge Rainey prepares as his daily breakfast/dinner when he wakes up at 5 p.m. for the night shift: traditional, sure, but also hearty and fulfilling, and somehow able to offer a kind of redemption.", "title": "A Cheeky Novel of Male Vulnerability Hits the U.S. at Last, Timelier Than Ever", "authors": ["Lauren Oyler", "David Szalay"]}
{"date": "2018-01-05 00:00:00", "text": "Of the global powers that dominated the 19th century, China alone is a rejuvenated empire. The Communist Party commands a vast territory that the ethnic-Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty cobbled together through war and diplomacy. And the dominion could grow: China is using its military to test potential control of disputed borderlands from the South China Sea to the Himalayas, while firing up nationalism at home. Once again, states around the world pay homage to the court, as in 2015 during a huge military parade.\n\nFor decades, the United States was a global beacon for those who embraced certain values \u2014 the rule of law, free speech, clean government and human rights. Even if policy often fell short of those stated ideals, American \u201csoft power\u201d remained as potent as its armed forces. In the post-Soviet era, political figures and scholars regarded that American way of amassing power through attraction as a central element of forging a modern empire.\n\nChina\u2019s rise is a blunt counterpoint. From 2009 onward, Chinese power in domestic and international realms has become synonymous with brute strength, bribery and browbeating \u2014 and the Communist Party\u2019s empire is getting stronger.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt home, the party has imprisoned rights lawyers, strangled the internet, compelled companies and universities to install party cells, and planned for a potentially Orwellian \u201csocial credit\u201d system. Abroad, it is building military installations on disputed Pacific reefs and infiltrating cybernetworks. It pushes the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d infrastructure initiative across Eurasia, which will have benefits for other nations but will also allow China to pressure them to do business with Chinese state-owned enterprises, as it has done in recent years throughout Asia and Africa.\n\nSo far, Chinese soft power plays a minor role. For one thing, the party insists on tight control of cultural production, so Chinese popular culture has little global appeal next to that of the United States or even South Korea.\n\nNo nation knows China\u2019s hard ways better than Norway. China punished it by breaking diplomatic and economic ties for six years after the independent Nobel committee in 2010 gave the Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo, a pro-democracy writer imprisoned in China (he died of cancer in July).\n\nPresident Xi Jinping is the avatar of the new imperium. The 19th Party Congress in October was his victory lap. Party officials enshrined \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d in the party constitution, putting him on par with Mao Zedong. Mr. Xi said China had entered a \u201cnew era\u201d of strength and the party would be the arbiter of public life. Mr. Xi holds appeal for foreign leaders aspiring to strongman status \u2014 President Trump openly admires him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

This belief was rooted in abstract hope rather than empirical evidence. It was like peering through the toxic air enveloping Chinese cities in search of blue sky.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe culture of hard power goes from top to bottom. In the provinces, party officials move quickly to suppress any challenges to their authority. When they sense rising mass resistance, they buy off or imprison the leaders.\n\nI saw this in my first year in China, when officials separately broke the will of parents furious over deadly tainted milk and ones grieving over thousands of children who had died in shoddily built schools during the Sichuan earthquake. I learned this was typical of the approach taken by Chinese officials. Most Chinese do not run afoul of the party, but those who do pay a high price.\n\nThe abuse of power is frequent, and many Chinese say corruption is their top concern. All other issues, from environmental degradation to wealth inequality, are linked to it. Mr. Xi is canny enough to capitalize on the discontent: He leads an anticorruption drive that allows him to oust rivals and enforce party discipline.\n\nNone of that results in the rule of law. And China\u2019s domestic security budget has exceeded that of its military in recent years, even as both grow rapidly, highlighting the nation\u2019s investment in hard power.\n\nVideo\n\nI learned in 2016 that Tashi Wangchuk, a young entrepreneur who had spoken to me about his advocacy for broader Tibetan language education, had been detained in his hometown, Yushu, by police officers. In microblog posts, Mr. Tashi had asked local officials to promote true bilingual education, and he had appeared in 2015 in Times articles and video.\n\nMr. Tashi is the kind of citizen China should value \u2014 someone working within the law to recommend policies that would benefit ordinary people and ease tensions. But two years later, Mr. Tashi remains imprisoned. A court tried him on Thursday for \u201cinciting separatism\u201d despite criticism from Western diplomats and human rights groups.\n\nThe party\u2019s style of rule threatens to turn sentiments against China even as the empire grows in stature. History teaches us about an inevitable dialectic: Power creates resistance. While the state can bend people to its will, those people meet it with fear and suspicion. The United States learns this lesson each time it over-relies on hard power.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI traveled often to the frontier regions because it was there that the dynamic of power and resistance was most evident, and that I got the clearest look at how China treats its most vulnerable citizens, those outside mainstream ethnic Han culture. No other areas better embody the idea of imperial China. Conquered by the Manchus and reabsorbed by Mao, these lands make up at least one-quarter of Chinese territory. Party officials fear they are like the Central Asian regions under Soviet rule \u2014 always on the verge of rebellion and eager to break free.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn October 2016, I quietly entered the sprawling Tibetan Buddhist settlement of Larung Gar and watched the government-ordered demolition of homes of monks and nuns. In parts of Xinjiang populated by ethnic Uighurs, the tension is even greater, fueled by cycles of violence and repression. Uighurs speak in hushed tones of restrictions on Islam and mass detentions. Signs across Xinjiang forbid long beards and full veils, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. On my last reporting trip in China, to the Silk Road oasis of Kashgar, I saw police patrols in riot gear rounding up young men.\n\nAn important bellwether is Hong Kong, the former British colony from which my parents emigrated to the United States. On this southern frontier, as in the west, the party works to silence the voices of students, politicians and other residents critical of its rule. Agents have even abducted booksellers. But those moves have actually led to more resistance and strengthened Hong Kong and Cantonese identity. They have also stoked greater fears of Beijing among citizens of Taiwan, the self-governing island that the party longs to rule.\n\nIt is not a stretch to say the party\u2019s ways of governance perpetuate a lack of trust by the Chinese in their institutions and fellow citizens. And its international policies light the kindling of resistance overseas, from Australia to Ghana.\n\nChinese citizens and the world would benefit if China turns out to be an empire whose power is based as much on ideas, values and culture as on military and economic might. It was more enlightened under its most glorious dynasties. But for now, the Communist Party embraces hard power and coercion, and this could well be what replaces the fading liberal hegemony of the United States on the global stage.\n\nIt will not lead to a grand vision of world order. Instead, before us looms a void.", "title": "A Chinese Empire Reborn", "authors": ["Edward Wong"]}

While Hughes\u2019s tone is both scholarly and rich in visual detail, Fidler entertains us with novelistic vignettes and cut-and-paste erudition, though he wobbles a little here and there. In a timeline that precedes the main narrative we are informed, for example, that the city was \u201crenamed Istanbul\u201d in 1453. In fact, the Ottomans kept the name Kostantiniyye in official usage until the dissolution of their empire in 1923, and the two names were used in parallel fashion by court officials. \u201cIstanbul,\u201d in any case, comes from the common Greek expression \u201ceis tin polin,\u201d \u201cinto the city,\u201d and was a word used by both Turks and Greeks long before Mehmet\u2019s conquest. As always with this great hybrid city, the continuities have as much force as the momentous changes. That said, Fidler displays great charm in the telling of his tale, spicing it with delicious gossip.\n\nTake the story of Nicephoros II Phokas, the ruthless mid-10th-century emperor who turned the tide of Byzantine military fortunes with a series of brilliant victories against Arab armies, culminating in the reconquest of Cyprus and Aleppo. In the summer of 968, the Lombard bishop Luitprand of Cremona visited Constantinople to negotiate a marriage contract between the family of Nicephoros and the future Otto II, king of Italy. Tensions between East and West were running high. Nicephoros treated the bishop shabbily, and Luitprand returned the favor with some unfavorable immortalizations. \u201cHe is a monstrosity of a man,\u201d Luitprand wrote, \u201cfat-headed and with tiny mole\u2019s eyes. A short, broad, thick beard disfigures him, half going gray and disgraced by a neck scarcely an inch long, which is pig-like by reason of the big close bristles on his beard. In color he is like an Ethiopian and, as the poet says, \u2018you would not want to meet him in the dark.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nInterestingly, this tale doesn\u2019t appear in Hughes\u2019s account. Instead, she goes from a discussion of the Viking presence in the 11th century to a lovely depiction of everyday life inside the walls of the city in that period and from thence to a consideration of the rich and productive cultural rivalry between the Christian empire and the caliphate, an overlooked period of synthesis and mutual imitation. She draws our attention to the \u201cpolychrome\u201d mosaic of the Near East and the polyphony of the great Greek-speaking Roman city that lay at its heart, and rightly so. Much that we now consider \u201cWestern\u201d had its roots in that mosaic.\n\nHughes argues that in this period \u2014 just before the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 heralded the arrival of a new enemy, the Turks \u2014 the two religions and empires had found a way of coexisting: \u201cThe men and women of Constantinople knew, from firsthand experience, of the conviction within the vast Muslim empire that thickly rimmed their lands. Hot-headed, unilateral aggression would only result in jihad. Constantinople, the City of God, was an entity that needed guarding, not squandering, that had to rely on displays of diplomacy and strength rather than on direct aggression.\u201d\n\nYet surely the rivalry had itself been made more potent by the military successes of Nicephoros at precisely this time and the recalibrating of influence his \u201cdirect aggression\u201d had achieved. After all, the reconquest of the largely Greek city of Aleppo in 962 was no small matter; it was a demoralizing catastrophe for the Hamdanid regime on the Arab side. And the pig-like emperor ridiculed by Luitprand was so violent and austere in his military methods that he was known as \u201cThe Pale Death of the Saracens.\u201d\n\nOf course, historians always omit some things and include others that seem more important to them, and so it should be. Neither Hughes nor Fidler ignores the violent arrival in Byzantine lands of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan in the late 11th century (Fidler notes that his mustache was so long it had to be tied behind his head to keep it from flying into his eyes during battle) and with him the beginning of Christian Constantinople\u2019s long decline.\n\nLike the Ottoman sultans who would succeed him, Arslan filled his court with mathematicians and literati, including the Persian poet Omar Khayyam, and in the end the eventual transformation of the Christian city into a Muslim one entailed less disruption and destruction than is commonly imagined. The Istanbul of Suleiman was every bit as imperial and cosmopolitan as that of Justinian, and it\u2019s a virtue of both books that they\u2019re able to depict this transformation subtly while at the same time showing how intricate and improbable Istanbul\u2019s history has been. The effect is rather like stumbling across the Serpent Column late at night after carousing in Istanbul\u2019s 21st-century nightclubs: a melancholic sense of historical vertigo.", "title": "A City Where East Meets West and the Past Is Always Present", "authors": ["Lawrence Osborne"]}

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "At least once a week, I arrive home from the office I share with a dozen other writers and, overwhelmed with hunger, immediately begin to cook. I pull out my scratched enamelware pot. I measure in rice, quinoa and water with a generous pinch of salt and set it on the stove to cook. I take a block of medium-firm tofu from its package, pat it dry, slice it into pieces and drizzle it with Bragg\u2019s liquid aminos, soy sauce\u2019s unfermented hippie cousin. Then I rummage through the crisper for leafy greens or broccoli \u2014 whatever I can find \u2014 and trim away the woody bits. I fry the tofu in coconut oil, boil the vegetables, cut some herbs from the garden box and serve myself dinner in my favorite shallow bowl with a healthy smear of chile paste.\n\nThe entire process takes about 40 minutes. The meal is just healthful enough to justify a little self-righteousness. And though the curious trio of tofu, Bragg\u2019s and coconut oil eventually transform to bear savory, custardy bites, this dish is about more than just tastes and textures. I grew up thinking of tofu as bland, rubbery filler food, but steeped in aminos, the semisoft tofu melts away with each bite, leaving behind a steamy, satisfying contrail of salt and umami. The coconut oil lends a trace of its sweet, tropical aroma as it yields a crisp, lacy crust. Mixed with quinoa, the rice becomes nutty and complex, a chewy counterpoint to the tender tofu. With only a few steps and five main ingredients, the dish barely requires a recipe, but the relish with which I eat it, the way I look forward to and relax into that steamy bowl, make me feel a way only a handful of dishes have over the course of my life. In the last few years, this funny, nourishing, simple meal has somehow become my preferred comfort food.\n\nBy definition, comfort foods are rich and creamy, or evocative of childhood pleasures. But this dish contains no butter, cheese or chicken stock, the pillars atop which classic comfort foods are built. Quinoa and tofu don\u2019t stoke a nostalgic flame \u2014 or even an ancestral one \u2014 for me. But this meal reflects a pair of friendships so nourishing that they\u2019ve enveloped me in the sisterhood I\u2019ve always sought. While I grew up in suburban Southern California in the 1980s, my friends Mara and Twilight Greenaway were scampering up avocado trees and pulling weeds on a little farm atop a mound of cooled lava half an ocean away, in Hawaii. When we all ended up in the Bay Area 20-some years later, I was working in a restaurant with Mara\u2019s best friend while Twilight wrote about food and farming. Our lives were bound to intersect, and they did, around the table.\n\nAt first, I was the one cooking for them. But several years ago, the restaurant I ran closed, and I shifted away from professional cooking. Just as I lost my steady source of income and health insurance, I injured my knee and fell into a devastating depression. I couldn\u2019t cook for myself, let alone anyone else, so Twilight and Mara began to cook for me. Whenever I could muster the energy, I\u2019d visit one or the other, sit at her table and let her sheathe me in friendship.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt first, apologies accompanied every meal. The sisters worried constantly that the simple dishes they served me \u2014 saut\u00e9ed greens, roast chicken, pots of beans \u2014 weren\u2019t impressive enough to serve a chef. But the value of eating at a friend\u2019s table is found around it, not on it. I\u2019ll eat anything, even foods I\u2019ve always shunned, when a friend cooks it. And besides, they\u2019re both great cooks.

{"date": "2018-01-23 00:00:00", "text": "Perhaps Mr. Noll\u2019s identity shouldn\u2019t have mattered. His historical evidence and the power of his arguments would be worth considering even if he were Catholic, Jewish or secular. But his identity did matter. It mattered because my evangelical students could not simply assume bad faith on the author\u2019s part. They knew Mr. Noll cared about evangelicals as a group of people. Instead of dismissing Mr. Noll as a bigot, my students thoughtfully engaged with his work.\n\nSince then, I have taken identity into account every time I have assigned new books for one of my courses. I currently teach a course called Black Intellectuals, which is focused on debates around racial inequality in the post-civil rights era. It tends to attract progressive students who, in analyzing racial inequality, are drawn to arguments that stress structural obstacles to equality and the enduring power of white racism, especially in our criminal justice system. The course features black authors who do defend that view, but I also teach the work of others who depart from it in some measure, including heterodox thinkers like Thomas Chatterton Williams and conservatives like Jason Riley. Much like my conservative evangelical students at Cornell, my progressive students at Claremont McKenna College are less likely to assume these contrarian black thinkers are acting in bad faith or are motivated by bigotry \u2014 even when the thinkers criticize hip-hop culture or defend white police officers. So the students engage the challenging arguments and ideas instead.\n\nAs conservatives have long observed and psychologists have since confirmed, human beings are hive-minded animals whose moral judgments are shaped more by sentiments than by reason. Thus, when we are confronted by arguments we disagree with, we can easily find reasons to reject them. The search for disconfirming evidence, however, can sometimes be short-circuited, especially when we feel close to the person making an argument we disagree with. As the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt concluded in his 2012 book, \u201cThe Righteous Mind,\u201d if we have \u201caffection, admiration, or desire to please\u201d other people, we lean toward them and attempt to \u201cfind the truth\u201d in their arguments. Social proximity matters.\n\nIf we want our students to consider the work of authors they\u2019re inclined to disagree with, we professors must take the identity of those authors into account. This doesn\u2019t mean scrubbing all white men from our syllabuses. But when we design an education for our students, we should remember that humans are partial, tribal beings \u2014 not rational automatons.\n\nSome readers \u2014 especially those on the right \u2014 may suspect that embracing identity in this way will only embolden campus radicals. But that objection ignores an important truth: Practicing the new identity politics in the right way can subvert the dogmas that drive its excesses. When students read books by a broad intellectual range of evangelical or female or black authors, for example, they learn that there is no single evangelical or female or black perspective. Disagreements about ideas transcend these social categories.\n\nThe left has often placed too much faith in the power of human reason. Conservatives make the same error when they insist that the identities of intellectuals should never matter. The fact is, they do. And they would, even absent new movements on campus.", "title": "Opinion | A Conservative Case for Identity Politics", "authors": []}

He lived in a gilded tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue but nevertheless became the voice of the left-behind. He made his public reputation as a reality-TV star but nevertheless defeated one of the most experienced politicians in the land. Trump has done so many extraordinary things in his first year in office, from tweeting about nuclear war to conducting public business in sight of paying guests in a resort he owns, it\u2019s easy to forget that, unless impeachment intervenes, he still has another three years \u2014 and perhaps seven \u2014 to go.\n\nTrump\u2019s election has set off a furious competition among America\u2019s pundits to explain what is going on: The most depressing political story of our time is also the most exciting. David Frum has usually been at or near the front of the pundit pack with a succession of articles in The Atlantic, where he is a senior editor. Most commentators are dyed-in-the-wool liberals who exhausted the language of fulmination during George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. Frum worked for Bush and even had a hand in writing his \u201caxis of evil\u201d speech. Most commentators regard conservative America as an alien land inhabited by monsters. Frum has been writing sharp but sympathetic books on that land since his first, \u201cDead Right,\u201d on the weaknesses of Reaganism, in 1994. The central theme in Frum\u2019s excellent new book, \u201cTrumpocracy,\u201d which draws on his Atlantic articles, is what Trump\u2019s career tells us about the deeper structural problems of America in general, and conservative America in particular.\n\nFrum argues that Trump\u2019s greatest talent \u2014 his genius really \u2014 is spotting and exploiting weaknesses. The Republican establishment spent $100 million to put the crown on Prince Jeb Bush\u2019s head. Trump incinerated Bush (and all that cash) with his gibe about \u201clow energy.\u201d He then proceeded to incinerate \u201clittle\u201d Marco Rubio and \u201clyin\u2019\u201d Ted Cruz. Trump\u2019s campaign against Hillary Clinton was in some ways a model of how not to run campaigns \u2014 he lurched from crisis to crisis and never bothered to enumerate any detailed policies. But he understood her great limitation: that she represented the nexus between meritocracy and plutocracy, indebted to Big Money and divorced from millions of heartland Americans.\n\nTrump\u2019s political operatics worked because he understood deeper weaknesses in American society. The white working class is suffering from two great hammer blows. The first is to its economic well-being: A group that thrived during the golden years of the 1950s and 1960s has seen its incomes stagnate and its job security disappear. Great swaths of white America now suffer from maladies that are all too familiar to black America: broken homes, drug addiction, listlessness, early death. The second hammer blow is to its psychological well-being: Even as their economic position has declined, members of the white working class \u2014 particularly white working-class men \u2014 have seen themselves denounced, often by people who spend more on college education in one year than they earn shoveling dirt, as agents of privilege and oppression. What better way to respond to being defined as a problem than to vote for a man who promises to punch back?\n\nTrump grasped that America is suffering from an epistemological weakness as well as economic ones: The line between truth and falsehood is becoming dangerously blurred. Again, America\u2019s knowledge elite is partly responsible for this: Armies of postmodern academics had prepared the way for Trump by arguing that truth is a construct of the power elite. But the biggest culprit is technological progress. Digitalization is not only creating a deafening cacophony of voices. It is also making it harder to finance real journalism while simultaneously making it easier to distribute tripe.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Manhattan-based playboy who has had life handed to him on a silver platter might look like a strange vehicle for the pain of the American heartland. But Trump is a winner with the soul of a loser: He is consumed by imagined slights to his fragile ego, hypersensitive to the pretensions of smarty-pants liberals, a man who spends many hours a day watching cable news and seething with anger. He is also an anti-intellectual with the soul of a postmodernist: He believes that reality is something that can be bent into any shape you choose provided that you have enough power.\n\nWhat does Trump want to do with all his power? The answer, Frum argues, certainly does not lie in helping the white working class that put him in the White House. His tax cuts will widen America\u2019s already high levels of inequality. It lies instead in \u201cthe aggrandizement of one domineering man and his shamelessly grasping extended family.\u201d The essence of Trumponomics is running a country just as you run your family business: appointing people with whom you have strong personal ties, ideally ties of DNA, directing business to your properties, using public resources to avenge private grudges. Trump\u2019s appointments to the White House staff included his former bodyguard, Keith Schiller, and a former contestant on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Perhaps the most telling moment in his first year was when he asked his daughter Ivanka to sit in his seat at a G-7 meeting, thereby reducing a great republic to the level of a family property.\n\nPhoto\n\nFrum thinks the combination of Trump\u2019s drive for self-aggrandizement and America\u2019s current weaknesses is nothing less than a threat to the democratic order. \u201cThe thing to fear from the Trump presidency is not the bold overthrow of the Constitution, but the stealthy paralysis of governance; not the open defiance of law, but an accumulating subversion of norms; not the deployment of state power to intimidate dissidents, but the incitement of private violence to radicalize supporters.\u201d Any supposed solutions to Trump\u2019s behavior, however, may be worse than the disease: American liberals have found themselves investing extraordinary hopes in the generals who now surround the president.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t alone in the weakness-exploitation business. Some of the most eye-catching investors in his real estate empire since he won the Republican nomination hail from countries where there is a faint line between business and politics. And some of Trump\u2019s biggest ideological backers have an almost apocalyptic sense that America needs to be purged in order to be saved. Hanging over everything is the figure of Vladimir Putin, a man who has devoted his career to accumulating information on weaknesses, both personal and political, and turning that information into power. Rather than Russia turning into America, as America\u2019s policymakers argued in that great age of illusion, the 1990s, America seems to be turning into Russia.\n\nThe immediate task facing the American republic is to limit the damage that Trump can cause: Here the checks and balances are already playing the role that the founders intended. But the bigger task is to eliminate the weaknesses that have produced Trumpism. Frum rightly points out that these are broad as well as deep. The travails of the white working class are symptoms of a bigger problem: the concentration of wealth in a narrow range of industries and companies. Likewise, the corruption embodied in Trump Inc. is the product of a broader corruption of America\u2019s governing class, which has allowed Bill and Hillary Clinton to transform themselves into public-service millionaires and Barack and Michelle Obama to negotiate a reported $65 million book deal for their autobiographies.

(Various Fox News commentators and others have tried to spin a tale in which the Clinton campaign effectively started the F.B.I. investigation, via Steele and Fusion.)\n\nWe still don\u2019t know how much of the information in Steele\u2019s infamous Trump dossier is accurate. Either way, Steele and Fusion are only supporting players in this story. The main questions are about Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia \u2014 not the people trying to figure out what was happening between the campaign and Russia.\n\nRelated: In The Times, Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, defends its decision to publish the Steele dossier one year ago today.\n\nPerspective. The story of Russian collusion is devilishly complicated. Susan Hennessey \u2014 a legal expert whose work I\u2019ve often cited in this newsletter \u2014 offered an especially clear summary in a recent podcast with Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein. She described two scenarios \u2014 one more innocent, one less so. Here are the basics:\n\nThe innocent explanation: Amateurish Trump officials unwittingly blundered into a campaign by Russia to influence American policy and create chaos. The Trump officials cooperated with Russian nationals because they didn\u2019t know they shouldn\u2019t. They then lied about their contacts because those contacts were embarrassing, not because they were part of a sophisticated conspiracy. As Hennessey puts it, \u201cthe cover up is worse than the crime.\u201d\n\nThe less-innocent explanation: Top Trump officials understood that they were doing something wrong. Perhaps they were trying to help their campaign with tactics they understood were wrong. Or perhaps they were working to advance the interests of a foreign power, because of financial entanglements between those officials \u2014 maybe including Trump \u2014 and Russia. These officials, and others who were aware of the entanglements, then lied about the contacts. In that case, Hennessey explains, \u201cthe decision making at the top of the executive branch is not in any meaningful way being guided by the best interests of the American people.\u201d\n\nLast year, I walked through five possible motivations for the Trump team\u2019s strange friendliness with Russia, including some of the possibilities mentioned here.

This comes on the heels of the same rulings last year regarding Haitians and Nicaraguans. Salvadorans, however, are by far the largest group of T.P.S. recipients \u2014 approximately two-thirds of the remaining beneficiaries.\n\nJust like the decision to end the DACA program for nearly 800,000 undocumented childhood arrivals, the T.P.S. announcement is politically motivated and is probably an attempt to satisfy President Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant base. Although the choice to end a supposedly temporary program that has nonetheless lasted for 17 years may sound rational, the real-world consequences of such a wide-reaching move will be immediate and severe \u2014 and may even contribute to a new cycle of illegal immigration.\n\nMany, if not most, are unlikely to voluntarily return to a country that they no longer call home and instead may seek to stay illegally. The widespread fear instilled by this ruling, and the possible deportations to come, will tear apart families and communities. In effect, as of September 2019 there will be a group of newly unauthorized migrants living in the United States equivalent to the population of Salt Lake City. After almost two decades in the United States, Salvadoran T.P.S. recipients have built lives, communities and businesses. In many cities \u2014 above all Washington and Los Angeles \u2014 they are an important part of the economic and social fabric. They are parents to approximately 192,700 United States-born citizens.\n\nIronically, if T.P.S. recipients are deported, a primary beneficiary will be one of President Trump\u2019s most-stated enemies: the MS-13 gang, which he has accused of turning United States communities \u201cinto bloodstained killing fields.\u201d The criminal organization, which is active in both the United States and El Salvador, traces its roots to instability after a wave of deportations from the United States in the 1990s, which El Salvador was ill equipped to receive. It didn\u2019t take long for the resulting instability to bounce back to the United States in the form of increased criminal activity and illegal immigration.", "title": "Opinion | A Counterproductive Approach to a Broken Immigration System", "authors": []}

My plan was to visit the evocatively named village of Cocodrilo (crocodile) with Dr. Guggenheim, who since 2015 has worked with a local group there called Red Alerta to protect its pristine coral reefs. It is a singular Cuban-American joint venture. His Washington-based N.G.O., Ocean Doctor, provides equipment and trains villagers to work as guides instead of fishing illegally \u2014 a standard ecotourism model in other parts of the world, but a radical departure in Cuba, where the economy is still mostly state-run and grass-roots activism is discouraged.\n\n\u201cAs fearful as we are of thousands of Americans going down to Cuba and recreating the mass tourism model that destroyed much of the Caribbean,\u201d he told me in Nueva Gerona, \u201ctourism has to be part of the solution.\u201d (Because it is research-based, the Red Alerta program has been unaffected by recent changes to travel for American citizens, but visits have to be arranged through an authorized travel agency or Ocean Doctor.)\n\nBut La Isla has not shaken off its Cold War past. The Cuban military monitors the various southern nature reserves, and we soon discovered that the whole area had been declared off-limits \u2014 no explanation given.

Our first mission was to snorkel off a popular beach called Punto Franc\u00e9s, where two years ago Dr. Guggenheim had seen intact expanses of elkhorn coral, a barometer of reef health. Even an amateur like me could tell that all was not well below the waves. \u201cThat is a wonderful example of a reef that is 90 percent dead,\u201d Dr. Guggenheim said with a sigh, as we dried off back on board. There had been some bleaching from climate change, he explained, but the main culprit was overfishing, which led to the coral being slowly covered in slimy green algae. \u201cWe treat fish like crops to be harvested,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they have important jobs to do in the ecosystem.

Morgan Babst\u2019s powerful debut novel, \u201cThe Floating World,\u201d revives our memory of what seemed at the time like the mother of all storms.\n\nThe novel follows the members of a New Orleans family immediately after Hurricane Katrina, alternating among their perspectives. There is Tess, a white doctor who comes from money, and her husband, Joe, a Creole artist. They have two grown daughters, the distressed Cora and the willful Del. Cora is the only one to stay for the storm; Del is away in New York and the others evacuate. Though Tess will eventually come to her daughter\u2019s aid, and Del will return, Cora sees something in the 25 days she\u2019s without her family that leaves her even more frazzled than before.\n\nUnlike Jesmyn Ward\u2019s powerful Katrina novel, the National Book Award-winning \u201cSalvage the Bones,\u201d most of this story takes place after landfall. And with visions of the storm sneaking into even the most discordant scenes, inescapable loss permeates each page. At one point, the perfection of a Tollhouse cookie in the imperfect city brings tears to Tess\u2019s eyes. At another, Del gets a \u201cfeeling in her chest like water straining against a door\u201d when her friend-turned-lover says I love you. Sometimes \u2014 especially in Tess\u2019s, Del\u2019s and Joe\u2019s sections \u2014 the sense of loss becomes almost oppressive. In reality the storm\u2019s impact was unrelenting, no doubt, but Babst is most effective at conveying the emotional weight of the tragedy when she presents it alongside vibrant characters and story lines.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne of the most vibrant is the family patriarch, Vincent, whom Babst brings to life in a portrayal that\u2019s impressively unrestrained, even Faulknerian. Because of his memory limitations, we see his whole life stream forward as if in the present tense, outside of the storm\u2019s temporal confines. We taste the stuffed crab and pocket pies he ate on a street the city has since replaced with an interstate he doesn\u2019t remember. We feel the comfort of his mother\u2019s rocking chair, the relief of his dog come back to assure him everything will be O.K.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBabst also shines in her depiction of Cora. The book\u2019s short middle section ingeniously tracks back to before the storm, and Cora glimmers on the page: a fragile, na\u00efve yet thoughtful woman reminiscent of Laura in \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d\n\nAny novel of the South has to grapple with race at least implicitly, and \u201cThe Floating World\u201d doesn\u2019t shy from the subject. Cora is romantically involved with Troy, an African-American restaurant worker whose sister, Reyna, is mentally ill. Though Joe identifies as Creole, and Cora and Del are biracial, they are economically privileged. So it was wise on Babst\u2019s part to introduce the poorer Troy and Reyna to a book about Katrina \u2014 a storm that touched so many poor African-American lives, after all. Unfortunately, Reyna rarely rises above stereotype, either sentimentalized by Cora or demonized by Troy. And her fate is too often and too superficially linked to Cora\u2019s story, without recognizing her independent significance as a mother of two, or just as a complex character. She feels like a missed opportunity to pay authentic attention to the plight of the people who arguably saw the worst of the storm.", "title": "A Debut Novelist\u2019s Elegy for Post-Katrina New Orleans", "authors": ["Margaret Wilkerson Sexton", "C.

Looking through the lens he saw with such acuity and drew so precisely (freehand) that some of his renderings still appear in text books. And yet he also drew with such delicacy and vivacity that his drawings stand on their own as wonders of graphic expression, both mysterious and familiar.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe drawings are at once fairly hard-nosed fact if you know your science. If you don\u2019t they are deep pools of suggestive motifs into which the imagination can dive. Their lines, forms and various textures of stippling, dashes and faint pencil circles would be the envy of any modern artist. That they connect with Surrealist drawing, biomorphic abstraction and exquisite doodling is only the half of it.\n\nThese small works evoke enough things you already know \u2014 landscape, weather systems, trees, marine life \u2014 that they bring you back around to reality, implying the multiple purposes if not universality of certain natural structures. Root systems, functioning in different ways, are found in trees, turnips and the pyramidal neuron, which Cajal called \u201cthe noble and enigmatic cell of thought.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBorn in Navarra, the son of a doctor, Cajal was a rebellious artistic child, with an innate distrust of authority and an obsessive-compulsive proclivity. At 8, according to the catalog, he drew everything around him and then set out to collect everything pertaining to birds. He taught himself photography, making carefully posed self-portraits throughout his life. And he trained as an artist, but his father cajoled him toward medicine by enlisting him to make anatomical drawings as teaching aids. The son then went to medical school and eventually found his calling in researching the extremely refined, nearly invisible workings of the brain. It was an exciting area of study at that time and it perfectly fused his various interests and talents.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis show, the first exhibition of Cajal\u2019s drawings in this country, originated at the University of Minnesota and continues in May to the MIT Museum in Cambridge, Mass. It was selected from the 2,900 or so drawings that Ram\u00f3n y Cajal made in his lifetime; all come from the Cajal Institute in Madrid, which organized the show with the university\u2019s Weisman Art Museum and three neuroscientists on its faculty \u2014 Eric A. Newman, Janet M. Dubinsky and Alfonso Araque. The catalog is an absolute treasure, jargon-free, with excellent reproductions and an illuminating biographical essay by Larry W. Swanson, a neurobiologist and author of \u201cBrain Architecture\u201d (2002). The outliers of the group are Lyndel King, director and chief curator of the Weisman and Eric Himmel, editor in chief at Abrams Books (the catalog\u2019s publisher), who contribute a riveting essay detailing Cajal\u2019s artistic sensibility and working processes.\n\nThe drawings will elicit stupefied awe from art enthusiasts, who use their brains without knowing how they work, and excited chatter from visiting neuroscience types. I asked one loquacious, evidently knowledgeable viewer if \u201cgray matter\u201d was a colloquialism or a term of science. I learned that it\u2019s a term of science that became a colloquialism: the brain has gray matter, which contains cells, and also white matter, which is fibrous.\n\nThe 80 drawings here were made between 1890 and 1933, and are divided into four sections. \u201cCells of the Brain\u201d presents some of the basics, beginning with pyramidal neurons, and including the pericellular nests that surround them like pointy hats, or Eva Hesse sculpture, and proceeding to the coral-like Purkinje neurons (from the human and pigeon cerebellum).\n\nIn \u201cSensory Systems,\u201d you\u2019ll find several of the show\u2019s masterpieces: \u201cCells in the retina of the eye,\u201d a vertical stack of textures and intersecting lines and shapes, suggests a wall hanging by a very ambitious fiber artist of the 1950s. Drawings for the retina of the lizard and sparrow evoke espaliered trees. Blue ink added to the peninsular forms of \u201cThe labyrinth of the inner ear,\u201d renders them solid. And the Wagnerian \u201cEnding of the vestibular nerve\u201d is swept with diagonal streams of lines and rising neurons.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cDevelopment and Pathology\u201d is rife with strange aberrant forms and a sense of agitated circuitry; also several outstanding drawings in a purely visual sense. Cajal samples the brain cells of a drowned man and one suffering from paralysis and in \u201cTumor cells of the covering membranes of the brain,\u201d he achieves tangled skeins that conjure William Blake and Louise Bourgeois. Things quiet down in \u201cNeuronal Pathways,\u201d which I recommend for the strange little landscape that is \u201cConnections within the hippocampus.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing the Beautiful Brain Today,\u201d a section on contemporary renderings usually in jolting bright colors, presents animations as well as detailed microscopic photographs that are juxtaposed with reproductions of Cajal drawings of the same subject.

Additionally, Western spy agencies are leery of operations that rely on mass demonstrations, which have a high risk of failure and cannot be easily controlled, the official said.\n\n\u201cCertainly, the West doesn\u2019t have the ground game to engage in that kind of activism, nor do Iran\u2019s regional adversaries,\u201d said Suzanne Maloney, the deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution and a former adviser to senior State Department officials on Iran.\n\nThat logic has not stopped Iranian officials from pointing fingers outside their borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government announced the arrest of an unidentified citizen of an unidentified European country who \u201chad been trained by espionage organizations in Europe,\u201d the Tasnim news agency reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIran has also accused Saudi Arabia, its main regional rival, of fomenting unrest.

Saudi Arabia has leveled similar accusations against Iran, accusing its Shiite Muslim government of stirring up Shiite dissidents in Sunni Muslim-governed Bahrain and in eastern Saudi Arabia.\n\nAn American intelligence official disputed the Iranian claim of a Saudi hand in the protests, saying that it would be difficult for the Saudis, or their allies in the United Arab Emirates, to organize an uprising in Iran. Neither Arab country has a coterie of Persian speakers, links to a proxy opposition force, or the depth of personnel needed for such an operation, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nOnce protests begin, however, any number of countries could try to funnel aid to the protesters.\n\nIranian fears of foreign intervention run deep, as far back as to Alexander the Great, who conquered what was then the Persian Empire around 330 B.C. Modern Iran\u2019s security establishment has long held that the biggest threats to the country come from abroad; the belief that the United States wants a change in government is axiomatic. The evidence, as every Iranian schoolchild knows, is the 1953 plot by the Central Intelligence Agency, code-named Operation Ajax, that overthrew Iran\u2019s prime minister and re-installed the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The kitchen belonged to Punyaratabandhu\u2019s maternal great-grandmother, who grew up outside the city, in central Thailand. \u201cWhen she married my great-grandfather, she brought a lot of traditions from up country,\u201d said Punyaratabandhu, who sometimes found it a little embarrassing when her friends from school came over and saw the clunky, old-fashioned stove.\n\nWhen Punyaratabandhu broke with tradition and moved to Chicago to study philology, her mother shipped over a steady supply of Thai cookbooks, persuading friends and relatives who were making the trip to carry a few with them. \u201cPart of her was afraid of losing her daughter, culturally,\u201d Punyaratabandu said. \u201cSo she tried to lure me back to my roots using the thing she knew would be most powerful: food.\u201d Over time, Punyaratabandhu became a food blogger, an author and an authority on Thai food, not only cooking but also tracing dishes through different eras, meticulously tracking their changes. What she found, time and time again, was that cooking wasn\u2019t static. That it didn\u2019t make sense to stubbornly romanticize a single past version. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as authenticity, at least not as most people understand it,\u201d she said. Instead, Punyaratabandhu thought of each dish as having a core set of ingredients that defined its identity, and even those sets could shift.", "title": "A Garlicky Stir-Fry With Basil Leaves From Bangkok", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "Television would never do that, of course, but McGregor does. Over 13 chapters, each marking a year, he traces the lives of more than two dozen of the town\u2019s inhabitants. There is birth, death, marriage, divorce, sex, romances kindled and snuffed out. And this is only half the action, because the turn of the seasons, the weather and the life cycles of plants and animals occupy almost as much of the narrative as the activities of the human characters do.\n\nImage\n\nMcGregor is a beautiful, controlled writer, who can convey the pathos of a life in a few lines. Despite the large cast of characters, each feels specific and real, from the vicar, Jane Hughes, who is the closest thing this reticent town has to a therapist, to Gordon Jackson, the town\u2019s Casanova, who, in a sympathetic twist, often seems more hopeful than his bedmates do about the possibility of a lasting relationship.\n\nMcGregor captures a village culture that is simultaneously gossipy and reserved. We are frequently told a character \u201cwas seen\u201d doing this or that, but not by whom. When a single mother moves to town with her children, we learn that \u201cthere were questions\u201d \u2014 about her background and where the father is \u2014 \u201cbut nothing was said to her face.\u201d When one character\u2019s mentally ill sister is taken away in an ambulance, \u201cnobody thought it appropriate to ask questions and he didn\u2019t volunteer.\u201d A widow, covered with bruises from her developmentally disabled son, flinches when anyone gently tries to probe what is going on.\n\nThe only flaw in this unconventional but affecting novel is that its central metaphor \u2014 the girl\u2019s disappearance \u2014 remains obscure. So does the symbolism of the village\u2019s 13 reservoirs, which figure in the search and in the title, and are echoed in the girl\u2019s age and the number of chapters.\n\nWe learn that the reservoirs were created, many years before, by flooding valleys; at their bottoms are the ruins of old villages. Perhaps McGregor means for the drowned villages, like the missing girl, to represent the secrets beneath the surface of any life. Or perhaps he means for them to gesture toward the sweep of history, reminding us that the struggles that seem so momentous to one group of people will someday be forgotten.\n\nThe book ends, quietly, at the close of the 13th year. A character who is bedridden by a stroke listens from his house to his neighbors singing \u201cSilent Night\u201d in the church, with his granddaughter performing a solo. The town takes a breath.

Kevin Spacey won the category at the 72nd ceremony for his performance in \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a series that fired him late last year after men came forward to accuse him of unwanted sexual advances.)\n\nThe Amazon series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d about a perfectionist 1950s housewife who becomes a stand-up comic, won the Globe for best TV comedy, and its star, Rachel Brosnahan, collected the trophy for best actress in a comedy.\n\n\u201cTheir support was completely unwavering,\u201d Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show\u2019s creator, said of Amazon from the stage while wearing a top hat festooned with feathers. She made no mention of Roy Price, who had helped push forward the series before resigning in October following accusations of sexual harassment.\n\nA night draped in black\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Globes were draped in black, quite literally, with actresses and some actors vowing to use their attire to make a statement about sexual harassment in Hollywood and other spheres. Winners were expected to use their moments of glory to rail against the systemic sexism and silence that allowed the behavior of men like Mr. Weinstein, James Toback, Louis C.K. and Mr. Spacey to fester for decades.\n\nOn the red carpet, eight actresses walked hand in hand with activists who focus on sexual harassment and gender inequality.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to create hierarchies \u2014 saying that women in Hollywood are more important than other women,\u201d Marai Larasi, the executive director of Imkaan, a British network of organizations dedicated to ending violence against black women, said on the E! arrivals special. \u201cWe have a platform, and we\u2019re trying to use it in the best way we possibly can.\u201d Ms. Larasi attended as Emma Watson\u2019s guest.\n\nBut the tone on the red carpet was not entirely serious. Smiles abounded. Along with discussion about women\u2019s rights came lighthearted banter by nominees about butterflies (the stomach variety) and some of the usual fashion chitchat. Alexis Bledel carried a black crystal clutch from Onna Ehrlich; Gucci dressed Margot Robbie and Dakota Johnson.\n\nAnd inside the ballroom, the ceremony in many ways felt like business as usual. Stars, producers and studio executives schmoozed in frantic fashion during the commercial breaks and straight through some awards. The vibe even approached easygoing and carefree \u2014 as if Hollywood felt it had exculpated itself with all of the serious talk on the red carpet and the sharp-edged jokes Mr. Meyers cracked during his monologue.", "title": "A Golden Globes Draped in Black Addresses #MeToo", "authors": ["Brooks Barnes", "Cara Buckley"]}

He can make your eyes water with a lyrical description of tropical rain falling on a Louisiana bayou: \u201cI love the mist hanging in the trees,\u201d he tells us in ROBICHEAUX (Simon & Schuster, $27.99), \u201ca hint of wraiths that would not let heavy stones weigh them down in their graves, the raindrops clicking on the lily pads, the fish rising as though in celebration.\u201d But in the next breath, he\u2019ll offer a comprehensive account of an excruciating death by torture: \u201cThe guy who did him took his time.\u201d And to satisfy our appetite for Southern eccentricity, he\u2019ll introduce us to great characters like Baby Cakes Babineau and Pookie the Possum Domingue.\n\nDave Robicheaux, the narrator of this robust regional series, is an Iberia Parish sheriff\u2019s detective with the melancholy air of a man who occasionally sees the hollow-eyed ghosts of the Confederate dead. Haunted by his own violent past, Robicheaux keeps trying to redeem himself through good works; but when he falls off the wagon, as he does here in a spectacular way, he thinks he might be capable of committing murder. But he\u2019s not in the same class as a contract killer named Chester Wimple (\u201cSometimes people call me Smiley\u201d).\n\nLike most of Burke\u2019s plots, this one has roots in Louisiana history, a gumbo of \u201cmisogamy and racism and homophobia,\u201d not to mention \u201cdemagoguery\u201d and \u201cself-congratulatory ignorance.\u201d Mob figures like Fat Tony Nemo look tough, but they have nothing on up-and-coming politicians like Jimmy Nightingale, eager to follow in the footsteps of his flamboyantly crooked predecessors. Burke has no inclination to romanticize gangsters, no matter how well groomed: \u201cThey were brutal, stupid to the core, and had the visceral instincts of medieval peasants armed with pitchforks.\u201d Rather, he pays homage to the fallen dead like Lt. Robert S. Broussard, a Civil War hero whose sword gets into the hands of a crime boss. In rescuing this artifact, Robicheaux bares his bleeding heart for \u201cLa Louisiane, the love of my life, the home of Jolie Blon and Evangeline and the Great Whore of Babylon, the place for which I would die.\u201d\n\n\u2666\n\nWitty, stylish and a bit of a rogue \u2014 that\u2019s what people said about Richard Nash, known as Beau, the notorious dandy who transformed the English city of Bath into \u201cthe 18th-century equivalent of Vegas.\u201d The same might be said of Peter Lovesey, whose elegant mysteries pay tribute to the past glories of this beautiful city. In BEAU DEATH (Soho Crime, $27.95), a demolition crew unearths the remains of a bewigged gentleman in period dress, setting off gossip that Nash has been found \u2014 murdered. Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond accepts this theory until he discovers the desiccated corpse was wearing modern-day underwear.\n\nThere\u2019s always a whiff of Restoration comedy about Lovesey\u2019s cunning plots, which make a point of featuring shrewd women like the drolly named Georgina Dallymore, whose ample comedic gifts make her a figure fit for a Congreve comedy and the perfect companion for Diamond.\n\n\u2666\n\nIf you find it significant that tortellini can be easier to eat than linguine or fettuccine, THE BODY IN THE CASKET (Morrow, $25.99) is your kind of mystery. Katherine Hall Page, who has written almost two dozen culinary mysteries, has come up with another smart twist on her cozy formula featuring Faith Fairchild, a minister\u2019s wife and keen-eyed amateur detective from suburban Massachusetts. Faith\u2019s catering firm, Have Faith in Your Kitchen, has been hired for a weekend party by Max Dane, a once-famous Broadway producer celebrating his 70th birthday. But what he really wants to hire is Faith\u2019s sleuthing talent, because he strongly suspects that one of his guests wants to kill him. The mechanics of the murder mystery are well set up and executed, but what you\u2019re hungry for is what\u2019s on the menu. This time, Faith is starting off with \u201cFallen Angel\u201d cocktails, then moving along to deviled eggs and an apple-potato dish called \u201cHimmel und Erde.\u201d The main course, lobster pasta fra diavolo, is followed by an angel food cake, from a recipe that calls for \u201cnine large eggs\u201d and a mountain of sugar. Sounds divine.\n\n\u2666\n\nWhere better to set a gangster novel than big, bad, brawling Chicago during Prohibition? The way Ray Celestin tells it in DEAD MAN\u2019S BLUES (Pegasus Crime, $25.95), everyone in the city was corrupt, from the mayor, Big Bill Thompson, to the 25,000 soda shop owners who ran speakeasies in their back rooms. The most colorful characters were mobsters like Al Capone and his rival, Bugs Moran, so-called because he was certifiably \u201cbuggy, crazy, homicidally violent and not very clever.\u201d As he did in his first novel, \u201cThe Axeman,\u201d which was set in New Orleans, Celestin perfectly captures the jazzy street rhythms of this proudly pugnacious city and its peculiar characters. His authorial gaze encompasses everything from a flower-festooned gangster\u2019s funeral (with \u201ca casket costing more than most people\u2019s houses\u201d) to a golf game featuring Capone; his hit man, Machine Gun Jack McGurn; and the mayor of suburban Burnham.

As crime and corruption skyrocket nationally, especially in surrounding areas, they\u2019ve remained stable or even declined here.\n\nWhen we asked Neza locals and officials how they did it, they pointed to Jorge Amador, the police chief who looks and talks as if he wandered into the job after getting lost on his way to a faculty meeting.\n\nMr. Amador, whose background is in sociology and water management, imposed policy changes that, sweeping and sometimes eccentric, might be impossible elsewhere. He set up literature programs and chess classes. He restructured the force to emphasize community engagement. He fired 100-plus officers suspected of corruption or brutality.\n\nSo was Mr. Amador the key to Neza\u2019s success? After some time in Neza (and a lot of time with Mexican academics), we came to a different conclusion. Or, at least, a broader one. Neza\u2019s secret was breaking from the Mexican party system, which is what made Mr. Amador\u2019s hiring and reforms possible.\n\nPhoto\n\nMexico\u2019s establishment political parties are beyond troubled. They are a dangerous combination of superstrong \u2014 they are tightly controlled institutions that have few career civil servants \u2014 and super-weak. They are riven with corruption, patronage and nepotism. They have the power to enforce internal loyalty but not to perform basic institutional functions.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any institution or agency that is capable of forcing the parties to cooperate and forcing them to be honest and fair. And that is a huge problem,\u201d said Joy Langston, a political scientist at the CIDE, a Mexico City university.\n\n\u201cThey are very much able to negotiate reforms that make them even stronger and give them even more distance from voters,\u201d she said, adding that this means parties have shrinking incentive to think about policies that will help voters, or to think about policy at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeza is different; it is run by the left-wing P.R.D. party, rather than either of the establishment parties.\n\nMost P.R.D. holds are not like Neza. They, too, see upticks in crime and corruption. But because the P.R.D. exists outside of the mainstream party system, an official like Mr. Amador is at least freer to root out corruption or experiment with unorthodox reforms.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Interpreter Newsletter Understand the world with sharp insight and commentary on the major news stories of the week.

And not all of his policies have worked.\n\nAfter years of relatively undisturbed experimentation, Neza has become something like an open-air experiment in social engineering. The goal is to so enamor the police of their civic responsibility that they will decide to refuse the money they could make extorting civilians or aiding drug gangs, as is common in much of Mexico.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn August, we attended one of the twice-annual awards ceremonies that Mr. Amador holds for the police. Of the 700 officers in attendance, half would receive some sort of prize and cash reward. Family members in the audience waved supportive signs. In an Oprah-style twist, and to cheers even she might envy, six officers were each granted bonuses worth four months pay. It felt like a pep rally.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, people don\u2019t trust you, they are very defensive,\u201d said Diana Hernandez, one of the community officers assigned to monitor a small patch of streets \u2014 another experiment.\n\nShe understands, she said. Growing up, her family rarely called the police, seeing them as bound to bring more trouble. Now, she said, \u201cPeople recognize me on the street. That they know me really makes me feel good about this.\u201d\n\nNeighborhood watch groups, set up to coordinate with police, are provided with police cameras, alarm systems and direct lines to the patrol cars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut their longer-term purpose, Mr. Amador said, is to create public buy-in for his reforms \u201cso that it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s in the mayor\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nIn a way, he is seeking to replicate the functions of a political party: grass-roots mobilization, civil society allies and institutionalized policies. It\u2019s a big idea, but a reminder that trying to reform the police and society without real institutional support is a bit like writing in the sand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fragile, this experiment,\u201d Guillermo Vald\u00e9s, a former head of the national intelligence agency, said. Establishing it \u201chas been a long process and a slow one,\u201d requiring time and freedom that doesn\u2019t exist for most Mexican officials constrained by the party system.\n\nPolicing experts we spoke to generally gave Neza high marks, as did Mr. Vald\u00e9s.\n\nJuan Salgado, also with the CIDE, said the city had achieved \u201cgreat successes,\u201d in part by sidestepping civil society organizations, which, like so much in Mexico, tend to dominated by the establishment parties.\n\nStill, not everyone has been sold. Antia Mendoza, a Mexico City-based security expert, said Neza\u2019s officials had not proven a link between Mr. Amador\u2019s reforms and the crime rate. And she saw little proof the community networks were working.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd Neza is hardly an oasis of safety. The day before the police awards, our photographer visited Neza to find the main traffic circle shut down by a public brawl. When we spent some time in the police command center, which includes dozens of new-looking TV screens displaying feeds from hundreds of street cameras, the officers watched helplessly as a car chase zipped across the screens.\n\nStill, in a way, the most important thing may not be how well Mr. Amador\u2019s reforms worked but the fact that he had space to try them at all, and for years at a time. That level of freedom, particularly to purge corruption, is rare in Mexican policymaking. It\u2019s a major problem for Mexico, constricting officials in a time of national crisis.\n\nThat, for us, was Neza\u2019s lesson: not the presence of reforms, but the absence of party-imposed constraints. It made us look differently at the rest of Mexico, where those constraints can be suffocating.\n\nIt made us think about Europe\u2019s mainstream parties, which are the least popular they\u2019ve been in years, giving rise to smaller and less professionalized fringe parties. It made us think about the global rise in populist parties, which often reject policy expertise and institutions as untrustworthy \u201cdeep state\u201d elites. And it made us think about American parties that have been hollowed out by polarization and other factors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMexico\u2019s political parties are, in many ways, particular to Mexico and its history.

Heart disease risk jumps for those in the 80th percentile, with lp(a) levels above 60, and climbs sharply for the 5 percent of the population with lp(a) levels between 150 and 300, according to Dr. Ginsberg at Columbia. \u201cThose people can be disasters in terms of cardiovascular risk,\u201d he said.\n\nYet many people at high risk do not fit the typical profile of a person with heart disease. Sandra Revill Tremulis was a health-conscious medical device executive who moonlighted as an aerobics instructor, followed a strict diet, and maintained 16 percent body fat, equivalent to that of an elite athlete. Her LDL and total cholesterol levels were low, and at age 39, her Framingham risk score, which gauges heart disease risk, put her odds of having a heart attack in her 40s at just 1 percent.\n\nBut when she started experiencing extreme fatigue and struggled to finish her workouts, she went to an interventional cardiologist and asked for a thorough work-up \u2014 which revealed that she had a 95 percent blockage in one of her coronary arteries.\n\n\u201cI was imminent to have a widow-maker heart attack at age 39,\u201d she said.\n\nFurther testing showed she had high lp(a), which she believes she inherited from her father, who died of a heart attack at age 50. Determined to raise awareness, Ms. Revill Tremulis started a nonprofit, the Lipoprotein(a) Foundation, and now travels the globe advocating for wider testing.\n\n\u201cOnly a small percentage of physicians know about this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe biggest challenge for patients is finding knowledgeable physicians who know about this and can help them.\u201d\n\nDr. Lloyd-Jones at Northwestern said that testing for lp(a) should be considered for people with early-onset cardiovascular disease \u2014 which means younger than age 50 for men and age 60 for women \u2014 or a strong family history of it. Since high lp(a) is hereditary, those who have it often have a parent, sibling or grandparent who suffered a premature heart attack or stroke.

Your radiator may have a problem with an air valve. Air valves, also known as air vents, open and close as steam flows through the radiator. (Unlike a control valve, you cannot turn an air valve on or off.)\n\nThese valves come in different sizes and are easily replaceable. \u201cYou could probably put a different type of air valve on the radiator that expels the air a little slower,\u201d said Philip Kraus, the president of Fred Smith Plumbing and Heating in Manhattan. \u201cIt\u2019s not complicated at all. You just unscrew it and put another one on.\u201d\n\nAsk Real Estate Submit your questions, share your stories and tell us what topics interest you most. Post a comment or email us at realestateqa@nytimes.com.\n\nAssuming this is the problem, your landlord should address it. \u201cThe landlord is shirking his or her legal obligations here,\u201d said Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. Because the condition violates the warranty of habitability, a state law that protects tenants, you are entitled to a rent abatement and if the problem cannot be fixed, may be allowed to terminate your lease, Mr. Ferrara said.\n\nYou could write the landlord a letter, including these points, sent by certified mail, demanding that the problem be addressed. You could also call 311 to report the matter.\n\nYour fastest route to a good night\u2019s sleep, however, may be through your superintendent.

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "In 2003 at a Kurdish investment seminar in Erbil, Mr. Schute met Douglas Layton, an American who came to Kurdistan in 1992. Mr. Layton, whose round spectacles and woolen cap lend him the air of a paperback spy, had survived a $1 million bounty on his head, courtesy of Saddam Hussein. After the dictator\u2019s capture and execution, Mr. Layton journeyed to Hussein\u2019s palace in Baghdad, where he found his outlandish throne and sat in it. \u201cYou\u2019re gone,\u201d Mr. Layton whispered to Saddam\u2019s ghost, \u201cand I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nMr. Schute and Mr. Layton, who had been working for the Meridian Health Foundation, both knew of Kurdistan\u2019s cultural riches and friendly people, so they joined forces to create what eventually became Kurdistan Iraq Tours, the only inbound tourism operator in Kurdistan. The idea seemed absurd.\n\n\u201cEveryone said no one will come to Iraq, and I said but they\u2019ll come to \u2018the other Iraq!\u2019\u201d Mr. Layton recalled. \u201cI believed, and I still believe, that tourism is the future.\u201d\n\nFor their main local guide, they hired and trained Balin Zrar, a charismatic, chain-smoking Kurd. Mr. Zrar had spent seven years running an Italian restaurant in London after he smuggled himself to Europe \u2014 an epic tale that involved time in an Iranian prison camp and riding for days curled atop a spare tire under a tractor-trailer. After the London bombings, Mr. Zrar returned to Kurdistan to dabble in real estate. For the guide-position interview, Mr. Layton asked him if he liked history. \u201cI hate history,\u201d replied Mr. Zrar, now in his early 40s, and the candor landed him the job. No one believed he\u2019d be busy.\n\nIn 2008, though, things took off. The company landed a contract with California-based Distant Horizons to run its Kurdistan cultural trips and soon others followed. Momentum built. By 2011 The New York Times put Iraqi Kurdistan on its annual list of places to go. National Geographic Traveler did the same. \u201cTop Gear,\u201d the British television show, filmed a special there. In 2012 tourism arrivals surged 30 percent, year-over-year, to about 2.2 million visitors. Copycat inbound companies sprang to life. Starwood, Kempinski and Marriott lined up to manage new luxury hotels. By spring 2014, Kurdistan Iraq Tours had 15-person groups booking 11-day itineraries and was actually making some money.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen, ISIS showed up.\n\nThe militants steamrolled down the Tigris and pushed into Kurdistan. They got so close to Erbil\u2019s city gates that even Mr. Schute was worried. Tourism companies shut down. Seventy hotels closed. Many flights ceased. \u201cWe were the last guys standing,\u201d Mr. Layton said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut all through those awful years the men worked behind the scenes, speaking to lawmakers and publishing a gorgeous, comprehensive guidebook to the region. As soon as ISIS was gone they knew travelers would come wandering back.\n\nTHE RED-EYE FROM AMMAN touched down just before dawn in Erbil where Mr. Zrar waited. He had a slim build and black hair flecked with gray. He fidgeted, as most Kurdish men do, with a string of beads called a tasbih. Outside the air was hazy and cool.\n\nOur contingent of five North Americans had pretty much spent a lifetime traveling. Even so, only one of us, the head of an adventure travel trade association, had visited Kurdistan before. This time he\u2019d brought along his son, who\u2019d turn 17 on the trip. A Canadian expat living in Hong Kong and a photographer from Los Angeles who had been to North Korea 10 times rounded out our group.\n\nWe piled into a mini bus and rolled into the city. Rows of half-finished skyscrapers rose from the earth like the picked-over rib cage of a great steely beast. Barbershops, bookstores, mosques and carts laden with wild cucumbers and cigarettes scrolled by the window. Unlike Iraqi Arabs, few Kurdish women wore head scarves. If you ignored the road signs pointing to Baghdad, you could mistake this for Turkey.\n\nTURKEY Amedi Duhok Lalish iraqi kurdistan IRAN Mosul Erbil Dukan Lake Tigris Sulaymaniya Area of detail Halabja IRAQ Baghdad 50 miles\n\nThe plan was to spend a week traveling in a clockwise loop that started and ended in Erbil, taking in cities like Duhok and Sulaymaniyah along the way. We\u2019d hike in the Zagros Mountains, paddle kayaks on Lake Dukan, and eat kebabs and flatbread. Often we\u2019d pause over sugary tea outside noisy bazaars and linger in museums highlighting Kurdish traditions and history. Mr. Layton, who now lives in Connecticut, could not join us, but Mr. Schute, still in Erbil, would spend time with us.\n\nImmediately it became clear that this would be unlike any other trip. Mr. Schute also serves as a senior security adviser to the Kurdish interior ministry and works closely with the Peshmerga, which means \u201cthose who face death.\u201d More than 100,000 of these Kurdish soldiers \u2014 our allies against Saddam Hussein and ISIS \u2014 manned a nearly impenetrable front riddled with tank ditches and checkpoints that has kept Kurdistan an enclave of comparative security while much of the rest of Iraq remains too dangerous for tourists. The Peshmerga, coalition forces and the Iraqis had cornered the last of ISIS\u2019s fighters in Mosul\u2019s old city along the Tigris. The effort to root them out for good was being coordinated through the Zerevani Peshmerga headquarters outside Erbil. Mr. Schute arranged to take us there.\n\nC-17s roared overhead as we arrived. In the distance you could see a dome that the South Koreans had built for a gym and several squat metal buildings. Guards led us into a room with a long table set with bananas and apricots and cold cans of Pepsi. United States Army Lt. Col. Darin E. Huss, the center\u2019s director, and Iraqi and Kurdish generals, came in to answer our questions about the fight. \u201cIn 10 days it will be finished, inshallah,\u201d Staff Major Gen. Saad Khalid Yasin told me. (It would be more like six weeks.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMost eye-opening of all, though, was the base\u2019s Mad Max junkyard of captured ISIS vehicles. The militants had welded thick armored plates around old Soviet personnel carriers and attached grids of rebar along their sides to disperse incoming rocket blasts. Some rigs had heavy metal prows to better ram a checkpoint. Others had been reduced to mangled heaps of metal. I climbed inside one that had been scorched beyond all recognition. On the floor lay a chalky white bone. Lamb. Someone\u2019s lunch had ended poorly.\n\nOVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS we took in more mainstream sites. We strolled around Erbil\u2019s citadel, a fortress on a mound, that dates to 6000 B.C., and mingled with Arab Iraqis from the south who seemed overjoyed to friend an American on Facebook. I stuck my nose in sacks of za\u2019atar and sumac in the city\u2019s frenetic bazaar and watched two teen lovebirds \u2014 she in a hijab, he in jeans \u2014 kiss behind a tree in a park where no one could see but God.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe next morning our driver headed north toward the Mar Mattai monastery. We slipped past wheat fields, gas stations with knockoff names like \u201cShall\u201d and \u201cNobil,\u201d and a refinery \u2014 a reminder of Kurdistan\u2019s agricultural economy and the fact that Iraq controls some of the richest oil fields in the world, a quarter of which lie in Kurdistan. Kids played on the banks of the Greater Zab River where earthen bunkers once shielded Iraqi tanks during the 2003 invasion. This was the Green Line, the point behind which Saddam withdrew his forces after the creation of a no-fly zone over Kurdistan following his defeat in the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nThe air turned hair-dryer hot as we wrapped up our time at the monastery. From there we drove to a field just outside a village called Amian. A lone cow stood in the grass. A kid in a yellow shirt rode by, waving, on a bike. In the distance rose a gumdrop-shape dollop of earth. It was a tell, or a man-made hill formed when ancient villages are built and rebuilt atop one another over thousands of years until they\u2019re abandoned and the grass reclaims them.\n\nKurdistan is littered with these. Very few of them have been excavated, Hashim Hama Abdullah, the director of the Slemani Museum in Sulaymaniyah, would tell me later after I\u2019d spent a morning studying the museum\u2019s ancient stelae, tablets and other artifacts. \u201cNo excavating happened at all under Saddam,\u201d he said. \u201cNow teams are coming in.\u201d\n\nKurdistan has no real budget for tourism projects, which means few attractions have basic things like interpretive signs. This field, which also has never been excavated, would be just a field without Mr. Schute to explain it.

Nadal still plans to follow his planned schedule, his team said, by playing a hardcourt event in Acapulco, Mexico, which begins on Feb. 26, followed by events in Indian Wells and Miami.\n\nThat would give Nadal more than a month to recover (he already had announced he would not play in the Davis Cup next week when Spain faces Britain).\n\nIn the semifinals, Cilic will face Kyle Edmund, an unseeded surprise from Britain who upset the No. 3 seed Grigor Dimitrov, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, earlier in the day in Rod Laver Arena.\n\nIt has been a tournament of big surprises. In her first Australian Open, the unseeded Elise Mertens of Belgium has reached the semifinals in women\u2019s singles. In his first Australian Open, 97th-ranked American Tennys Sandgren has reached the quarterfinals in men\u2019s singles.\n\nNadal\u2019s retirement means there will be no rematch with Roger Federer in this year\u2019s final. Federer beat Nadal in a five-set thriller in 2017 to win the Australian Open, but Federer, who will face Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, is now the only member of the so-called Big Five who is still in contention at Melbourne Park.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe years of competing at the highest level are taking their toll on that elite group. Andy Murray, 30, underwent hip surgery this month in Australia after withdrawing from this tournament. Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka managed to play after taking six-month breaks from competition because of injuries, but they were diminished in Melbourne.\n\nWawrinka, returning from knee surgery at age 32, lost in the second round to Sandgren. In a fourth-round loss to the 21-year-old South Korean Hyeon Chung, Djokovic, now 30, was frequently wincing in pain, his right elbow still not sufficiently healed after his extended break. Djokovic has acknowledged that elbow surgery is a possibility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSandgren and Chung will play each other for a spot in the semifinals on Wednesday.\n\nNadal expressed concern about the series of injuries to leading players in the last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the right moment to say for me, but somebody who is running the tour should think a little bit about what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cToo many people getting injured.\u201d\n\nNadal, 31, said tennis authorities need to think about the long-term health of the players.\n\n\u201cThere is life after tennis, so I don\u2019t know if we keep playing in these very, very hard surfaces, what is going to happen in the future with our lives,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout Nadal\u2019s remarkable career, as he has won 16 Grand Slam singles titles and two Olympic gold medals, he has often lobbied for more tournaments to be played on natural surfaces like grass and clay \u2014 his best surface.\n\nNadal has a spectacular but punishing playing style, full of abrupt changes of direction as he covers court like few men in the long history of tennis.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In an interview in September, he complained that the top players had mandatory tournament commitments that stretched from January to November, although veteran players become exempt from some mandatory events as they accrue years of service.\n\nChris Kermode, the executive chairman and president of the ATP, has said that the tour has conducted research that shows the overall injury rate is not climbing for all players but only for the elite, which could be explained by the fact that much of that group is aging.\n\nFederer, the oldest of the Big Five by far at age 36, has long argued that it is important to take long breaks within the season. And though Cilic, 29, was sympathetic to Nadal\u2019s injury, he was not ready to ring the alarm bells as loudly.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s on all of us to try to take care of our bodies, to try to pick the right schedule, to listen to our body, how it feels,\u201d said Cilic, the 2014 United States Open champion and the only man outside the Big Five to win a Grand Slam singles title since the beginning of 2010.\n\nPhoto\n\nNadal had a triumphant 2017 season, winning his 10th French Open and third United States Open.

At that moment, I thought something happened, but I didn\u2019t realize how bad.\u201d\n\nIt would soon become clear, and the capacity crowd in Laver Arena began to groan and gasp as they watched him hobble and miss routine shots.\n\n\u201cYou never want to accept it. You want to wait and see if something happens that helps it go away and get better,\u201d said Nadal, who took anti-inflammatory medication during the match. \u201cI was waiting to see if that had any effect and improved anything. But I couldn\u2019t move, and without being able to move, I\u2019m not going to win.

He has retired from matches at eight tour events during his career but only two at the Grand Slam level, both at Melbourne Park.

In 2011, when Nadal was trying to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win four straight major singles titles, he sustained a hamstring injury in the opening set of his quarterfinal against his Spanish compatriot David Ferrer and lost in straight sets.\n\nIn the 2014 final here, Nadal lost to Wawrinka in four sets when hampered by a back problem.\n\nDespite his retirement on Tuesday, Nadal will retain the No. 1 ranking after the tournament. But \u2014 as with Djokovic \u2014 it is unclear when Nadal will be able to play again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad because once again I\u2019ve had a problem in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the end, when these things happen, you have to look in the mirror and see all the good things that have happened, too.

Climate scientists say the ice cap here has been reduced by nearly a quarter in the past 40 years because of rising temperatures. With the rate of melting increasing each year, some scientists predict that within 50 years many of the peaks here will no longer have glaciers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Antarctica, where you have a rupture of a mile and everyone notices,\u201d said Justiniano Alejo Cochachin, a glaciologist who works for the Peruvian government. \u201cIt\u2019s 19 meters a year; it is bit by bit.\u201d\n\nOn his many journeys, Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez has spent decades looking over the shoulders of scientists like Mr. Cochachin, shaping his own intimate view of a landscape altered by climate change.\n\nHe watched the expanding rocky fields around the Pastoruri Glacier, where the melting ice uncovered fossils that had not seen daylight in ages, including those of ferns and other plants. He has seen rivers turn red as other glaciers melted and exposed heavy metals that poison the water downstream.\n\n\u201cIf there is no water, there is no life,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nHis work begins early, well before sunrise, when he packs crampons used to walk atop the glaciers, large boring drills and topographical instruments, helmets, gloves and the gear to build a shelter, all in a backpack nearly as large as he is.\n\nThe food often goes on a mule \u2014 provided the mule can make the climb.

His descriptions of it from that time vary. At times he evokes a building \u2014 it had \u201cblue walls,\u201d he said. Sometimes he spoke of the glacier\u2019s \u201cbeautiful long tongue,\u201d and it sounded more like an animal.\n\n\u201cYes, it is alive,\u201d he said, describing the glacier\u2019s slow movement below his feet.\n\nIn the 1990s, the hikes could be an escape from the conflicts taking place below, when the Shining Path, the Maoist rebel group that terrorized Peru for decades, attacked politicians in Huaraz and planted three car bombs. Despite the unrest, American researchers would come each year, and Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez would lead them up as the ice sheet continued to melt.\n\n\u201cWhen you go out into the field, your mind clears,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was the sound of the cracking, heard on nearly every ice sheet the scientists came to study, that bothered him most. \u201cTac,\u201d he said, \u201clike a huge sound.\u201d And every year he came, Yanamarey was farther away than it had been the last time.\n\nPhoto\n\nOur climb continued. The landscape turned into a rocky stretch of boulders. Then the glacier came into view.\n\nIt looked very different that day from the place Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez had described.

But then, around 11:30 p.m., an email arrived. It was from an electronic musician experiencing a host of problems, including anxiety and depression.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge step for someone just to send that,\u201d Mr. Aston said. \u201cThey clearly need to talk.\u201d\n\nHe quickly wrote a reply, saying, among other things, they could call anytime. Four hours later, the phone still hadn\u2019t rung. The help line received an average of 25 inquiries a week in December. Some nights are busy, others quiet.\n\nMental health is a high-profile issue in the music industry, with stars like Zayn Malik talking about anxiety and the suicides of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park. Yet the Music Minds help line is one of few public initiatives trying to improve matters.\n\nRichard Robinson, Help Musicians\u2019 chief executive, said the idea had been brewing for several years. The \u201cfinal shove,\u201d he said, came in 2016, when the group commissioned the University of Westminster in London to research mental health issues in the industry.\n\nOf the roughly 2,200 people who participated in the survey, from aspiring violinists to folk singers, 71 percent said they had experienced anxiety or panic, and 68.5 percent depression. That compares with a nationwide average of 17 percent of people ages 16 or over having anxiety or depression in Britain, according to the Office of National Statistics. More than half of those in the music industry said they had found it difficult to get help. The report on the survey results is blunt: \u201cMusic making is therapeutic, but making a career out of music is destructive.\u201d\n\nOther studies have shown similar numbers. In 2016, researchers in Norway found that musicians there were three times more likely to be in therapy than the general work force.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a unique environment,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. \u201cSomeone who\u2019s putting their creative brain on show is saying, \u2018Look, I can either succeed or fail here.\u2019 And it\u2019s horrific.\u201d\n\nThe daily calls to the help line show it is needed, he added. Calls from electronic musicians, composers and people in music theater have dominated so far.\n\nIt is easy to find musicians who welcome such efforts. \u201cI\u2019m totally fine to admit I\u2019ve rung Samaritans before,\u201d said Matthew Johnson, the frontman of the Leeds-based rock band Hookworms, referring to Britain\u2019s best-known suicide-prevention hotline. \u201cThe problem I\u2019ve had is, when I\u2019ve tried to explain my problems, and I\u2019ve had it with therapists too, they say, \u2018Oh, your life must be wonderful.\u2019 They don\u2019t particularly understand the pressures you might be under.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Johnson has had depression, on and off, since he was a teenager. Being a musician has sometimes made things worse, he said, even though Hookworms has released two critically acclaimed albums. The profession comes with financial precariousness, but he said he also hated being onstage, and found coping with reviews and online sniping difficult.\n\n\u201cI found myself the other day looking through YouTube comments, and I found one \u2014 one! \u2014 where someone said they didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said, referring to their latest single. \u201cThat\u2019s the one I\u2019ll take to heart. I\u2019ll ignore all the ones saying it\u2019s brilliant.\u201d\n\nThe artist says he feels lucky that his band signed with Domino, a London-based label that he said had been supportive. \u201cWhen I feel bad, they always reach out to check I\u2019m O.K.

He said he asked Ms. Stevens what she wanted him to do with the manuscript, and she said she would take care of it, and took the box and put it under her desk. (When asked to provide examples of overlapping passages from the novel and the biography, the foundation declined to do so.)\n\nSpiegel & Grau rebutted the foundation\u2019s claim. \u201cNorma Stevens did not copy or use a Richard Avedon novel in any way in writing \u201cAvedon: Something Personal,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThe Avedon Foundation has made loose, unsubstantiated allegations of copyright infringement without presenting any documented instances of substantial similarity between our book and another work.\u201d\n\nMs. Stevens was not available to comment for this article, a spokeswoman for Spiegel & Grau said, but the publisher defended the work: \u201cThe book is an important and meaningful account by the person who was in a privileged position to observe and know Richard Avedon as well as anybody else and to reflect on him.\u201d\n\nMs. Stevens worked with Avedon closely for nearly 30 years, and had a front-row view of his celebrated, glamorous career. Before he died, Avedon indicated that he wanted to name Ms. Stevens as the executive director of his foundation, and she ran it for five years. Ms. Stevens notes in the book that Mr. Avedon often urged her to write about him, and to make it an honest and unsparing portrait. \u201cThe best portrait is always the truth. Make me into an Avedon,\u201d she said he told her.\n\nIn a career that spanned nearly six decades, Avedon revolutionized fashion photography and took revealing portraits of some of the biggest cultural giants of the modern era, including Ezra Pound, Charlie Chaplin, Bob Dylan, Marilyn Monroe and Allen Ginsberg. His works were exhibited in museums around the world and collected in books and exhibition catalogs, including \u201cObservations,\u201d which featured text by Truman Capote, and \u201cNothing Personal,\u201d with text by James Baldwin.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Destitute and mentally ill in the late 1980s, he fled New York City and made his way to Buffalo, his former home, where he died in a hospital of causes that remain vague.\n\nBy then he was so distant from the artistic scene of which he was once a vibrant member that it was only when The Village Voice published an obituary in January 1991, eight months later, that his old friends and collaborators found out he was gone. His scores had years before been destroyed or vanished; recordings of them were more or less nonexistent, and none released commercially.\n\nA vital career seemed entirely lost. First in Buffalo, whose state university campus was a new-music hotbed, and then in another hotbed, the downtown New York of the \u201970s, Eastman had been the charismatic center of the party \u2014 sweet-natured, arrogant, exuberantly provocative. His compositions radiated confidence; his solo-piano improvisations balanced conviction and meditation; his bass voice, in music by Meredith Monk, Peter Maxwell Davies and Frederic Rzewski, was a formidable mixture of reverberation and clarity.\n\nAll that was stilled, long before he died.\n\nIt was because of the determination of a small circle of advocates \u2014 particularly the composer and performer Mary Jane Leach, who had worked with Eastman in the 1980s \u2014 that material began to reaccumulate.

We could, but why bother?\n\nThere\u2019s another type of memory extension that is even more mindlike. We routinely extend our memories by using other people\u2019s minds, and our minds serve as memory extenders for others. Anyone with children is constantly remembering things for them \u2014 what time they need to be at soccer practice, where it is, what they need to bring.

A few years ago, my work demands began to overwhelm my ability to remember important information. Using some mental tricks helped, but I still couldn\u2019t keep up.\n\nSo I switched strategies. Recognizing that there was some redundancy in remembering certain things that others knew, I gave up trying.

When I worry that might be the case, I ask: \u201cAm I keeping track of this or you?\u201d That settles it. In fact, I end many meetings or email exchanges at work just this way. Once a plan of action or a solution to a problem is worked out, I make it clear who has ownership of it and will make sure crucial information isn\u2019t lost.\n\nAt home, my wife and I are explicit about who is handling which follow-up to the myriad demands associated with my children\u2019s school and extracurricular activities.

Or they can root for the defenseman Chay Genoway: An undrafted long shot, he dreamed of making the N.H.L., and he did \u2014 for just a single game, in 2012. That\u2019s one better than Mat Robinson, who never made it at all, and neither did the team\u2019s oldest player, 37-year-old Chris Lee.\n\nThen there\u2019s goaltender Ben Scrivens, an undrafted Cornell graduate who spent almost his entire five-year N.H.L. career playing in three of Canada\u2019s most high-pressure markets \u2014 Toronto, Edmonton and Montreal. He built a devoted fan base through a thoughtful social media presence, and his wife, Jenny, was a goaltender for the New York Riveters of the National Women\u2019s Hockey League.\n\nUnlike the members of previous Team Canada rosters, these guys don\u2019t have N.H.L. playoff races to return to when it\u2019s over. Instead, they\u2019ll be playing in easily the most important games of their careers. In a way, that feels like what the Olympics should be.\n\nThe Czech team will be captained by Martin Erat, a veteran forward who played almost 900 N.H.L. games. But he\u2019s probably best remembered by the league\u2019s fans for something he had no control over \u2014 a disastrous 2013 trade in which the Washington Capitals gave up their best prospect to acquire him. That prospect, Filip Forsberg (no relation to Peter), is now one of the league\u2019s best young forwards, while Erat has been out of the league for almost three years.

Fort Negley reopened in 2004, on the 140th anniversary of the Battle of Nashville. The next year it was designated a National Historic Landmark District.\n\nThree years after the Sounds left, Mayor Megan Barry released a request for proposals related to the site of the old stadium. The request was not for Metro Parks to create a plan for desperately needed green space in an already overpaved urban core.

The unfamiliar surroundings affected Franklin\u2019s mental health, causing him great anxiety. Ms. Matthias feared that Nevaeh felt ashamed. And the stress reignited a dormant vice for Ms. Matthias: shoplifting.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt gave me a high that I couldn\u2019t find anywhere else,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re doing it, you just think you\u2019re being mischievous.\u201d\n\nWhenever Ms. Matthias stole, she said, the item was frivolous, the action done solely for a momentary rush. In spring 2014, the habit sent the family careening into disarray. After a court appearance related to a shoplifting charge, Ms. Matthias bought a birthday present for her nephew and then went to a Walmart, where she stole baby formula, which she had no need for. She was arrested on the spot.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen she returned to court, she was charged with petty larceny. The judge accused her of endangering her children, which sent Ms. Matthias into hysterics.

Her guilt and shame were so overwhelming that she refused to have her children visit.\n\nAfter Ms. Matthias\u2019s release, she sought immediate help from Children\u2019s Aid, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Social workers helped her regain custody of the children less than two months after her release.\n\nMs. Matthias and her children\u2019s father separated around the same time, though he is still involved in their lives. She and the children re-entered the shelter system.\n\nIn late 2014, Ms. Matthias began attending Cleptomaniacs and Shoplifters Anonymous meetings. Receiving Nevaeh\u2019s forgiveness was a huge boost to her willpower, she said, but the meetings were vital to understanding that she was not the only one battling such a compulsion. They also pushed her to stay mindful of her actions\u2019 consequences.\n\n\u201cI know the right direction is to always look for the help that I need,\u201d Ms. Matthias said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know what direction I\u2019m going, I know where to go to get the help.\u201d\n\nMs. Matthias\u2019s support network has a hole since her mother, who used to call Ms. Matthias and her children every day, died in March 2016.\n\n\u201cI miss that lady,\u201d Ms. Matthias said in a pained whisper.\n\nIn late 2016, the family secured a new apartment in the Bronx. Finances remain tight. Ms. Matthias, who does not work, receives $735 in Social Security disability for Franklin, $100 in welfare and $180 in food stamps each month. Social workers at Children\u2019s Aid used $1,500 in Neediest Cases funds to buy the family new furniture.\n\nMs. Matthias says Nevaeh is thriving in school. Franklin recently transitioned into a specialized high school, and Ms. Matthias says she has few worries about his development.\n\nWhen she cries, the tears she sheds are for her mother.

The researchers who have worked there acknowledge some of the emotional challenges to studying the toddler\u2019s remains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this hollowness yet this ghostlike pain still there which is fascinating from a scientific perspective but horrific from a parental perspective,\u201d said Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University in Ontario and an author of the recent paper.\n\nIn the crypt, the child\u2019s coffin rests near dozens of other wooden burial boxes, some of which held the bodies of Aragonese princes and Neapolitan nobles. Their corpses were clothed in decorated woven fabrics and precious silk. Many were embalmed but some were naturally mummified by the dry conditions of the basilica.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe mummies of San Domenico Maggiore are unique in Italy not only for the antiquity and excellent state of preservation of the bodies,\u201d Gino Fornaciari, a paleopathologist at the University of Pisa and an author of the paper, said in an email, \u201cbut also for the fame of the personages, whose lives and causes of death are well known.\u201d\n\nDr. Fornaciari first studied the child mummy in the 1980s. Using an electron microscope he found what he thought were traces of smallpox, also known as variola virus, in its remains. Since then the child has served as a quintessential example of early European smallpox. That made it a prime target for Dr. Holmes and his colleagues who have tried to map out the timeline and diversity of the smallpox virus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2016, Dr. Holmes and his team had found traces of smallpox in a 17th century Lithuanian mummy. By re-examining the Naples mummy with molecular tools, they expected to push back the timeline of smallpox in Europe another hundred years.\n\n\u201cThat was the hope, that this would be a slam dunk,\u201d Dr. Poinar said. \u201cBut it\u2019s never a slam dunk when you think it\u2019s a slam dunk.\u201d\n\nInstead, when they sequenced the genome of the child mummy and performed their molecular analysis they found no trace of the smallpox virus. But they did find evidence of the hepatitis B virus.\n\nMore Reporting on Archaeology\n\nAt first they did not pay much attention to the finding. Then they realized that a symptom of hepatitis B infection in children is a facial rash called Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. They thought perhaps the hepatitis B virus caused the dots on the child\u2019s mummified face.\n\nThey performed another molecular analysis and found that the genetic information they extracted from the ancient hepatitis B virus resembled that of a modern-day hepatitis B virus genome. To the researchers, that was a red flag for contamination.\n\nThey spent the next year and a half trying to figure out whether they had actually found traces of ancient hepatitis B virus, or whether instead the virus they found was a contaminant from one of the researchers who uncovered the mummy in the 1980s. As hepatitis B infections were common in Italy at that time, Dr. Poinar said it was possible that the virus signals they saw were from contamination.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That indicated that it was similarly as old. But to further corroborate their hunch, the team performed an evolutionary analysis using several other old strains of hepatitis B virus, and found that the virus itself evolves very slowly. That suggests that in a period of about 500 years, the hepatitis B virus has not changed much.\n\nDr. Poinar and Dr. Holmes said they are confident that they found perhaps the earliest evidence of hepatitis B infection in Italy, but would not completely rule out the possibility of contamination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 80-20 at this point, or maybe 90-10, that it\u2019s not contamination,\u201d Dr. Poinar said.", "title": "A Mummified Child\u2019s Remains Show Signs of a Modern Scourge", "authors": ["Nicholas St. Fleur"]}

Paper, $16.\n\nMuch has been written and sung about the way distance and the isolation it breeds have shaped the identities of those Europeans who settled in New Zealand. From the music of Split Enz to Eleanor Catton\u2019s novel \u201cThe Luminaries,\u201d stories of colonizers who crossed perilous seas to carve out a facsimile of an old society in a strange land are more than familiar. In his debut novel, the New Zealand writer Craig Cliff adds to the canon, but with such ambition, creativity and sheer energy that he shows there\u2019s still something new to say about a national narrative that can seem, at times, to hold no surprises.\n\nIn \u201cThe Mannequin Makers,\u201d Cliff makes real a desolate, windswept country at the turn of the early 20th century and beyond, a place populated by men and women who have learned that life is hard, and that it can be borne only by keeping one\u2019s feelings carefully trammeled. It is the preoccupation of many a New Zealand novel and at the beginning of this one, things seem to fall into a familiar pattern. In the small town of Marumaru on the North Island\u2019s east coast, Colton Kemp\u2019s wife dies while pregnant and, unable to acknowledge what has happened, he goes about his business in town that day without divulging the news to anyone, pretending she is still alive.\n\nBut there is already an inkling that this will be more than another story about a quiet man: Kemp is a carver of department store mannequins, and not an especially good one. In another establishment across town, his rival, known as The Carpenter, does not have Kemp\u2019s imagination, but his mannequins are startlingly lifelike, incurring Kemp\u2019s bitter jealousy.\n\nFrom there, the tale takes flight in a way that comes close to magic realism, with the characters and events falling into a gothic swoon. In his grief over the loss of his wife, Kemp commits an act so heinous that it sets in motion a story almost Shakespearean in scope. To divulge more would spoil a rollicking plot, but it isn\u2019t revealing too much to say that Cliff\u2019s background as a short story writer gives him a rare skill with the minutiae of structure and characterization. The book is split into four entwined narratives, each from a different point of view, with Kemp\u2019s just the first. A headstrong teenage girl and a man who cannot speak are rich standouts of the book\u2019s second and third acts; Cliff paints the 16-year-old girl as kind and resilient while never overplaying her innocence. It\u2019s one of several tightropes he steps onto with quiet assurance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater, in mute, elderly Gabriel Doig, the reader is delivered an immensely satisfying account of shipwreck and survival. That the tale is conveyed in writing to another character, because Doig cannot speak, and that it arrives obviously laden with Cliff\u2019s own research of the historical context, could easily have resulted in unwieldy storytelling. Instead, the book soars.\n\nIn the final section, another change of narrator and a jump forward to 1970s Australia bring about the denouement. This is the only place Cliff seems to falter; he has much to reveal about his new storyteller while also needing to wrangle a sprawling plot. Events unspool perhaps a little slowly in the beginning of this section and then rather too quickly toward the end, leaving the characters\u2019 motivations, and the truths we are eager to learn, somewhat occluded.", "title": "A New Zealand Novel Full of Taciturn Men and Wooden Dolls", "authors": ["Charlotte Graham-Mclay", "Craig Cliff"]}

Ro cannot stop thinking of Susan\u2019s offhand remark that \u201cyou don\u2019t truly become an adult until you have kids.\u201d Susan is preoccupied with the thought of Ro\u2019s questioning her reasons for changing her surname: \u201cHow come nobody\u2019s allowed to criticize a woman\u2019s decision to give up her name for a man\u2019s name? Just because it\u2019s her choice? I can think of some other bad choices that\u2014.\u201d Both women keep lists: Ro\u2019s is a self-flagellating inventory of reasons it\u2019s a bad idea for an unwed 42-year-old to raise a child; Susan\u2019s is a lengthy accounting of the unrelenting and grindingly dull routine of raising children: \u201cHerd crumbs into palm. Spray table. Wipe down table. Rinse cups and bowls,\u201d and on and on. Susan\u2019s resentment of Ro\u2019s rich intellectual life means the exhausted mother can\u2019t empathize with the single teacher\u2019s loneliness. But Ro\u2019s corresponding resentment of Susan\u2019s full family life means she can\u2019t empathize, either, with her friend\u2019s boredom and despair. These carefully chosen details feel urgent in our present moment, when women are constantly encouraged to compete with one another to attain an unattainable ideal of our gender.\n\nIf there is a criticism to be made of this highly absorbing novel, it is that it feels perhaps a shade too contemporary, and never quite reveals the horrors that would surely follow if the pre-Roe v. Wade days were to repeat themselves. The one disaster that has occurred \u2014 to Mattie\u2019s friend Yasmine \u2014 is elided from the action of the novel, and rendered soft-focus and ambiguous. The reader is left to wonder what it would be like to be a pregnant teenager of color under these new laws. Mattie\u2019s journey to try to terminate her pregnancy is far less demeaning and terrifying than the hardships endured by some women living in states with few legal, safe abortion clinics. Gin stands trial, but it\u2019s clear from early on that the forces conspiring against her would have seen her accused of a crime with or without the new laws. Having read one\u2019s Paley, one feels while reading Zumas\u2019s book that yes, this imagined dystopia is terrible, but the reality would be far worse.\n\nMaybe, though, it is almost impossible to write the truth about these things without seeming \u2014 how like a woman! \u2014 hysterical. As with the return of fascism and the measles outbreak, it\u2019s difficult to believe that mere foolishness and complacency could return us to the bad old days until we actually see it happen. And the novel gives the reader much to enjoy in the meantime. Zumas is a skillful writer, expertly keeping each of her characters in balanced motion, never allowing one to dominate the rest. Her cunning device of not revealing the name of each character in the sections she narrates grants us a multidimensional perspective on all four women, highlighting their roles in one another\u2019s stories. It\u2019s a beautiful metaphor for the interdependence of women\u2019s lives \u2014 for the way that, as Paley would remind us, the laws that imprison or criminalize one of us narrow the options for all of us.\n\nFloating over the narrative of \u201cRed Clocks,\u201d too, is the figure of Eivor Minervudottir, the subject of Ro\u2019s biography. This Arctic explorer\u2019s fierce yet cool interest in the natural world provides Zumas\u2019s suggested answer to the question: What is a woman when she is by herself? If, as Virginia Woolf posited, \u201ca woman must have \u2026 a room of her own\u201d \u2014 and, one is tempted to add, a womb of her own \u2014 to be able to create, then why are we so fearful of what nonsexual, nonreproductive passions could emerge from female solitude? And, if Minervudottir\u2019s tale never quite coheres, never quite touches the rest of the book, then her very ice-floe remoteness becomes a stark reminder of our society\u2019s detachment from a world in which a woman could simply and happily be left alone.", "title": "A Novel That Asks, What if Abortion Were Again Illegal?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nA STATE OF FREEDOM\n\nBy Neel Mukherjee\n\n278 pp. W.W. Norton. $25.95\n\nNeel Mukherjee likes to keep his titles a bit abstract, suggesting a mood or even an ethical choice, but conveying nothing about a book\u2019s characters or setting or plot. His first novel, \u201cA Life Apart,\u201d published in 2010, could be about almost anything; in practice it begins with an Indian student at Oxford and then moves in on the London sex trade. His 2014 novel, \u201cThe Lives of Others,\u201d shares its name with an earlier Oscar-winning German film, but those words fit beautifully onto its complex story of political and familial turmoil in Bengal. Both books have a 19th-century plenitude of detail, but it\u2019s the 19th century of Zola rather than Dickens. They\u2019re works of rub-your-nose-in-it naturalism, unforgiving and emotionally draining, books that make you squirm, and think. That\u2019s especially true of his latest novel, \u201cA State of Freedom.\u201d Except this title is less open-ended than it seems, and in using it Mukherjee has something very specific in mind: He has his eye on one crucial literary predecessor.\n\nV. S. Naipaul\u2019s \u201cIn a Free State\u201d won the Booker Prize in 1971, just a few years after it was established to recognize the year\u2019s best fiction from Britain and its former colonies. The award has had a better record than most: Many of its winners have stood the test of time and their tally includes remarkably few embarrassments. But \u201cIn a Free State\u201d stands out, even in a list that includes \u201cDisgrace\u201d and \u201cPossession,\u201d \u201cMidnight\u2019s Children\u201d and \u201cWolf Hall.\u201d It is dark and bitter and grand, and its prose mixes despair with a sense of majesty. Naipaul divides the book into five sections, each about people in motion from one continent to another, and frames its different narratives with a prologue and an epilogue whose cadences match his own autobiographical writing. No character reappears from one part to the next, but the book is unified by its sense of freedom as a disruptive force, as though its people were unmoored in something other than a physical sense.\n\nCalcutta-born and London-based, Mukherjee has twice been a finalist for the now-renamed Man Booker Prize, and this new novel stands as an echo of Naipaul\u2019s great work. The first of its five semi-independent sections concerns an expatriate Indian academic, a man bent on showing the Moghul remains of northern India to his American son: the Taj Mahal over lunch and then an hour\u2019s drive to the abandoned 16th-century capital of Fatehpur Sikri. He\u2019s a worried father, concerned that he \u201cmight have imposed too much on a 6-year-old,\u201d but he drags the boy along just the same, and grows irritated at his inattentiveness. He\u2019s also horrified at their driver\u2019s breakneck pace and dismayed by the beggars and touts, for whom his guidebook marks him as prey. America has made him soft; he\u2019s lost \u201cthe easy Indian ability to bark at people considered as servants.\u201d In other hands this might be comic, but Mukherjee begins on a foreboding note, and so as we read we wait for something to happen, something bad.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the way back from Fatehpur Sikri the car passes a fox-faced man with \u201ca mustache that seemed alive,\u201d leading a trained bear along the roadside. While Mukherjee\u2019s unhappy professor will vanish from the book, the bear\u2019s owner, Lakshman, reappears in its third section, as though the novelist had decided to imagine a life for a man glimpsed from the window of a moving car.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLakshman finds the cub near his village in the mountains and saves it from the cruelty of the local children, only to inflict a further cruelty of his own. The keepers of dancing bears are traditionally Muslims, known as \u201cqalandars\u201d; Lakshman, a Hindu, doesn\u2019t so much train the animal as beat it into submission, having first gotten its canines knocked out. Nevertheless the bear soon acquires a name, Raju, and a character, and when Lakshman runs away from the cares of village life, from his family and his debts, Raju becomes his only companion. This is the hardest of Mukherjee\u2019s narratives to read, but it\u2019s also the most original and the most beautifully written. (On a morning when \u201cthe heat is beginning to bare its teeth,\u201d the man and his bear must \u201ccleave to the shaded areas.\u201d)", "title": "A Novel That Echoes Naipaul, Exploring the Limits of Freedom", "authors": ["Michael Gorra", "Neel Mukherjee"]}
{"date": "2018-01-17 00:00:00", "text": "KING ZENO\n\nBy Nathaniel Rich\n\n386 pp. MCD/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28.\n\nA street preacher, perhaps the most minor of characters in Nathaniel Rich\u2019s ambitious and metaphorically dense third novel, \u201cKing Zeno,\u201d hangs moralistic signs on the back of his church wagon. One is about John Barleycorn. Another \u2014 we\u2019re in New Orleans in 1918 \u2014 reads, \u201cJAZZ KILLS.\u201d This is a tiny, atmospheric touch, viewed through the window of a police captain\u2019s office while prominent characters discuss an investigation into serial ax murders, but like nearly every detail in this novel of digging and questing, it has figurative resonance. The novel makes clear that jazz does indeed kill \u2014 not by its decadence, as the proselytist suggests, but by its novelty, its ingenuity. Jazz kills the old art forms, rag and swing. Jazz enacts violence on a song \u2014 one band is shown \u201cteasing apart the \u2018Tiger Rag\u2019 like an old sweater until it unraveled into something unrecognizable and frightening.\u201d And jazz assaults the listener \u2014 \u201cSlaughter me dead!\u201d one audience member screams during a show. In its diabolical innovation jazz is dangerous, and as such it is an ideal subject for a novel that roils with the inseparable energies of creation and destruction.\n\nJazz is but one of numerous intricate subjects that Rich admits into the novel. Others include World War I, the Spanish flu epidemic, serial murder, police procedures, race relations, the New Orleans Mafia, and the construction of the Industrial Canal, which links Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi River (and whose catastrophic breach during Hurricane Katrina looms meaningfully over the book: PROGRESS KILLS). Rich, a resident of New Orleans, throws his arms wide open to history and to the city, and \u201cKing Zeno,\u201d particularly in its first half, is as unruly and laterally active as a big urban novel ought to be. And the novel, like a city, somehow coheres, as Rich never loses control of the riotous raw material. The close third-person point of view rotates among three central figures, providing pattern and the promise of convergence; the mysterious ax murders serve as a narrative through-line; the canal exerts centripetal and allegorical force; and the extraordinary American yearning of the characters, as in Stephen Millhauser\u2019s \u201cMartin Dressler\u201d or E. L. Doctorow\u2019s \u201cThe Waterworks,\u201d is a constantly propulsive force.\n\nDespite his large canvas, Rich is a gifted portraitist of his three main characters. One is William Bastrop, a detective in the New Orleans Police Department who is haunted by recent experiences in the war. Bastrop has not been forthright to his wife, Maisie, nor to himself, about what happened in a besieged dugout in France, where many of his fellow soldiers died. One of the ghosts from his past turns out to be real \u2014 an eye-patched, trench-coated fellow soldier seeking revenge for Bastrop\u2019s cowardice \u2014 and Bastrop must escape harm and then confront his own trauma and fraudulence. Maisie (or Maze), after learning the truth about France, moves out. To save his marriage and to regain a sense of purpose and integrity, Bastrop decides, roughly midway through the novel, that he must solve the ax murder case. \u201cThis was no longer police work, at least not only police work. By solving this unsolvable case, he would solve Maze. He would prove his courage, regain his confidence.\u201d At this point his character achieves velocity and direction \u2014 he becomes a dramatic vector, a supersleuth.\n\nImage\n\nThe second central character is a Creole musician named Isadore Zeno. Isadore is a startlingly original cornet player who longs to be the king of New Orleans jazz, to make a new music that \u201cwould live forever, flowing from one generation to the next down the river of time into the sea of immortality.\u201d But listeners are not quite ready for Isadore\u2019s sound, and he is frustrated by his lack of good gigs. Zeno has a pregnant wife and he needs steady work. He dabbles in armed robbery, but ultimately goes straight, working as a canal digger and a cooper. For a time he forsakes the cornet, but eventually he resolves, roughly midway through the novel, to be both a family man and a jazzman. (As the son of a trumpet player, I was perhaps inordinately curious about how Zeno achieves and maintains his brilliance without seeming to practice.) When the hysteria surrounding the Axman gives Zeno an odd opportunity to take the stage, he very creatively capitalizes on the widespread fear. This daring and desperate move \u2014 somewhat convenient, dramatically speaking \u2014 furthers Zeno\u2019s music career, and also puts him on a dangerous course toward both the Axman and Bastrop.", "title": "A Novel of 1918 New Orleans, With Murder and All That Jazz", "authors": []}

But there\u2019s no sex.\u201d\n\nHang on. I thought you said this was a Hanif Kureishi book? I want my money back. Kureishi is the Londoner (of Pakistani descent) who wrote the 1985 Daniel Day Lewis film \u201cMy Beautiful Laundrette\u201d and arrived on the literary scene with the 1990 novel \u201cThe Buddha of Suburbia,\u201d a bi-curious picaresque whose wily mixed-race hero bed-hopped his way out of the London suburbs. \u201cAlways put your penis first,\u201d a wise old writer tells the main character in \u201cThe Last Word\u201d (2014), a directive every Kureishi protagonist has done his best to heed, with Waldo no exception. A once studly young buck in flares, love beads, shoulder-length black hair and \u201can ass you\u2019d pay to bite,\u201d he now lives with his wife, Zee, 22 years his junior, who feeds and washes his failing body. \u201cI am, I\u2019ve realized at last, the sort of fool who wants to be loved exclusively,\u201d he says.\n\nBut Waldo\u2019s imagination is not going quietly into the night. Convinced Zee is having an affair with a longtime pal of his, a down-at-the-heels film critic and Soho gadfly called Eddie who spends nights at their flat under the pretext of helping Zee with her nursing duties, Waldo goes to bed, feigns sleep, turns up his hearing aid and lets his mind run wild: \u201cWorking with sound and my imagination, I envisage the angles and cuts, making the only substantial films I can manage these days, mind movies.\u201d\n\nImage Credit Sonny Figueroa/The New York Times\n\nThe idea of a celibate Hanif Kureishi hero tormented by the very urges he once indulged is an excellent one \u2014 think Philip Roth in a chastity belt. Given the current cultural and political climate, in fact, that idea may have even more than usual appeal. The unfettered license that male writers have enjoyed when it comes to holding up every stain in the sheets as a palimpsest of their smarting, solipsistic souls is due for an overhaul. Sexual jealousy has produced many a major and minor classic, from Saul Bellow\u2019s \u201cHerzog\u201d to Patrick Hamilton\u2019s \u201cHangover Square\u201d and Julian Barnes\u2019s \u201cBefore She Met Me,\u201d but the trick of these books lies in the skill with which the writer evokes, through the heat haze of the protagonist\u2019s obsession, the bobbing horizon line of reality, however fleetingly glimpsed.

As a rule, this dance theater presents one company a week \u2014 but here it featured eight, in four programs, under the aegis of American Dance Platform, an annual fixture and part of the big early-January dance splurge across New York, with presenters coming in from around the country to sample as many troupes as possible.\n\nFor New Yorkers, it\u2019s also a valuable opportunity to sample new or unfamiliar dance.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "For all its successes, Los Angeles has not developed the political, cultural and philanthropic institutions that have proved critical in other American cities. The turmoil at The Times comes just months after Eli Broad, who has been the city\u2019s biggest philanthropist, announced he was retiring.\n\nThere are many reasons for this problem. Los Angeles County is made up of 88 different cities, including the City of Los Angeles, rolling across 4,571 square miles that stretch from the ocean to the desert. People here are more likely to identify themselves with the city or neighborhood where they live \u2014 be it Glendale, Compton, Beverly Hills or Whittier \u2014 rather than Los Angeles. The worsening traffic has encouraged people to stay close to the places where they live and work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so vast,\u201d said William Deverell, a historian of California at the University of Southern California. \u201cL.A. was self-consciously designed to be a decentralized place. What we call sprawl in the 21st century was part and parcel of the decentralized nature of the place.\u201d\n\nThere has been an exodus of Fortune 500 companies to other parts of the country from Los Angeles over the past 20 years \u2014 among them, Occidental Petroleum, which moved to Houston in 2014 \u2014 and with it the loss of business leaders who in other cities fill key civic roles. There were three Fortune 500 companies here in 2017, compared with seven in the City of Los Angeles in 1987. Many Hollywood executives and actors have homes in other parts of the country, and with some notable exceptions, have not played a major role in civic life here.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story California Today The news and stories that matter to Californians (and anyone else interested in the state).

And this is a relatively young city, filled with recent arrivals who do not have the history of the kind of old-line families who have defined civic foundations in established cities like Boston and Philadelphia.\n\nThe overlapping maze of governments works against the emergence of a single powerful political leader, such as an Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York City. The mayor here has little control over the school board or the health system.\n\nUnlike New York, which has two feisty daily tabloids and a 24-hours news station devoted only to New York news, The Los Angeles Times has stood increasingly alone as other news organizations have gone out of business, such as The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, which closed in 1989. That has meant the absence of different voices and the kind of competition that can ensure a live civic debate, particularly since Los Angeles does not have the prodding that comes with an aggressive tabloid culture.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMarylouise Oates, who was an influential society columnist for The Times in the 1980s, writing closely followed columns that covered every aspect of life here \u2014 politics, Hollywood, culture, along with events in the Jewish, Latino and African-American community \u2014 said she was distressed that there were few journalistic voices in the community today.\n\n\u201cThis city is so silo-ized,\u201d Ms. Oates said. \u201cI covered everything. At the time it was all one city. Otis Chandler made that possible. He decided it was a good thing to do.\u201d\n\nAntonio R. Villaraigosa, a former two-term mayor, said the lack of these kinds of forces was a constant obstacle to accomplishing anything ambitious when he was in City Hall.\n\n\u201cRallying the city around big challenges becomes more difficult when you don\u2019t have the broad cross-section of institutional players,\u201d said Mr. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who is running for governor. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything like that here. We\u2019ve been struggling for 50 years with weakened institutions.\u201d\n\nBut he said he thought that was changing. \u201cWe are a global city,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to see ourselves as a global city.\u201d\n\nThe other factor is the lack of philanthropy. There is no shortage of wealth in Los Angeles, but leaders of cultural institutions have long struggled to raise money or solicit contributions of art. Los Angeles ranked 14th in charitable giving in 2017, according to The Charity Navigator; San Diego ranked first. The Walt Disney Concert Hall, by any measure a landmark work of architecture in this city and the world, almost did not get completed; Richard Riordan, a former mayor, made a personal plea to Mr. Broad to help come up with the needed financing.\n\nMr. Broad said he was not worried that no one would step up to fill the shoes he has left since retirement. For example, he suggested, David Geffen, the Hollywood mogul who lives in Beverly Hills and New York, pledged $150 million last year for the construction of a new Los Angeles County Museum of Art building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a changing city,\u201d Mr. Broad said. \u201cIt\u2019s a younger city. We\u2019re growing up.\u201d\n\nGeography may be seen as an impediment to strong institutions, but it is also a central piece of Angeleno identity \u2014 a landscape of beaches, mountains, valleys, open skies and clusters of buildings. \u201cGeography is part of our values,\u201d said Zev Yaroslavsky, a former member of the county board of supervisors and a professor at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to live on top of each other, like in New York or Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSouthern Californians, he said, \u201cwant to be independent.\u201d\n\nBill Boyarsky, a former editor at The Los Angeles Times and the author of \u201cInventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times,\u201d a book on the newspaper, described the idea that people in Los Angeles \u201ccan\u2019t see beyond their block\u201d as an East Coast stereotype.\n\n\u201cI always thought geography was an unusual but true way of binding the city together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe developments come as Los Angeles \u2014 by many other measures \u2014 is on an upswing. The economy is humming. Its youthful mayor, Eric M. Garcetti, is traveling the country, a potential presidential candidate in 2020, which in some circles provokes eye-rolling, but is also a source of pride, particularly at a time when political activism in this relatively apolitical city has risen since the election of President Trump.\n\nThe city now has two professional football teams \u2014 after 20 years when there were none \u2014 and was chosen as the site of the 2028 Olympic Games. And a raft of new museums are opening or are being renovated, including one financed by the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures and another by George Lucas in downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe are a trendsetting city,\u201d Ms. Bojarsky said. \u201cAnd we look much more like what cities of the future are going to look like.

In politics, the newspaper bent City Hall to its will, and along the way propelled the rise of favored leaders, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. The Chandlers sold the family-controlled Times Mirror Company to the Tribune Company in 2000.\n\nThe newspaper developed from being less a political player and more a civic leader \u2014 a paper with international prestige that helped set the conversation every morning here. \u201cIt proved to be the golden age for an organization like The L.A. Times to engage citizens of Los Angeles,\u201d Mr. Beutner said. \u201cWith everything going on here today you\u2019d expect it to be a leader in the conversation.

He fell into a coma after binge drinking, his blood-alcohol level reaching 0.40, five times the legal limit to drive, prosecutors said. The fraternity was indicted on homicide and hazing charges, while no individual members were charged. The case fell apart after the fraternity dissolved its chapter at M.I.T.\n\nAnother fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was found guilty in 2012 of hazing and other charges after George Desdunes, a Cornell University sophomore from Brooklyn, died after drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. However, in that case, the fraternity did not present a defense; three students who were charged were acquitted.\n\nProsecutors routinely pursue criminal cases against institutions, often for white-collar crimes involving allegations of corporate malfeasance. Charges alleging violent offenses are less common. Legal experts said the situation with fraternities is analogous to workplace cases, such as in mines or on construction sites, where prosecutors believe an employer\u2019s negligence or wrongdoing contributed to a worker\u2019s injury or death.\n\nIn such cases, prosecutors have to show that the death was \u201cmuch more than pure possibility,\u201d said David LaBahn, the president of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. \u201cThis was a death that was preventable.\u201d\n\nIn the Baruch case, Pi Delta Psi has contended that the initiation rituals were unsanctioned.

For social scientists, the more actors manage to frame an issue to resonate for multiple constituencies, not just the core constituency, the more likely they are to influence politics.\n\nIn Latin America, both Catholic and evangelical clergymen have come up with an effective frame for their conservatism: opposition to what they have baptized the \u201cideology of gender.\u201d\n\nThis term is used to label any effort to promote acceptance of sexual and gender diversity. When experts argue that sexual diversity is real and gender identity is a construct, evangelical and Catholic clergies respond that this is just ideology, not science.\n\nEvangelicals are keen on stressing the word \u201cideology\u201d because this gives them the right, they argue, to protect themselves, and especially their children, from exposure to these ideas. Ideology of gender allows them to call for the protection of children as cover for homophobia.\n\nThe political beauty of \u201cideology of gender\u201d is that it has given clergymen a way to recast their religious stand in secular terms: as parents\u2019 rights. In Latin America, the new Christian slogan is, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with my kids.\u201d It is one of the results of this evangelical-Catholic collaboration.\n\nPolitically, we may be witnessing a historic truce between Protestants and Catholics in the region: Evangelicals agree to embrace the Catholic Church\u2019s strong condemnation of abortion, the Catholic Church embraces evangelicals\u2019 strong condemnation of sexual diversity, and together, they can confront rising secularism.\n\nThis truce poses a dilemma for Pope Francis, now on tour in Latin America. On the one hand, he has expressed rejection of extremism, and a desire to connect with the most modern, even liberal groups in the church. On the other hand, this pope has made \u201cChristian encounters\u201d a hallmark of his papacy, and he himself is not entirely allergic to the cultural conservatism of evangelicals.", "title": "Opinion | A Perfect Marriage: Evangelicals and Conservatives in Latin America", "authors": []}

Talks are scheduled through March or April. But given Mexican presidential elections on July 1, and a United States midterm vote in November, it would be impossible for a hypothetical agreement to be ratified by both Congresses, and perhaps the Canadian Parliament, before early 2019.\n\nThis would deter foreign investment at least until the new rules are determined and also allow the Trump administration to continue to threaten a Nafta blowup to obtain concessions from Mexico on other issues.\n\n\u201cHypothetical\u201d is a big word. Such little progress has been made on America\u2019s stringent demands that there is no agreement in sight.\n\nThe Trump administration wants the so-called rules of origin renegotiated, requiring, for example, that at least 50 percent of a Nafta-produced car be made of American parts. Washington also wants disputes settled in American courts (and not in the more neutral arbitration bodies set up by the treaty), limits on the export of some agricultural products from Mexico to the United States, and the entire agreement revisited every five years.\n\nWith these sticking points hanging over the talks, President Trump\u2019s negotiators may any day invoke Nafta\u2019s Article 2205, which provides for a signatory\u2019s exit from the treaty in six months.\n\nWhile Mexico will survive without Nafta, the impact on foreign investment, much more than on trade, would be devastating for the first few years. This is not good news for an economy that is expected to grow less than 2 percent in 2018, and has expanded recently at an average rate of barely 2 percent per year. Lower growth means less employment, which, among other things, could prompt greater emigration from Mexico to the United States.\n\nThe third squall ahead lies in the presidential election.

And the election promises to be fundamentally free and fair: another accomplishment. But the outcome, at least according to most current polls, promises to be problematic.

A few years later, she brought him over to present his production of \u201cAjax, the Madness\u201d at Philadelphia\u2019s FringeArts festival. He also conducted a four-day workshop that would plant the seed of HotHouse, the Wilma\u2019s \u201cartistic incubator\u201d and acting company, and a key element in Ms. Zizka\u2019s plan.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile many regional theaters once had resident companies, that model has evaporated over the past two decades or so.

(There were only three in 2017-18 because the Wilma presented Opera Philadelphia\u2019s \u201cWe Shall Not Be Moved\u201d in the fall slot, and also worked on a new lobby cafe around that time.)\n\nThe Wilma must also be aware of the ominous shadow cast by the neighboring Philadelphia Theater Company, which had to repurchase its own venue after the bank foreclosed and severely curtailed its 2017-18 season to pay off debt.\n\nSo for now, at least, the Wilma\u2019s effort remains financially modest: The HotHouse actors get paid when they are cast in a show, and they receive a stipend for attending the communal training Ms. Zizka has instituted to build esprit de corps.\n\nPhoto\n\nThree Mondays out of the month between September and June, the 12 company members participate in five-hour sessions filled with exercises drawn from Mr. Terzopoulos\u2019s techniques.\n\nThey did not go down easily at first.\n\n\u201cThere is a rigorous collectivity to this work that is strenuously un-American in a way that is both exciting and disturbing,\u201d said Ross Beschler, a HotHouse member.

Before entering the space, the participants leave their shoes at the door, along with their inhibitions and self-consciousness. Mr. Terzopoulos\u2019s approach emphasizes breathing, with the diaphragm the gateway to feeling, and it starts with an extended vocal and physical warm-up.\n\n\u201cThis is the idea of the vertical voice, in which you find emotions inside your body,\u201d the wiry, soft-spoken Ms. Zizka said. \u201cPeople are blocked in their bodies, so this is a way to generate emotions by opening up the back of the bodies.

That includes not only your physicality but your memory, your history, your imagination \u2014 everything about the human experience.\u201d\n\nThat phase can last three or four hours, according to Mr. Jain. Next comes \u201cthe infinite improvisation,\u201d he said, when \u201cyou start to marry a text or a concept or an idea to that form.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThis requires the actors to be comfortable with themselves and with one another \u2014 at a November session, some cried, others got into a trance-like state. \u201cIt\u2019s better than therapy,\u201d Ms. Zizka said, chuckling.\n\nAs her experiment evolves, Ms. Zizka must balance artistic daring with pragmatic considerations that American nonprofit institutions inevitably face.\n\nOne question mark is the future of WynTix, which keeps tickets for a show\u2019s initial run at an affordable $30 ($10 for students). A grant from the Wyncote Foundation in Philadelphia funded the initiative, which was extended by one year and is now slated to conclude at the end of the season; the Wilma is exploring ways to continue it.\n\nMeanwhile, on Jan. 10, the Wilma begins five-week run of the Stew and Heidi Rodewald musical \u201cPassing Strange,\u201d which will mix HotHouse members and others. The Wilma had to partner with a commercial producer to bring the Tony-nominated show\u2019s revival to fruition.\n\nThat show\u2019s director, Tea Alagic, has worked with HotHouse and attended the strenuous Monday sessions. So has Kate Tarker, who has been commissioned to write a play in the Wilma\u2019s 2018-19 season.\n\n\u201cThey have a warm-up ritual that they do on Mondays where it\u2019s like they\u2019re excavating this sadness from their bones,\u201d Ms. Tarker reported. \u201cSo I wrote them a piece that\u2019s a tragedy but also kind of a comedy about tragedy.

Though many see the public memorials to the breakaway Southern states as little more than celebrations of white supremacy, President Trump has lamented the removal of \u201cour beautiful\u201d Confederate statues.\n\nAt the same time, amid the shoving, shouting and violence, a more measured conversation is being had about the recalibration of American history and the rethinking of historical symbols, one in which the art world has played a central role.\n\nPhoto\n\nArtists, art historians and preservationists have weighed in on what to do with the decommissioned Confederate statues, and on questions of their artistic merit. In Baltimore, a statue of a pregnant black woman with a raised fist, created by the artist Pablo Machioli, briefly occupied a space where the city\u2019s Lee-Jackson memorial had stood before its removal in August. Good-natured petitions calling for alternative monuments to the African-American hip-hop artists OutKast and Missy Elliott have appeared in their respective hometowns of Atlanta and Portsmouth, Va.\n\nThis is the context in which the Alliance seeks to interject its revival of \u201cNative Guard.\u201d Ms. Trethewey\u2019s celebrated 2006 book is itself a kind of literary monument to her experience growing up in Mississippi as a biracial child, to her African-American mother, and to the Louisiana Native Guards, the black Union soldiers who fought on the Mississippi coast and guarded a prison camp for captured Confederates at Ship Island, south of Biloxi.\n\n\u201cThe book is trying, in many ways, to talk about those things that have been forgotten or erased or somehow left out of the historical record, and I\u2019m very concerned with trying to inscribe, or reinscribe, those things,\u201d Ms. Trethewey, an English professor at Northwestern University, said in a recent phone interview.\n\nThe Alliance\u2019s artistic director, Susan V. Booth, approached the Atlanta History Center with the idea of staging the play alongside its collection of Civil War artifacts. It was enthusiastically embraced by F. Sheffield Hale, the center\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cI said, \u2018Hell yeah,\u201d recalled Mr. Hale, who said he was already a fan of the book. \u201cIt fits into our new strategic plan of working with other institutions and getting different people from different ZIP codes and different interests in here,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Hale is not a historian but a history buff, an Atlanta native with a law degree from the University of Virginia.

From a neighborhood perspective, it makes a lot of sense to get that conversion going.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, some owners have sought to upgrade older buildings to Class A by \u201cre-skinning\u201d the facades, giving them a more modern look and reducing energy costs. So far, building owners in Washington continue to favor such cosmetic face-lifts over more substantial conversions.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother factor contributing to rising office vacancy rates, according to Mr. Widdicombe, is that some companies, notably law firms, are relocating to newer buildings, where they are leasing less space per employee, a workplace trend known as densification.\n\nA new concept in Washington, conversions have been implemented elsewhere. More than 37.5 million square feet of \u201colder office space that has reached functional obsolescence\u201d in the nation has been converted to residential use over the last decade, according to JLL.\n\nIn Washington\u2019s Maryland and Virginia suburbs, for instance, higher office vacancy rates have resulted in more conversions of older buildings without the use of government incentives.\n\nIn Old Town, a neighborhood in Alexandria, Va., the former offices of the Sheet Metal Workers International Union are now the Oronoco, a 60-unit luxury condominium on the Potomac River waterfront, with prices ranging from $1.3 million to $2.8 million. In Fairfax County, Washington\u2019s most populous suburb, the county government recently voted to streamline rezoning for the \u201crepurposing\u201d of commercial buildings.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Real Estate Newsletter Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.

But they have a mixed zoning history. They long housed commercial tenants, but the buildings were converted in 2006 into condos, ranging from $499,000 for a one-bedroom to $2 million for three-bedroom units.\n\nAccording to the DC Condo Boutique website, the townhouse row \u201ccombines historic details with modern conveniences.\u201d A one-bedroom, one-bath unit there \u2014 the only residence currently for sale and available for immediate occupancy in the entire Golden Triangle district \u2014 is on the market for $650,000. \u201cIncredible location,\u201d the listing says.", "title": "A Push to Make Washington\u2019s Downtown More Livable", "authors": ["Eugene L.

{"date": "2018-01-24 00:00:00", "text": "Neutrons from the source, slowed down by the water, would penetrate the uranium atoms in the cans and induce fissions. If the fissioning atoms released more neutrons, those \u201csecondary\u201d neutrons would irradiate the manganese. Measuring the radioactivity induced in the manganese would tell Fermi if the fissions were multiplying. If so, then a chain reaction might be possible, one bombarding neutron splitting a uranium atom and releasing two neutrons, those two splitting two other uranium atoms and releasing four, the four releasing eight, and so on in a geometric progression that could potentially produce vast amounts of energy for power \u2014 or for an atomic bomb. The experiment worked.\n\nIn 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized a program to build atomic bombs, hoping to defeat a Germany that was potentially a year or more ahead in the deadly race. Fermi, working now at the University of Chicago, undertook the building of a full-scale reactor to demonstrate that a chain reaction could be achieved and controlled. By then it was known as well that a nuclear reactor would breed a newly discovered element, plutonium, an alternative nuclear explosive. Fermi\u2019s reactor would also demonstrate the breeding of plutonium.\n\nInstead of water, which absorbed too many neutrons, the demonstration reactor would use graphite, the form of carbon found in pencil lead, to slow the neutrons. Graphite blocks the size of planter boxes, drilled with blind holes to house slugs of uranium metal, would be stacked layer by layer to form a spherical matrix. Fermi, who loved American idioms, called his creation a \u201cpile.\u201d\n\nAcross the month of November 1942, Fermi supervised the building of Chicago Pile No. 1 on a doubles squash court under the west stands of the university football stadium. It was ready on the frigid morning of Dec. 2, 1942. Through the morning and early afternoon, wielding his slide rule, Fermi slowly took the pile critical, with a characteristically Fermian break for lunch. It worked, which meant a bomb would almost certainly work as well.\n\nHistorically, no other development in Fermi\u2019s life ranks as high as the nuclear reactor, mighty versions of which produce more than 11 percent of the world\u2019s electricity today. Fermi continued to contribute original scientific work throughout the war and postwar at the University of Chicago. He advised the United States government on atomic energy and worked on weapons problems during summer stints at Los Alamos. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb more vehemently than J. Robert Oppenheimer but escaped the ruination visited upon Oppenheimer by the vindictive chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis L. Strauss. He went on to help build the first hydrogen bomb.\n\nI kept wishing this biography were livelier, lit with more surprises, but Schwartz, working with limited sources, tells the story well. A few infelicities are distracting. \u201cDisinterested\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cuninterested.\u201d \u201cFulsome\u201d still means \u201coffensively flattering,\u201d not \u201cgenerous,\u201d though the meaning is changing. Brig. Gen. Leslie R. Groves of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, not Oppenheimer, held \u201cauthority over the entire Manhattan Project.\u201d Oppenheimer was the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, one part of the project, where the first bombs were designed and built.\n\nStill, these are minor mistakes. All in all, Schwartz\u2019s biography adds importantly to the literature of the utterly remarkable men and women who opened up nuclear physics to the world.", "title": "A Remarkable Man Among Remarkable Men and Women", "authors": []}

Most of those joining Ms. Aksener\u2019s movement are young people chafing under the restrictions, she said.\n\nMs. Aksener and Mr. Erdogan both represent the center right of the political spectrum, but she opposes him on almost every aspect of his politics, from his increasingly autocratic form of government to his anti-Western diatribes that have damaged relations and scared off foreign investment.\n\nMr. Erdogan remains Turkey\u2019s most popular politician by far, but last year\u2019s referendum showed that the country is deeply divided. Ms. Aksener says she is uniquely placed to draw support from right-wing nationalists and more liberal centrists who are disenchanted with Mr. Erdogan.\n\n\u201cWe saw in the referendum the country is split in half,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Good Party is the only party that can get votes from both camps.\u201d\n\nStill, her path ahead will be anything but easy. Although Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party has slipped slightly in the polls, there is little sign that Ms. Aksener is the cause, said Kemal Can, a prominent political writer.\n\n\u201cMost of the polls show that she cannot draw the vote away from A.K.P.,\u201d he said, using the party\u2019s Turkish initials. \u201cShe may sway 1 or 2 percent from A.K.P., but these are already estranged voters who most probably already voted No in the referendum.\u201d\n\nSince she occupies some of the same political space as the president, Ms. Aksener is in many ways campaigning as the anti-Erdogan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe says she wants to re-establish freedom of expression, reverse draconian measures that have imprisoned journalists and closed down newspapers and media outlets, and restore a nonpartisan justice system and constitutional court.\n\nShe also says she wants to reverse Mr. Erdogan\u2019s April referendum, which will introduce an executive-style presidency after the next elections, regardless of who wins.\n\n\u201cWe are going to return to a parliamentary system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe second thing is to restore trust in the economy.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of a civil servant, Ms. Aksener grew up in a small rural village in western Turkey.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "This was not the case last December with the Gulf Cup, a biennial tournament featuring eight national teams from the region that was scheduled to be played in Qatar. Ten days before the opening match, with Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E. and Bahrain refusing to participate, Qatar agreed to allow the tournament be switched to Kuwait. (The U.A.E. soccer association said that, in that case, its reasons for boycotting were not political.)\n\nThe tournament went off without major incidents: Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. were placed in a different group from Qatar\u2019s, and their national teams never met on the field. But with no resolution to the diplomatic crisis, concern quickly shifted to this year\u2019s Champions League, a tournament featuring 32 of Asia\u2019s top clubs from various countries, set to begin its group stage in February.\n\nThe problem was that the tournament is split into eight groups of four teams, and with four clubs from Qatar, four from the Emirates and two from Saudi Arabia in the field, a collision of at least two of them seemed inevitable. (Iran, which has sided with Qatar in the political dispute, also has teams in the tournament and has its own diplomatic impasse with Saudi Arabia.) In the end, half of the eight groups contain at least one team from Qatar and one from Saudi Arabia or the U.A.E. (or both).\n\nIn January, the A.F.C. sent a delegation to the region to investigate the situation. But on Saturday it announced the games would be played at home sites after all, according to the event\u2019s regulations.\n\n\u201cThe regulations are clear, and matches must be played in home-and-away format, especially in club competitions,\u201d said Dato\u2019 Windsor John, the A.F.C.\u2019s general secretary. \u201cNow we need to think from an operational point of view. We need to sit down with them and see what is needed. In terms of venues, kickoff times and all the rest, there is a lot to do.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth the Saudi and U.A.E. federations expressed surprise at the decision but quickly indicated their participating clubs would not withdraw. The first tests arrive Feb. 12, when the group stage begins.\n\n\u201cIn view of U.A.E. F.A. keenness to cooperate with A.F.C., it announces the participation of its affiliated clubs in A.C.L. 2018,\u201d the U.A.E. federation said a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDorsey said that he saw compliance as a practical recognition by Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. of the popularity of soccer in their countries, and an acknowledgment of the risks of denying fans access to prestigious games.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

During the Gulf Cup in December, a Saudi delegation walked out of a news conference to protest the presence of Qatari journalists. In September, Saudi authorities ejected a reporter from the Qatari-owned network beIN Sports from a crucial 2018 World Cup qualifier in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, despite the network\u2019s status as the broadcast rights-holder for the event.\n\nThe A.F.C. has yet to comment on the prospect of neutral venues when Iranian and Saudi clubs meet. Those two countries cut diplomatic ties in January 2016, and a year later that dispute led to a Champions League semifinal between Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia and Iran\u2019s Persepolis being held in U.A.E. and Oman. Instead of games attracting as many as 150,000 fans combined in Riyadh and Tehran, only 14,000 people actually attended the two neutral-site matches.\n\n\u201cTaking the matches to a third country is a temporary solution, or should be,\u201d said Steve Kim, a former head of club competitions at the A.F.C. \u201cThe games need to be played home and away. But in Asia, that can be difficult.\u201d\n\nAll this sporting drama and tension is playing out against the backdrop of the 2022 World Cup, to be hosted by Qatar. The tournament is central to the country\u2019s efforts to become an influential player on the global stage, and disrupting it \u2014 or forcing its cancellation \u2014 could be seen as a coup for its rivals.\n\nIn October, a leading U.A.E. security official wrote on Twitter that the blockade would end if Qatar gave up hosting rights to the tournament. \u201cIf the World Cup goes out of Qatar, the crisis in Qatar will end because the crisis was made to break it,\u201d said the official, the Dubai security chief Dhahi Khalfan.\n\nThe recent decision by the Champions League, then, is encouraging, according to Dorsey. \u201cIf the Gulf crisis is to last into 2022, then this breach of the blockade means that an even more significant breach would occur at the World Cup,\u201d he said.\n\nFor John and the A.F.C., the issue was much simpler.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about that,\u201d he said of the World Cup. \u201cWe have obligations to fans, media and sponsors, and we are focused on making sure that our fixtures are completed.\u201d", "title": "A Soccer Tournament Breaks Through the Boycott of Qatar", "authors": ["John Duerden"]}

Ms. Brown said she and the dancers worked on stripping the gestures down so that they didn\u2019t look \u201cdancey,\u201d then on building them back up so that they became alive in a theatrical sense. She gives her dancers the freedom to make choices, the way actors do.\n\n\u201cI almost look at my dancers as actors,\u201d she said, which isn\u2019t surprising, since she is one of the rare concert dance choreographers who sustains a high-level career in theater, too.

{"date": "2018-01-04 00:00:00", "text": "\u2193\n\nA Mystified Allergist\n\nThe specialist spent nearly two hours going over everything the woman had been exposed to \u2014 food, plants, toxins, anything that might have triggered this nearly fatal allergic reaction. There were no new exposures that day, nothing she hadn\u2019t eaten or touched many times before and after this latest attack. The most common cause of severe allergic reactions in adults is food, but the allergist couldn\u2019t identify any likely suspects. He was mystified. He asked her to share her diagnosis when she got one.\n\nFor months after returning to her home on Long Island, the woman was anxious about everything she ate, and she worried every night when she went to bed. She always kept a bottle of Benadryl and an EpiPen with her, but still she was terrified about what might happen if she was too far from a hospital the next time.\n\n\u2193\n\n\u2018I Need a Nurse!\u2019\n\nWhen her next attack happened \u2014 just 10 months later \u2014 she was already in Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in East Patchogue, N.Y. She was being treated with antibiotics for a devastating case of gastroenteritis due to salmonella. Her first meal, after days of nothing but clear liquids, was beef brisket with potatoes and carrots. It smelled good, but she had no appetite. She made herself eat a few bites anyway, knowing it was her first step toward going home.\n\nPhoto\n\nA couple of hours later, she felt a strange itch on the top of her head. She scratched reflexively. Then the recognition hit her like a slap: Not now, she thought. She grabbed the IV pole, still dripping fluids into her system, and ran out into the hallway. \u201cI need a nurse,\u201d she shouted. Her heart was pounding, and she knew what was coming next. Hospital staffers in scrubs descended on her. Was she having a panic attack? No, an allergy attack, she told them.\n\nThey helped her back into bed and gave her oxygen, Benadryl and steroids. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d someone asked. She told the whole story, plus something she now realized \u2014 every one of her attacks seemed to come a few hours after she ate beef. She didn\u2019t go through this every time she had a hamburger or steak; meat was a regular and much-loved part of her diet. But she was pretty sure that she had steak \u2014 or beef brisket, this time \u2014 before each episode.\n\nHer doctors were dubious. New food allergies \u2014 especially severe ones like hers \u2014 are uncommon in adults. This was much more likely to be an allergic response to one of the antibiotics they were giving her. The patient, though, found that theory hard to swallow. It might explain this episode, but what about the earlier ones? She hadn\u2019t been on antibiotics then. The doctors had no answer.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

There was some kind of tick, the nurse told her, whose bite could make you allergic to meat. She didn\u2019t know much about it. But, the nurse suggested, she should check it out.\n\nThe woman had been bitten by ticks before \u2014 who on Long Island hasn\u2019t? But was it really possible for a bite to produce this crazy reaction? Indeed it was, she discovered, when she got home and began doing some research. The bite of the lone star tick \u2014 named for a white spot shaped like Texas on the arachnid\u2019s back \u2014 could cause an allergic reaction to mammalian meat. The trigger was a sugar, identified as galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose and more casually known as alpha-gal, a carbohydrate found in the flesh of all nonprimate mammals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow the tick bite triggers this allergy is not yet known. The link between the tick \u2014 whose range extends from southern Florida to Maine and as far west as Iowa \u2014 and the resulting alpha-gal allergy was first described in 2009 by Thomas Platts-Mills, a professor at the University of Virginia, who himself developed the disorder. Unlike most food allergies, in which symptoms occur within minutes of consuming the allergen, the alpha-gal reaction is delayed. The symptoms \u2014 ranging from a rash to nausea to shortness of breath and even anaphylaxis \u2014 can appear four to six hours after a meal containing meat. Stranger still, the reaction doesn\u2019t occur after every exposure.\n\n\u2193\n\nA Diet Changed Forever\n\nThe diagnosis of mammalian meat allergy (M.M.A.) can be confirmed with a blood test that identifies antibodies to alpha-gal. The patient contacted Diane Cymerman, an allergist she had seen years earlier for seasonal allergies. Cymerman asked her to list all the foods she consumed before her last episode in the hospital and had her blood tested for antibodies to everything on the list, down to the black pepper and parsley seasoning. And to alpha-gal.\n\nThe first results came back the following week: She had a moderate allergy to beef, but everything else was normal. The following month, the test results for alpha-gal antibodies came back. She was wildly allergic to galactose-\u03b1-1,3-galactose. Cymerman called the patient with the news. She had to avoid eating meat from mammals \u2014 and everything derived from them, including Jell-O and other foods and medications made from gelatin. Even safe foods cooked on a grill that has also been used for meat can be contaminated with enough alpha-gal to trigger a reaction.\n\nThe patient contacted the allergist back in Iowa and told him what she had. He was amazed. He had only recently heard a lecture on this phenomenon. He had never seen it before her case.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been easy for this Iowa transplant to give up beef and other meat that comes from mammals. Some days, she tells me, just thinking about a juicy hamburger or steak makes her stomach growl. But she remembers her terror and that long drive to the Iowa hospital and sticks to chicken, fish and vegetables.", "title": "A Strange Itch, Trouble Breathing, Then Anaphylactic Shock", "authors": ["Lisa Sanders"]}

In some ways, it\u2019s what the whole book is about. More than once Marcus counts himself \u201cone of those men who had always structured his days around radio news bulletins,\u201d and his struggle against a fractured worldview fed by media saturation is the novel\u2019s most compelling and recurring theme. The stories he dwells on longest involve a water contamination catastrophe that makes Mairead very ill (\u201chistory and politics were now a severe intestinal disorder, spliced into the figure of my wife who sweated along the pale length of her body\u201d) and a case of political graft sabotaging a public construction project he\u2019d overseen as an engineer. Meanwhile, his own \u201cchildhood ability to get ahead of myself and reason to apocalyptic ends\u201d he sees reinvented in his son, Darragh, as a \u201ckind of apocalyptic riffing,\u201d the media-age glibness of the young. It\u2019s in this context that a memory of something as innocuous as a video chat with Darragh (who was bumming around Australia, calling intermittently in the middle of the night) leads Marcus to imagine the world\u2019s end: \u201cstanding hollow-eyed in the middle of some desolation with the wind whistling through your skull, just before the world collapses\n\n\u201cmountains, rivers and lakes\n\n\u201cacres, roods and perches\n\n\u201cinto oblivion, drawn down into that fissure in creation where everything is consumed in the raging tides and swells of non-being, the physical world gone down in flames\n\n\u201cmountains, rivers and lakes\n\n\u201cand pulling with it also all those human rhythms that bind us together and draw the world into a community, those daily\n\n\u201crites, rhythms and rituals.\u201d\n\nMcCormack\u2019s sense of Armageddon is at once familiarly contemporary and blessedly contentious. Marcus\u2019s gloominess is tempered by his own self-skepticism and struggle, but the true counterpoint is an agnostic sort of spirituality that accumulates over the course of the novel, a sense of the connectedness of humanity, the world in all its parts, \u201cthat harmonic order,\u201d as Marcus imagines, \u201cwhich underlay everyone and everything.\u201d It is this same sense of order he identifies earlier, \u201cupholding the world like solar bones, that rarefied amalgam of time and light whose extension through every minute of the day is visible from the moment I get up in the morning and stand at the kitchen window with a mug of tea in my hand, watching the first cars of the day passing on the road.\u201d\n\nFor all its apparent stylistic complexity, \u201cSolar Bones\u201d is a beautifully simple book. Death has not solved Marcus\u2019s worldly problems, only offered a shift of scope, and this is what McCormack\u2019s novel offers as well. Where modernism took a world that appeared to be whole and showed it to be broken, \u201cSolar Bones\u201d takes a world that can\u2019t stop talking about how broken it is, and suggests it might possibly be whole.", "title": "A Stylistically Daring Novel Considers Fundamental Questions", "authors": ["Martin Riker", "Mike Mccormack"]}

Every six months or so, she flew to Zurich to withdraw money directly from Mr. Buck. She would return to the United States secretly carrying just under $10,000 in cash \u2014 the cutoff for having to make a customs declaration.\n\nThe setup allowed Ms. Butrus to avoid paying tens of thousands of dollars in income taxes. And it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Mr. Buck and Bank Frey.\n\nAs much as chocolate and watches, Switzerland is known for bank secrecy. That made the country a destination for money that the wealthy wanted to hide. Last decade, it also made Swiss banks targets for an assault by the United States government, which was tired of Americans escaping taxes on money in offshore accounts.\n\nMany banks came clean, divulging their clients to American authorities. Many Americans, including Ms. Butrus, searched for new places to park their money.\n\nBank Frey was among the very few to defy the legal onslaught. And Mr. Buck, a clean-cut and self-confident 28-year-old at the time he met Ms. Butrus, was the bank\u2019s public face, responsible for landing and then managing American accounts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat put Mr. Buck in the government\u2019s cross hairs. In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted him for conspiring to help Americans avoid taxes. It seemed like another blow against Swiss bank secrecy.\n\nBut things didn\u2019t go as prosecutors had planned \u2014 and the chain of events could have big consequences for America\u2019s fight to keep people from evading taxes using offshore bank accounts.\n\nPhoto\n\nA Small Outfit\n\nMr. Buck was raised in Germany. His parents had been championship ice dancers; his mother competed in figure skating for Switzerland in the 1972 Olympics in Japan.\n\nHis father ran an insurance company, and Mr. Buck figured that one day he would take it over. But an acquaintance from business school offered him a job in early 2007 at Bank Frey. The bank was tiny, with about 20 employees. Mr. Buck shared an office with four people, including the bank\u2019s receptionist. \u201cWe all got along well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe business revolved around clients that the bank\u2019s founder, Markus Frey, had accumulated over the years, according to Mr. Buck and the court testimony of another former bank employee. At first, there wasn\u2019t a focus on Americans.\n\nThen, in 2008, a legal earthquake shook the foundations of Swiss banking. American prosecutors started filing criminal charges against bankers and executives who had set up accounts for Americans. In 2009, UBS, the huge Swiss bank, admitted helping Americans hide money from the Internal Revenue Service and agreed to provide authorities with the names of its tax-dodging clients.\n\nSoon Swiss banks were expelling American clients.\n\nNot Bank Frey. It didn\u2019t have offices in the United States, and executives didn\u2019t see it as their responsibility to police whether their clients were paying taxes.\n\n\u201cWe decided there\u2019s no reason not to maintain business with American clients,\u201d Mr. Buck said in an interview. Executives consulted with legal experts to ensure they weren\u2019t crossing any lines. \u201cWe really tried to make sure that how we did the business is correct.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOpening accounts for desperate Americans seemed like a golden opportunity. \u201cThe positioning of Bank Frey as a solely Swiss private bank is now considered as a competitive advantage by the market,\u201d the bank\u2019s chief executive, Gregor Bienz, said at a board meeting in late 2008, according to records of the meeting. Mr. Bienz didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nOver the next few years, hundreds of millions of dollars in American deposits flowed from Swiss banking stalwarts \u2014 institutions like Credit Suisse and Julius Baer \u2014 to Bank Frey. Its number of American clients roughly tripled, according to court records. By September 2012, nearly half of the bank\u2019s $2.1 billion in assets was held on behalf of American taxpayers.\n\nThe Matterhorn Debit Card\n\nMs. Butrus was one of them. C. Richard Lucy, a former Goldman Sachs and Bank of America executive in New York, was another.\n\nIn late 2009, Mr. Lucy\u2019s contact at Julius Baer, where he\u2019d had an account for many years, told him he had to move it elsewhere. Mr. Lucy traveled to Zurich and met with about 15 banks. None would take his money, according to his court testimony.\n\nThere was one exception. \u201cA couple of times the name Bank Frey came up as a bank that was new and aggressively seeking out accounts,\u201d he testified. (He didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)\n\nSure enough, when Mr. Lucy showed up at Bank Frey\u2019s offices, Mr. Buck said he would open him an account.\n\nMr. Lucy was impressed by Mr. Buck\u2019s assurances that his bank had nothing to worry about in the American tax-evasion investigations. \u201cI had found what I was looking for,\u201d Mr. Lucy said.\n\nMr. Lucy said that Mr. Buck arranged for him to get a Matterhorn-emblazoned debit card that didn\u2019t have Bank Frey\u2019s or Mr. Lucy\u2019s names on it. Mr. Lucy was told that, when he needed money, he should call Bank Frey and ask them to load money onto the debit card. He could use it at any ATM.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lucy wanted to bring some account documentation back to New York. He said Mr. Buck advised him not to take anything with Bank Frey\u2019s name on it. (Mr. Buck denies giving that advice.) Mr. Lucy took a pair of scissors and snipped Bank Frey\u2019s name and logo off the paperwork.\n\nBack in Manhattan, Mr. Lucy bought a prepaid phone card for his calls to Zurich. He made them from a pay phone outside his apartment building. When that phone was damaged, the only other functioning pay phone he could find nearby was inside the kitchen of a boutique hotel. Surrounded by the kitchen\u2019s hubbub, he chatted on the phone with his Swiss banker.\n\nBy the turn of the decade, other Swiss banks were booting their American customers \u2014 and handing them glossy Bank Frey brochures on the way out the door.\n\nMr. Buck, who eventually rose to be Bank Frey\u2019s head of private banking, said he felt he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong. All the same, he warned one client, Christine Warsaw, against sending banking instructions through the United States Postal Service, she said in court. \u201cNo USPS, use fax,\u201d she wrote in a note to herself. Mr. Buck said he didn\u2019t tell her not to send materials through the mail.\n\nBy 2011, it was dangerous for Americans to keep their money in undeclared offshore accounts. More banks were handing over client lists to the Justice Department. If you showed up on a list, prosecutors might pursue you.\n\nA safer option was to turn yourself in to the I.R.S. through a voluntary self-disclosure program. It allowed taxpayers to pay back taxes, cooperate with investigators and move on with their lives.\n\nMs. Butrus closed her Bank Frey account and eventually declared the money to the I.R.S. She paid her taxes and a stiff penalty and pledged to help the I.R.S. and prosecutors. Mr. Lucy did, too. On disclosure forms, both identified Mr. Buck as their relationship manager.\n\nPhoto\n\nProsecutors were hunting for bankers to hold accountable. The theory was that bankers knew they were enabling Americans to break the law and therefore were part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Prosecutors turned to people including Ms. Butrus and Mr. Lucy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy 2013, more than 20 employees of Swiss financial institutions had been criminally charged. At least a dozen pleaded guilty and received a fine, probation or both. Several hunkered down in Switzerland, which refused to extradite its citizens to the United States for actions that weren\u2019t illegal in Switzerland.\n\nNone had actually gone on trial.\n\n\u2018Do It Now\u2019\n\nAt 5 o\u2019clock one morning in April 2013, Mr. Buck was awakened by a phone call. Bank Frey\u2019s chief executive was on the line. \u201cGo look at Bloomberg,\u201d Mr. Buck recalls him saying, referring to the business-news service.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d Mr. Buck said he replied.\n\n\u201cDo it now,\u201d his boss ordered.\n\nMr. Buck pulled out his cellphone. There it was: an article saying he had been indicted.\n\nTerrified, Mr. Buck skimmed the indictment. The indictment made clear that his former clients were assisting the government. \u201cIt was surreal,\u201d Mr. Buck said.\n\nMr. Buck, 32 years old at the time and single, went to work to hand in his I.D. card and cellphone. He was placed on paid leave; the bank would cover his legal expenses.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was her husband\u2019s birthday, and they were hosting a barbecue.\n\nHis sister, Sylvia Muther, was nearly nine months pregnant. \u201cWe were scared he\u2019d go to jail,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried not to think about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got hammered,\u201d Mr. Buck said.\n\nMr. Buck spent months weighing his options. He could plead guilty and be done with it. He could spend the rest of his life in Switzerland, which wouldn\u2019t extradite him. Or he could fight the charges.\n\nThat third road was perilous. If Mr. Buck won at trial, he would be free \u2014 and the Justice Department\u2019s fight against bankers who enable tax evasion would be dealt a serious blow. If he lost, he was looking at up to five years in prison.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn October 2014, one of UBS\u2019s top executives, Raoul Weil, went on trial in Florida.

The jury deliberated for barely an hour before acquitting him.\n\nThe same week, a Los Angeles jury acquitted an Israeli banker who faced similar accusations. The Americans\u2019 pursuit of foreign bankers no longer looked invincible.\n\nA few months later, on a cloudy morning in January 2015, Mr. Buck was skiing with friends in the Swiss Alps. Above the tree line, they started their descent.\n\nA sign on the slope marked the boundary between France and Switzerland. Mr. Buck realized he was crossing an international border \u2014 and that meant he theoretically could be picked up on an American arrest warrant in France. \u201cI was scared,\u201d Mr. Buck said.\n\nHe told his friends to continue without him. He snapped off his skis, trudged back up the slope and skied down the Swiss side of the mountain.\n\nMr. Buck realized he couldn\u2019t spend the rest of his life fearful of crossing a border. \u201cThere was no way I was just going to stay in Switzerland,\u201d he said.", "title": "A Swiss Banker Helped Americans Dodge Taxes.

But the president doesn\u2019t have the power to unilaterally make the decision to commit American troops to stop Mr. Assad by force. He needs to make his case to Congress and the American people, as well as the international community. Inserting American troops into this situation on his own is not just bad policy, it is illegal under both the Constitution and international law.\n\nStart with the Constitution. The founders created a system in which the power to declare war rests with Congress, not the president. The 1973 War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of introducing armed forces into hostilities in the absence of a declaration of war. The president must then terminate the use of armed forces within 60 days (with 30 days for withdrawal) unless Congress has declared war or otherwise authorized the use of military force.\n\nThe Trump foreign policy team has made clear that it does not think it must abide by any of these rules, and the new commitment announced by Secretary Tillerson shows that it is ready to break them. Clearly and lamentably, the president is prepared to flout constitutional limits on his authority to commit our troops on his own.\n\nThe Trump administration might argue that the troops are already in Syria, so keeping them there isn\u2019t \u201cintroducing them.\u201d But that would make a mockery of the statute. The Obama administration explained in 2015 that the authorizations for the use of military force that Congress agreed to in 2001 and 2002 provided the legal basis for operations against the Islamic State because they were broadly aimed at terrorism as a threat. That justification was tenuous, but surely nothing in the statutes could plausibly be said to extend to an American military presence in Syria after the Islamic State has been credibly debilitated.\n\nWe\u2019re not the first ones to point out such concerns. Senators Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, and Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, have worked for years to draw attention to the absence of legal authorization for military operations in the Middle East. And Bob Corker of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear at a recent committee hearing that if the United States were to remain in Syria to fight Iranian proxies, \u201cthe authorizations are not there for that kind of activity.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | A Syria Plan That Breaks the Law", "authors": []}

Porzingis was 7-foot-1 at the time. Bobroczkyi was 14.\n\nBobroczkyi was always tall, even when he was little. He passed six feet before his ninth birthday. He dunked at age 12. His father, Zsigmond, is 7-1, and his mother, Brunhilde, a former volleyball player, is 6-1. Still, their boy\u2019s size raised concerns. At the Cleveland Clinic, doctors ruled out Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition of the connective tissue that can lead to life-threatening heart trouble. Other tests over the years eliminated other, potentially worrisome, conditions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe made all kinds of tests through the years to ensure everything was all right,\u201d the father wrote in an email. \u201cWe made them everywhere, every year, once including Rome, Seville, Washington, Vitoria, Budapest. Everything was fine.\u201d\n\nIn Bobroczkyi\u2019s hometown, Arad, in western Romania, he was known mostly because of his father, who had played professionally with the Romanian clubs Elba Timisoara and West Petrom Arad, and even with Muresan on Romania\u2019s national team, forming what might have been the world\u2019s tallest frontcourt at the time. But he began to garner attention when, in middle school, he surpassed his father\u2019s height.\n\nHe went to Italy to play for an amateur club, A.S. Stella Azzurra, but took a year off from basketball to work on his frame, which was struggling to support his long limbs. Around that time, Bob Bossman, director of the basketball program at Spire, discovered a YouTube video of Bobroczkyi coolly knocking down 3-pointers and making passes.\n\n\u201cI saw he has potential,\u201d Bossman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to work with a kid like that often.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBossman reached out to Bobroczkyi on Facebook. The conversation began: Bossman told him about the facilities, the chance to play on a team with some of the nation\u2019s top recruits, to attend a small boarding school down the road, to practice at an Olympic training site. When Bobroczkyi and his family visited the campus in 2016, he packed a bag and did not return to Italy.\n\nHe first lived in a dorm at Grand River, a 187-year-old preparatory academy with 80 students. School officials brought in an eight-foot bed for his room and custom desks in his classrooms. He has since moved into a house with his basketball teammates at Spire; the bed could not fit in the door there, he said, so Bobroczkyi props two suitcases at the end of his twin with a pillow on top to support his feet.\n\n\u201cYou have to get used to it,\u201d he said of his height, a sizable understatement given the challenges that come with it. Doorways are perpetually too low. Pants need to be custom-ordered. Shirts are XXXXXL.\n\nHis team once flew him to Hartford for a game, but forgot to reserve a seat for him in an exit row.\n\n\u201cNever flying again, Coach,\u201d Bobroczkyi told Bossman when he landed.

She would not crack the top 200 again or reach the WTA Tour level, but she found herself enjoying tennis more than ever as part of a balanced life.\n\nThen came the violent episode in 2011. At a small tournament in Versmold, Germany, Tamaela was watching her friend Danielle Harmsen compete in a qualifying match against Karen Barbat. With Harmsen up a break at 4-2 in the first set, Barbat\u2019s father, Mihai, became enraged.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe screamed racial insults at Tamaela, whose father was born in the Netherlands to immigrants from the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, and struck her in her temple. She collapsed to the ground and was unconscious for several minutes.\n\n\u201cHe started talking to me and I didn\u2019t even know what was happening,\u201d Tamaela said.\n\nWhen she regained consciousness, she went to a police station to file a report, but later, according to news media reports, she began to vomit continuously and was taken in an ambulance to a nearby hospital.

In Danish news media reports, Barbat and his daughter claimed that he acted in self-defense after being provoked by Tamaela, which she denies. The Barbats had returned to their home in Denmark before the German police could contact them. Mihai Barbat was not arrested.\n\nHe had a history of erratic behavior on tour, including an arrest one year earlier for attempted drunken driving in a parking lot outside a tournament in Copenhagen. The International Tennis Federation ultimately banned him from its events for two years.\n\n\u201cThis is the truth in tennis: There are parents that are just nuts,\u201d Tamaela said. \u201cI feel sorry for their kids.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKaren Barbat apologized to Tamaela the next year.\n\n\u201cShe came to me, she apologized, but I haven\u2019t seen him,\u201d Tamaela said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would even recognize him if I see him.

Though nearly a decade apart in age, the pair shared a close bond. Krunic had been the first person outside Tamaela\u2019s family to contact her when she was hospitalized.\n\nAt first Krunic asked for only a few weeks at a time when her normal coaches were unable to travel with her. But in the summer of 2016, Krunic asked Tamaela if she would join her on the tour as her primary coach.\n\nTamaela was reluctant.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Alex, come on, I have my life here, my family, a full-time job with a contract,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a big step for me to take, and I always like security. I love to be home with my family. I had to give it some thought.\u201d\n\nTamaela said her boss told her: \u201c\u2018Elise, if you want to do it, you\u2019ve got to do it. And if you don\u2019t like it, come back.\u2019 So I had my security there, and I was just going to try, and I\u2019d go back if I didn\u2019t like it. But I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe pair have made great strides. Krunic finished 2016 ranked 147th, and has climbed over 100 spots to her current spot at 45th, a career high.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKrunic, who lost in the first round of the Australian Open last week, opened her season with a run to the quarterfinals at the Brisbane International. She beat the top-seeded Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, who retired in the third set because of cramping in the stiflingly humid summer weather.\n\nThat Krunic earned an impressive upset on the strength of her conditioning is not incidental. Tamaela pulls double duty as a coach with tennis experience and a credentialed physiotherapist, giving her a dual insight few others have.\n\n\u201cI worked a lot with professional athletes, and I know a lot of injuries are just overuse,\u201d Tamaela said. \u201cAlmost every injury is overuse, unless it\u2019s a trauma like in soccer. But in tennis, it\u2019s most of the time overuse. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to find, this balance.\u201d\n\nTamaela is also uncommon as a female coach, a rare cohort even on the women\u2019s professional tour. According to the WTA\u2019s most recent index of coaches, there are only eight players in the top 100 who list a woman as a coach or co-coach.\n\nKrunic had previously worked with another female coach, Biljana Veselinovic.\n\n\u201cMaybe the tour is still not really familiar with female coaches, but I tried it for myself, I loved it and I\u2019m pretty sure if some other girls tried it they would love it too,\u201d Krunic said.\n\nWorking with Tamaela gave her newfound trust and connection with a coach, Krunic said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the energy, and I\u2019m a pretty tough person to deal with because I have an opinion for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course sometimes I\u2019m right, sometimes I\u2019m wrong, but sometimes with guys it can get heated because not a lot of guys will allow some girl to say whatever she thinks. But with Elise, we\u2019re really good friends and she knows me really well.

On Wednesday, officials from North and South Korea agreed to field a joint women\u2019s hockey team and march under the same flag at the Olympics, which begin Feb. 9. The International Olympic Committee, which had been pressing for the two countries to cooperate during the Games, is expected to ratify the agreement at a meeting Saturday in Switzerland.\n\nSo far, the only North Korean athletes to qualify for the Pyeongchang Games are a pairs figure skating team but it is not clear if they will be among North Korea\u2019s delegation, which would number about 550 people and may also include a pop orchestra and supporters.\n\nThe move to field a joint hockey team, supported by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea but met with some criticism by the public, has created uncertainty for the South Korean team, which has trained as a core group over the last four years and already is something of a hybrid.\n\nTo fill out its roster and compete at the highest level, the Korean Ice Hockey Association recruited a handful of women\u2019s hockey players of Korean heritage from the United States and Canada. With their counterparts from South Korea, the women have established a familial bond while pushing to earn a reputation as a strong team, not just as one gifted a berth into their first Olympic appearance as the host nation.\n\nAmong the greatest unknown is who from the North will be joining their team.\n\nSarah Murray, the Canadian-born coach of the South Korean team, fielded those questions as she arrived in South Korea on Tuesday, facing a horde of reporters with a sudden, elevated interest in women\u2019s hockey and North Korean players.", "title": "A Tricky Reunion on the Ice for North and South Korean Hockey", "authors": []}

The other three members of the state\u2019s House delegation, all Republicans, signed on as co-sponsors.\n\nBut a reading of the bill, H.R. 4558, reveals it as a Trojan horse, appearing as a gift to the public while eroding federal environmental protections on public lands. If it becomes law, the bill could set a precedent with enormous consequences nationally, all of them bad for the national parks and the park service, which celebrates its 102nd birthday this August.

He perceives himself to be strikingly dull compared with his precocious family members, some of whom are writing dissertations while others are composing experimental music and planning to be distinguished in ways yet to be determined. The clan of six is both close-knit and dissociated by the privacy of their individual obsessions. Together, their collective erudition and oddness isolate them from their small French town, which is still intrigued by their precocity. But as a series of losses throws into sharp, sometimes devastating, light the limits and loneliness of the life of the mind, it is Dory \u2014 observant, feeling, open to others and to new experiences \u2014 who becomes, as his brother observes in an ethnographic treatise on their unique \u201cfamily system,\u201d \u201cthe one the other subjects turn to for comfort and hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow to Behave in a Crowd,\u201d Bordas\u2019s third novel and her first written in English, joins the league of novels about adolescence persuasively told by adolescent narrators. \u201cWho would care for a novel about us?\u201d asks one of Dory\u2019s siblings. The answer is: everyone.\n\nYIZA\n\nBy Michael K\u00f6hlmeier\n\nTranslated by Ruth Martin\n\n111 pp. Haus Publishing. Paper, $15.95.\n\nImage\n\nThe reader never feels safe in the world of this short novel, first published in Germany in 2016 as \u201cDas M\u00e4dchen mit dem Fingerhut\u201d (\u201cThe Girl With the Thimble\u201d). In an unnamed country, a trio of homeless children of unspecified nationalities negotiates the vicissitudes of their imperiled circumstance with a mix of innocence, preternatural canniness and an empathy that transcends the limits of language. Like many tragedies and fairy tales (\u201cOedipus Rex,\u201d \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d), K\u00f6hlmeier\u2019s dark gem of a story takes its English title from its protagonist, Yiza, a 6-year-old girl who escapes with two older boys from a home for migrant children. Yet this is no typical fall-from-power-through-hubris narrative or fabulist cautionary tale. Yiza, we learn, is not even a real name, and for a while the only vocabulary the three have in common is the names by which they call themselves. The mendicant world they wander through \u2014 stalked by starvation, illness, prejudice and evil \u2014 is all too real to anyone attuned to the predicament of displaced children. The engine of this simply told but important text (narrated in a stripped-down vocabulary, as though K\u00f6hlmeier and Martin have selected only words that can be easily translated into any language) is the resiliency of the children themselves. Despite privation and a lack of means to express to each other the staggering uncertainty of their situation, they nonetheless exchange talismanic gifts (the thimble) and are capable of loyalty and protectiveness that evince a humanity greater than any shown to them by society.\n\nLEA\n\nBy Pascal Mercier\n\nTranslated by Shaun Whiteside\n\n292 pp. Grove. $25.\n\nImage\n\nTwo middle-aged Swiss men \u2014 Martijn van Vliet and Adrian Herzog \u2014 meet by chance outside a Provence cafe.

Trump favors government cuts and corporate deregulation that would hurt many Americans. He has also failed to deliver on his promises to bring back factory jobs. \u201cIf you are a Democrat, and you are not talking about this every day,\u201d Ronald Klain, the longtime Democratic operative, wrote, referring to Trump\u2019s broken promises to Carrier workers in Indiana, \u201cyou are not using the most effective argument we have.\u201d\n\nA focus on economic issues will almost certainly be more effective than a focus on personality. But the question isn\u2019t just personality versus policy. It\u2019s also which kinds of policy Democrats emphasize. And economic issues are much more likely to be effective than cultural issues, even if Democrats rightly feel passionate about cultural issues like immigration and Trump\u2019s racism. Matthew Yglesias made this point well in Vox yesterday, also citing the recent Republican uptick in polls.\n\n\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether Trump is racist (he is),\u201d Yglesias tweeted, summarizing his piece, \u201cit\u2019s whether harping on that is a good way to defeat racism.\u201d His answer \u2014 which I agree with \u2014 is no. \u201cIf you want to help the people most severely victimized by Trumpism, you need to beat Trumpism at the polls,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs for the potential shutdown: Democrats are absolutely right to insist on protection for the so-called Dreamers \u2014 immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. And I understand why Senate Democrats view a potential government shutdown as their best leverage.\n\nBut Democrats would also be wise to be honest with themselves about the political downsides here. Notably, Claire McCaskill of Missouri \u2014 who represents a state Trump carried in 2016, the kind of area the party will need to win to retake control of Congress \u2014 seems concerned about a high-profile fight over immigration. It\u2019s not the subject most likely to drive Trump\u2019s approval rating back down into the 30s.\n\nThe best question for Democrats to ask themselves may be: Can we protect the Dreamers without turning immigration into the country\u2019s highest-profile political topic?\n\nTrump\u2019s agenda. Dr. Esther Choo laid out, in a series of tweets, who will suffer from the Trump administration\u2019s Medicaid changes: hard-working Americans doing their best to get by. This issue is one in which principled policy and smart politics are clearly aligned for Democrats.\n\nWhat about Wisconsin? In a special election this week in a Wisconsin state-legislature district, the Democrat won a shocking victory. The race is a reminder that Republicans remain very vulnerable.

The Justice Department in November sued to block the company\u2019s $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, a merger that would create a media and telecommunications behemoth with the ability to reach consumers through a wide variety of means.\n\nHuawei has been counting on the Mate 10 to compete with Apple\u2019s high-end iPhones, in a test of the potential appeal of a Chinese brand in the American market. While Huawei has long sold budget phones, some Mate 10 versions cost $900 or more without subsidies from phone carriers.\n\nHuawei sells smartphones in the United States, but it does not have smartphone deals with any of the major wireless carriers in the country. Those carriers \u2014 Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile \u2014 dominate the market, making it more difficult for Huawei to get a foothold in the country. The AT&T deal was supposed to cement the company\u2019s status as a top maker of the devices, alongside Apple and Samsung Electronics of South Korea.\n\nCongressional misgivings about the company\u2019s close relationship with the Chinese government have long plagued Huawei. Already, other major telecommunications companies refuse to buy the equipment Huawei makes for telecommunications networks \u2014 its core business \u2014 because of worries in Washington over security.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the letter, the lawmakers said Huawei had ties to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as to the country\u2019s intelligence and security services, and they accused Huawei of disregarding intellectual property. In particular, the letter implies that the deal with AT&T could more firmly establish Huawei phones in the United States, and ultimately open up the possibility of American government officials using them.\n\nAnalysts said the political opposition to Huawei was not surprising. Leaders in China and the United States view technology made in the other country with suspicion. In policy guidance and speeches, Chinese officials have repeatedly called for technology made by American companies to be replaced by locally produced ones. Beijing has also widely blocked major American internet companies from offering products in the country.\n\nAmerican lawmakers have stated their suspicions before. In 2012, a House Intelligence Committee report said two Chinese companies, including Huawei, were a threat to United States national security.\n\nFor a Chinese company that has pushed hard to become a recognized multinational player, the setback is only one of many in the United States.

After he served his sentence, Mr. Ragbir was ordered deported in 2006 and detained by immigration officials, then released on an order of supervision while his case moved through the immigration courts.\n\nIn 2011, the New York field office of the ICE granted him a stay of removal, allowing him to remain in the country. He was given several extensions of the stay, the last set to expire on Jan. 19. But ICE decided to detain him eight days early, at a Jan. 11 check-in.\n\nFederal prosecutors argued they did so because ICE had obtained travel documents from Trinidad. The agency flew him to a detention facility in Miami without initially notifying his lawyer and wife; the court later ordered him back to the New York area.\n\nBecause Mr. Ragbir was not a flight risk or a danger to the community, his lawyers argued that he should not have been detained.\n\nThe decision from the district court comes after several nationally prominent immigrant activists were detained in recent weeks. Mr. Ragbir\u2019s legal team from New York University Law School\u2019s Immigrant Rights Clinic, led by Alina Das, argued that officials from ICE detained him in order to silence and punish him.\n\nThey said that Scott Mechkowski, the assistant field director of ICE who ordered him deported, had resented Mr. Ragbir for his activism against the agency.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Jeremy Cutting, a legal intern for Ms. Das, said that Mr. Mechkowski had at one point referred to the Jan. 11 check-in as \u201cD-Day.\u201d After Mr. Ragbir was detained and taken away in an ambulance, it turned into a showdown; 18 people, including two City Council members, were arrested during protests outside the federal building.\n\nBrandon Waterman, a lawyer for the government, said that claims that government was targeting Mr. Ragbir was \u201cpure speculation,\u201d adding, \u201cwe have no information to support that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Das said that Mr. Ragbir has a separate lawsuit pending in New Jersey challenging his original criminal conviction.

Investors seeking new strategies, more dividends, executive changes or board seats aren\u2019t going away. If anything, the siege of P.&G. by Nelson Peltz, whose Trian Partners gained a director\u2019s seat after a 10-month campaign, will embolden others to take up the cause. Resistance isn\u2019t futile, but it needs to be more carefully considered.\n\nFrom General Motors to Whole Foods, no company was off limits in 2017. P.&G. proved size is no defense; the $230 billion conglomerate was the largest ever target for a proxy fight. Companies with a market capitalization of over $10 billion made up 21.4 percent of targets in the first 11 months of 2017, up more than two percentage points from the previous year, according to Activist Insight. Expect that trend to continue in 2018 even though activists went home empty-handed in more cases than not in those 11 months, which wasn\u2019t the case the previous year.\n\nFor companies, the best defense is a good offense. G.M.\u2019s Mary Barra handily fended off David Einhorn\u2019s attempt to split the stock. It helped that she had already begun to address the stock\u2019s discount by selling off the automaker\u2019s European brands before Mr. Einhorn launched his campaign, and that she carefully outlined the company\u2019s long-term strategy. Automatic Data Processing sent Bill Ackman packing by pointing out its efforts to transform its technology and the hedge-fund manager\u2019s comparatively poor performance.\n\nFor activists, sharp instincts and finely honed demands hold the key to success. Mr. Peltz made clear he wasn\u2019t seeking to break up P.&G. and sought a single board seat to push for new blood in management and greater emphasis on new products and mergers and acquisitions. The defiant 10-month defense by the chief executive, David Taylor, seemed out of proportion to the activist\u2019s ask and ultimately undercut Mr. Taylor\u2019s credibility. Look for more executives to follow the example of General Electric\u2019s John Flannery, who enlisted Mr. Peltz as an ally by giving Trian a board seat without a proxy fight.\n\nP.&G.\u2019s boardroom makeover offers companies an opportunity to wash their dirty laundry. Entrenchment, egocentricity and poor performance without a clear plan are a checklist for activist success.

At his confirmation hearing, he said the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay should remain open.\n\nThe tension between those two options has been clear during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office. Last year, prosecutors brought a man suspected of belonging to Al Qaeda to Philadelphia to face charges in federal court. The suspect, Ali Charaf Damache, a dual Algerian and Irish citizen, was transferred from Spain. If the administration had tried to send him to the military prison in Cuba, then Spain probably would have refused to cooperate.\n\nAdministration officials have said that Mr. Sessions still believes in the value of the Guant\u00e1namo facility.

And in this fight against terror, we have gotten results.\u201d\n\nAfter a driver killed eight people by plowing his truck down a crowded Manhattan bike path in November, Mr. Trump has signaled that he recognized the reality of prosecuting people at Guant\u00e1namo Bay.\n\n\u201cWould love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, \u201cbut statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans who were most vocal in their criticism when President Barack Obama made that same argument were silent in response to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEmirati officials had agreed to hand over Mr. Khabyar for federal prosecution. Former law enforcement officials said there was strong evidence that he had also spent time with Shabab, the Qaeda-affiliated group in Somalia. Current and former officials said agents hoped to persuade him to cooperate and help build cases against other members of Shabab and Al Qaeda.\n\nBut last month, top administration officials decided not to immediately bring Mr. Khaybar to the United States, a decision that effectively leaves his case in limbo and raises questions about what will happen to him.\n\nThe F.B.I. declined to comment.\n\nMr. Khaybar\u2019s case was not without complications. Some officials say he is a better candidate to face charges from the Emirati government. And even assuming he served time in an American prison, he could argue after his release that he should not be deported to Yemen or Sudan because he would be tortured.\n\nMr. Khaybar was captured in mid-2016 by United Arab Emirates forces during a raid. Officials said Mr. Khaybar, who is about 40, was cooperative and provided valuable information to his interrogators. His willingness to talk was viewed as a sign that he would have helped prosecutors once he was in American custody.\n\nHis case inside the intelligence community has been likened to that of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali terrorist who was captured in 2010 and brought back to New York, where he was successfully prosecuted. He became one of the F.B.I.\u2019s most important terrorism informants, and he is cited as proof that civilian courts could handle these types of cases.\n\nIn November, a federal jury in Washington convicted a former Libyan militia leader, Ahmed Abu Khattala, of terrorism charges arising from the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

But it is a way of making a point. It is also following a well-traveled historical path to statehood.\n\nIn 1796, the residents of Tennessee decided to force the issue of statehood by holding a convention, drafting a constitution, electing members of the House and Senate and then demanding that the other states let Tennessee in. The state eventually prevailed, and that hardball path to statehood came to be known as the Tennessee Plan. It has been copied by others, most recently Alaska, and Puerto Rico is now utilizing the technique.\n\nWith an eye toward worries about political realignment, the shadow delegation includes three Democrats, three Republicans and an independent. While they may not share the same view when it comes to assessing the quality of the federal response to the hurricane, they would agree that Puerto Rico\u2019s recovery would have been handled differently if it was a full-fledged state.\n\nThe new tax law, coming on the heels of the hurricane and a debilitating financial crisis, seemed to Puerto Ricans to be an especially cruel step. The legislation instituted a new tax on intellectual property held by foreign corporations that Puerto Ricans say will eliminate a main incentive for businesses to locate on the island and puts Puerto Rico on the same level as a foreign nation. \u201cWe are American citizens and these are American jobs,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nHe and other statehood backers say the island of nearly 3.5 million people \u2014 it would be the 30th largest state by population \u2014 would have fared much better with full representation in Congress and the right of residents to vote for president.\n\n\u201cBecause we don\u2019t have political power, because we don\u2019t have representatives, senators, no vote for president, we are treated as an afterthought,\u201d said Mr. Rossell\u00f3. \u201cWhen it is time to vote, there is not accountability.\u201d", "title": "Advocates of Puerto Rico Statehood Plan to Demand Representation", "authors": []}

Unlike the leading encyclopedic museums of London, Paris or Vienna, the Met will offer a single ticket for its permanent collection and its rotating displays. Bundling those together allows curators to present shows that may not always be easy crowdpleasers and whose importance cannot be assessed by foot traffic alone.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne extraordinary example opened recently in the museum\u2019s African wing. It contains just four works, by artists whose identity cannot be established (plus one bonus item), but they pack enough stunning technique and transcendent authority for a blockbuster of their own.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn \u201cThe Face of Dynasty: Royal Crests From Western Cameroon,\u201d you\u2019ll find a quartet of massive wooden crowns, known as tsesah crests, that served as avatars of kingship among the dozens of small monarchies of the Bamileke people in the grasslands of northwest Cameroon, near the contemporary border with Nigeria. Each is carved from a single piece of wood and takes the form of a highly stylized face topped by a vast vertical brow. The earliest and most fragile, dating to the 18th century, entered the Met\u2019s collection last year. Its three cousins, of finer finish and about a century more recent, have been lent from the Smithsonian in Washington, the Menil Collection in Houston, and a private collection. Put them together, examine their differences, understand their African political significance and their western aesthetic impacts, and you have a thundering show.\n\nPhoto\n\nOnly 15 tsesah crests still exist worldwide, and an American museum has never assembled so many at once. Each is a hefty three feet tall; their eyes are rendered as lightly outlined ovals, and the cheeks protrude so sharply as to form a ledge. Noses and mouths comprise simple geometric shapes, cones and spheres and half moons, while the towering brows are festooned with designs of startling intricacy. In the Met\u2019s early example, the brow is shaped like a spackling knife and retains the burl of the wood grain, though its top edge has been splintered over time. In the three 19th-century crests, the brows are carefully incised with rolling waves, in the case of the Menil\u2019s example; interlocking diamonds in the Smithsonian\u2019s; and a modified checkerboard pattern in the privately owned specimen.\n\nPhoto\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the Bamileke societies where these masterpieces emerged, the tsesah crest was the primary marker of a king\u2019s power and authority \u2014 and aesthetic similarities in far-flung examples suggest that rulers went out of their way to find the best artists. Courtiers would wear or hold these crests at enthronements, legal proceedings, funerals. (A 27-foot-long resist-dyed cloth, whose deep blue background is overlaid with interlocking crosses and chevrons, is this show\u2019s final object; it would have marked out a seating area for royals.)

And there always is (at least) one.\n\nIn previous years, journalists have responded to the heat in Hollywood by asking celebrities about #AskHerMore, the initiative to query actresses about more substantive things than their outfits; #OscarsSoWhite, which highlighted the dearth of diverse nominees; and, more recently, the presidency of Donald J. Trump.\n\nThis year, it is the celebrities, in particular the women, who are defining the agenda. Women attending the Globes have been asked to wear black gowns to show solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct. The plan was initially dismissed as a toothless gimmick, one that would do little to advance the #MeToo movement. But the call to wear black gowns turned out to be part of a sweeping and ambitious initiative, called Time\u2019s Up, created by some 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors and entertainment executives to fight sexual misconduct across the country. Time\u2019s Up boasts a $14 million legal defense fund for less privileged victims, and has already secured pledges from talent agencies to achieve gender parity in their corner offices by 2020. The black gowns aren\u2019t meant to just call attention to the problem, or mourn the industry\u2019s old guard; they are pointing to solutions.\n\n\u201cThis is a moment to shine a light on other people,\u201d said Reese Witherspoon, who has been working closely with Time\u2019s Up. \u201cThis is not the time to be quiet.\u201d", "title": "After #AskHerMore and #MeToo, Time\u2019s Up", "authors": ["Cara Buckley"]}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "After the media exposed the sexual assault allegations, other women came forward with stories of harassment and abuse dating back to 2002. Fifteen months later, federal prosecutors indicted Judge Kent for aggravated sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact and lying to the disciplinary committee about his actions.\n\nIt was only after Judge Kent was charged that the disciplinary panel agreed to conduct a further investigation, claiming to be \u201cunaware\u201d of how serious the misconduct was. In the end, there was no need: Judge Kent resigned after pleading guilty to obstructing justice under threat of impeachment.\n\nThis ordeal makes it clear that the chief justice\u2019s working group must overhaul the process to make it more robust and transparent. This is no easy task. The law mandates that all evidence, testimony and hearings relating to misconduct investigations be kept secret. But judges can \u2014 and should \u2014 publish detailed, well-reasoned opinions about the outcome of those cases to inform the public and maintain confidence in the integrity of the proceedings.\n\nAlso crucial to ensuring fairness is giving both sides the same procedural rights. The statute allows for equal treatment, but as enforced it is biased against the person who brings the complaint. An accused judge has the right to be present at a disciplinary hearing, to present testimony and witnesses, and to have a lawyer in any disciplinary case that is subject to investigation. The working group should provide the same rights to the person accusing the judge.\n\nSexual misconduct cases should also be automatically transferred from the circuit where they arose to a court in a different region of the country so that judges won\u2019t have to pass judgment on a close colleague whom they see on a regular basis. (Before he resigned, Judge Kozinski was set to be judged by his colleagues on the Second Circuit, but only because Chief Justice Roberts had ordered that transfer.)\n\nFinally, the working group should hold the nine Supreme Court justices accountable under the same standards. The fact that Congress exempted them when it passed the disciplinary law in 1980 is no excuse for refusing to play by the same rules as everyone else.\n\nNot everyone will go quietly like Judge Kozinski. And the Kent case has taught us that it is grossly unfair to the accusers for judges to convene in secret, shut one side out and issue written orders designed to obscure more than they inform. This coddling of undeserving colleagues undermines public confidence in the judiciary and makes hypocrites of the judges themselves, whose job is to ensure equal justice under the law.", "title": "Opinion | After #MeToo Comes to the Courts", "authors": []}

When nominations for the 90th Academy Awards are announced on Tuesday morning, almost all of the acting nominees are again expected to be white. The Vietnamese-American actress Hong Chau, who has a supporting role as a brusque refugee in \u201cDownsizing,\u201d could get a nod. Among black actors, Daniel Kaluuya, the \u201cGet Out\u201d star, and Mary J.

Rothman, chairman of the Sony Pictures Film Group, said in an email: \u201cClearly the United States Hispanic moviegoing audience, which is quite strong, is underserved in terms of stories and characters they can relate to. We hope that \u2018Miss Bala,\u2019 with its empowered Latina protagonist, can be a step forward in addressing this need.\u201d Sony is remaking that 2011 Mexican thriller with Gina Rodriguez and Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova as the leads.\n\nHollywood\u2019s other major studios declined to comment for this article, though several studio executives privately expressed frustration with the number of inclusion issues they are being asked to immediately address. At the moment, they said, the #MeToo fight against sexual harassment and gender equality has become all-consuming. They are also under pressure from activists working for improved onscreen representation for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Representatives for people with disabilities are also pushing for more respect.\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences referred a reporter to comments that John Bailey, the organization\u2019s president, made in an interview with The New York Times in August. The academy, which is 72 percent male and 87 percent white, roughly reflecting the demographics of the film industry, has pledged to double female and minority membership by 2020.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep doing everything we can to be more inclusive,\u201d Mr. Bailey said then. \u201cBut the academy is not the industry.

The 2014 directing prize went to Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for \u201cGravity.\u201d Alejandro G.

Chris Rock got the film industry\u2019s attention in 2014 when he wrote a blistering essay on diversity for The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cForget whether Hollywood is black enough,\u201d Mr. Rock wrote. \u201cA better question is: Is Hollywood Mexican enough? You\u2019re in L.A., you\u2019ve got to try not to hire Mexicans.\u201d\n\nBut the underrepresentation of Latinos, unlike the sidelining of other minority groups, has never truly entered the public conversation.\n\nOne possible reason is the diversity of Hispanics themselves, with their distinct cultures and races from different regions and countries, from Venezuela to Spain. It can be difficult, activists say, to rally uniform support for Latino-focused films, much less orchestrate a cohesive repudiation of Hollywood practices.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother explanation may involve the approach that many Hispanic advocates have taken. Rather than use direct confrontation \u2014 as when Spike Lee stood before academy members in 2015 and shouted, \u201cGet some flave up in this!\u201d \u2014 Hispanic stars like Eva Longoria and America Ferrera, and even people like Mr. Nogales, have instead tried to build consensus, often speaking out in passionate yet measured tones.\n\nChristy Haubegger, the founder of Latina magazine, for instance, has been trying to push for change from within the Hollywood system. She joined Creative Artists Agency in 2005 with a mandate to make the company and Hollywood more diverse. Creative Artists now represents more than 100 Hispanic clients, including Ms. Rodriguez, Ms. Cruz, Mr. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Ms. Longoria.\n\n\u201cTo create sustainable, long-term change in the entertainment industry, we have to start at the bottom and touch every rung of the ladder on up,\u201d Ms. Haubegger said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, and it takes patience. We\u2019re still in early days, which I know sounds crazy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe pointed to other efforts at Creative Artists, including overhauling the agency\u2019s internship program, which was almost entirely white and male a decade ago and is now 65 percent minorities and female; establishing a series of conferences, called Amplify, that aim to accelerate diversity efforts in Hollywood and beyond; and presenting Creative Artists-conducted research to studios. One study, for instance, analyzed box office results for more than 500 films released between 2014 and 2016 and found that movies with casts that were 30 percent or more diverse outperformed non-diverse counterparts.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s true at every budget level,\u201d Ms. Haubegger said.\n\nOne specific box office statistic, however, may help explain why most studios have not moved faster to include Hispanic actors: the relatively high percentage of frequent moviegoers who are Hispanic.\n\n\u201cTheir attitude is: \u2018Why should we do anything different? They are already coming,\u2019\u201d Ana-Christina Ram\u00f3n, an author of several reports on Hollywood and race at the University of California, Los Angeles, said of the studios.\n\nMs. Ram\u00f3n answers that question by pointing back to the data, which shows a sharp decline in the number of Hispanic frequent moviegoers over time. In 2013, for instance, 11.6 million Hispanics attended the movies frequently, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. In 2016, the last year for which figures are available, that number had fallen to 8.3 million.\n\n\u201cThey are losing loyal customers,\u201d Ms. Ram\u00f3n said.", "title": "After #OscarsSoWhite, Hispanics Seek Their Hollywood Moment", "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"]}

The opening leaks spinal fluid, and the base of the brain can sink into the spinal column and be harmed by pressure.\n\nResearch has shown that for carefully selected fetuses, surgery before birth rather than after gives the child better odds of being able to walk independently and of avoiding the need for an implanted shunt to prevent fluid buildup in the brain.\n\nUsually, the prenatal surgery requires cutting open the uterus. But after carefully studying the options and consulting various specialists, Lexi and Joshuwa Royer chose an experimental approach. In that procedure, developed at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital by Dr. Michael Belfort, the obstetrician and gynecologist-in-chief, and Dr. William Whitehead, a pediatric neurosurgeon, doctors make just tiny slits in the uterus to insert a camera and miniature instruments. The camera sends images to a monitor that the surgeons watch so they can see what they are doing.\n\nPhoto\n\nThough more data is needed, the newer approach seems to have two major advantages, which were important to the Royers. It appears less likely to lead to a premature birth, which can cause many complications for the newborn. And it gives the mother a chance to have a vaginal delivery. Women who have the usual fetal surgery have to give birth by cesarean section, which poses risks for subsequent pregnancies.\n\nFor the Royers, the procedure, described in an Oct. 23 article in The New York Times, lived up to its promises. Mrs. Royer\u2019s pregnancy lasted the full nine months, and she had a happy, uncomplicated vaginal birth with her husband by her side. Dr. Belfort delivered their son.\n\nThe infant\u2019s back, which previously had the biggest defect the surgeons had ever repaired, now showed barely a hint of it. But incisions on his sides, made during the fetal surgery to loosen enough tissue to cover the hole in his back, had not closed. Those cuts usually heal on their own after birth, but one had a sizable lump of tissue bulging out and needed suturing.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The likeliest path to reopening the government is an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that would stretch longer than the few days that Senate Democrats wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the House approved on Thursday night.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said on Saturday that the president refused to negotiate on immigration issues until there was a deal to reopen the government.\n\nReferring to Democrats\u2019 insistence that a deal to protect the young immigrants be in hand before they agree to a funding measure, Marc Short, the White House legislative director, told reporters at the White House: \u201cThere is nothing in this bill Democrats say they object to, yet it\u2019s like a 2-year-old temper tantrum to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to take my toys and go home because I\u2019m upset about something else.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn his morning Twitter burst, Mr. Trump said Democrats were prioritizing \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d over American citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year\u2019s midterm congressional elections.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border,\u201d the president said on Twitter. \u201cThey could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was Mr. Trump who opted not to pursue a potential deal that he and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, had hashed out over lunch at the White House on Friday. The proposal would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while including disaster aid funds and money for a federal children\u2019s health insurance program.

At the Berkeley Rose School, in Alameda County, only 13 percent of kindergarten students were up to date on vaccinations in 2014. George De La Torre Jr. Elementary, in Los Angeles, was at 14 percent. The Community Outreach Academy, a large public school in Sacramento, was at 46 percent. These were on the lower end \u2014 but they were not the lowest rates.\n\nThere were two ways a student could be unvaccinated in 2014 in the California public schools. Some students were admitted \u201cconditionally\u201d \u2014 that is, not fully vaccinated but planning to be soon. Other students had a formal \u201cpersonal belief exemption.\u201d That is, for religious or other reasons \u2014 often misplaced fears of vaccine injury \u2014 the parents could choose not to vaccinate their children at all.\n\nThese varied greatly across schools. In the Berkeley Rose School, a private Waldorf school, all of the unvaccinated students (87 percent of the kindergartners) had personal belief exemptions. In elementary schools in poorer parts of Los Angeles, the lack of up-to-date vaccination was due mostly to conditional enrollment. In practice, in this period there was little follow-up on the vaccination of conditionally enrolled students, so conditional non-vaccination could easily turn into long-term non-vaccination.\n\nIn the end, the result was the same: many schools with many unvaccinated children, and they were at risk. Measles is extremely contagious. If you introduce it into a school where only 13 percent of students are vaccinated, a lot of people will become ill.\n\nIn response to the Disneyland outbreak, California suddenly went from a state with quite lax school vaccination standards to one with extremely strict requirements. The state passed Senate Bill 277, which went into effect in 2016 and eliminated all personal belief exemptions and tightened the approach to conditionally enrolled students. No longer could a parent say, \u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d; there had to be a plan for vaccine completion over a period of about six months.\n\nThe only remaining exemptions were for medical reasons. And since all schools, public and private, have to report the vaccination status of enrolled children, including documentation, the state has a way to monitor this. Without seeing your vaccination records, a school simply is not allowed to enroll you. And children have to be enrolled in school.\n\nPublic health researchers have studied the relationship between state vaccination rules and vaccination rates, and have generally found that stricter vaccination laws generate higher vaccination rates on average. But these studies tend to focus on state levels over all, rather than on the distribution.

I had an entire beach nearly to myself, and swatted the occasional sandfly as I watched bruised grays and yellows stretching across the horizon, pinks popping vividly, in part thanks to the lack of any visible electric light from the shore. I would spend those next few days in late March snorkeling in limpid, blue waters, hiking in Corcovado National Park, and riding around on the back of a motorbike in one of the more splendid, unspoiled places I\u2019d ever visited.\n\nThe airport in Drake Bay, on the southwestern coast, consisted of a small shack next to a long strip of asphalt. I had arrived by small aircraft, a single-propeller Cessna operated by Sansa Airlines. It was the same type of plane that crashed this past New Year\u2019s Eve outside of Punta Islita Airport, killing 10 Americans. Air fatalities, while rare, are always sobering. And the tragedy of this crash is particularly difficult to reconcile with the remarkable beauty of Costa Rica \u2014 a place American tourists have embraced as one of the world\u2019s top eco-travel destinations, and one that I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to return to.\n\nOf the roughly 2.7 million tourists who visit Costa Rica annually, 40 percent are from the United States. This is largely because of the country\u2019s extraordinary wildlife, rain forests, and cloud forests, but also its stability within a historically volatile area. Costa Rica has been an uninterrupted democracy since the late 1940s in a region marred by political and economic turmoil. Its G.D.P. has grown at an average of nearly 5 percent since 1992, well ahead of other countries in the region. And the country is now practically synonymous with sustainable tourism and eco-tourism, having abolished its standing military following the Costa Rican Civil War in 1948 and funneled some of that money into developing social and environmental conservation programs.\n\nThat success manifests itself in great national pride \u2014 a calm assurance that I witnessed throughout my visit. \u201cYou\u2019re in Costa Rica now, relax!\u201d my snorkeling guide, Gustavo, advised a seasick German woman in our group. The immediate friendliness and warmth of Ticos, as Costa Ricans call themselves, allow visitors to easily get back to nature and experience the Costa Rican concept of \u201cpura vida,\u201d or pure life, that is the unofficial national motto and a phrase you\u2019ll hear daily while in the country.", "title": "After a Tragedy, Making the Case for Costa Rica", "authors": []}

Zero consequences, and everyone just moves on.\u201d\n\nShe proposed another scenario: \u201cThe president has an extramarital affair with a porn star, right after his wife gives birth to a son. Then he pays the porn star to shut up. Does it even matter to, say, his evangelical base?\u201d\n\nKenan Thompson, playing another contestant, answered: \u201cTo evangelicals, of course it matters. It\u2019s against everything that they stand for.\u201d\n\nThe buzzer sounded again. \u201cYou\u2019d think so, but no,\u201d Ms. Chastain said despairingly. \u201cThey say he\u2019s just repented and they forgive him, and Mike Pence is like, \u2018That\u2019s my dude.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe game went on, with Ms. Chastain\u2019s character drifting further into delirium and eventually asking the three players to write down anything they thought would matter or lead to consequences for President Trump. The contestants came back with scenarios like \u201cTrump Punches Pope,\u201d \u201cHe Cancels Olympics Because Flags Are \u2018Gay,\u2019\u201d and \u201cSex Tape With Don Jr.\u201d\n\nWrong again, Ms. Chastain countered for each: \u201cBecause nothing truly matters \u2014 none of it matters.\u201d\n\nThe White House Physician Is (to Put It Mildly) a Trump Guy\n\nIn the opening sketch, Aidy Bryant played Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, holding a news conference to discuss the results of Mr. Trump\u2019s recent physical examination.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Bryant first addressed the shutdown of the federal government, saying:\n\nPresident Trump maintains that any deal he signs must include a border wall, and he\u2019s been consistent that it must be a solid, physical wall with some parts see-through, some parts fence and some parts empty spaces that just operate on the honor system. And it will be paid for by Mexico with U.S. taxpayer money.\n\nPlaying the White House physician, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, Beck Bennett then came to the podium to discuss \u201chow not-fat the president is.\u201d Mr. Bennett said his \u201cunbiased, 100 percent accurate health assessment\u201d had found that President Trump weighed \u201ca very svelte 239 pounds\u201d with \u201ca gorgeous, 44-inch Coke-bottle waist.\u201d The president is \u201c75 inches\u201d tall (or 6-foot-3, which is accurate), Mr. Bennett said, \u201cwith legs that \u2014 well, they seem to go on forever,\u201d and he wears a size 12 shoe, \u201cso you can fill in the blanks there.\u201d\n\nIn this week\u2019s other memorable moments:\n\nStormy Daniels Segment of the Week No. 1\n\nNaturally, \u201cWeekend Update\u201d couldn\u2019t resist the saga of Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump and was reportedly paid $130,000 in hush money shortly before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThis week, I was finally able to Google \u2018Stormy Daniels\u2019 on my work computer,\u201d said Colin Jost, the co-anchor.\n\nHe continued:\n\nIn an interview from 2011, porn star Stormy Daniels said that while she was having an affair with Donald Trump, he told her she was beautiful and smart, just like his daughter. Which is somehow the grossest thing anyone has ever said to Stormy Daniels. I just love watching Mike Pence through all of this. He\u2019s a button-down, conservative Christian. Now he\u2019s going to go ride-or-die with Caligula. At this point, Pence would probably be more comfortable as a judge on \u2018RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race.\u2019\u201d\n\nStormy Daniels Segment of the Week No. 2\n\nMr. Jost\u2019s co-anchor, Michael Che, added:\n\nThe worst part about that Stormy Daniels story was that it was so lame. An old rich dude cheated on his wife with a porn star. Clutch my pearls. I thought we\u2019d at least get some freaky details out of it. I mean, Donald Trump grabs women by the vagina as his opener. So, his actual sex must be insane, right? But the craziest thing we got is that he was spanked with a magazine and he\u2019s afraid of sharks. Well, of course he\u2019s afraid of sharks \u2014 the man has a body of a seal.\u201d\n\nStormy Daniels Segment of the Week No. 3\n\nCecily Strong portrayed Ms. Clifford in a deskside segment on \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d in which Mr. Jost introduced her as an \u201cunlikely ally for critics of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nMs. Strong agreed. \u201cI\u2019m like a liberal hero,\u201d she said, \u201ceven though I\u2019m a Republican porn star who loves Sarah Palin. Right? Things are so bad now, there are so many women just desperately trying to figure out how to be empowered by me. And the best they can say is that I\u2019m a female director.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cNow, I get it, that I\u2019m not what these people envisioned their hero would look like. But guess what, America? I\u2019m the hero you deserve right now.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s March Shout-Out of the Week\n\nIn her opening monologue, Ms. Chastain expressed regret that she could not participate in the Women\u2019s March this weekend. Instead, she performed a cover of \u201cYou Don\u2019t Own Me\u201d with Ms. McKinnon and Ms. Strong, while other cast members tossed out quick jokes about the event.\n\nMs. Bryant said she had \u201cp-hats\u201d for the occasion, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t say the real word because it\u2019s just one of those many words that only the president can use.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer co-star Leslie Jones strode out and said, \u201cYou mean pussy hats?\u201d\n\nLater, Melissa Villase\u00f1or explained why she was dressing up for the march: \u201cLook, I\u2019m a proud feminist, but I\u2019m still trying to catch a husband,\u201d she said.\n\nImprobable Robert Mueller Impression of the Week\n\nIf Ms. McKinnon can play Hillary Clinton, Kellyanne Conway, Theresa May, Angela Merkel, Mika Brzezinski, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Jeff Sessions, then why not Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election?\n\nWearing a facial prosthesis that we\u2019ll see later in our nightmares, Ms. McKinnon portrayed Mr. Mueller as not trying too hard to conceal the progress of his investigation. \u201cYou know how you loved the show \u2018Lost,\u2019 but it never really came together?\u201d she asked. \u201cThere was no satisfying ending?

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "Aside from some initial public apologies, including one emailed newsletter that included a recipe for cinnamon rolls, Mr. Batali has been silent. By all accounts, he is not engaged in running the restaurant group that he started with his partner, Joe Bastianich, in 1998 when they opened Babbo in Greenwich Village. Yet the terms of his income stream from the company have not changed, Mr. Bastianich said.\n\nIn an email on Tuesday, Mr. Batali, 57, said he had been spending time with his wife. \u201cI am taking some time away from the restaurants to work on myself,\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness decisions will come after that.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Bastianich is moving ahead to remake the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which has nearly 2,100 employees and 24 restaurants, including operations in Las Vegas and the elegant Del Posto in New York. That includes plotting a future without Mr. Batali.\n\n\u201cDivorces are never easy,\u201d Mr. Bastianich said. \u201cDo we buy out? Do we split restaurants? We may have intentions. He has intentions. Really, the decision is his. He\u2019s going through a process. We\u2019re going through a process. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u2018Changing the DNA\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nAt first, Mr. Bastianich said, the two were talking frequently. Then came a period when they would communicate only through representatives. They recently began speaking again.\n\nMr. Batali has lost his contract with the ABC-TV show \u201cThe Chew.\u201d Licensing deals have disappeared; the Eataly stores have pulled his books and food products from shelves, and have said that he is no longer actively involved with the chain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going through a very difficult thing,\u201d Mr. Bastianich said. \u201cHe is prioritizing his personal life because that will bring more clarity to his future as chef.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bastianich said that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Mr. Bastianich also recently apologized for sexist and racist comments he made on Italian television.\n\nHe said he is intent on \u201ccompletely changing the DNA of the company.\u201d He is interviewing branding agencies to develop a new name, and centralizing some business practices and expanding medical and other benefits for employees in an organization that has let each restaurant essentially function as its own company.\n\nFrank Langello, the executive chef at Babbo, who staff members said had created a sexualized and hostile work environment, left the company this month and was replaced by Rob Zwirz, from Lupa. A new human resources manager started this month, and an outside firm has been hired to investigate any future claims of employee harassment.\n\nBoth Mr. Bastianich\u2019s mother, the chef Lidia Bastianich, 70, and Nancy Silverton, 63, a partner with Mr. Bastianich and Mr. Batali in the Mozza group of restaurants in Southern California and Singapore, have been elevated to leadership roles.\n\nMs. Silverton, a respected veteran of the California dining scene, said she had been so focused on her own group of restaurants that she had no idea that sexual harassment was so pervasive in other parts of the B & B empire, or of how Mr. Batali behaved around women.\n\n\u201cWas he a prude? No,\u201d she said. \u201cBut did I know to what extent? No.\u201d\n\nLike many in an industry fueled by good-natured sexualized camaraderie, alcohol and a battlefield mentality, Ms. Silverton is still parsing the line between boorish and unacceptable behavior. With time, a more nuanced view will prevail, she said.\n\n\u201cThe way I look at it is, O.K., take a deep breath and now let\u2019s turn something positive into what was such a negative,\u201d she said.\n\nIn New Orleans, Women Step Up\n\nPhoto\n\nThe effort to stabilize the chef John Besh\u2019s restaurant group in New Orleans has had more time to jell. News that 25 current and former employees had been sexually harassed at some of his dozen restaurants was reported by The Times-Picayune in October, two weeks after The New York Times broke the story about predatory sexual behavior by Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Besh, 49, remains an owner of the business, which includes eight restaurants and has renamed itself BRG Hospitality, and he has final approval on major business decisions. But he has permanently turned over everything else to Shannon White, 31, who started with the company as a server.\n\nWhen the scandal broke, she had just been named the company\u2019s chief operating officer and had become a mother for the first time. In an interview in New Orleans last week, she said that in those first few days she realized that if the ship was going fto be saved, somebody needed to take control.\n\n\u201cIt was like we were in the eye of the hurricane,\u201d she said. She persuaded Mr. Besh and his business partner, Octavio Mantilla, to make her chief executive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a women\u2019s problem, and women have to take the lead,\u201d she said. \u201cA man is not going to understand it.\u201d\n\nIn an emotional meeting with the executive chefs and general managers, Ms. White said they had a long road ahead but assured them that drastic changes were coming.\n\nShe set up a hotline, revised training procedures and updated the employee handbook, adding a code of conduct and a morals-and-ethics clause. She started an assistance program open to all 1,200 employees, and is creating an employee advisory committee. She hired an independent investigator who unearthed another case of harassment; the bill for that alone may top $50,000, she said.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think of the financial implications of any of this,\u201d Ms. White said. \u201cNo matter what, there were people who were at our restaurants who were being harassed, period. And it was going to stop, whatever it took.\u201d\n\nAs for Mr. Besh, she said, \u201cWe are trying to figure out what, if any, role he may have in the future.\u201d\n\nMs. White also consults regularly with Kelly Fields, the outspoken star chef at Willa Jean, the Besh restaurant that Ms. Fields helped start in 2015 and where, until the scandal hit, Mr. Besh got his morning coffee.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Fields, 39, who was traveling in Iceland when the harassment story broke, recalled her early conversations with Mr. Besh. \u201cHe was a mess and worried about his family,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I was worried about this business and our family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt was ugly at first. Business slumped. People called the restaurants and asked how anyone could still work there. Influential New Orleanians stopped recommending Besh restaurants to visitors. Ms. Fields considered walking away, but decided to stay. She liked the challenge of changing both the Besh group and the larger restaurant culture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to weather it \u2014 we are going to take it and run with it,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Besh said in an email last week that he was focusing on his family, and praised Ms. White and Ms. Fields for setting a new standard for the industry.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His first, Pizzaiolo, has been a hub of local left-leaning politics, art and community projects since it opened in 2005.\n\nMr. Hallowell has been the most public about his personal and professional efforts to navigate the scandal. \u201cI have stepped aside and indefinitely left the day-to-day operations of the restaurant,\u201d he wrote this week in response to several questions for this article. \u201cI have stopped taking my salary and stopped taking any owner distributions.\u201d\n\nListening to people\u2019s experiences and hearing their anger and frustration \u201chas been pretty brutal, and it has really illuminated the massive blind spot I had,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hallowell said he is in the process of hiring a new chief executive with input from the staff, and is staying out of the restaurants as an independent investigation arranged by his legal counsel is underway. He has hired a human resources consultant, and said he wants to bring on a coach with expertise in management training and organizational psychology.\n\nHe is also working with Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth, an organization founded by Fania Davis, the sister of the author and political activist Angela Davis, which aims to bring victims and perpetrators together to work toward reconciliation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI feel like we are digging so deep into this place of blame that we can\u2019t find a place of healing,\u201d said Teiahsha Bankhead, a co-director. The goal, she said, is to recognize that people are taught to behave in certain ways \u2014 and to change that culture, both for women and men.\n\nIt may not be enough. The seven-person management team at one restaurant, Boot and Shoe Service, has threatened to resign if Mr. Hallowell does not divest from the restaurant by Saturday. (At other restaurants, the staff is staying on and not joining in that fight.)\n\nMolly Surbridge is a former employee who told The Chronicle that Mr. Hallowell had once stopped her during an interview for a promotion to say he wanted to have sex with her. She and others said they think he is convinced that the scandal will eventually blow over.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s just public shaming, which doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cIt needs to be a real consequence. Because it is a business, it needs to be about money.\u201d\n\nSilence and Conversation in New York\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Friedman, 56, who owns seven restaurants in New York and California with the chef April Bloomfield, has dropped out of public sight since The New York Times reported in December that he had created a pervasive culture of sexual predation and harassment, especially at the Spotted Pig in the West Village, where some employees referred to a celebrity-studded private dining room as \u201cthe rape room.\u201d\n\nSince making some initial apologies, Ms. Bloomfield has not spoken publicly about the state of the restaurants or her business relationship with Mr. Friedman. She has taken over operations.\n\nMr. Friedman has sought treatment, according to former employees who said he had sent them apologies and the phone number of a Connecticut rehabilitation center in case they wanted to contact him.\n\nKelly Berg, the group\u2019s recently hired human resources manager, issued a statement on Monday that said the company was working with consultants and \u201crolling out a forceful action plan to elevate and empower our managers and enact our standards throughout the organization.\u201d The plan includes increased training and better monitoring to ensure \u201ca supportive and caring environment.\u201d Mr. Friedman, the statement said, has not been involved in day-to-day management since The Times\u2019s article appeared.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see your icons taken down,\u201d said Kerry Diamond, a founder of Cherry Bombe, a media group dedicated to women and food that features Ms. Bloomfield on the current cover of its twice-yearly magazine \u2014 a feature that Ms. Diamond said had been developed long before the revelations.\n\n\u201cAt the same time,\u201d she added, \u201cthese are important conversations we\u2019re finally having about harassment and abuse, so you can\u2019t be too sad. It\u2019s going to be painful and messy if we want real change to occur.\u201d\n\nA Quandary for Customers\n\nThe dining public appears to be divided. At first, many reservations and holiday parties scheduled for Mr. Batali\u2019s and Ms. Bloomfield\u2019s restaurants were canceled. But business doesn\u2019t appear to have suffered terribly. Babbo was packed on Sunday night. At the Spotted Pig, the wait for a 7 p.m. table on Friday was an hour long.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Ms. Bloomfield has been trying to steady the Hearth & Hound, which opened just as the Friedman expos\u00e9 was published. Reservations aren\u2019t hard to get, but last weekend tables were filled.\n\nSamantha Martin, a customer who ate there last week, said she hadn\u2019t heard about the accusations against Mr. Friedman. \u201cI try to do everything right and be careful where my money goes, but I can\u2019t keep track of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if I heard it, I\u2019m not sure I would have skipped coming here. The food is incredible.\u201d\n\nFor some diners, though, the taint may never go away. Brian Gresko, a Brooklyn writer who addresses themes of gender and masculinity in his work, was recently casting around for a new place to eat near Union Square because he could not bring himself to go to Otto, a Batali restaurant.\n\nMr. Gresko used to meet friends there regularly, and even chose it to celebrate his birthday. Now he vows to show support for the #MeToo movement by \u201cnot consuming the art or the products that these guys have created,\u201d he said. \u201cTo my stomach\u2019s dismay.\u201d", "title": "After the Apologies, Restaurants Struggle to Change", "authors": ["Kim Severson"]}

It was one of more than a dozen homes throughout Ireland that were often run by Catholic religious orders, but were funded and supposedly regulated by the government.\n\nMs. Corless came across the death certificates for nearly 800 children who had died at the home, often of contagious disease. But there were virtually no burial records, an absence in the public record that neither the Bon Secours nor the local government could explain.\n\nAfter further sleuthing, she wrote an article in the local journal in 2012 that strongly suggested that the remains of hundreds of children, all born to unwed mothers and all baptized in the Catholic faith, had not been buried in consecrated ground, but in parts of a disused septic system dating to when the home was a 19th-century workhouse.\n\nThose suspicions were confirmed last March by forensic investigators working for the Commission of Investigation Into Mother and Baby Homes, which had been established by the chastened government in response to Ms. Corless\u2019s work. The commission is charged with examining the social and historical reasons for these institutions, to which Irish society had long relegated vulnerable, unwed mothers and their children.\n\nMs. Zappone, meanwhile, dispatched a panel of technical experts who eventually developed the five options. They reported that the considerable complications included the amount of juvenile remains and their commingling, which would make individual identifications difficult, and the potentially limited yield of DNA tests. The experts emphasized the importance of communicating \u201crealistic expectations,\u201d given the need to match extracted samples with those of living relatives and the likelihood that samples taken from infants would be of poor quality.", "title": "Agonizing Question for Irish: What to Do With Children\u2019s Remains?", "authors": []}

After all, not \u201caltered at all\u201d creates something of a loophole for those taking part. Erasing a pimple here and a worry line there may not seem material to one brand, but it could be material to an individual. There\u2019s a sliding scale of what constitutes transparency for most of us, and we aren\u2019t the ones selling skin care.\n\nAccording to the official statement from CVS, the company is defining \u201cmaterially altered\u201d as \u201cchanging or enhancing a person\u2019s shape, size, proportion, skin or eye color, wrinkles or any other individual characteristics.\u201d Not, however, taming a flyaway hair (to suggest one example that might sneak through).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation we are having now with our partners,\u201d Ms. Foulkes said. \u201cIf a famous actress shows up for a shoot and she\u2019s had a very late work night and has dark circles under her eyes, is cleaning them up materially altering her image?

In 2011, Lanc\u00f4me, part of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, got in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority in the United Kingdom for a Julia Roberts ad for its Teint Miracle foundation that showed Ms. Roberts miraculously lit from within, with not a visible line or spot. The problem was, said the authority, which banned the ad, her glow was probably due more to digital postproduction work than to the actual product.\n\nSimilarly, in 2014, Diane Keaton made a speech at the Golden Globes in all her 68-year-old glory, only to appear with the skin of a twentysomething in a L\u2019Oreal commercial that same evening, a contrast that was widely mocked.\n\nWhile we most often complain about the negative effects airbrushing can have on the body images of young girls \u2014 the American Medical Association has identified it as health issue \u2014 the impact of Keaton-esque treatment can be just as detrimental for us more mature women, even if theoretically we are supposed to know better (or at least be able to recognize the impossible, or implausible, when we see it).\n\nHaving been at many fashion shows where older models are trotted out onto the catwalk, I have been struck by the discrepancy between reality and representation. No matter how great they look (and many of them are amazingly beautiful women in their 40s), their bodies and their faces generally look nothing like they do in the pages of glossy magazines. They have back fat. They even have the occasional pimple.

Only so many planes can land at an airport in any given day, so Airbus reasoned that planes carrying more people would allow airports to absorb more passengers.\n\nThe A380 can carry more than 500 passengers while also offering amenities like showers, first-class suites and a bar.\n\nBut the airline industry responded by increasing traffic to smaller airports, a change that favored Boeing and its 787 Dreamliner, a midsize, wide-bodied plane that can carry a maximum of 330 passengers. The Dreamliner has two engines, making it much less expensive to maintain than the four-engine A380.\n\nMr. Aboulafia of Teal Group noted that it is now possible to fly directly to Spain from Washington, D.C., without passing through a large hub like London or Frankfurt.\n\n\u201cAs smaller, more efficient planes flood the market,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cnew city pairs are being created almost every day, killing the case for larger aircraft.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In fact, orders for two planes were canceled.\n\nThe superjumbo\u2019s poor performance overshadowed an otherwise decent year for Airbus, which said on Monday that it delivered 718 aircraft in 2017, a 4 percent increase from the previous year. The company said it had a backlog of orders worth $1.1 trillion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAirbus could further benefit from a general upswing in commercial air travel, and it may profit from a trade dispute between its archrival Boeing and Bombardier of Canada.\n\nThe United States Commerce Department imposed punitive tariffs on Bombardier last year after Boeing accused it of receiving unfair subsidies from the Canadian government. Bombardier is challenging the tariffs, but has also struck a deal to build its new CSeries midrange planes at an Airbus factory in Alabama. That could allow Bombardier to avoid the penalties.\n\nAirbus\u2019s best-seller by far in 2017 was the A320 line, versions of which can carry up to 240 passengers, or about half as many as the A380.\n\nMr. Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer, said on Monday that the A380\u2019s best days were ahead. Passenger traffic is doubling every 15 years, he said, meaning that the original rationale for the model still holds.\n\nAirbus, as a result, is still betting that airlines flying between large, highly congested hubs in London or New Delhi will have no choice but to buy larger planes if they want to continue to grow.\n\n\u201cIf people want to fly, they need to fly in bigger aircraft,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cThis is an airplane whose time will come.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged that, until that day arrives, Airbus needs a minimum of six to eight orders a year to keep production alive at the A380\u2019s final assembly plant near Toulouse.

{"date": "2018-01-19 00:00:00", "text": "The United States has also stepped in, saying it opposes such unilateral changes by China, according to Taiwanese media. In response to a question from Taiwan\u2019s government-run Central News Agency, Brian Hook, a policy adviser to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, said China should have consulted with Taiwan first.\n\nPhoto\n\nTensions between Taiwan and China force the United States to engage in a difficult geopolitical balancing act. While Washington has joined most of the rest of the world in keeping Taiwan at diplomatic arm\u2019s length for fear of angering China, it also obligated by treaty to provide the means for the island to defend itself.\n\nAccording to Taiwanese media reports, Taiwan has asked friendly nations to raise concerns about the new route with the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body that oversees international air routes. Taiwan cannot directly appeal to the organization because it is not a member of the United Nations. Taiwan also has no formal ties with the aviation body itself, which is headed by Fang Liu, a Chinese citizen who since 2016 has denied Taiwan observer status.\n\nThe establishment of the new air route comes as China has been stepping up efforts to isolate Taiwan, which broke away when the Communist Party took control of China in 1949. Earlier this month, Chinese authorities forced big multinational corporations that do business in China, including the Marriott hotel chain and Delta Air Lines, to remove Taiwan from lists of countries on their websites.\n\nChina began raising the pressure on Taiwan after Ms. Tsai\u2019s election in 2016. The government of President Xi Jinping of China cut off official communications channels, citing her unwillingness to subscribe to the notion that Taiwan belongs to \u201cone China.\u201d Mr. Xi, who has pledged to restore China to international greatness, has issued stern warnings to Taiwan, saying China will never relinquish control of any part of its territory, even though the Communist government has never ruled Taiwan.\n\nIn a New Year\u2019s statement last month, Zhang Zhijun, minister of China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, put blame for the current tensions on the Tsai administration, accusing it of \u201cindulging and conniving with \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 forces pushing forward with \u2018desinification\u2019, \u2018progressive Taiwan independence\u2019 and all kinds of backwards policies.\u201d\n\nThe failure to consult with Taiwan before establishing the air route is seen as a slap in the face aimed at Ms. Tsai. In 2015, when Taiwan was governed by the more China-friendly administration of Ms. Tsai\u2019s predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, Beijing and Taipei negotiated an agreement for China to use a similar air route over the Taiwan Strait for Chinese airliners flying the opposite direction, from north to south.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office said the route was an internal affair of China. It also said that the safe use of the earlier, 2015 route proved that there was no safety risk in flights in the Taiwan Strait.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe use of airliners also follows a Chinese strategy of relying on nonmilitary means to assert its sovereignty in other disputes in the region while avoiding a full-blown, armed confrontation.\n\nChina has dispatched coast guard vessels to challenge Japanese control of islands in the East China Sea that China also claims. In the South China Sea, China has used commercial fishing boats and ships from its fisheries management agency to demonstrate its presence in areas also claimed by Southeast Asian nations.\n\nTaiwan also has a history of viewing Chinese airliners as a Trojan horse for military threats against the island. Up until the early 2000s, Taiwan resisted opening direct flights by commercial airliners between China and Taiwan partly out of fear that Chinese military aircraft could evade radar detection by sneaking in behind civilian jets.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He also praised the United States for speaking out against China\u2019s move.\n\nThe new air route has alarmed some security experts because it increases China\u2019s ability to launch a surprise attack on the Taiwanese island groups of Kinmen and Matsu, which are near the Chinese coast and thus on the front line of Taiwan\u2019s defense, by allowing Chinese aircraft to get closer before they can be detected.\n\nBy making it easier for China to launch a first strike, the new air route risked further destabilizing an already tense region, said Ian Easton, a research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, an Arlington, Va.-based think tank, who has done research on Chinese war plans for Taiwan.\n\n\u201cGiven the close-in nature of the standoff, early warning time is vital for stability,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s being further constricted.\u201d", "title": "Airliners Have Become China\u2019s Newest Means of Pressuring Taiwan", "authors": ["Chris Horton"]}

Trailing by 7 points with just under four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Alabama had marched down the field but stalled and faced 4th down deep in Georgia territory. Tagovailoa rolled out to his left, avoided pressure and threw a 7-yard touchdown pass that sizzled past two defenders and into the arms of Calvin Ridley. The extra point by Andy Pappanastos tied the score, 20-20.\n\nAfter Alabama\u2019s defense forced Georgia to punt, Tagovailoa led the Tide back down the field and a victory seemed likely in regulation. They just needed Pappanastos to hit a winning field goal from 36 yards out with just a few seconds remaining.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut Pappanastos\u2019s kick hooked severely to the left, just like a 40-yard attempt he had missed in the first half, and the Georgia fans, granted a reprieve, roared in delight and relief.\n\nThose emotions did not last long. Georgia (13-2) did take a brief lead in overtime on Rodrigo Blankenship\u2019s 51-yard field goal after Fromm, too, was sacked for a 13-yard loss. But Tagovailoa followed with perhaps the throw of the season to Smith, and Alabama (13-1) had its second title in three years. Both saw crafty coaching from Saban, who used an unexpected onside kick two years ago to help the Tide beat Clemson in that championship game.\n\nThis victory gave Saban six national titles and added to his stature as one of the most accomplished coaches in college football history. He matched Bear Bryant, who won six national titles at Alabama. Saban has five at Alabama and one at Louisiana State, and the wild victory on Monday helped ease memories of a crushing loss to Clemson in last year\u2019s championship game.\n\nSoon after Monday\u2019s victory, someone tried to stuff a game ball in Saban\u2019s hands to commemorate the latest accomplishment.

Mr. Cuomo\u2019s planned legislation would require any companies with state business to disclose the number of sexual harassment cases they had faced each year, and would bar employers from forcing their employees into private arbitration. One of the Democrats\u2019 bills would expand protections for employees of small businesses.\n\nMs. Young said the focus on harassment by celebrities and public officials, both in New York and nationwide, threatened to overshadow victims of sexual harassment whose accused abusers were less well known.

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "New York, which has had no shortage of child sex-abuse scandals, should be on that list. In fact, it should be leading the nation on this issue. Instead it, along with Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama and Michigan, is one of the states with the least victim-friendly reporting laws in the country. New York requires most child sex-abuse victims to sue by the age of 23, 19 years before the average age at which such victims report their abuse.\n\nLawmakers have had the solution in their hands for more than a decade. The Child Victims Act would extend the statute of limitations to age 50 in civil cases, and to age 28 in criminal cases. It would also establish a one-year window in which anyone would be permitted to bring a lawsuit, even if the statute of limitations had already expired.\n\nThe bill enjoys widespread and bipartisan support in Albany \u2014 it passed the State Assembly once again in 2017, by a vote of 139 to 7 \u2014 and from Gov. Andrew Cuomo. And yet it keeps failing to become law.\n\nWhy? The Senate majority leader, John Flanagan, a Republican, has refused to let the bill come to the floor for a vote. The bill\u2019s opponents, which include the Catholic Church, Orthodox Jewish groups and the Boy Scouts of America, are concerned primarily with the one-year window, which they believe would cause a wave of claims that could drive churches, schools and hospitals into bankruptcy. That hasn\u2019t happened in other states, even those that opened the window for longer. In Minnesota, which created a three-year window for a population a little more than a quarter of New York\u2019s, just under 1,000 civil claims have been filed.\n\nBut even if it did, we should be less concerned with protecting the bank accounts of institutions that might harbor sexual predators, and more concerned with bringing justice to the victims \u2014 whether their abusers are clergy members, teachers or, as in a majority of cases, a family member.\n\nThe Child Victims Act should have passed on its merits long ago. Since it hasn\u2019t, Mr. Cuomo needs to step up and demonstrate the leadership he has shown on many other divisive issues in recent years, like same-sex marriage. If Mr. Cuomo includes the bill\u2019s provisions in the 2018-19 state budget, which he is scheduled to present on Tuesday, he will make it extremely tough for Mr. Flanagan and other Republican leaders to say no to protecting New York\u2019s most vulnerable victims.", "title": "Opinion | Albany, Pass the Child Victims Act", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-15 00:00:00", "text": "Apple popularized the virtual assistant concept in 2011 when it introduced technology called Siri in its iPhones. About three years later, Amazon debuted the Echo, a speaker packed with microphones to capture and decipher what we\u2019re saying to Alexa. Soon, various technology companies were betting that speaking to machines through virtual assistants would be an essential way for consumers to interact with devices and services in the future.\n\nThere is a reason tech companies think virtual assistants are so important: They want to control an indispensable \u201cplatform\u201d \u2014 a crucial piece of technology other services or devices must rely upon.\n\nSome believe virtual assistant technology can be that sort of platform, and the company with the most useful assistant will gain an advantage for their other services \u2014 like internet search or online shopping. Lose that competition, however, and a company could be at the mercy of its rivals.\n\nWith those stakes in mind, tech giants have been scrambling to make their assistants omnipresent. Since smart speakers are the main way for people to deal with virtual assistants, Amazon and Google stoked holiday sales with heavy discounts, dropping the price of their entry-level models to $30, from $50. At the same time, tech companies have been putting their assistants inside products of all shapes and sizes.\n\nBefore last week\u2019s International CES tech conference in Las Vegas, Amazon announced a string of new Alexa partnerships. Hisense will put the assistant into its television sets, while Kohler said a new bathroom mirror will have built-in microphones so people can use Alexa to dim the lights and fill a bathtub using voice commands. PC makers like HP, Asus and Acer said they were integrating Alexa into their computers, while Panasonic, Garmin and other electronics makers will do the same for devices that go into cars.\n\nAmazon also announced an agreement with Toyota to integrate Alexa into some Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Ditto for a new smoke alarm from First Alert. Google said LG Televisions, headphones from Sony and smart displays from Lenovo will tap into its Assistant.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor now, consumers\u2019 satisfaction with their smart speakers \u2014 and by extension, the onboard assistants \u2014 is helped in part by the fact they didn\u2019t pay a lot to get them into their homes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJustin Hosseininejad, an engineering consultant from Medina, Ohio, said he bought his first Amazon Echo Dot for $50 last year and got a second one free a few months ago with another internet-connected device, the Nest thermostat. He uses them to listen to news in the morning and play music throughout the day. He recognizes that he\u2019s not asking Alexa to do a lot, but considering how little he paid, he is fine with that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only certain things I use it for, but I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my taxes with it.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nPaul Erickson, a senior analyst at the research firm IHS Markit, said the next step for these devices will be to become the hub of a connected home, controlling internet-connected lights, thermostats and other basic home appliances.\n\n\u201cThe more interesting functionality is yet to come,\u201d Mr. Erickson said. \u201cPart of that will come as more integration happens this year and next year. This is the first year we\u2019re going to see real advances with the assistants because of competition in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nCompetitors of Google and Amazon are also spreading their assistants far and wide. Apple now has Siri running across its universe of devices, along with an upcoming smart speaker called HomePod. Samsung has its own assistant, Bixby, available in its phones and televisions, and Microsoft has Cortana as a feature built into its Windows software.\n\nAmazon has turned its Echo family of products and the Alexa assistant that powers them into the unlikeliest of success stories \u2014 although it is hard to say exactly how successful because it shrouds its disclosures about devices sales in fuzzy language.\n\nAmazon would say only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of Alexa devices during the recent holiday season, millions more than the same period last year. Analysts estimate that Echo accounts for over 70 percent of sales in the smart speaker category, with Google a distant second.\n\nGoogle was also coy about revealing exact sales of Google Home. In a statement on Jan. 5, Google announced it has sold one Google Home smart speaker every second since it started shipping a smaller version of voice-controlled device on October 19 \u2014 or about 79 days. That works out to roughly seven million units.\n\nIn the 20 months since it first started making the Google Assistant available as part of its Allo messaging app, Google said its Assistant is now accessible on more than 400 million devices including washing machines, dryers, air-conditioners, refrigerators and dishwashers from LG, headphones from Bose and a range of speakers from 15 different companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGoogle said the Assistant can now accomplish more than one million tasks, or \u201cactions,\u201d such as asking for photos from Halloween or adding events to a calendar. It created a directory \u2014 searchable, of course \u2014 to highlight these capabilities, hoping to remind users that the Assistant can do more than set a timer.\n\nThere are signs that some consumers are starting to recognize the value of virtual assistants even if they aren\u2019t interested in smart speakers. Mr. Hosseininejad\u2019s friend Stephen Melik, also an engineer from Ohio, said he uses Siri on his Apple Watch and iPhone to control his lights and power switches. But the notion of a stand-alone smart speaker that remains in one place doesn\u2019t make sense to him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always viewed these smart speakers as a solution searching for a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the voice assistants, potentially there are a lot of benefits to it.\u201d", "title": "Alexa, We\u2019re Still Trying to Figure Out What to Do With You", "authors": ["Daisuke Wakabayashi", "Nick Wingfield"]}
{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "The safety and security concerns become more challenging when tools like Alexa are used to make car-to-home connections. While cruising down I-95, a driver can open a garage door back at home or shut off the living room lights, for example. Ford already offers such car-to-home capabilities that, using its Ford+Alexa app, can tap into some 25,000 Alexa skills in vehicles that have the company\u2019s Sync 3 in-dash system. Ford has also added a new feature that allows the driver to forgo the push-to-talk button and trigger Alexa by uttering a wake-up phrase.\n\nSuch convenience does allow for the possibility that restive children could prank Alexa from the back seat simply by calling out for, say, Rick Astley songs. Timur Pulathaneli, Ford\u2019s supervisor of connected vehicles and services, said that if it proved to be a nuisance, drivers could turn the feature off in the app so that Alexa would respond only after a button was pushed on the steering wheel.\n\nFord\u2019s setup also limits what a car thief or a parking attendant can do behind the wheel. A person wouldn\u2019t automatically be able to unlock a home\u2019s front door from the car because such functions work only in conjunction with the owner\u2019s smartphone (which they\u2019d have to steal, too).\n\nAdding voice assistants to vehicles may make cars seem like just another device on the so-called Internet of Things, but it raises the stakes significantly.\n\n\u201cWhat gets added with the car is your specific location,\u201d Mr. Wang said. \u201cYou can track where the car goes and at what times.\u201d\n\nIf compromised, Alexa could provide a criminal with details about a user\u2019s purchases, driving habits and travel routines. And to make it easier to connect different smart devices, Alexa can scan for compatible gadgets. All that information is sent back to Amazon\u2019s servers and then shared with other companies, Travis Witteveen, chief executive of the security firm Avira, pointed out. The sharing of such information increases the system\u2019s \u2014 and the car\u2019s \u2014 security vulnerabilities.\n\nNevertheless, the conveniences that digital assistants offer may make them an ineluctable part of the next generation of cars. Nuance, a leading speech-recognition company involved in the automotive business, is already working on voice systems for cars that would be even easier to use. Eric Montague, Nuance\u2019s senior director of product marketing and strategy, said the company would introduce a system this year that did not require the driver to use a wake-up word or push a button to talk.\n\nUltimately, the car will simply understand when it\u2019s being spoken to.\n\n\u201cPeople will expect to be able to have a conversation with their car,\u201d said Martyn Humphries, a vice president at NXP, whose sensors are used extensively in automotive applications. \u201cSo security is going to have to continue to evolve with it.\u201d", "title": "Alexa, What Happened to My Car?", "authors": []}

The Americans de-emphasize such details.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut the cooperation with the Y.P.G., including arming and training the fighters and providing them with air support, has put the United States on a collision course with Turkey.\n\nLast weekend Turkey launched a military operation against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in northwestern Syria and it is now threatening to expand the operation to the east, into areas where Kurdish forces are directly backed by the American military.\n\nThe United States has sought to differentiate between the Kurds it supports and those in Afrin, whom it does not, a distinction the Kurds themselves do not recognize.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey are not different parts at all, and they cannot be divided in any way, not politically, not economically, not militarily,\u201d said Newaf Xelil, a Kurdish political analyst in Germany and a former spokesman for the party affiliated with the Y.P.G. \u201cFor us, it is all Kurdistan and we are now defending Afrin with all we have.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump urged his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to use restraint and avoid any situation that could lead to clashes between the Turkish and American militaries. Disputing the White House\u2019s description of the call, Turkish officials denied that Mr. Trump had made such a request.\n\nY.P.G. leaders say theirs is a homegrown movement that sprang up to defend civilians in the early days of Syria\u2019s war and against offensives by the Islamic State.\n\nThat role, and the backing of the United States, has transformed the group into the most prominent political and military force in northeastern Syria.\n\nFormerly an impoverished and marginalized minority, Syria\u2019s Kurds now administer substantial territory, where they are teaching Kurdish in schools and setting up local administrations. Critics have accused them of displacing Arabs.\n\nAmerican officials have long sought to minimize the Y.P.G.\u2019s ties to the P.K.K., but Turkey is enraged that the United States is giving military support to a group that idealizes Mr. Ocalan, the sole inmate of an island prison in the Sea of Marmara.\n\nMany Y.P.G. leaders speak openly of their history with the P.K.K., and Kurds from Iraq, Iran and Turkey have joined the movement in Syria.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Bonsey said there had been hope among the Americans that they could pull the Y.P.G. away from the P.K.K.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut such a prospect appears unlikely \u2014 especially with the Kurds now uncertain that they have solid support from the United States, which has sent mixed messages about how strongly it would back them against a Turkish onslaught.\n\nThe American ambivalence was clear on Wednesday in comments by Thomas P.

The Turks say the Americans promised that the Syrian Democratic Forces would withdraw from such majority-Arab areas after taking them from the Islamic State, but it has not.\n\nThe ingredients for this clash have been brewing since Syrians rose up against the authoritarian rule of President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Within a few years, the northeastern province of Hasaka, with a large Kurdish population as well as Arabs and Assyrians, was effectively ruling itself.\n\nAs it became the area\u2019s dominant force, the Y.P.G. tried to implement its vision of a utopian society, inspired by Mr. Ocalan.

The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.\n\nPhoto\n\nThey are moving into an industry where the lines between traditionally distinct areas, such as pharmacies, insurers and providers, are increasingly blurry. CVS Health\u2019s deal last month to buy the health insurer Aetna for about $69 billion is just one example of the changes underway. Separately, Amazon\u2019s potential entry into the pharmacy business continues to rattle major drug companies and distributors.\n\n(Here\u2019s a look at how even the threat of Amazon\u2019s entry into an industry can rattle stocks.)\n\nThe companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be \u201cfree from profit-making incentives and constraints,\u201d but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.\n\nJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.\n\n\u201cThe health care system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,\u201d Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cHard as it might be, reducing health care\u2019s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.\u201d\n\nThe announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon\u2019s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans \u2014 from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics.\n\n(We asked health care experts to imagine what the three corporations might do.)\n\n\u201cIt could be big,\u201d Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. \u201cThose are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.\u201d\n\nTaking On \u2018the Hungry Tapeworm\u2019 A look at the three companies that announced a joint health care initiative on Tuesday.\n\nBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies \u2014 which, combined, employ more than one million people \u2014 might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,\u201d said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. \u201cThe idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.\u201d\n\nEven the three companies don\u2019t seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company.\n\nThree people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Mr. Bezos, Mr. Buffett, and Mr. Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency \u2014 whatever it might turn out to be.\n\n\u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in the statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\u201d\n\nOver the past several months, the three had met formally \u2014 along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan\u2019s board \u2014 to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Mr. Buffett\u2019s thinking.\n\nPremiums Are Rising Faster Than Earnings and Inflation % 250 200 150 100 50 0\n\nEmployee earnings 2000 2005 2010 2015 increase since 1999 Premiums for family coverage Overall inflation Employee contributions to premiums % 250 200 150 100 50 0 Employee contributions to premiums Overall inflation Employee earnings 2000 2005 2010 2015 increase since 1999 Premiums for family coverage % 250 200 150 100 50 0 Premiums for family coverage Employee contributions to premiums Overall inflation Employee earnings 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 increase since 1999\n\nThe three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set.\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Mr. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country\u2019s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage As Mr. Buffett himself has aged \u2014 he is 87 \u2014 the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs.

Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities.\n\n\u201cEach of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,\u201d said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care start-up, RxAdvance. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn\u2019t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.\u201d\n\nErik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards.\n\n\u201cI think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.\n\nThe entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.\n\nNationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs \u2014 they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing co-payments.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur members\u2019 balance sheets speak for themselves \u2014 health care is a growing cost at a time when other costs are either not rising or falling,\u201d said Robert Andrews, chief executive of the Healthcare Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 companies, including Coca-Cola and American Express, that have banded together to lower health care costs.\n\nOther major employers have also sought more direct control over their employees\u2019 health care. Walmart contracted with groups like the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo and Geisinger, among others, to take care of employees who need organ transplants and heart and spine care. Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, sets its own rules for drug coverage, which it has said saves it millions of dollars per year, even though it still uses a pharmacy benefit manager to process its claims.\n\nSuzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, \u201cit\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added, \u201cThere are so many opportunities to do this better.\u201d\n\nThe issue is not solely a 21st-century concern: In 1915, Henry Ford became increasingly worried about the quality of health care available to his growing work force in Detroit, so he opened the Henry Ford Hospital.

{"date": "2018-01-07 00:00:00", "text": "For most actresses on red carpets, what you\u2019re wearing is less an expression of who you are and more an expression of what you\u2019re worth. The very act of getting ready for an award show can be a masochist\u2019s checklist of one\u2019s value: Airbrush your arms so that they look more toned. Check. Get a peel or injection to make sure your face looks flawless. Check. Lose bloat by eating only before 6 p.m. and stop drinking all liquid 24 hours before the big day to send your metabolism into shock. Check. Prepping for award shows can be a weeklong marathon in dread, resulting in a one-time portrayal of improbable beauty.\n\nYou\u2019re also often assigned a look that doesn\u2019t reflect who you truly are but reflects what a runway wants you to be. Platform high heels and frilly dresses and a clutch purse made from the skin of dead baby lizards. I\u2019ve spent the better part of my two decades as an actress accumulating more designer high heels than most could ever dream of, only to hit my 30s and realize I hated wearing most of them and always had. Years ago when I was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama, I had a full anxiety attack after the dress fitting, even though I had found a beautiful dress that fit me nicely. I found myself in my car, the air-conditioning on full blast, sobbing into my steering wheel. The anxiety I was feeling wasn\u2019t about the dress itself. It was about the fulfillment of the obligations of the dress.\n\nNot all actresses loathe getting ready for award shows, though. For some, the act of dressing up is a joy that comes quite naturally. For example, one of my best friends is the actress Blake Lively, who has such extraordinary taste in fashion and clothing. I often find myself texting her to get advice on what to wear to an event where I know there will be cameras present. She is always helpful and thoughtful about what will look best on me, a favor I can\u2019t ever seem to do for myself no matter how hard I try. In recent years, I\u2019ve become far more comfortable in my skin and on red carpets, and I\u2019ve had the good fortune of working with stylists such as Karla Welch and Sarah Slutsky who don\u2019t dress a woman\u2019s body as if it\u2019s a tree hungry for ornaments, but rather an individual, unique body with its own sweet purpose and design.\n\nBut getting dressed does still involve obligations. We actresses are not just modeling clothing when we walk a red carpet on award show night. We are modeling a kind of behavior. We are speaking in a coded language to other women \u2014 even young girls \u2014 that says: The way I look and what I wear and how I wear it is the standard for women. What is being worn is not an exception. It is the rule. You must dress a certain way and look a certain way if you want to be valued as a woman, no matter what you do for a living or who you are. We never intend for this to be the message we are sending with what we wear, but often it is the perceived one, whether we like it or not.\n\nI have often wondered what would happen if actresses stood in solidarity with a singular, powerful choice for just one night. What would that even look like? To uniformly reject our lifelong objectification and say: Enough. We belong to no one. We are a canvas for no expression other than the words our voices have chosen to speak.\n\nTonight, you will see just such an experiment as myself and hundreds of women from the Time\u2019s Up movement will reject colorful gowns for black ones on the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet and at related events across the country. Wearing black is not all we will be doing. We will be doing away with the old spoken codes in favor of communicating boldly and directly: What we are wearing is not a statement of fashion. It is a statement of action. It is a direct message of resistance. Black because we are powerful when we stand together with all women across industry lines. Black because we\u2019re starting over, resetting the standard. Black because we\u2019re done being silenced and we\u2019re done with the silencers. Tonight is not a mourning.

{"date": "2018-01-02 00:00:00", "text": "Strategic antagonism and manipulation find a natural medium on social platforms. A service like Twitter all but demands bad faith: It\u2019s a place where fresh identities can be created and performed, often anonymously, and the stakes are only as high as the value you ascribe to not being banned. It\u2019s a service where the official regulations are vague, self-serving and haphazardly enforced, and therefore maximally prone to exploitation. (To the extent that users have a social contract on Twitter, it\u2019s with Twitter, not with one another.) On social media, charges of \u201cbad faith\u201d can address everything from automated spam to interpersonal conflict to the breakdown of political discourse.\n\nThe question is whether identifying bad faith can do anything to combat it. And the answer is: of course not. In theory, an accusation of bad faith derives its power from the presence of some persuadable audience \u2014 some judge or observer or swing voter who recognizes strategic dishonesty and is repelled by it. But in our utterly polarized political reality, the idea of finding some unaligned, reasonable-minded mass to appeal to feels like an absurd fantasy. Instead, accusations of bad faith are laid directly at the feet of the bad-faith actors themselves, with one inevitable result: Now even the words \u201cbad faith\u201d are used in bad faith. When the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, discussing Sam Seder\u2019s brief firing, tweeted that \u201cthe entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness,\u201d one response came from Donald Trump Jr., who provided what felt like an algebraic proof of Hayes\u2019s point. \u201cI agree with this fully,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMain Stream Media has done exactly that for decades, but the people have finally caught on and aren\u2019t buying the BS anymore.\u201d\n\nThe sheer satisfaction offered by \u201cbad faith\u201d is a sure sign of its impotence. It\u2019s an invitation to dismiss powerful political actors as lost causes. But its speakers stubbornly refuse to admit that it also describes their own inability to force their enemies to play by the rules. The Atlantic\u2019s Megan Garber recently identified one major problem with the new use of \u201cbad faith\u201d: As a description, it is \u201cboth conveniently expansive and conveniently specific.\u201d It is, despite its legal and philosophical trappings, most often deployed ad hominem, for the satisfaction of allies. \u201cBad faith,\u201d Garber writes, \u201cis not concerned with individual claims of truth, or with individual lies, so much as it alleges someone\u2019s dishonesty as an overarching condition.\u201d\n\nIt does not help that the people whom liberals are most eager to accuse of bad faith already have their own version of this claim. Among internet-native right wingers, the phrase \u201cvirtue signaling\u201d has long done similar work, suggesting that the social-justice rhetoric of progressives is only a form of self-righteous, hypocritical point-scoring. This, too, was \u201cconveniently expansive and conveniently specific,\u201d but it also zeros in on a real human insecurity: the fear among many well-meaning and comparatively well-off liberals that their lifestyles and attitudes didn\u2019t measure up to their egalitarian ideals. The accusation is intentionally dismissive and nasty, but it at least has the potential to wound \u2014 so long as the people being accused really do aspire, in good faith, to live up to their own values.\n\nBut if you really believe that your enemy is acting in bad faith, calling him or her out won\u2019t get you far. Being accused of duplicitousness doesn\u2019t hurt if the duplicitousness is a conscious strategy. The charge will also have been anticipated. There is an entire genre of Trump apologetics, practiced by cable-news pundits and manifested on sites like Gateway Pundit and Infowars, based on justifying strategic disingenuousness: Any criticism of the administration is met with some combination of \u201cthe left did it first\u201d and \u201cwe have no choice\u201d and \u201cwhat about....\u201d\n\nThe bad-faith actor will claim, in other words, that his bad faith is both justified and necessary, that all possibility of good-faith engagement was exhausted long ago and it was not his fault. You may insist that your opponents respect your positions, your arguments, your facts. But it is a powerful manifestation of privilege to expect that they will see you as worthy of that respect. Shouting \u201cbad faith\u201d can sound like shouting \u201cno fair\u201d \u2014 and revealing your previously undisturbed expectation that you will always be treated fairly.\n\nSo when bad faith does run into consequences, those consequences tend to be self-inflicted. After the Alabama election, Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart, admitted in a CNN interview that he thought at least one of the sexual-assault accusations against Roy Moore had \u201ca lot of credibility\u201d and made him uncomfortable. Moore, he said, was a \u201cweak candidate.\u201d But Marlow defended his site\u2019s militantly pro-Moore coverage and its numerous attempts to discredit Moore\u2019s accusers. \u201cI think they want to create a standard where President Trump, either from past or future accusations, will not be able to match whatever standard is now in place for who can be a United States senator,\u201d he said, referring to other media outlets. \u201cI think that\u2019s the playbook here. And I think it\u2019s part of the reason why it was so important for Breitbart to continue our coverage of the way we covered it.\u201d\n\nIn his account, this wasn\u2019t dissonance; it was strategy. He could justify this nihilistic tactic by reflexively claiming that other media did it first, leaving him no choice but to push back. This is a remarkable thing to announce openly, and it looks a lot like projection: If you justify your actions as the dictates of tactical \u201cplaybooks,\u201d you may assume that everyone else is doing the same. It illustrates the principal risk of acting in bad faith toward others, which is that somewhere along the line, you start to believe yourself.", "title": "American Politics Is Swamped With \u2018Bad Faith\u2019 Actors", "authors": ["John Herrman", "First Words"]}

But the Court of Arbitration for Sport \u2014 the ultimate arbiter of sports disputes, which issued Thursday\u2019s ruling \u2014 overruled it with a more forgiving opinion, and no punishment.\n\n\u201cEven when exercising the utmost caution, the player could not have been aware of the consequences that kissing Pamela would have on him,\u201d sports arbitrators wrote in their decision about Gasquet, who had sued the woman he kissed to obtain a sample of her hair to prove routine cocaine use, which his own hair sample had disproved.\n\nAnother athlete, the decorated Canadian pole-vaulter Shawn Barber, similarly avoided a multiyear suspension in 2016, successfully attributing a low-level cocaine violation to an intimate encounter with a woman he had met on Craigslist the night before Olympic trials.\n\nJonathan Taylor, a prominent global sports lawyer who represented the International Tennis Federation in its appeal of Gasquet\u2019s case, said that athletes were strictly liable for any substance in their system \u2014 even if that substance was ingested completely unintentionally.\n\n\u201cThey will only avoid a ban in very exceptional cases, where they can show that they took every reasonable precaution,\u201d Taylor said, adding that the further removed an athlete was from training and competition \u2014 and the more personal the atmosphere \u2014 the lower the level of precautions he or she might be expected to take.\n\nStill, to prevent against a flood of similar such defenses, he said, the top sports court would surely require strong objective and scientific evidence to validate future accounts of cross-contamination by kiss.\n\nSalazar said that since last spring, her boyfriend\u2019s case had raised her own sense of caution. \u201cBefore I even take DayQuil, it crosses my mind,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything I take now, I think twice before I even go near him.\u201d", "title": "American Sprinter Used \u2018Passionate Kissing\u2019 Defense in Doping Case.

The researchers reached their conclusions by analyzing data from The American Time Use Survey, which as its title suggests measures how Americans spend their time. It is how we know, for example, that American women spend more time engaging in most forms of housework than their male counterparts.\n\nAccording to Bob Simon, a former staff director for the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, at least one problem is that the time use survey participants record only their primary activity within a given time span. If, for example, a participant is cooking and watching television at the same time, only the cooking activity is recorded. Or, if a participant is running errands (such as hitting the grocery store), over the course of their commute to work, that change in behavior isn\u2019t recorded in the time use survey either.\n\nBut, according to Dr. Simon, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s changed is how people commute back and forth to work over the last decade or so,\u201d he said, referencing a Department of Transportation report on commuting in the United States. \u201cThey\u2019re adding more trips to their commute.

While the aim was to derail Yamal\u2019s construction, in the end, the plant was financed by Russian and Chinese banks and its output never faced sanctions.\n\nThus it was under the proud eyes of Mr. Putin that the first cargo from Yamal L.N.G. was loaded into the Russian icebreaker/tanker Christophe de Margerie (named after the recently deceased chief executive the French energy company Total, which holds a 20 percent interest in the project.) The cargo was initially intended for Asia, but as gas prices soared in Britain, it made its way to the Isle of Grain terminal near London on Dec. 28.\n\nHere the gas was briefly stored but never made its way to the British grid. On Dec. 30, the French energy company Engie\u2019s Gaselys tanker picked up cargo and set off for Boston, where gas prices were soaring because of the cold winter.\n\nBecause the time between the unloading of the Russian vessel and loading of the Gaselys vessel at Grain was brief, it is safe to assume that the Gaselys vessel was carrying at least some, if not all, of the Russian gas from the Yamal L.N.G. project. The storage facility in London might also have been holding L.N.G. from other producers. Nonetheless the Russia news media has gloated over this gas delivery to Boston and claimed it as Russian.\n\nIn the globalizing natural gas markets, we can expect more of these trades.

Mr. Balfour said the company would investigate specific claims brought to its attention.\n\nThe regulatory office in Lanzhou gave enough credence to the complaints that it referred the findings to the local branch of China\u2019s main law enforcement agency, the Public Security Bureau.\n\nThen the investigation stalled.\n\nWang Xingwei, the administration official in charge of the initial investigation, said in a telephone interview that he had been transferred off the case.\n\nThe former distributors said they believed that regional officials sympathetic to Amway had quashed their complaints. They cited an instance when the state television channel in Gansu, after interviewing them, received a directive not to report on their case.\n\nAccording to a journalist at the station, Gao Zenglei, the directive came from the Communist Party\u2019s provincial propaganda department.

The interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nThere is a huge focus on how dominant Google and Facebook are in digital advertising, where they are often referred to as the \u201cduopoly.\u201d Some people have a hard time seeing that change.\n\nThe people who are most stuck in the world are those who see hegemonic positions now and don\u2019t believe that now can be disrupted \u2014 despite the fact that what exists now only exists because everything\u2019s been disrupted.\n\nAt the beginning of my career, the hegemonic position was held by ITV and the big commercial broadcasters.

What do you think?\n\nImagine a massively emboldened Hulu.\n\nIf Disney decides to put the Fox assets in entertainment and movies into Hulu, and Comcast decides to put Universal and NBC studio assets into Hulu, too, then certainly from a domestic point of view, you end up with a product that looks pretty fantastic if people watch television.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The other way you could argue this is that Facebook has decided that there is a degree of toxicity which comes from being overtly an economic participant in a news-based value chain, and that the economics of it are not worth the perceived risks of association.\n\nThe one thing that\u2019s kind of disturbing about all of this to me and potentially The New York Times is: Are we moving into a world where the dominant platforms of media consumption are basically getting close to a point where they\u2019re blacklisting the monetization of news?\n\nWhat have you seen that makes you think they\u2019re getting close to that?\n\nIt seems that there is no huge demand in Google\u2019s program commissioning to commission news.

His house in Carmel was warm and worn, with a heap of toys visible through the windows on the porch. There were two children, 8 and 4, a girl and a boy.\n\nOn his left hand was a wedding band. His bride, Rachel Azimi, had pushed it up over his knuckle on their wedding day almost 10 years ago.

Mr. Azimi\u2019s addiction was more like a sleeper cell. It took seed as a teenager, and those around him sought to stomp it dead, but it loomed, largely dormant. It hid behind the broad smile he flashed for photographs, the ones of the family man with the house and the yard.\n\n\u201cI believed he was sober for the vast majority of our marriage,\u201d Ms. Azimi said. \u201cI never saw drug paraphernalia.

The school sought to curb bad behavior by limiting student contact with the outside world and exacting what alumni described as a system of punishments that could be severe.

At the next station, the train would in effect overshoot the platform, allowing the last four cars to reach the platform and open while the first four stayed shut. Six cars in the middle would open on the platform at every stop.", "title": "An Einstein for the Subways? A Lawyer Suggests a \u2018Genius\u2019 Fix", "authors": []}

He is a seventh-generation Texan from a state in which phrases like \u201cseventh-generation Texan\u201d are humble-brag gold. His great-grandfather had the distinction of surviving the Galveston hurricane of 1900, the worst natural disaster (perhaps as many as 8,000 dead) in the history of the United States. A great-granduncle operated a ranch at the base of the Window, a gap in the mountain ramparts of the Big Bend country that is a beloved hunk of geology to scenery-starved Texans.\n\nHodge begins his book with an atmospheric prelude (\u201cThe boy wears a cowboy hat and boots, his jeans tucked in. He carries a gun, and a knife, and sometimes a sword\u201d) that to my ear echoes the opening of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s \u201cBlood Meridian\u201d (\u201cSee the child. He is pale and thin, he wears a thin and ragged linen shirt. He stokes the scullery fire\u201d). Lest you suspect me of overexplication, Hodge himself takes time out, a little past the midway point of his book, for a 14-page appreciation of McCarthy\u2019s fiction, particularly his Texas-set novel \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d Caution: Writing about Cormac McCarthy while simultaneously writing about the immemorial violence of the Texas borderlands can lead to sentences like this:\n\n\u201cAnd everywhere are the ruins of those ancient and not so ancient peoples who were slaughtered in those places and whose lives left no articulate testament to bear witness to the joys and hopes and dreams and sorrows that they shared before pale riders the color of dust swooped down and spilled their blood onto the thirsty ground.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nIf Hodge is susceptible every now and then to the hypnotic Bible rhythms of McCarthy\u2019s language, for the most part he writes with an earnest, stripped-down clarity. He\u2019s smart, observant and skeptical. He has no interest in adding another volume to the library shelves of rousing Texas hoohah. \u201cAs I reread the conventional histories,\u201d he writes, \u201cI remained dissatisfied by their generalizations and hoary meditations on Texas \u2018character.\u2019 Much of it struck me as self-congratulatory nationalistic rubbish. I read those fat tomes mostly for the footnotes, the infinite forking paths of primary sources and archives.\u201d Even \u201cLone Star,\u201d T. R. Fehrenbach\u2019s venerable history of the state (so massive and self-confident its first words are \u201cIn the beginning\u201d), makes Hodge a little queasy, because \u201csuch epic histories sweep high above the hard ground of lived experience.\u201d\n\nHard ground and lived experience are what \u201cTexas Blood\u201d is all about. Hodge reminisces about his own background as a young ranch hand \u2014 loading livestock into trailers, rounding up sheep on muleback, crossing the Rio Grande to Ciudad Acu\u00f1a every weekend for flaming tequila shots at famous watering holes like Ma Crosby\u2019s. He traces the history of the region through the Jumano and Apache Indians who had at one time or another considered themselves in possession of it. He writes about Spanish explorers like Cabeza de Vaca and notorious scalp hunters like the Irish-born James Kirker, or the former Texas Ranger John Joel Glanton, who went on to assume toxic literary immortality as a character in \u201cBlood Meridian.\u201d\n\nIn other chapters Hodge follows the trail of his long-ago Texas-bound ancestors through Missouri and Kansas, hangs out with the Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley, explores the ancient rock art along the Pecos, and takes part in a pilgrimage to the top of Mount Cristo Rey across the New Mexico border from El Paso, where Indian dancers known as matachines perform a centuries-old dance depicting Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\u2019s conquest of Mexico, \u201cthe ancient drama of conquest, love, betrayal and conversion.\u201d", "title": "An Unconventional History of Texas, From a Writer With the State in His Veins", "authors": []}

But his focus was on talking about how he has reshaped the C.I.A.

Some critics have mistaken the book as continuing the tradition of Saul Bellow, Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud \u2014 whose names Namdar strategically drops, as red herrings \u2014 with Andrew just another Kepesh, Silk, Levin or Herzog. Namdar actually has less in common with those novelists, whose imaginations were largely secular, than with Cynthia Ozick, who has grappled with religious prohibition, or with the young Leonard Cohen, who harangued an audience in Montreal in 1964, telling them: \u201cThere is an awful truth which no Jewish writer investigates today.... It is this truth: We no longer believe we are holy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs if in response to that howl, in \u201cThe Ruined House\u201d ancient Jewish holiness bleeds, insistently, horrifically, into the present. The connection is hinted at from the start, in the Hebrew dates given in the chapter headings, which count \u201cfrom the creation of the world\u201d: The novel begins on Elul 6, 5760 (\u201cwhich happened to fall on Wednesday, Sept. 6, 2000\u201d), and ends on \u201cThe 1st of Tishrei, 5762\u201d or \u201cSept. 18, 2001.\u201d This indicates that Andrew\u2019s story is being narrated, unusually, as part of the trajectory of the long Jewish past.\n\nUneasy links between that past and the present animate the visions that begin, over the course of the novel, to flood Andrew\u2019s senses and invade his dreams, frightening and finally paralyzing him. He\u2019s overtaken by the sights and smells of fires, bulls, golden candelabra and massacres; he watches as \u201cred, boiling blood runs in the streets,\u201d hears \u201cwails of terror and sorrow\u201d and has no idea why.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn explanation, eventually available to the reader but not to Andrew, appears in a pseudo-Talmudic narrative set during the Roman rule of Palestine and involving the High Priest and one of his many assistant priests. This ancient back story appears on pages styled to evoke the commentary-laced text of the Talmud.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many such echoes, present in Namdar\u2019s Hebrew original, could not be conveyed even in Hillel Halkin\u2019s extraordinary translation, but some do manage to peek through. For example, apropos of not much, on a jaunt out of the city, Andrew happens to notice \u201cthe opaque, misplaced names on the road signs \u2014 Goshen, Rehoboth, Bethel,\u201d which are noteworthy only if you\u2019ve been thinking about the old Canaan, the one that\u2019s not in Connecticut.\n\nAndrew\u2019s surname, Cohen, functions in the same way, as a portal between past and present. It means \u201cpriest,\u201d and the people who bear it \u2014 every songwriter, model, television host, comedian, Trump lawyer, baseball announcer, novelist and figure skater \u2014 all trace their roots, knowingly or not, to the functionaries who performed ritual sacrifices (slaughtering animals, burning incense) in the Temple in Jerusalem, before A.D. 70. Don\u2019t be embarrassed if you didn\u2019t know this: Since the days of vaudeville, in America \u201cCohen\u201d has meant nothing at best, and at worst it\u2019s been the punchline of a cruel joke. Namdar\u2019s protagonist, sophisticated and brilliant as he may be, hasn\u2019t the slightest inkling of his inheritance.\n\nAs the novel carefully reminds us, though, the sacrifices performed by priests in the Temple have always been the not-so-thoroughly repressed core of religious Judaism. It\u2019s not just the Orthodox, but also Conservative Jews, all across America, who still pray constantly for the Temple to be rebuilt. Before the advent of political Zionism in the 19th century, that dream of rebuilding was the reason Jews even cared about Zion: They believed the only thing that could purify them or secure their atonement was ritual sacrifice, possible nowhere but on that highly contentious scrap of land, the Temple Mount.\n\nSo it\u2019s no caprice on Namdar\u2019s part to take seriously the legacy of the destroyed temple, the \u201cruined house\u201d whose fall sent the Israelites into exile and elevated the rabbis over the priests as Jewish authorities. On the contrary, his is an attempt to recover the mythic foundations of the present.\n\nNamdar has no thesis, and the novel does not suggest that the return of the repressed would be easy or even productive. At times dripping in gore and effluvia, steeped in sacred texts and apocalyptic visions, \u201cThe Ruined House\u201d cannot be recommended lightly. But it is a masterpiece of modern religious literature, exactly as deep, disturbing and unresolved as is necessary to remind us, habituated as we are to the shallows of contemporary Jewish life, what still lurks beneath \u2014 primitive, raw and exacting.", "title": "An Unusual Jewish Novel, Full of Blood and Incense", "authors": ["Josh Lambert"]}

In a Lens piece, \u201cJamel Shabazz\u2019s 40 Years of Sights and Styles in New York,\u201d Maurice Berger writes:\n\nMr. Shabazz uses his camera predominantly to challenge stereotypes and negative perceptions about urban life \u2014 and especially about New York\u2019s black and brown residents \u2014 by focusing on the vitality, diversity and dignity of his subjects.\n\nPeople are the main focus of Shabazz\u2019s work, and the concept and emotional intention of his photographs are supported by the use of value and contrast to create emphasis. Subjects stand out when contrasting with their environment, drawing the eye to the person captured in the image.\n\nIn \u201cStyle,\u201d Lower East Side, Manhattan, 2002,\u201d the black-and-white image that begins the slide show above, there are many tonal values (shades from the gray scale). Which parts of the image are low contrast, and which are high contrast? What stands out? What\u2019s the first thing you see? What\u2019s the next thing you notice? Is your eye drawn to the high contrast or low contrast areas first?\n\nIn highlighting his community, Jamel Shabazz plays with value and contrast to make them stand out, emphasizing fashion and community aesthetics as a way to honor and document his New York neighbors. His memorable photographs communicate successfully in part because of his skilled approach to using value to create emphasis and meaning.\n\nClick through the entire slide show and repeat the same exercise for each image. Which photos have high contrast colors? Which have low contrast colors, or a mix of both? Which areas are emphasized with high contrast shades? What do you think Mr. Shabazz wanted to reveal about his subjects?\n\n_________\n\n2. Value Creates Illusion\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen colors have similar value and low contrast, they create the illusion of vibration or movement, as in the paintings of Agnes Martin, whose color choice often stays within the realm of a certain value to create subtle variation with a puzzling effect for the eye. In \u201cThe Joy of Reading Between Agnes Martin\u2019s Lines,\u201d Holland Cotter writes about the visual exercise of differentiating color and value in her work:\n\nView her paintings from several feet away, and their surfaces \u2014 whitish, pinkish, grayish, brownish \u2014 look hazily blank, as if they needed a dusting or a buffing. Move closer, and complicated, eye-tricking, self-erasing textures come in and out of focus.\n\nHow does Martin use value to trick the eye and create subtle texture variation? Which of her paintings have a high contrast between colors, and which have colors of similar value? Look through the images shown in \u201cThe Joy of Reading Between Agnes Martin\u2019s Lines\u201d and analyze her use of color value.\n\nThen, compare and contrast Agnes Martin\u2019s use of contrasting color values with the work of the painter Julian Stanczak, known for his Op Art style that also boldly plays with the eye. Op Art is a type of visual art that creates optical illusions. In his Times review of the exhibition \u201cJulian Stanczak Master of Op Art: Highlights of the Past 40 years,\u201d Kenneth Johnson writes:\n\nMr. Stanczak has been steadfastly devoted to using pattern and color to create striking and confounding illusions of movement and luminosity. In his neatly made abstractions nothing stays fixed: lines appear to vibrate, waver, rotate and undulate; color glows and throbs as if electrically generated; hovering, gridded squares seem to fade in and out of visibility. The effects are retinal but they feel almost hallucinatory.\n\nIn the Times writer Roberta Smith\u2019s recent obituary about the abstract painter Julian Stanczak, Ms. Smith detailed how the artist achieved these optical illusions and became a leader in the Op Art style.\n\nHe produced some of the most emotionally gripping paintings associated with the Op trend. This was achieved partly by his delicately textured paint surfaces and partly by the soft light that often infiltrated his forms and patterns, the result of an infinitesimal adjustment of the shades of one or two colors.\n\nBrowse through the Times slide show embedded above on \u201cThe Art of Julian Stanczak\u201d and answer the following questions:\n\n\u2022 Can you identify the techniques used to create optical illusions of depth, dimension and light?\n\n\u2022Which paintings have the most subtle adjustments between shades?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022Which have a higher contrast?\n\n\u2022Which kinds of value variants create the strongest texture?\n\n\u2022How do you describe the effect each image has on your eye?\n\n_________\n\n3. A Times Scavenger Hunt\n\nPhoto\n\nNow that you\u2019ve explored how value is used to emphasize subjects in art and creates the illusion of dark and light, and gained an understanding of the value of colors and how they affect each other, browse through features in The New York Times\u2019s Art & Design section; Lens, the Times site for photojournalism; or anywhere else on NYTimes.com, and challenge yourself to a scavenger hunt.\n\nSee if you can find photographs or images of artwork with the following characteristics:\n\n\u2022A high contrast photograph.\n\n\u2022A low contrast photograph.\n\n\u2022An image of a painting with colors of highly contrasting values.\n\n\u2022An image of a painting with colors of similar value.\n\n\u2022A photograph in which the level of value contrast affects the mood of the image.\n\n\u2022A photograph in which the value contrast creates texture.\n\n\u2022A photograph in which the value contrast emphasizes the focus of the image.\n\n4. Your Turn: Photo Portraits and Op Art\n\nHere are two ideas for experimenting with value in your own creative work.\n\na. Portraits With Varied Values\n\n\n\nSlide Show\n\nIn 2014, The Times invited students to submit creative selfies that express who they are, and received hundreds, from college students to first graders. Marci Beene, who teaches digital photography at J.T. Hutchinson Middle School in Lubbock, Tex., turned the solicitation into an assignment for her seventh and eighth graders: \u201cDo a selfie that goes beyond your face,\u201d she instructed, \u201cand that represents something.\u201d Click through the photos above to see the results.\n\nTake a portrait of a friend, or a self-portrait using the timer on your camera. Use an editing app on your phone like Instagram or Snapchat to create different versions of the portrait with filters. Create one black-and-white version with high contrast and one with low contrast. Do the same with a full-color version.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhich filters create the strongest value contrast and which flatten the photo with low contrasting light and color? Arrange the four versions of your portrait into one image and compare the mood of each. How does value bring about the feeling portrayed?\n\nb. Op Art Collage\n\nPhoto\n\nTo create an Op Art collage, choose two colors of construction paper with similar values, like red and orange, or light yellow and light pink. Cut one color into thin strips or small shapes, and glue onto the other sheet with a glue stick. Consider the abstract compositions of Julian Stanczak for inspiration. Next, choose two colors that have a strong contrast, like blue and orange. Create another cut-paper collage using the same technique.\n\nSol LeWitt is another artist who experimented with color values to whom you can look for inspiration.

Gone are the seafarers who over-hunted them to near extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries. Gone too are the large crocodiles that may have preyed upon them in prehistoric times, as a new study suggests.\n\nDennis Hansen, an ecologist from the University of Zurich, was exploring the coral atoll and its azure lagoon, part of the Seychelles, when he came across fossils that intrigued him. They included parts of a giant tortoise shell with circular bite marks and the jaw of an ancient crocodylian. From the finds, he and a colleague concluded that some 90,000 to 125,000 years ago, the ancient crocodiles may have feasted upon the giant tortoises of Aldabra.\n\nThe finding, which was published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science, may offer new insights into the ancient past of the world\u2019s most numerous giant tortoise and the threats it once faced from predators.\n\nMore Reporting on Paleontology\n\nMeasuring more than 3 feet long and 550 pounds on average, the Aldabra giant tortoise is behind only the Galapagos tortoise in size. It has a thick, domed shell which protects its soft body. It also has a long neck and stout legs covered in scales.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Hansen found about 180 fossils near a pond on the atoll. One was a jawbone of an ancient crocodile that he first thought was a tortoise longbone. But when he turned it over he saw it had holes where teeth could fit. He sent some of the fossils to his colleague Torsten Scheyer, a paleontologist also at the University of Zurich, for further examination.", "title": "Ancient Crocodiles Once Feasted on Giant Tortoises on This Island", "authors": ["Nicholas St. Fleur"]}

Mr. Moses served 18 years in prison for killing the girl, Shamone Johnson, but was released on parole in 2013 after an eyewitness at his trial recanted his testimony.\n\nSince he was released, Mr. Moses has been trying to get his verdict formally reversed, in part by arguing, as he did at trial, that Mr. Scarcella choked and hit him to coerce a confession. In her order on Thursday, Justice Dineen A. Riviezzo said that while some of the claims against Mr. Scarcella \u201cseem far-fetched,\u201d the accumulation of accusations that he used \u201cimproper tactics\u201d to send people to prison could have proved persuasive to the jury that convicted Mr. Moses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Justice Riviezzo announced her decision from the bench, spectators in the courtroom in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn applauded.

But, with potential buyers like Disney and 21st Century Fox now wrapped up in their own mega-mergers, there\u2019s a sense that a sale has begun to seem like a less likely outcome, at least anytime soon.

Average hourly earnings rose just 2.5 percent last year, below the Fed\u2019s target and in line with recent years.\n\nBut there has been some optimism that wage growth might pick up this year because: 1) The unemployment rate should continue to fall; 2) Companies are doling out one-time bonuses and pay raises in response to the new tax law; 3) Several cities and states raised the minimum wage on Jan. 1.\n\nThe economists at BofA Merrill Lynch took a closer look these dynamics, and here\u2019s their take away:\n\n\u201cWage increases by companies and higher state and local minimum wages should provide a slight bump to wage growth in the next few months...Once the initial boost to wage growth fades, we think the trajectory for wage growth should be a function of the degree of tightening in the labor market. The descent in the unemployment rate should be able to boost wages to a high-2% pace by year-end and to 3% by the middle of 2019. The trajectory is still gradual, but clearly higher.\u201d\n\nDo investors care about a government shutdown?\n\nSo far, the markets don\u2019t seem bothered.

The pain of leaving home to attempt adulthood was exacerbated by my inability to find peace in partnership. I tried to turn every relationship into a love that could replace the mighty one with which I was raised, but they left me feeling unseen or stagnant.\n\nWith him, though, I felt alive. I felt like the version of myself I long assumed had been dead and buried. And I began to believe that I was meant to be paralyzed by fear throughout all of those tumultuous years so that, when he finally appeared, I would be free to love him.\n\nI started to understand what others had always described: the softening of edges that certainty affords us. All the things that might have troubled me about him \u2014 his inability to hear me when he was fixed upon a computer screen, his lukewarm interest in fiction, his occasional melodrama \u2014 could be set aside if it meant that I could keep him.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I didn\u2019t label our differences as damning. They were the space within which we divided, leaving room for us to yearn for each other, to be dazzled by our distinctiveness, to always want to draw the other closer.\n\nEveryone with whom I have discussed Bitcoin has affirmed that it is a system based on trust. These elusive wonder coins bear and accrue value because of the shared faith that miners and moneymakers place in them.\n\nAnd now, I\u2019m kicking myself for not investing some paltry sum at an earlier date.\n\nAll along, I thought I was holding something of value because I could see and feel it. But realness and value are products of shared and equal faith, no matter if in things unseen.

{"date": "2018-01-27 00:00:00", "text": "The Republican tax law has slashed the federal corporate tax rate to 21 percent, from 35 percent. The Trump administration has argued that this cut will translate into big raises for workers, but many economists say that most of those gains will actually flow to shareholders and top executives. Take Walmart. The company says it will spend $700 million on bonuses and higher wages for cashiers, drivers and other hourly workers. That\u2019s a tidy sum, but the company is spending far more \u2014 $4 billion \u2014 to buy back its stock, which will benefit its investors by raising the share price. And it is worth keeping in mind that Walmart also raised wages when tax rates were higher under President Barack Obama.\n\nApple says it is repatriating most of the $252 billion of cash it holds abroad by making a onetime tax payment of $38 billion to the federal government. The company also has promised to create 20,000 jobs and build a new campus. This sounds great. But thanks to the Republican tax law, Apple will pay at a fraction of the tax rate on its foreign profits that it would have paid at under previous tax law \u2014 just 15.5 percent on profits held as cash and 8 percent on earnings held in nonliquid assets like real estate and equipment. It is hard to believe that lawmakers made the right call by giving Apple and other multinational companies this huge tax break. Research has shown that a 2004 law allowing companies to bring foreign profits home at a discounted tax rate did little to boost investment or create jobs and that most of the tax savings went to shareholders.\n\nIn cutting the corporate tax rate, Republicans have argued that the 35 percent rate was holding American businesses back relative to foreign competitors. This is hard to square with the fact that companies based in the United States have prospered in recent decades. Apple, for example, has become one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies and went from employing 5,000 people in the United States in 1998 to employing 84,000 this year.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with cutting taxes on corporations as part of a broader reform that closes loopholes, increases American competitiveness and helps create well-paying jobs. Unfortunately, none of those conditions apply in this case.\n\nAs many experts have pointed out, corporate tax cuts passed by Congress and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s did not turbocharge wages or investment. Similarly, a series of corporate tax cuts in the last 10 years or so by Labour and Conservative governments in Britain \u2014 to 19 percent, from 30 percent \u2014 did not produce a boom in wages or investment. In fact, wages grew faster in the United States, according to an article on Vox by Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor, and Edward Kleinbard, a law professor.\n\nIt\u2019s great that after decades of anemic wage growth, some workers are finally getting a raise. But if President Trump and the Republicans in Congress were serious about helping workers via the tax code, they had obvious options open to them: They could have cut taxes on the middle class and expanded the earned-income tax credit for poorer workers. Instead, they chose to write giant checks to big investors on the accounts of future generations.", "title": "Opinion | Are Corporate Tax Cuts Raising Pay? Yes, for Bosses", "authors": []}

Would you want to attend any of these schools because of the amenities featured? Why or why not?\n\nIn \u201cNo College Kid Needs a Water Park to Study,\u201d James V. Koch writes:\n\nIn a competition to woo students, public universities are increasingly offering lavish amenities that have nothing to do with education. The latest trend is lazy rivers, which have been installed at several big institutions, including the Universities of Alabama, Iowa and Missouri. Last year, Louisiana State University topped them all with a 536-foot-long \u201cleisure\u201d river in the shape of the letters \u201cLSU,\u201d part of an $85 million renovation and expansion of its gym. It was L.S.U. students who footed the bill. At a time when college has never been more expensive, this is the last thing students should be paying for. According to the College Board, tuition and fees at public four-year institutions grew more than 60 percent over the past 10 years. State budgets for higher education have been slashed, and students have to make up the difference. In the case of L.S.U., the lazy river was financed entirely by student fees, an addendum to their annual tuition. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, over the past five years, those fees increased by 60 percent, nearly triple the amount L.S.U. students paid in 2000. Tuition and fee hikes at public universities don\u2019t come out of nowhere. Each has to be approved by a school\u2019s governing board, whose trustees are typically appointed by the governor. Ensuring affordable, quality education is an essential part of trustees\u2019 responsibility, but unfortunately often not part of their practice. Trustees of public universities are stewards of a public trust that rests nobly on the notion that an enlightened citizenry is vital to a democratic society. They have a fiduciary duty to represent the citizens and taxpayers who support public institutions of higher education, as well as the students who attend them. But even though the best interests of students and taxpayers revolve around college access, affordability and graduation outcomes, too often presidents and boards are more focused on the rankings, reputation and popularity of the institution itself.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 Are lavish amenities on college campuses useful or frivolous, in your opinion?

There are many Republicans wary of a second term for Mr. Trump, and yet right now they are entirely reliant on the Democrats to deliver a winning centrist candidate out of a primary process that almost made Bernie Sanders their 2016 nominee. A contest between Mr. Trump and a liberal Democratic candidate like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would leave the middle up for grabs. And a big contingent of politically orphaned political strategists, academics and donors would be ready to lend support.\n\nWill outraged voters fall in line behind a resurgent Democratic Party or fuel the rise of a new major party? Abraham Lincoln was the last representative of a new political party to be elected president. He won in 1860 as the nominee of the anti-slavery Republican Party after he gained notice for his debates with Stephen Douglas during his 1858 Senate run.\n\nLincoln lost that Senate race, but he became famous as a voice of moral clarity. Lincoln\u2019s eventual win resulted not from a party affiliation but from the moral authority he commanded as an opponent of slavery.

It\u2019s a phenomenon, it really is.\u201d\n\nMr. Amiri no longer works on Sunset, though he keeps the old studio \u2014 backslid now to more or less one table, one chair \u2014 as a reminder of days gone by. In fact, he said on a warm day in mid-December, as the crash of silverware could be heard from the restaurant kitchen above, he grew out of it quickly and moved to a studio in Koreatown. In six months, he grew out of that one and relocated downtown. Soon we were headed there, negotiating Los Angeles traffic in Mr. Amiri\u2019s new G-Class Mercedes. As of this month, he has moved once again, to a 30,000-square-foot complex that will house his design studio, a showroom, a digital studio for e-commerce and, for kicks and good measure, a basketball court.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Amiri, 41, grew up in Hollywood, the son of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Iranians who parlayed a business in antique rugs into real-estate investments, enough of them to rent an apartment in Beverly Hills so that Mr. Amiri and one of his brothers could go to Beverly Hills High School on the right side of the tracks. (Mr. Amiri remembered being an outsider there, ditching classes and smoking cigarettes alongside classmates like Angelina Jolie.) But his sensibility was forged along the Sunset Strip of the 1990s, the halcyon days of hard rock and Viper Room debauchery.\n\n\u201cComing from Hollywood, the heroes were people you would see here,\u201d Mr. Amiri said. \u201cPeople in those jackets, the flannels, super-long hair, polka-dot shirts with leopard. For me, that was the coolest thing ever. To anybody else, they look like burnouts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat sensibility, some 30 years later, still dictates the Amiri look, which is subtle as a scream. Mr. Amiri\u2019s first collection was built around embellished jeans and sweatshirts and tees holed by shotgun fire \u2014 distressed clothes you could hardly blame for their distress. It is based on vintage items, which Mr. Amiri began his career scouring flea markets for and reinterpreting.\n\n\u201cFor people who have more money than time, you don\u2019t have to go digging every weekend at the Rose Bowl,\u201d said Will Welch, the creative director of GQ. \u201cIt\u2019s the vintage grails you always wanted to find.\u201d\n\nHere they have morphed into something glitzier and gamier. Mr. Amiri has a free hand with embellishment, and a love of casual staples \u2014 hoodies, flannels and so on \u2014 ratcheted to luxurious but still flea-bitten extremes. As rock gods crank their amps to 11, so does he.

Mr. Amiri idolized Hedi Slimane, a fellow (if adopted) Angeleno and rock obsessive, who helped pioneer cult luxury denim as the designer of Dior Homme in the early Aughts. The pairs Mr. Amiri himself designs are, generally speaking, skintight, slashed and stretchy, and can run to $1,000 or more.\n\nStretch has fallen out of favor in men\u2019s fashion, but Mr. Amiri realized that stretch fabrics were more comfortable for those who live, party, sleep and wake up in their jeans, and a man with a 34-inch waist doesn\u2019t mind finding he fits into a 32. (Mr. Amiri introduced a women\u2019s collection in 2017, and while men\u2019s still accounts for 75 percent of sales, women\u2019s is growing.)\n\nAmiri\u2019s brashness is in stark contrast to some of the luxury brands with whom he now competes, which tend to fetishize newness and intellectualize their approach.

He studied genetic disorders linked to certain population groups, like Ashkenazi Jews, and considered the ethical issues raised by genetic testing and gene therapy.\n\nHe was also highly esteemed as a mentor, becoming the subject of a chapter in a 2009 book on mentoring in higher education.\n\nOne who studied with him was Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein. It was during a fellowship with Dr. Motulsky, beginning in 1968, that Dr. Goldstein laid the foundation for research on how the body processes cholesterol. The findings led to a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, which Dr. Goldstein shared with Dr. Michael S. Brown.

In an account he gave to the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics in 2016, Dr. Motulsky said his family had hoped to join his father\u2019s brother in Chicago but headed for Cuba instead after hearing that a United States quota system was causing long delays in granting visas.\n\nHis father left first.

In 1945 he married Gretel Stern, an accountant, who had left Germany in 1938 and whom he had met at the Y.M.C.A. college. He graduated in 1947 and took further training in internal medicine and hematology.\n\nIn 1951, during the Korean War, Dr. Motulsky was called back into the Army and assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, where he studied inherited blood disorders.\n\nDischarged in 1953, he became an instructor at the University of Washington\u2019s new medical school, in Seattle, assigned to teach internal medicine and hematology.

The charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, related to Mr. Lee\u2019s possession in 2012 of two notebooks that contained the identities of Chinese nationals working for the C.I.A. and other highly classified details. Mr. Lee\u2019s repeated contacts with Chinese intelligence would be of great relevance to the question of whether he may have been recruited by China and played a role in the betrayal of C.I.A. secrets.\n\nDuring the early years of the investigation into the loss of sources in China, there were disagreements between the C.I.A. and F.B.I. over whether Mr. Lee was the likely source of the breach. Some investigators believed that China might have penetrated the C.I.A.\u2019s covert communications or that sloppy tradecraft by the agency might have exposed operations.\n\nMr. Lee does not yet appear to have a lawyer, though he was represented by a federal public defender during a court appearance this week. He has not been charged with espionage, and no evidence has publicly emerged linking him directly to the deaths of the C.I.A. sources in China.\n\nThe colleague, who was formerly a senior manager with Japan Tobacco and worked closely with Mr. Lee there, said the company had good reason to believe Mr. Lee\u2019s claim that he had been the C.I.A. liaison to the Ministry of State Security, though he declined to give details. He said the company also believed the later report that Mr. Lee was meeting in 2010 with Chinese intelligence, which came as a tip from a Chinese official to a veteran investigator with Japan Tobacco, a former Hong Kong police investigator who had handled many tobacco cases.\n\nMr. Lee\u2019s reported false claim that Japan Tobacco investigators were actually working for the C.I.A. alarmed company officials, who thought it would put at risk every company investigator who traveled in China. He said the claim had no basis in fact, and that any perception of an association with any foreign intelligence service was carefully avoided because it would have been dangerous for Japan Tobacco employees in China.\n\nCompany officials thought the false C.I.A. claim was an act of revenge for Mr. Lee\u2019s firing.

Mr. Roginsky\u2019s father died in prison, and Mr. Roginsky himself spent four years in three different Soviet labor camps in the 1980s for printing an underground journal whose goal was \u201cto rescue from oblivion all those historical facts and names that are currently doomed to perish or disappear.\u201d\n\nThat remained his mission to his dying day, briefly with the support of the Russian state in the 1990s, then again in defiance of it as Russia under Vladimir Putin set about creating a narrative of Russian greatness in which historical facts could be a handicap. For Mr. Roginsky, historical memory meant more than compiling records; it also meant giving a name to the culprits \u2014 the interrogators, the guards, the state itself \u2014 and sounding the alarm at violations of human rights. In recent years, Memorial was targeted with searches, threats of closing and identification as a \u201cforeign agent.\u201d\n\nIt is not only in Russia, of course, that reckoning with a nefarious past has been a struggle. Germany\u2019s Nazi past, America\u2019s Confederate monuments, Turkey\u2019s refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide, China\u2019s censoring talk about the Tiananmen massacre and many other examples bear witness to the difficulty of confronting a troubling history.\n\nThe reasons are many. Those who lived through hell, as Russians of an older generation did, may prefer to blot out the horrors they endured or inflicted. Younger generations prefer to live for today. Political leaders prefer to project a noble history, sometimes by turning complicity in atrocities into claims of victimhood. In Russia, Mr. Putin and many of his lieutenants came from the K.G.B. and resisted fully confronting its repressive history. And they, like many of their countrymen, prefer to portray Stalin not only as the architect of the Gulag but also as the leader who built Russia\u2019s industrial might and led it to victory in the Great Patriotic War, as World War II is known in Russia.", "title": "Opinion | Arseny Roginsky, a Champion of Historical Truth", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-01-25 00:00:00", "text": "Let\u2019s take the example of a human doctor making a diagnosis. Afterward, a patient might ask that doctor how she made that diagnosis, and she would probably share some of the data she used to draw her conclusion. But could she really explain how and why she made that decision, what specific data from what studies she drew on, what observations from her training or mentors influenced her, what tacit knowledge she gleaned from her own and her colleagues\u2019 shared experiences and how all of this combined into that precise insight? Sure, she\u2019d probably give a few indicators about what pointed her in a certain direction \u2014 but there would also be an element of guessing, of following hunches. And even if there weren\u2019t, we still wouldn\u2019t know that there weren\u2019t other factors involved of which she wasn\u2019t even consciously aware.\n\nIf the same diagnosis had been made with A.I., we could draw from all available information on that particular patient \u2014 as well as data anonymously aggregated across time and from countless other relevant patients everywhere, to make the strongest evidence-based decision possible. It would be a diagnosis with a direct connection to the data, rather than human intuition based on limited data and derivative summaries of anecdotal experiences with a relatively small number of local patients.\n\nBut we make decisions in areas that we don\u2019t fully understand every day \u2014 often very successfully \u2014 from the predicted economic impacts of policies to weather forecasts to the ways in which we approach much of science in the first place. We either oversimplify things or accept that they\u2019re too complex for us to break down linearly, let alone explain fully. It\u2019s just like the black box of A.I.: Human intelligence can reason and make arguments for a given conclusion, but it can\u2019t explain the complex, underlying basis for how we arrived at a particular conclusion. Think of what happens when a couple get divorced because of one stated cause \u2014 say, infidelity \u2014 when in reality there\u2019s an entire unseen universe of intertwined causes, forces and events that contributed to that outcome. Why did they choose to split up when another couple in a similar situation didn\u2019t? Even those in the relationship can\u2019t fully explain it. It\u2019s a black box.\n\nThe irony is that compared with human intelligence, A.I. is actually the more transparent of intelligences. Unlike the human mind, A.I. can \u2014 and should \u2014 be interrogated and interpreted. Like the ability to audit and refine models and expose knowledge gaps in deep neural nets and the debugging tools that will inevitably be built and the potential ability to augment human intelligence via brain-computer interfaces, there are many technologies that could help interpret artificial intelligence in a way we can\u2019t interpret the human brain. In the process, we may even learn more about how human intelligence itself works.\n\nPerhaps the real source of critics\u2019 concerns isn\u2019t that we can\u2019t \u201csee\u201d A.I.\u2019s reasoning but that as A.I. gets more powerful, the human mind becomes the limiting factor. It\u2019s that in the future, we\u2019ll need A.I. to understand A.I. In health care as well as in other fields, this means we will soon see the creation of a category of human professionals who don\u2019t have to make the moment-to-moment decisions themselves but instead manage a team of A.I. workers \u2014 just like commercial airplane pilots who engage autopilots to land in poor weather conditions. Doctors will no longer \u201cdrive\u201d the primary diagnosis; instead, they\u2019ll ensure that the diagnosis is relevant and meaningful for a patient and oversee when and how to offer more clarification and more narrative explanation. The doctor\u2019s office of the future will very likely include computer assistants, on both the doctor\u2019s side and the patient\u2019s side, as well as data inputs that come from far beyond the office walls.\n\nWhen that happens, it will become clear that the so-called black box of artificial intelligence is more of a feature, not a bug \u2014 because it\u2019s more possible to capture and explain what\u2019s going on there than it is in the human mind. None of this dismisses or ignores the need for oversight of A.I. It\u2019s just that instead of worrying about the black box, we should focus on the opportunity and therefore better address a future where A.I. not only augments human intelligence and intuition but also perhaps even sheds light on and redefines what it means to be human in the first place.", "title": "Opinion | Artificial Intelligence\u2019s \u2018Black Box\u2019 Is Nothing to Fear", "authors": []}

His recent firing of a powerful provincial governor, who is refusing to leave a post he has held for 13 years, has led to a protracted showdown that is consuming the government\u2019s energy.\n\nIn the latest wave of violence, Taliban militants laid siege to a hilltop hotel, fighting for 15 hours and killing at least 22. Then, on Saturday, the Taliban drove an ambulance packed with explosives into the heart of the city, within a earshot of the country\u2019s intelligence agency and other government offices, and slaughtered more than 100 people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlthough the Monday attack at the military university was claimed by the Islamic State, Afghan officials saw it as connected to the Taliban violence. Afghan and Western officials have long spoken of an overlap between the networks that carry out urban attacks for the Taliban and the Islamic State.\n\nThe Trump administration announced last month that it would suspend security aid to Pakistan for harboring such terrorist groups. Mr. Ghani, his aides say, has repeatedly warned that Pakistan would push the Taliban to intensify its violence in order to weaken the government here before American pressure could change Pakistan\u2019s long-held calculations.\n\nThe war will not end, said Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, the Afghan intelligence chief, who is facing calls to resign, \u201cwithout Pakistan stopping the support for terrorists.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe mentality there that \u2018fighting in Afghanistan is a holy war\u2019 should be eliminated,\u201d he added. \u201cWithout that, it is not possible to end the war here.\u201d\n\nMr. Stanekzai said the international pressure on Pakistan had \u201ctranslated into revenge on the Afghan people.\u201d\n\nTaliban commanders say they are intensifying the urban attacks as a retaliation for increased airstrikes on their areas. The United States military alone dropped more than 4,000 bombs across Afghanistan in 2017, and the Afghan air force, as it expands with aircraft provided by the United States, increasingly carries out regular bombings. New American military units are expected to arrive, adding to the approximately 14,000 troops already here, to advise and assist the Afghans.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He rarely speaks to local news media, and critics accuse him of not understanding the gravity of the situation as he remains mired in trying to fix a broken bureaucracy.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Ghani appeared at a brief news conference along with the visiting president of Indonesia. The day had been declared a national holiday \u201cto free resources\u201d for victims of the earlier attacks, though many suggested that the main motive was to shut down the city for security reasons to make the Indonesian\u2019s visit possible.\n\nMr. Ghani said the Taliban, who in the past had hesitated to claim responsibility for attacks with high civilian casualties, were now happy to do so because \u201ctheir masters\u201d \u2014 a reference to Pakistan \u2014 had been cornered by international pressure. \u201cThey did it at the behest of their masters, so their masters can get out of political isolation,\u201d Mr. Ghani said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe added: \u201cOur blood will not go unanswered.\u201d\n\nAmrullah Saleh, a former intelligence chief who briefly advised Mr. Ghani on security reforms, said the Afghan president was micromanaging \u2014 chairing water councils and holding weekly meetings on procurement contracts \u2014 when he should be focused on security and uniting people.\n\n\u201cFor the Taliban, it is the end which matters, not the ways and the means,\u201d Mr. Saleh said. \u201cThe end is to weaken the state, the end is to fragment the society, the end is to increase the cost of war \u2014 that they are achieving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what we are telling Ashraf Ghani,\u201d he added. \u201cYou may save $20 million in procurement, you may save $10 million managing the Kabul municipality, but how much are you losing by not focusing wholly on security?\u201d", "title": "As Afghan Attacks Intensify, So Does Anger at Country\u2019s Leaders", "authors": ["Mujib Mashal", "Fahim Abed"]}

The Treasury must borrow money from private investors but needs congressional approval to go above the $20.5 trillion debt limit that caps the United States debt load.\n\nFiscal hawks warn that mounting federal debt will ultimately slow economic growth, but Washington shows no signs of paying heed. Congress is poised to dole out billions of dollars for a host of different priorities, and the spending spree is being embraced across party lines.\n\nMr. Trump and Republicans are pushing for a big increase in military spending, warning that the nation\u2019s security is at stake. The president wants $25 billion for border security, including his promised wall on the border with Mexico. Mr. Mnuchin also said on Tuesday that infrastructure would be an administration priority this year. Mr. Trump has suggested that rebuilding roads and bridges is something that could garner bipartisan support, and White House has signaled that it will seek $200 billion from Congress to jump-start an infrastructure investment program.\n\nOn top of that spending, the party is still celebrating its sweeping overhaul of the tax code, casting aside expectations of how it will impact the national debt.\n\nAfter loudly bemoaning that the tax overhaul would swell the national debt, Democrats are pressing to secure a sizable boost in spending on domestic programs, including billions of dollars to address the opioid crisis. And lawmakers from both parties are looking to approve at least about $80 billion in additional aid in response to last year\u2019s hurricanes and wildfires.\n\n\u201cThe deep dark secret is Republicans like to spend money just as much as Democrats,\u201d said Representative Jim Costa, Democrat of California and a co-chairman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition. \u201cThey just want to spend it on something different.\u201d\n\nJust last week, lawmakers approved a stopgap spending bill to end a government shutdown and keep agencies funded until Feb. 8 while also extending funding for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for six years. But the fine print of the bill also suspended or delayed a handful of taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act, which will cost the government $31 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe deficit is now projected to reach $1 trillion in the 2019 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.\n\nThat could grow even larger if, as expected, congressional leaders from both parties can reach an agreement to raise strict caps on military and domestic spending that were imposed in 2011.\n\nRepublicans are pushing for a big increase to the cap on military spending, while Democrats are insisting on an equal increase in nonmilitary spending. All told, lawmakers could reach a two-year agreement to raise the spending caps by more than $200 billion over that period.\n\nFor Democrats, the firm posture in spending talks does not perfectly harmonize with their outcry during the battle over the Republican tax overhaul. Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, recalled that just recently, during the fight over taxes, Democrats were \u201cabsolutely outraged at what potential deficit impact there might be.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion to the deficit over a decade, or about $1.1 trillion if the effects of economic growth and interest rates are taken into account, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nMr. Mnuchin dismissed that idea on Tuesday, reiterating his position that if economic growth can be sustained at an annual rate of 3 percent, the tax cuts will pay for themselves. (Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, expects growth in the first three months of 2018 to fall to 2.3 percent.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile Democrats tried to draw attention to how the tax cuts would worsen the government\u2019s finances, few Republicans expressed similar concerns.

But there is little expectation that Congress will take any significant action in those areas any time soon.\n\n\u201cThis is out of control,\u201d complained Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, as he lamented that lawmakers were set to approve disaster aid without finding a way to pay for it.\n\n\u201cEvery dime that we\u2019re talking about for disaster relief is borrowed,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. \u201cWe have to go to China and borrow that money to give disaster relief to farmers in Texas and people in Florida.\u201d\n\nAt the Senate hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Mnuchin said that Mr. Trump has been focused on initiatives that will spur economic growth as a way of generating additional revenue for the government.\n\n\u201cHis first priority was to create economic growth,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the single most important thing that will create revenues.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans are not so sure.\n\n\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to have to change the name of the Department of Treasury to the Department of Debt, because there\u2019s not going to be any treasury left,\u201d said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana. \u201cIt would seem to me that we need to have an adult discussion at some point about how we\u2019re going to get control of that.\u201d", "title": "As Deficit Soars Toward $1 Trillion, Congress Shrugs and Keeps Spending", "authors": ["Alan Rappeport", "Thomas Kaplan"]}

It works in large part by training the public to expect a certain level of inflation, disciplining the pricing decisions of businesses and the wage demands of workers. It is, in other words, a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe Fed announced in January 2012 that it would seek to keep inflation at a 2 percent annual pace, formalizing its implicit target since the mid-1990s.\n\nThe rise of inflation targeting reflected a consensus among academics and policymakers that central banks did not have direct control over broader economic performance but did exercise direct control over inflation, and that keeping inflation low and stable was the best way to support growth.\n\nMost central banks in developed nations similarly target a low rate of inflation, taking the view that unpredictable increases in prices are economically disruptive. The European Central Bank, for example, aims to keep inflation \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2 percent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the Fed\u2019s focus on inflation in the real economy did not prevent asset prices like mortgage-backed bonds from soaring to unsustainable heights before 2008, and concern about keeping inflation low limited the scope of its post-crisis stimulus campaign.\n\nMoreover, the combination of low inflation and modest growth has left the Fed with very little room to respond to future downturns by reducing interest rates. During past downturns, the Fed lowered rates by an average of five percentage points. But the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate currently sits in a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent. That would make cutting the rate a less effective tool than in previous firefights.\n\nJanet L. Yellen, the Fed\u2019s outgoing chairwoman, has emphasized that the Fed has other weapons in its arsenal. After 2008, the Fed bought large quantities of Treasuries and mortgage bonds and promised to keep interest rates low for years at a time, encouraging borrowing by businesses and consumers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Powell, a Fed governor who is awaiting Senate confirmation as the next Fed chairman.\n\nSome outside economists say the Fed is putting a brave face on a bad situation.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a singularly brittle context in which we do not have a basis for assuming that monetary policy will be able as rapidly as possible to lift us out of the next recession,\u201d said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary.\n\nThe proposed alternatives to inflation targeting can be sorted into two categories. The first contains one simple idea: The Fed should permanently embrace higher inflation. The second is full of complicated ideas for temporarily embracing higher inflation during downturns.\n\nOlivier Blanchard, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who began his term as president of the American Economic Association at the Philadelphia meeting, said the choice of a 2 percent target had no particular economic logic to recommend it. Raising the target to 4 percent would give the Fed more room to operate without significantly larger economic costs, he said.\n\nMany economists, however, are wary of the simple solution.\n\nBen S. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, has warned that the costs of dropping a new anchor would be significant. On Monday, at a Brookings Institution conference convened to discuss alternatives to the 2 percent target, Mr. Bernanke dismissed a 4 percent target as politically untenable.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is not going to adopt a 4 percent inflation target,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Bernanke has added his name to the list of those seeking an alternative to the current system. Last year, he proposed that the Fed should announce that it would temporarily tolerate higher inflation during future economic recoveries.\n\nA mechanized version of that idea, popular in some academic circles, would instruct the Fed to target an alternative economic measure, nominal gross domestic product, or N.G.D.P., which sums inflation and real economic growth. Under a 4 percent N.G.D.P. target, for example, the Fed would aim for a combination of inflation and growth that equaled 4 percent, such as 2 percent inflation and 2 percent growth. During a period of lower inflation, like the last decade, such a target would require the Fed to dictate more aggressive stimulus.\n\nSome are skeptical that the Fed can improve the economy by trying harder. Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton University, has argued in his research that high levels of household debt are limiting the impact of monetary policy because many households cannot or will not continue borrow.\n\n\u201cThere is this implicit assumption that things will have traction if you just push hard enough,\u201d Mr. Mian said. \u201cBut what is the mechanism through which this will raise actual G.D.P.?\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Fed and other central banks have not even succeeded in hitting their 2 percent targets in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. Inflation in the United States has been below that level for the last six years, although most Fed policymakers continue to predict that higher inflation is around the corner.\n\nMs. Romer said more ambitious targets might encourage central banks to try harder to stimulate inflation.\n\nIn practice, she said, the Fed could have purchased more Treasuries and mortgage bonds as part of its response to the crisis, or even engaged in direct lending to businesses.\n\n\u201cWe should not just assume that what we\u2019ve done for the last 25 years is right,\u201d she said.", "title": "As Economy Strengthens, Fed Ponders New Approach", "authors": ["Binyamin Appelbaum"]}

The Trump administration is more closely scrutinizing visa applications, indefinitely banning travel from some countries and making it harder for foreign students to remain in the United States after graduation.\n\nWhile government officials describe these as necessary national security measures, a number of American colleges have been casualties of the policies.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs you lose those students, then the tuition revenue is negatively impacted as well,\u201d said Michael Godard, the interim provost at the University of Central Missouri, where 944 international students were enrolled in the fall, a decline of more than 1,500 from the previous year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to make some decisions, budgetary decisions, to adjust.\u201d\n\nInternational students pay double the $6,445 tuition of Missouri residents, and the lost revenue amounts to $14 million, according to Roger Best, the chief operating officer for the school, in Warrensburg, Mo. Dr. Best said that the university has been forced to cut instructors in computer programs, where many of the foreign students were enrolled, as well as defer maintenance and shave money from other departments, such as the campus newspaper.\n\nNationwide, the number of new foreign students declined an average of 7 percent this past fall, according to preliminary figures from a survey of 500 colleges by the Institute of International Education. Nearly half of the campuses surveyed reported declines.\n\nNow that the revenue stream appears to be diminishing, the financial outlook may be dire enough to weigh down the bond ratings of some schools, making it more expensive for them to borrow money, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service. Last month, Moody\u2019s changed its credit outlook for higher education to \u201cnegative\u201d from \u201cstable.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrowing uncertainty for international student enrollment stems from immigration policies that are in flux,\u201d Moody\u2019s said, warning that universities without global brand recognition would be hit hardest. While some flagship public and elite private colleges have been affected, the Institute of International Education said, the biggest impact will be felt by second-tier institutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe shift comes just as some states also are experiencing a drop in domestic students, partly the result of a decline in birthrates two decades ago. This year, the number of domestic undergraduate students dropped 224,000, or 1 percent, according to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center.\n\nAn increasingly diverse population in that age group means that more of the students come from low-income families in which no one has ever gone to college, also presenting recruitment challenges for universities, according to Doug Shapiro, the organization\u2019s executive research director. \u201cAffordability issues are the biggest hurdles,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can do with recruiting if the families can\u2019t afford the tuition.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

One official cited a \u201cperfect demographic storm.\u201d Budget cuts are underway.\n\nFaced with a demand from the university that it trim its budget, faculty in the school\u2019s modern languages department picked Italian as the language to cut, a decision that will save the university the salary of its only Italian professor, which one faculty member said was about $47,000. A final decision is still pending.\n\n\u201cThis definitely undermines that idea of diversity many U.S. universities proclaim to promote across the country,\u201d said Alessia Salamina, the professor whose job is in jeopardy. \u201cThis is in fact a national emergency, not only a K-State one.\u201d\n\nAccording to the institute\u2019s survey, enrollment is falling from a broad range of countries, including China and India, the two biggest sources of students. Among countries covered by Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban, Iran is the largest, though it can still send students to the United States.\n\nBut many administrators believe the president\u2019s views on immigration have made applying to United States colleges more of a gamble today. Officials said that other reasons for the decline in enrollment include increased competition from schools in other countries, cuts in scholarship programs in Saudi Arabia and Brazil, and a currency crisis in India caused when the government decided to swap widely used notes for new bills.\n\nFor years, American colleges had been staking their futures on continued growth in foreign students, and after the recession a decade ago, those students were a lifeline for colleges that had poured money into new buildings and amenities. In just the past six months, the University of Akron opened an international center in an existing building and hired 10 employees to work in international programming. The president, Matthew Wilson, said that students from India were reporting increased scrutiny of their visa applications, one of the reasons for a drop of about 200 international students.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEven a marketing campaign featuring Akron\u2019s favorite son, LeBron James, who is wildly popular in China, hasn\u2019t been enough to stave off declines.\n\nBut Mr. Wilson said he remained optimistic. \u201cInternational isn\u2019t something where I\u2019m thinking this is going to result in budgetary cutbacks,\u201d he said. \u201cSome folks are scaling back.

Moody\u2019s has already downgraded Wright State three notches, citing among other factors a notable drop in international enrollment, nearly 800 students over two years.\n\nWright State has decided to eliminate Italian, Russian and Japanese, part of more than $30 million in budget cuts.\n\nThe swimming team will cease to exist this spring, even after five of its members recently competed at the U.S.A. Winter Nationals. The team\u2019s elimination prompted at least two members to decide to leave the university, according to Trevor Keriazes, who specializes in the breaststroke.\n\nOther cuts included the full-time French horn and tuba professors, both one year short of tenure protection.\n\nThe school had asked both to remain as adjunct professors with reduced pay. Instead, they landed other jobs, and adjuncts have taken their positions at Wright State.\n\n\u201cIt was a contentious thing for a lot of people,\u201d said Jonas F.

But the Wisconsin program is voluntary, and inmates are paid market wages. State officials say the program gives inmates a chance to build up some savings, learn vocational skills and prepare for life after prison.\n\nMs. Yeadon initially encountered skepticism from supervisors. But as the local labor pool kept shrinking, it became harder to rule out a group of potential \u2014 albeit unconventional \u2014 workers.\n\nLess Education, but Still Gaining In the past five years, employment rates have grown the most among those who have not earned a high school diploma. +4.0 pct. points Less than high school Change in employment rates +3.5 Some college or associate\u2019s degree +3.0 Ages 25-54 +2.5 High school diploma or G.E.D. +2.0 Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher +1.5 +1.0 +0.5 \u201912 \u201913 \u201914 \u201915 \u201916 \u201917\n\n\u201cOur company is looking for new ways to find pools of people just because of our hiring needs being so high,\u201d Ms. Yeadon said. \u201cIt just took them to hear the right sales pitch.\u201d\n\nOther companies are making similar choices. Officials in Wisconsin and other states with similar inmate programs say demand for their workers has risen sharply in the past year. And while most companies may not be ready to turn to inmate labor, there are signs they are increasingly willing to consider candidates with criminal records, who have long faced trouble finding jobs.\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t regularly collect data on employment for people with criminal records. But private-sector sources suggest that companies have become more willing to consider hiring them. Data from Burning Glass showed that 7.9 percent of online job postings indicated that a criminal-background check was required, down from 8.9 percent in 2014.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Wynne runs Emerge Community Development, a Minneapolis nonprofit that helps people with criminal records or other difficulties find jobs. In the past, Mr. Wynne said, companies saw working with Emerge mostly as a form of public relations. But with the unemployment rate in the Minneapolis area at 2.1 percent, companies have increasingly turned to Emerge as a source of labor.\n\n\u201cWe see employers really knocking on the door of our organization in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in probably 20 years,\u201d Mr. Wynne said.\n\nAs employers dip deeper into the pool of available labor, workers are coming off the economy\u2019s sidelines. The participation rate for what economists call prime-age workers \u2014 those ages 25 to 54 \u2014 hit a seven-year high in December. Employment gains have been especially strong for groups that often face discrimination \u2014 unemployment for African-Americans fell to 6.8 percent in November, the lowest rate on record.\n\nAmy Glaser, a senior vice president for Adecco, a staffing firm, said that especially during the recent holiday season, there was a surge in demand for warehouse workers, creating opportunities for people who might have struggled to find work earlier in the economic recovery. Two years ago, Ms. Glaser said, companies required warehouse workers to have high school diplomas and experience with the scanners used to track merchandise. Now, increasingly, they require neither, she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an extreme escalation in the past 12 months,\u201d Ms. Glaser said. \u201cIf someone applies for a job and you don\u2019t get to them within 24 hours, that person will already have taken another job.\u201d\n\nEven during the strong economy that accompanied the housing boom of the mid-2000s, the unemployment rate never dropped below 4.4 percent, and the United States has never reached the point at which everyone who wanted a job could get one. Perhaps as a result, incomes were stagnant for many middle-class families, and many groups that have historically faced discrimination or other disadvantages in the labor market never experienced the full benefits of the strong economy.\n\nMany economists say the recovery still has a ways to go before rivaling that of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The unemployment rate has fallen nearly as far as it did in 2000, when it hit 3.8 percent. But millions of Americans still have part-time or temporary jobs, or are out of the labor force entirely. And parts of the country still bear the scars of the recession that officially ended nearly a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI think of the late \u201990s as having been a very healthy labor market,\u201d said Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \u201cWhen I look at the United States today, I think it has some room to grow in terms of achieving that kind of health.\u201d\n\nStill, household incomes have risen rapidly in the past two years, with the strongest gains coming for those in the poorest families. And there are signs that the tightening labor market is at last beginning to shift bargaining power from companies to workers. Ahu Yildirmaz, an economist who helps lead the research arm of the payroll-processing company ADP, said her firm\u2019s data showed more people switching jobs, and getting bigger bumps in pay for doing so.\n\nFor Mr. Forseth, the job at Stoughton Trailers was an opportunity to save money and prove his value. He even earned the Employee of the Month award \u2014 although, because he was still incarcerated, he couldn\u2019t take advantage of the parking spot that came with it.\n\nNow, however, he is thinking bigger. Other jobs in the area pay higher wages, and his freedom has opened up more options. He has been talking to another local company, which is interested in training him to become an estimator \u2014 a salaried job that would pay more and offer room for advancement.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying they\u2019re willing to teach someone that wants to learn,\u201d Mr. Forseth said. \u201cThat\u2019d be an actual career.\u201d", "title": "As Labor Pool Shrinks, Prison Time Is Less of a Hiring Hurdle", "authors": ["Ben Casselman"]}

Of the nearly 2,500 low-power stations in some stage of licensing, construction or active broadcast across the nation, more than 850 have a license holder with a religious affiliation.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany bigger stations, by contrast, are being programmed far from the cities they serve, with corporate budgets to buy transmitters that can then boost a signal beyond its home base. The low-power licenses are exclusively local, restricted to nonprofit groups that might have a civic cause \u2014 the South Philadelphia Rainbow Committee, for example \u2014 or were formed solely for the sake of a station and the dreams that fuel its existence.\n\nWashington has the second-highest concentration of them among the nation\u2019s 15 most populous states, with 68 stations for 7.4 million people, according to the Federal Communications Commission, second only to Florida. New York, by contrast, has 54 stations, but nearly three times Washington\u2019s population. Oregon \u2014 while not among the 15 most populous states, with 4.1 million people \u2014 is even more saturated than Washington and Florida; it has 80 low-power stations, most in rural areas.\n\nYou want weird? Just turn the dial. One station in Seattle invites listeners to phone their dreams and fantasies into a recorded line, then puts them on the air, at least the ones that don\u2019t raise concerns about F.C.C. indecency rules.\n\nRussian-speaking residents in Portland, Ore., have their own tiny station.\n\nAnd if you want be charmed by a 5-year-old boy chatting with his father at bedtime about dinosaurs, music and his sometimes bothersome sisters, you can find that at Tristan\u2019s Bedtime Radio Hour, broadcast on Sunday nights on KBFG in Northwest Seattle, where Tristan lives. It also streams on the web.\n\nHelp From Community Groups\n\nWhat low-power urban radio creates, believers say, is a sense of community, a defined physical stamp of existence that goes only as far as it can be heard. So new licensees and programmers are knocking on doors near their antennas and holding fund-raisers at the local brewpub. That\u2019s a stark contrast to the amorphous everywhere-but-nowhere world of the web, and the web-streaming radio or podcasts that a few years ago seemed most likely to take center stage in low-budget community communications.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen you start broadcasting, it\u2019s like you have a storefront,\u201d said Rebecca Webb, founder of the Portland Radio Project, KSFL 99.1, which broadcasts from two rooms above a closed silent-movie-era theater built around 1915. The station promises to play a Portland-area music group every 15 minutes, and in a time of media consolidation, Ms. Webb said, that\u2019s a political act.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have gathered ourselves up by our bootstraps and created a community radio station is in direct response to the ownership concentration of large media companies,\u201d she said.\n\nMany community groups with no money and often no experience in radio got help in starting their stations. A Seattle-based event ticketing company with a social mission in working with nonprofits allowed a staff organizer, Sabrina Roach, to help people manage the F.C.C. process with seminars, training and advice.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Oregon and California, a group called Common Frequency jumped in, especially in rural regions, helping people get licenses as they came available. In Philadelphia, the Prometheus Radio Project led a fight to get the F.C.C. to relax rules to allow more low-power FM stations, especially in urban markets, which big broadcasters had opposed.\n\nThe recent F.C.C. vote to end so-called net neutrality, under which internet users were guaranteed equal speed and access, might not directly affect small radio broadcasters that do not livestream. But advocates said the decision amplified the importance of small voices, however they are expressed.\n\n\u201cIf it gets harder for independent media to stream online, the low-power FM stations will become even more important,\u201d said Todd Urick, a radio engineer who helped lead Common Frequency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The otherwise nondescript spot is now marked with a plaque: \u201cPope Francis was born in this house.\u201d\n\nThe pope has not spoken at length about why he has not visited Argentina, which analysts attribute at least in part to a reluctance to get swept up in the country\u2019s polarized politics.\n\nIt is not that Francis has ignored South America, a region where the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s influence has been waning steadily in recent years.\n\nBy the end of his coming trip, the pontiff will have visited every country that borders Argentina, with the exception of Uruguay, plus three additional countries on the continent. He traveled to Brazil in 2013, Bolivia, Paraguay and Ecuador in 2015, Colombia last year and now Chile and Peru during a six-day trip that starts Monday.\n\nMany in Argentina have interpreted the pope\u2019s apparent snub as a decision to avoid contact with President Mauricio Macri. Francis did not crack a smile when he posed for a photo at the Vatican with the center-right politician in February 2016, shortly after Mr. Macri was sworn in.\n\nFrancis also had a tense relationship with former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her late husband and predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, while he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, often making thinly veiled criticisms about poverty and corruption. Ms. Kirchner and the pontiff appeared to reconcile after he moved to the Vatican.\n\nBut while he may avoid any awkward encounters with leaders in Argentina, the coming trip will still put the pontiff in some uncomfortable situations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Santiago, Francis is expected to face demonstrations for keeping Bishop Juan Barros as head of the Diocese of Osorno, 570 miles south of the capital, despite allegations he helped cover up a notorious case of clerical sexual abuse. Francis appointed him in January 2015 even though he was part of the inner circle of the Rev. Fernando Karadima, whom the Vatican found guilty of sexual abuse in 2011.\n\nFrancis called \u201cdumb\u201d the lay and religious organizations protesting in Osorno at the time.\n\n\u201cWe are not convinced that the pope has really assumed this zero tolerance policy on sexual abuses,\u201d said Juan Carlos Claret, 24, one of the organizers of the demonstrations. \u201cHe has showed infinite tolerance. Having all the power to do something, he prefers to remain ambiguous.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPeru will be no less thorny. Francis will almost certainly be asked to weigh in on President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski\u2019s politically explosive Christmas Eve pardon of former president Alberto Fujimori, which sparked nationwide protests. Besides that, the pope on Wednesday ordered a Vatican takeover of a Peruvian Catholic society, following claims that its founder sexually and physically abused members.\n\nSex abuse scandals are among the reasons millions of Latin Americans have turned away from the Catholic Church in recent years. In prosperous nations, including Chile and Uruguay, societies have become increasingly secular. In countries in the region troubled by violence, stark inequality and entrenched poverty like Brazil, evangelical denominations have cut deeply into the historical base of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe number of Chileans who described themselves as Catholic dropped from 74 percent in 1995 to 45 percent last year, according to a poll by Latinobar\u00f3metro.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But this time, Mrs. May faces the dilemma of whether to endorse Mr. Xi\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative \u2014 his expansive vision of ports, roads, railways and other infrastructure to spread Chinese trade and influence.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat project has unsettled some American and European policymakers, who worry it will be a vehicle for one-sided Chinese influence and interests. Britain has been cautious, but Mr. Xi has made it one of his signature international undertakings. Mrs. May said in Beijing that Britain would work with China on deciding how to cooperate on the initiative, while ensuring that it \u201cmeets international standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, China knows that Britain is pretty desperate for trade deals, so maybe she\u2019s trying to generate a bit of leverage of her own,\u201d said Dr. Foot of Oxford. \u201cSecondly, there\u2019s a genuine concern that involvement in \u2018Belt and Road\u2019 is not going to be open, essentially, to other companies and to other countries.\u201d\n\nMrs. May has also been pushed to raise what Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, called \u201cincreasing threats to basic freedoms\u201d in the city, which Britain returned to China in 1997 under a promise that Beijing would let it keep its civil liberties and legal autonomy for 50 years. Mr. Xi\u2019s government has tightened its grip on Hong Kong politics, publishing and news media, especially since the 2014 protests there over China\u2019s refusal to allow fully democratic elections in the city.\n\nIn a letter to Mrs. May this week, Mr. Patten and Paddy Ashdown, former leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, asked for assurances that Britain\u2019s growing commercial relationship with China would not \u201ccome at the cost of our obligations\u201d to the people of Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult to build up a broad base of interest in the subtle changes that have been going on in Hong Kong,\u201d Dr. Foot said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long time since the handover of 1997, so it\u2019s been very difficult against the weight of China\u2019s economic and political prominence.\u201d", "title": "As Theresa May Pursues Deals in China, Her Own Troubles Follow", "authors": ["Chris Buckley", "Stephen Castle"]}

The report makes clear that \u201cthat\u2019s not what we believe.\u201d\n\nYet some of the president\u2019s economic policies could actually harm the farm industry. New analyses of the tax law by economists at the Department of Agriculture suggest it could actually lower farm output in the years to come and effectively raise taxes on the lowest-earning farm households, while delivering large gains for the richest farmers.\n\nAnd the administration\u2019s trade policies continue to be a concern for farmers, who benefit from access to other markets, including by exporting their products. Mr. Trump continues to threaten to withdraw from trade pacts if other countries do not grant the United States a better deal, a position that has put him at odds with much of the farm industry.\n\n\u201cTrade has become an increasingly important and substantial part of the ag economy. So anything that causes a ripple in that can have not just little effects but significant effects,\u201d said Dale Moore, the executive director for public policy at the Farm Bureau.\n\nIndeed, part of the White House report Monday is expected to discuss global markets\u2019 importance to rural America.\n\nAgriculture has been the biggest beneficiary of pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which have allowed the United States to export grains and meat. In April, when the president came to the brink of withdrawing the United States from the pact, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue helped to dissuade him by showing him a map of the part of the country that would be hardest hit \u2014 farming states that also helped to elect Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cIt creates a lot of anxiety across all of agriculture, particularly the U.S. pulling out of Nafta,\u201d said Kevin Kester, a rancher in California and the president-elect of the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFarmers and ranchers like Mr. Kester worry that they are losing ground to foreign competitors, as major markets like Japan, Europe and Mexico push ahead with their own trade pacts. Although Mr. Trump has talked about forging new bilateral deals, the United States does not appear to be close to forming any.\n\nAmerican beef exporters are now at a big disadvantage in Japan, Mr. Kester said, after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that would have included Japan, and Japan signed a free-trade agreement that cut tariffs for Australian beef. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to talk to the Trump administration and urge them to get on the horse and get going with talks with Japan in particular,\u201d Mr. Kester said.\n\nNations like Canada are also beginning to export goods that have long been a staple of United States exports, such as lobster.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

On Thursday, a group of six Republican senators visited the White House to lobby the president on trade.\n\nPat Roberts, the senator from Kansas who led the delegation, said the president had \u201creally listened to our concerns\u201d and \u201cunderstands the difficulty farm country is going through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI delivered the message that farmers and ranchers need to grow export markets and maintain our status as a reliable supplier, more especially with Canada and Mexico in Nafta renegotiations,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.\n\nTrade analysts said these visits from farm state representatives and the president\u2019s trip to the Farm Bureau meeting were most likely the product of Nafta supporters inside the White House, who are trying to influence the president\u2019s views on trade. Yet there is no sign yet that these meetings have altered the president\u2019s long-held skepticism of Nafta.\n\n\u201cThe reports we\u2019re hearing is the message is being delivered,\u201d said Michael Dykes, the president of the International Dairy Foods Association, an industry lobbying group. However, he said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen anything visible to see that they\u2019re taking it on and changing course.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWithout existing free trade agreements, many agricultural products would face prohibitively high tariffs as they cross borders. Food is still one of the most protected products under global rules. Without free trade agreements, Mexico could raise its tariffs to up to 75 percent on American chicken and Idaho potatoes. South Korea could raise its tariffs to 40 percent on beef and 36 percent on cheese.\n\n\u201cI believe the president is genuine when he says he wants to take care of the folks in rural America. I think he\u2019s also hearing from rural America that, hey, Nafta is critical to agriculture,\u201d Mr. Dykes said. \u201cNafta is woven into the fabric of our business.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has positioned his tax overhaul, which lowers individual and corporate rates, as an economic salve for rural America, including farmers. The new law won support from farmers, but many warn that its benefits could be blunted by a protectionist approach to trade.\n\nStanley H. Ryan, the chief executive of Darigold, said the tax bill was \u201chelpful and supportive\u201d for businesses like his, a century-old dairy producer in Washington State. However, \u201cto get the full benefits of it, you\u2019ve got to have market access,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Farm Bureau endorsed both the House and Senate versions of the bill, and Mr. Trump signed a compromise measure into law in December. The final version included several provisions the bureau had championed, such as the ability for businesses to immediately deduct the cost of new investments. It also narrowed the number of households affected by the estate tax, a move the bureau praised even though it had pushed to eliminate the tax entirely.\n\nBut research presented on Friday in Philadelphia, at America\u2019s annual mega-gathering of economists, suggests the bill contains downsides for the industry in general and particularly for lower-income farmers.\n\nA model of the law\u2019s effects on farm households by Siraj G. Bawa and James M. Williamson, of the Agriculture Department\u2019s Economic Research Service, projects that 70 to 80 percent of the law\u2019s benefits will flow to the top 1 percent of farm households by income.\n\nThe law actually shrinks tax refunds for the lowest-earning 20 percent of farm households, Mr. Bawa said in a session hosted by the Agriculture and Applied Economics Association. The reason stems from a combination of changes in the bill, including its elimination of a tax break for domestic production.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe lowest quintile is actually getting a tax raise under this,\u201d Mr. Bawa said.\n\nA second paper, from Jayson Beckman and Munisamy Gopinath of the Agriculture Department and Marinos Tsigas of the United States International Trade Commission, projects that the law will reduce American farm production nearly 1 percent for primary agriculture, even though it reduces tax rates on farmers.\n\nThe reason, in part, is that the tax bill\u2019s favorable treatment of other sectors, such as construction and factories, could draw investment away from agriculture.\n\nThe authors suggest those reductions could be offset \u2014 if America could secure better access to foreign consumers through trade negotiations.", "title": "As Trump Appeals to Farmers, Some of His Policies Don\u2019t", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Jim Tankersley"]}

There\u2019s almost no hierarchy of detail or information because Tom doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s significant and what isn\u2019t. Everything is important, not only because the action is unspooling in real time but because in the first moments after his daughter\u2019s birth and the final moments of his partner\u2019s life, the most mundane detail is precious: \u201cHer ears, eyebrows, eyelashes, nose, and that little indentation in her skin by her right nostril, that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s still the same, but it\u2019s enough, it\u2019s Karin.\u201d\n\nThis is narrative as raw material. In a powerful translation by the novelist Henning Koch, there are sentences of precise and subtle lyricism. Describing Tom\u2019s newly born daughter, Malmquist writes: \u201cThe consultant is holding Livia by the legs, as if she\u2019s bleeding prey.\u201d Elsewhere the prose is unadorned, even blunt, particularly in the sections where the opaque languages of medicine and bureaucracy flood \u2014 infiltrate would be too weak a word \u2014 Tom\u2019s voice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA novel about permeability, \u201cIn Every Moment We Are Still Alive\u201d captures the jumbled sensory experience of being profoundly, catastrophically overwhelmed. Malmquist achieves much of this through style. The linguistic contagion results in moments of deep pathos, as when Tom struggles to locate the language to tell her parents that Karin is dead, only to fall back on medical terminology: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to articulate it so I just repeat what Nygren said to me: The electrical activity in Karin\u2019s heart has stopped.\u201d\n\nBook Review Rose McGowan on \u2018Brave\u2019 McGowan talks about her new memoir, and Katie Kitamura discusses Tom Malmquist\u2019s new novel, \u201cIn Every Moment We Are Still Alive.\u201d Audio\n\nTom is left with his grief and his newborn daughter. \u201cJersey Girl,\u201d a heartwarming 2004 movie about death starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, uses more or less the same setup. The comparison illustrates the degree to which this material risks clich\u00e9 and sentimentality. But if sentiment is emotion\u2019s easily digestible expression, simple to contain and designed not to trouble, it\u2019s clear that Malmquist is explicitly interested in what can\u2019t be contained, what continues to trouble.\n\nThis novel travels off the map and into that territory. It exchanges the schematic ease of the sentimental for the uncharted depths of the emotional. Toward the end, Tom says, \u201cI miss Karin,\u201d but until this point there\u2019s virtually no mention of his feelings. At its conclusion, Tom hasn\u2019t recovered, isn\u2019t even bereaved, but instead exists in a pit of emotion so acute as to be without \u201cmeaning.\u201d Watching his child at play and asleep, he confesses: \u201cI have never hated as I hate now, it has no direction, no meaning, and every time I try to understand it, attach words to it, define it, control it, I start crying so violently that I am afraid of waking her even if I am in a different room.\u201d\n\nWhat kind of emotional experience do we expect from a work of art? Once upon a time, we turned to art in search of catharsis, submitting to a rite of terror and purification, the workings of which were beyond our comprehension. But in the age of psychology and self-help, our expectations have shifted. Increasingly, we seek narratives that guide us through our fear, language that diagnoses and renders transparent, a timeline of redemption and resolution that\u2019s legible and coherent.\n\nPhoto\n\nMalmquist denies us that timeline. Even as he depicts the unpromising start of Karin and Tom\u2019s relationship, he utilizes the present tense: \u201cKarin has a friend with her when we meet that weekend in a bar on Odengatan. Helena is as tall as Karin, but slender. \u2026 Karin is unremarkable in comparison, and when they stand next to each other at the horseshoe-shaped bar and I can see their hips, Karin looks ungainly.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the novel, Karin emerges as a complex character, and the representation of her relationship with Tom is undistorted by either hindsight or nostalgia. This temporal collapse captures the nature of acute grief and trauma: It\u2019s not simply that Tom is unable to imagine a future without Karin, it\u2019s that he\u2019s unable to process the past as past. The effect is often jarring as disordered fragments from past and present are set against one another without signposts or connective tissue.

But perhaps the biggest departure from his fellow watchmakers was getting a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2002 from the Business School Lausanne, which he completed part time while working for a local maker of watch parts. Mr. Gauthier\u2019s graduation thesis was a business plan for his own brand, which he started three years later.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis focus was the creation of top-quality watches in very limited quantities, an orientation he has maintained as the business developed. Today, the Romain Gauthier brand makes only about 50 watches a year.\n\nMr. Gauthier introduced his first watch, the 41-millimeter Prestige HM (\u201chour, minute\u201d), at the 2007 Baselworld watch fair. Along with a movement made in-house, the watch had a flat winding crown on the back rather than the traditional location on the side of the case. Its placement made it easy to wind and suited both left- and right-hand wearers. The more traditional aspect of the watch was its off-center time indicator, set on a gold guilloch\u00e9 dial.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuch finishes \u2014 like hand-beveled bridges that require 20 hours of work or tiny screws topped with a special insignia \u2014 are Mr. Gauthier\u2019s signature, earning him something of a reputation in the industry. William Asprey, chairman of the London retailer William & Son, Mr. Gauthier\u2019s only British outlet, lauded the brand for its \u201cextraordinary finishing\u201d and \u201crare pieces that appeal to our clients.\u201d\n\nThe watchmaker also supplies high-end parts to outside houses, including Chanel. That relationship began in 2011, and included an investment that both businesses still decline to detail. (The relationship became public knowledge at the 2016 Baselworld fair, during Chanel\u2019s introduction of Monsieur, its first men\u2019s watch with an in-house movement.)\n\nMr. Gauthier\u2019s third watch, Logical One, won a Grand Prix d\u2019Horlogerie de Gen\u00e8ve award in 2013; the model addressed the longtime horological challenge of transferring constant energy via a chain-and-fus\u00e9e mechanism, a part that the watchmaker reconfigured for optimal reliability and consistency. The watch, now offered in white gold and in titanium, originally was produced in platinum and in red gold for 139,000 Swiss francs ($142,580 today) each, but those 20-piece limited editions sold out. (\u201cI have to borrow some Logical Ones from friends to show at S.I.H.H.,\u201d Mr. Gauthier said).\n\nPhoto\n\nDespite such accolades, Mr. Gauthier said that introducing his own brand would have been impossible without his M.B.A., something he says would be valuable for any of his peers in the independent watchmaking world. \u201cThe biggest challenge for a niche brand is to be professional,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big companies succeed because they take care of all points \u2014 not only developing and producing a watch but also promotion, communication, traveling the world and meeting clients. I\u2019ve had to learn about balancing my passion with business.\u201d\n\nInterest in such watches has been rising, driven by two key factors, said Sky Sit, who last summer established Skolorr, a website that sells only watches made by independents (it does not stock Romain Gauthier).\n\nOne is the so-called flight to quality, spurred by the recent industry downturn that created overstocks and led to heavy discounting of some big brands. \u201cWhen people saw discounts of 30 to 50 percent on watches, they began to question the value of major mainstream pieces,\u201d Ms. Sit said. \u201cIt was a light bulb moment: Watches by independents, with their exclusivity and smaller-scale production, have more intrinsic value.\u201d (Independents generally make from 30 to 300 pieces a year, compared with the hundreds of thousands produced by the largest brands.)\n\nAnd millennial buyers are the other factor. \u201cThey want something that not everyone has and which is more personal,\u201d Ms. Sit said. \u201cIt\u2019s the psychology of wanting to stand out. Social media is everything.\u201d\n\nThe industry seems to be taking note, too. S.I.H.H. has a space dedicated to independents, with the number of Carr\u00e9 des Horlogers exhibitors rising to 17 this year (there were nine in 2016). For small houses, the fair \u201cis a better way to efficiently and quickly target the most important actors in fine watchmaking worldwide,\u201d said Fabienne Lupo, the fair\u2019s managing director. And, she added, their presence \u201cbrings in some fresh air \u2014 and fresh air is always a benefit for everyone.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor his S.I.H.H. debut, Mr. Gauthier is introducing a women\u2019s watch (he has done feminine designs but as private commissions) drawn from the Insight Micro-Rotor collection he introduced at Baselworld last year. The models, at a unisex-sized 39.5 millimeters (about 1.5 inches), include the maison\u2019s first automatic movement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe red-gold women\u2019s watch features a visible bidirectional micro-rotor in 22-karat gold, and sparkles with 45 diamonds in different sizes. It also has a layered dial that is available in white mother-of-pearl from Australia or black, from Tahiti, paired with either a satin or rubber strap.\n\nThe watch, the Insight Micro-Rotor Lady, is priced at 83,000 Swiss francs and will be produced in limited editions of 10 pieces with each dial. Mr. Gauthier called it the \u201cperfect luxury daily watch\u201d as it doesn\u2019t need winding. \u201cYou just need to wear and enjoy it, and see beautiful things on your wrist.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

More than that would require not only more staff but also would compromise his vision to keep creating what he calls \u201clittle stars\u201d for collectors \u2014 small-quantity watches made of parts that take hours to craft and, when done, reflect knowledge and sophistication. \u201cThat is the real meaning of haute horology,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that growth is entirely off the agenda. Here Mr. Gauthier\u2019s business training rises, producing terms like ROI, investment, manufacture and R&D. \u201cIndependent means controlling your business \u2014 and risk \u2014 from the inside,\u201d he said. \u201cMy thinking was always to take the small road, not the highway.\u201d\n\nMr. Gauthier did hint that he may have his own boutique someday (he\u2019s stocked in only 11 retailers worldwide) and noted that the United States now accounts for about 40 percent of his sales. The ideal location? Los Angeles, of course.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m already talking with someone there.\u201d", "title": "As an Independent Watchmaker, Romain Gauthier Has His Own Ideas", "authors": ["Ming Liu"]}

The unit has now largely been pared back to its original purpose: financing for G.E. customers to buy the company\u2019s jet engines, power turbines, medical-imaging machines and other industrial equipment.\n\nOnly a few nonindustrial finance businesses remain within GE Capital. The newly disclosed trouble surfaced in one of those, a reinsurance unit, North American Life and Health, mainly because of the higher-than-expected cost of reinsuring long-term care policies sold by other insurers.\n\nAfter examining the trend in claims tied to such policies, G.E., working with the reinsurer\u2019s primary regulator, the Kansas Insurance Department, decided it needed to substantially increase its reserves for future payouts. Many of the policyholders are now 80 and older, an age when claims rise substantially.\n\nG.E. has agreed to add $15 billion to reserves for the business over the next seven years.\n\n\u201cThis is deeply disappointing,\u201d Mr. Flannery said in the conference call. He added that the anticipated costs were manageable, would be \u201ccontained within GE Capital\u201d and would have no effect on investment in the company\u2019s industrial businesses.\n\nStill, G.E. said, GE Capital would suspend dividend payments to the parent company for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d To conserve cash, Mr. Flannery cut G.E.\u2019s dividend last year, only the second time since the Depression that had happened.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In July, the company completed a merger of its oil and gas division with Baker Hughes into a separate company in which G.E. holds a 62.5 percent stake.\n\n\u201cOur results, over the past several years, including 2017, and the insurance charge only further my belief that we need to continue to move with purpose to reshape G.E.,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.\n\nThe scope of the insurance problem, and its seemingly sudden emergence, were reflected in sharp questions from analysts about the performance of G.E.\u2019s outside auditor, KPMG, and possible lapses by G.E. managers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nG.E. said it had used two outside auditors to assess the insurance obligations, and Jamie Miller, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that the G.E. board reviewed the selection of the company\u2019s auditor every year.\n\nThe company\u2019s scrutiny of its finance unit and other businesses is continuing. \u201cWe\u2019ve been scrubbing deeply,\u201d Mr. Flannery said.\n\n\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the insurance problem echoed those that cropped up in the company\u2019s power-generation business last year.

But the two announcements of deeper-than-anticipated troubles, they said, added to the uncertainty surrounding the company.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that Flannery seems to have cleared the deck,\u201d said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm. \u201cThe bad news is how do you trust anything now?\u201d", "title": "At G.E., $6.2 Billion Charge for Finance Unit Hurts C.E.O.\u2019s Turnaround Push", "authors": ["Steve Lohr", "Chad Bray"]}

On Thursday, as the snow piled up and winds strengthened, the Port Authority announced that Kennedy would temporarily shut down.

As late as 6:20 p.m., the Port Authority was still sending out tweets that it expected to reopen Kennedy that night. But an hour later, close to 7:30 p.m., the Port Authority decided to keep Kennedy closed until Friday morning. That meant that all of the flights bound for Kennedy had to divert to other airports or turn around.\n\nThe sudden, unplanned detouring of all of those planes set off a chain reaction that stretched to various continents and left Kennedy tied in knots for the next few days, with passengers stranded in overcrowded terminals and on planes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cVirtually no foreign airline canceled any flights into J.F.K.\u201d on Thursday, said Jason Rabinowitz, a freelance aviation blogger who tracked the cascading pileup as it played out. \u201cThey all launched their aircraft, but by the time they got halfway over the Atlantic, they found out they couldn\u2019t land at J.F.K.\u201d\n\nAs an example, Mr. Rabinowitz cited Iberia Flight 6253, which got halfway to New York from Madrid before making a U-turn and going back to Spain: an eight-hour fight to nowhere.

Each January, they would be met by high-minded reminders that the festival also nurtured talent, believed in story (a Sundance mantra) and embraced diversity. Those paying attention would notice that it generally made good on its principles with a slate that \u2014 good, dutiful or mediocre \u2014 was striking for its plurality of voices.\n\nAnd so this year, women were hot (not in a sexist, demeaning way, of course!) along with black filmmakers (again). Except that the festival and its parent organization, the Sundance Institute, have been pushing and advocating for filmmakers who are not white men for much of their history. In 1979, the year Robert Redford floated his plans for the institute, he spoke about diversity; he did so again this year. For the most part, the festival has been more invested in diversifying its filmmaker population than the kinds of movies it programs.

In a letter in response to questions from The New York Times, they said they had warned about the arrangement at Roseburg, where physicians are repeatedly overruled by administrators. \u201cWhen we voice concern that a process is dangerous and not good for patient care,\u201d they wrote, \u201cwe are met with the response that \u2018this is what the director wants.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot express strongly enough how detrimental this process has been for patient care and how unacceptable it would be anywhere else,\u201d the letter noted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe day after Mr. Savage was turned away, he showed up again asking for help. Again, he was denied. He waited for hours in the emergency room until a doctor finally admitted him against the wishes of the administration, his son-in-law said. The administration, ever mindful of metrics, moved him to a nursing home in less than 24 hours.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs began grading hospitals about four years ago based on 110 performance indicators such as wait times, infection rates and nurse turnover at its 1,200 hospitals and clinics.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd on the surface, the scrutiny appears to have paid off. In 2016, according to the department, 82 percent of facilities improved.\n\nEven Roseburg. For years, the hospital in this logging town, which had no intensive care unit and limited surgery facilities, has struggled with the challenges many rural hospitals face. It was hard to attract new doctors. A small staff meant that just one open position could create a pileup of delays. Doctors constantly left for higher-paying jobs outside the system.\n\nBut as more patients were sent away in recent years, Roseburg was recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs as one of the rising stars of its health care system.\n\nHowever, interviews with staff at the hospital suggest that some improvements were pure manipulation. And in some cases efforts to improve the rating actually made care worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a numbers game. The leadership has figured out the hospital can actually do better by seeing less patients,\u201d said Dr. Steven Blum, a hospitalist there who said he has seen patients regularly turned away or transferred to private hospitals. \u201cThese numbers show up on the director\u2019s report card, so it is very important they look good.\u201d\n\nOn average, more than half the hospital\u2019s beds now sit empty, he said, while patients are either sent home or transferred to private hospitals at government expense. Costly transfers don\u2019t come out of the Roseburg budget, but they do protect the hospital by moving risk to other facilities\u2019 books.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the few patients who are admitted to Roseburg, other tactics are used to further improve the ratings. The hospital is penalized when patients are hospitalized with congestive heart failure, because it counts as a sign of poor preventive care. So, doctors said, they are told to list it as hypervolemia, a condition that occurs when there is too much fluid in the blood, a diagnosis that isn\u2019t tracked and hides the problem.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnother penalty is assessed for deaths in the hospital or within 30 days of discharge. To avoid counting these, doctors and nurses say, the administration regularly persuades veterans to be admitted only as hospice patients, signaling they are terminal and don\u2019t want treatment. Often neither is true. Doctors said some veterans were switched to hospice without their knowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely unethical, extremely,\u201d Dr. Blum said. \u201cI was asked to do it and so were the emergency department doctors. And we refused, so the administration just did it.\u201d\n\nThe focus on improving scores overshadowed deep-seated problems, staff said, including crippling turnover in primary care doctors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She resigned in 2016.\n\nDangerous gaps appeared when doctors ordering critical tests were no longer around to review the results and alert patients. Several nurses said they saw positive cancer screening alerts and other critical lab results languish for weeks or even months.\n\n\u201cAlerts go into Neverland,\u201d said Treva Moss, a nurse who works in the medical center\u2019s specialty clinic in Eugene, Ore.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis fall, a number of employees complained to their congressman, Peter DeFazio, who blasted the hospital management on the floor of the House of Representatives as \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d At his request, the department is conducting an investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRoseburg\u2019s decision to cloak deficiencies by manipulating metrics is part of a persistent problem that reaches beyond one rural hospital, said Dr. Michael Mann, a professor of surgery at the University of California, San Francisco who led the thoracic surgery program at the San Francisco veterans hospital for eight years.\n\nAttempts to track performance in the veterans health care system have repeatedly created perverse outcomes, he said. He pointed out that the 2014 scandal exposing hidden wait times for veterans arose only after the department began tracking whether medical appointments were scheduled within 14 days, and veterans hospitals across the country that could not meet the goal began keeping off-the-books lists to hide actual wait times.\n\nDuring Dr. Mann\u2019s tenure, the veterans department began ranking hospitals on surgical complications. Remarkably, complications across the nationwide system dropped steadily, decreasing 47 percent between 1997 and 2007.\n\n\u201cOf course quality had not really improved by that much,\u201d Dr. Mann said. \u201cPeople had just learned to make it appear that it had.\u201d\n\nMany hospitals simply stopped performing surgeries on high-risk patients, or cut high-risk procedures all together, Dr. Mann said. \u201cI\u2019m very ashamed. I colluded. I was told not to operate and pulled back, and at least one of my patients died because of it.\u201d\n\nThe vast health care system has little choice but to rely on metrics, said David J. Shulkin, the veterans affairs secretary.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWithout it we\u2019re like an airport with no air traffic control,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where our hospitals are, we don\u2019t know where they are headed. All we can do is respond to the crashes. I\u2019d rather be able to look ahead and prevent them.\u201d\n\nThe department regularly audits hospitals, he said. But the Government Accountability Office raised doubts in a report this fall noting in many cases the data seems inaccurate but the central office \u201chas not determined the extent to which these problems exist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2014, when Mr. Paxton took over Roseburg, he vowed to turn around a hospital that had long ranked one of the worst in the system. He added staff, tried to cut inefficiencies, and tapped his new chief of mental health, a social worker by training named Paul Beiring, to figure out how to improve metrics.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Beiring said focusing on hospital admissions was strategic because it accounted for a big slice of the rating.\n\n\u201cIt is weighted really high, so we knew we had to optimize that measure,\u201d he said.\n\nThe medical center created an \u201cexclusion list\u201d of conditions deemed too severe for Roseburg and put in place a \u201cutilization management team\u201d of administrators to approve hospital admissions using a risk analysis score.\n\nDoctors were required to call an off-site nurse to ask permission to admit a patient. Patients who had a high risk of death \u2014 usually because of advanced age \u2014 were routinely transferred to other hospitals or sent home. Even low-risk patients that Roseburg could easily have cared for, such as people with pneumonia, were denied, doctors said.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Veterans Affairs said Roseburg was not manipulating data, adding: \u201cAll admission decisions are based on the hospital\u2019s ability to provide the care patients require and are made by clinicians, including the facility chief of staff and her clinical chiefs of service \u2014 nonclinical administrators have nothing to do with these decisions.\u201d\n\nThe hospital has no plans to change its admitting practices. In November, Roseburg was demoted to one star, because of what Mr. Beiring called \u201ca death or two\u201d but he said it was a temporary setback and the hospital had already \u201cdeployed counter measures\u201d that would soon send its ratings up again.\n\nOne of those measures, doctors said, appears to be that admissions have become ever more strict.", "title": "At Veterans Hospital in Oregon, a Push for Better Ratings Puts Patients at Risk, Doctors Say", "authors": ["Dave Philipps"]}

For him, everything in Denver is new: \u201crunning water, appliances, grocery stores, snow.\u201d\n\nWilliams worries about Iraqi sisters Jakleen and Mariam, daughters of a Christian father and Muslim mother; their father worked for the Americans, and then disappeared in Baghdad as sectarian violence erupted during the American troop drawdown. With their mother and a third sister, the girls spent six years in a Damascus suburb, missed a year of school because of car bombs and are now barely able to get to school on time.\n\nMethusella and Solomon, teenage boys from the Democratic Republic of Congo, were driven out of Goma with their family. The brothers show up at South High School on time every day, \u201calways nicely dressed,\u201d bending over their work with laser focus.\n\nThorpe gets to know some of the parents, like Methusella and Solomon\u2019s father, a dignified man wearing a collared shirt and navy trousers, working as a dishwasher and studying English out of a creased pocket dictionary he bought at Goodwill for a dollar. He speaks four languages including French, and when he sees dents in American houses, he must remind himself they are not caused by bullet holes, like the dents in houses back home.\n\nThorpe went deep, hiring 14 translators to conduct repeated interviews. Jakleen shares a letter she wrote to her father. Thorpe runs her hands over the Arabic letters on the page, and it\u2019s \u201clike reading Braille inversely,\u201d because the girl pressed so hard with her pen. Still, some of their sad secrets stay buried. Hsar Htoo asks Thorpe before she interviews him not to ask him about his father\u2019s death. She also never really unravels how the unaccompanied Salvadoran children, fleeing one of the hemisphere\u2019s most violent nations, survived harrowing cross-border trips and made their way from federal detention facilities to Denver.\n\nA year is a long time in teenage years, and frustration mounts. Some of the students are multilingual, and feel smarter than their lack of English allows. The Iraqi girls are so depressed they barely show up for school in the winter, racking up absences. The school encourages them with success stories. Thorpe\u2019s Arabic translator tells the girls that she raised her three children in America, and that they too hated it when they first arrived. Today, one is an engineer, another is a pediatric dentist, and the third is studying medicine.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThorpe makes fascinating linguistic discoveries. At first, the newcomers can\u2019t even communicate with one another. As the weeks pass, they resort to Google Translate, sometimes bypassing English altogether. Watching them translate Swahili to Arabic and Portuguese, Thorpe notices cognates between Arabic and the African languages, remnants of ancient connections between two regions that to many Americans are as unfamiliar as the dark side of the moon.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cAs the kids discovered these commonalities, I began to feel as though I were watching something like the living embodiment of a linguistic tree,\u201d Thorpe writes. \u201cThe classroom and the relationships forming inside of it were an almost perfect map of language proximity around the globe.\u201d\n\nThorpe has an epiphany of sorts when she learns that the word for \u201cbook\u201d is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d in the African languages and in Arabic. \u201cThat was the moment when I first grasped my own arrogance as an English speaker,\u201d Thorpe writes. \u201cI mean, the arrogance harbored by someone who knew only European languages, which rendered the well-laced interconnectedness of the rest of the world invisible.\u201d\n\nIn class, the teenagers are like teenagers everywhere. They are dramatic, they preen, they get depressed, they fall in love. One day, the students teach Thorpe a word \u2014 qalb \u2014 meaning \u201cheart\u201d in Farsi and Arabic. When Thorpe puts qalb into Google Translate, Arabic to English, something surprising happens. She is given a flood of meanings. \u201cI got heart, center, middle, transformation, conscience, core, marrow, pith, pulp, gist, essence, quintessence, topple, alter, flip, tip, overturn, reversal, overthrow, capsize, whimsical, capricious, convert, change, counterfeit. \u2026 My own concept of heart did not include flip, capsize or reverse.\u201d She concludes: \u201cOur two cultures did not have the same idea of what was happening at the core of our beings. \u2026 The idea of heart that these kids possessed appeared to have a lighter, more nimble quality.\u201d\n\nBut no matter how nimble and light their hearts might be, the students can\u2019t help noticing the rising resentment aimed their way. \u201cXenophobia was not something that was listed formally as a factor that inhibited learning among E.L.A. students,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut as the weeks slipped by and the cacophony of the presidential election ratcheted up, elevating all kind of sentiments in the voting populace, including a virulent dislike of people from other countries, I came to think of the fear some people in my own country felt toward foreigners as an issue that itself inhibited the newcomers\u2019 learning.

The principal brings on nine temporary counselors to help, because the number of children seeking counseling \u201creached levels that nobody had ever seen before.\u201d Two students had attempted suicide.\n\nNevertheless, Thorpe\u2019s book is a reminder that in an era of nativism, some Americans are still breaking down walls and nurturing newcomers, the seeds of the great American experiment.", "title": "At a Public School in Denver, Refugee Children Find Hope and Frustration", "authors": ["Nina Burleigh", "Helen Thorpe"]}

Championship Game in which the Packers outlasted the Cowboys at Lambeau Field in conditions where the wind chill reached about minus 36 degrees Fahrenheit. But that game is compelling only as lore. In the moment, it was virtually unwatchable and barely even resembled football. During the game, the Packers quarterback Bart Starr got frostbite in his fingers; the linebacker Ray Nitschke\u2019s frostbite was so awful, his toenails fell off. The marching band in attendance couldn\u2019t play because the woodwinds froze.\n\nAfter whistling for kickoff, the referee Norm Schachter realized that his whistle was stuck to his lips; when he tried to remove it, the skin ripped from his mouth. (The refs stopped using their whistles after that and communicated by screaming for play to stop.) A fan in the stands died. This was not football. This was simply a bunch of men trying not to freeze to death. And yet the game is still talked about as a classic decades later, to the detriment not just of the men and women who play, but of the pleasure of the fans who watch them.\n\nWeather does not enhance the enjoyment of sports; it stands in the way. We watch sports to see a great quarterback throw a perfect pass to win the big game; we do not watch the ball hit a stiff wind and flutter like a wounded duck.

On Monday, she took the initiative from the baseline repeatedly and returned serve with aplomb to defeat Williams for the first time in five matches.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I played a bad match,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe just played above and beyond.\u201d\n\nThe next high-profile American to lose was CoCo Vandeweghe, the No. 10 seed and a semifinalist here last year, who was upset, 7-6 (4), 6-2, in Hisense Arena by Timea Babos, a Hungarian veteran with a serve nearly as big as Vandeweghe\u2019s.\n\nVandeweghe later said she had been suffering from the flu, which had affected her preparation for the tournament\n\n\u201cIn women\u2019s tennis, I think we see it: Anything can happen when there is no Serena Williams,\u201d Babos said.\n\nEven without Serena Williams, the American women have had considerable success in the past year. On Monday, however, they were 1-9 collectively, with the only victory coming in the hinterlands of Court 22 from Nicole Gibbs, the former Stanford star who was also the last direct entry into the main draw.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSome of the girls who had tough matches earlier today were kind of ribbing me in the locker room before I went on, saying \u2018You need to hold it down for our country today,\u2019 so no pressure,\u201d Gibbs said.\n\nShe went on to defeat Viktoriya Tomova, a Bulgarian who made it into the tournament as a lucky loser, by 6-1, 6-1.\n\nReferring to the three U.S. Open semifinalists who lost before she took the court, Gibbs said, \u201cObviously that speaks volumes to the depth, especially on the WTA Tour, so I think it\u2019s just a tough game, and it\u2019s tough to stay on top repeatedly.\u201d\n\nTwo of the three top-ranked American men \u2013 Jack Sock and John Isner \u2013 also lost on Monday. Sock, who broke into the top 10 last year and qualified for the elite ATP World Tour Finals in London, was upset, 6-1, 7-6 (4), 5-7, 6-3, by the Japanese veteran Yuichi Sugita.\n\nPhoto\n\nSock said his surprising late-season surge has played a role in his downbeat start to 2018 (he also lost a lopsided opening match in Auckland, New Zealand where he was defending champion).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a weird feeling because you are on the highest of highs after making it,\u201d he said of London. \u201cYou go home, and you\u2019re all excited and it\u2019s Thanksgiving with your family and then in your head, you\u2019re like, \u2018Well I only have a couple weeks to train and get ready and then it\u2019s kind of back to reality and the grind of it.\u2019\u201d\n\nKevin Anderson, a surprise finalist at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, was also defeated on day one, losing in five sets to Kyle Edmund of Britain. But Rafael Nadal, the No. 1 seed who defeated Anderson in that U.S. Open final, had no such concerns in his first official match of 2018, defeating Victor Estrella Burgos, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After an 11-month injury layoff, she roared back to win her first major singles title in New York shortly after returning to action. Since then, Stephens has lost eight straight matches.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to dwell on it just because I lost eight matches in a row and say, \u2018Oh winning the U.S. Open, it\u2019s haunting me now,\u2019\u201d Stephens said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cYou know, before I would get so upset about what people would write and say things about me on TV and blah, blah, blah \u2014 and now it\u2019s like, yeah, who cares? I won a Grand Slam. I\u2019m going through a tough time. Who cares?\n\n\u201cNo one cares about my life. I\u2019m just having fun. I\u2019m enjoying it. There\u2019s too much emphasis on the bad things that happen after something really great happens.\u201d\n\nSix other American women also lost on Monday: the youngsters CiCi Bellis, Taylor Townsend, Sofia Kenin and Jennifer Brady, as well as the veterans Alison Riske and Irina Falconi.\n\nBut the most prominent American to fall was the fifth-ranked Venus Williams, who last year reached the finals of the Australian Open and Wimbledon. She was defeated in Melbourne last year by her sister Serena Williams, who was two months pregnant at the time.\n\nSerena Williams, who gave birth to a daughter in September, has not played another tour-level match since that victory, while Venus Williams has continued to excel and even talk about playing until the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nBut Bencic, 17 years Venus Williams\u2019s junior, is a remarkable talent. She was not yet born the last time no Williams sister reached the second round of the Australian Open. That was in 1997, but Bencic ensured it happened this year by playing a poised and aggressive match. She is now one of the few to have defeated both Williams sisters in singles (she upset Serena Williams in the final of the Rogers Cup in 2015 before experiencing injury issues).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cObviously yeah, the first reaction of everyone was like, \u2018Oh bad luck, bad luck,\u2019\u201d said Bencic of being drawn to face Venus Williams.\n\nBut she said she adopted a different approach than in her previous defeats to Venus. \u201cFor the first matches, I think I had a little bit too much respect, played a little bit careful and safe,\u201d Bencic said. \u201cThis time I really tried to come out and hit it big, also tactically be smart on the court. It\u2019s really tough to play her. You really have to be on the limit of your game. You have to come out with everything you have.\u201d\n\nStephens has been troubled by a knee issue, but her confidence also has seemed to be a factor. And though she served for the match at 5-4 in the second set on Monday, she was unable to close it out.\n\nIt all amounted to a major mood swing from September in New York: a shift also represented by Stephens\u2019s coach, Kamau Murray, normally a gifted and expansive communicator who walked out of Margaret Court Arena wearing a pained expression before delivering a series of remarkably curt answers to questions.\n\nIs the issue more mental or physical for Stephens at the moment?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see; we\u2019ll see,\u201d Murray said, as he headed for the staircase.", "title": "Australian Open: Within Hours, Top Americans Fall", "authors": ["Christopher Clarey"]}

{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cThe market is pretty saturated right now,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com. She noted that there were now 1.26 vehicles on the road for every licensed driver, more than ever.\n\nThe downward sales trend is the latest challenge for the industry. Tariffs could be imposed on cars made in Mexico and Canada if the Trump administration negotiates major changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Manufacturers are also trying to push ahead with self-driving and electric vehicles even as it remains unclear how many they will be able to sell, and when.\n\nThe effect of rising fuel prices is also a question mark. Though still low by the standards of recent years, prices at the pump were $2.49 a gallon for regular gas on Wednesday compared with $2.35 a year ago, according to AAA.\n\nThe seven-year stretch of growth from 2010 to 2016 is the longest since the infancy of the automobile nearly a century ago, according to the automotive publisher WardsAuto. It was born out of one of the industry\u2019s darkest periods: the deep recession that prompted federally backed bankruptcy reorganizations of General Motors and Chrysler. At the low point, 2009, new-car sales plunged to fewer than 11 million a year.\n\nAs sales climbed over the past seven years, carmakers had to worry little about keeping their plants humming. Now they are faced with the prospect of trimming production and finding ways to entice customers to buy the vehicles that are rolling off the assembly line.\n\nSlowdown Last Year Domestic sales of light vehicles declined in 2017 for the first time since the financial crisis to 17.2 million from 17.6 million in 2016.

At some point, further increases in sales incentives could hurt manufacturers\u2019 profits, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are deep into a push market,\u201d in which consumers have to be lured with deals rather than driven by a strong need or desire for a new car, Mr. Wakefield said.\n\nDespite last year\u2019s decline, domestic auto sales remain at a historically healthy level. And worldwide sales are still on the rise: The research firm IHS Markit estimated that global light vehicle sales rose 1.5 percent in 2017, to 93.5 million cars and trucks.\n\nAmericans tend to favor cars when gas prices are high, and trucks when prices are low, but this time the shift to trucks has been compounded by an increasing preference for taller, roomier vehicles. That has forced carmakers in recent years to shift the production mix rapidly to emphasize sport-utility vehicles, minivans and light trucks.\n\nThe December Sales Picture DECEMBER 2017 SALES CHANGE MARKET SHARE % 308,539 240,910 222,985 171,946 149,317 138,226 63,594 63,342 57,652 43,039 \u2013 3.3 + 1.3 \u2013 8.3 \u201310.7 \u2013 7.0 \u2013 9.5 + 2.1 \u2013 0.3 \u2013 5.4 \u201320.8 % 19.2 15.0 13.9 10.7 9.3 8.6 4.0 4.0 3.6 2.7 GENERAL MOTORS FORD MOTOR TOYOTA FIAT CHRYSLER HONDA NISSAN HYUNDAI SUBARU VOLKSWAGEN KIA\n\nIn December, passenger cars made up just one-third of the market. \u201cIn 2012, cars were over 50 percent,\u201d said Ms. Caldwell, the Edmunds analyst. \u201cThat\u2019s a big shift in a short period of time.\u2019\u2019\n\nSales at General Motors last month reflected that shift. The company had a strong December in trucks, selling more than 94,000 full-size pickups between its Chevrolet and GMC brands, almost one-third of its total sales. But its overall sales still fell 3.3 percent from the previous December, as cars like the Chevy Malibu and Impala languished on dealer lots.\n\nFor the full year, G.M.\u2019s sales declined 1.3 percent, to 3 million vehicles. At the Detroit auto show, which kicks off later this month, G.M. will unveil redesigns of its full-size pickups.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles also had a tough month, with sales declining 10.7 percent. Fiat Chrysler has stopped making small and mid-sized cars, and trucks account for 85 percent of its sales total. But a push to cut back on incentives and sales to rental fleets have slowed the company. Total sales for 2017 dropped 8 percent, to 2.1 million vehicles.\n\nFord Motor, the second largest American automaker after G.M., was one of the few manufacturers to report a rise for December, with sales increasing 1.3 percent. Like G.M., Ford had a big month in pickups, selling more than 89,000 of its F-series models.\n\nBut for the full year, Ford couldn\u2019t buck the market\u2019s trend.

The woman is merely acted upon.\n\nAll of this put me in mind of another article published this weekend, this one by the novelist and feminist icon Margaret Atwood. \u201cMy fundamental position is that women are human beings,\u201d she writes. \u201cNor do I believe that women are children, incapable of agency or of making moral decisions. If they were, we\u2019re back to the 19th century, and women should not own property, have credit cards, have access to higher education, control their own reproduction or vote. There are powerful groups in North America pushing this agenda, but they are not usually considered feminists.\u201d\n\nExcept, increasingly, they are.\n\nThe article in Babe was met with digital hosannas by young feminists who insisted that consent is consent only if it is affirmative, active, continuous and \u2014 and this is the word most used \u2014 enthusiastic. Consent isn\u2019t the only thing they are radically redefining. A recent survey by The Economist/YouGov found that approximately 25 percent of millennial-age American men think asking someone for a drink is harassment. More than a third of millennial men and women say that if a man compliments a woman\u2019s looks it is harassment.\n\nTo judge from social media reaction, they also see a flagrant abuse of power in this sexual encounter. Yes, Mr. Ansari is a wealthy celebrity with a Netflix show. But he had no actual power over the woman \u2014 professionally or otherwise. And lumping him in with the same movement that brought down men who ran movie studios and forced themselves on actresses, or the factory-floor supervisors who demanded sex from female workers, trivializes what #MeToo first stood for.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this woman had this experience. I too have had lousy romantic encounters, as has every adult woman I know. I have regretted these encounters, and not said anything at all. I have regretted them and said so, as she did. And I know I am lucky that these unpleasant moments were far from being anything approaching assault or rape, or even the worst night of my life.\n\nBut the response to her story makes me think that many of my fellow feminists might insist that my experience was just that, and for me to define it otherwise is nothing more than my internalized misogyny.\n\nThere is a useful term for what this woman experienced on her night with Mr. Ansari. It\u2019s called \u201cbad sex.\u201d It sucks.\n\nThe feminist answer is to push for a culture in which boys and young men are taught that sex does not have to be pursued as if they\u2019re in a pornographic film, and one in which girls and young women are empowered to be bolder, braver and louder about what they want. The insidious attempt by some women to criminalize awkward, gross and entitled sex takes women back to the days of smelling salts and fainting couches.

When the BBC asked all employees with complaints to come forward, it resulted in 298 cases in all.\n\nMr. Hall said the BBC had resolved 117 of those cases, most of them involving pay for women.\n\nLast week, the BBC said it was reducing the salaries of several male journalists. Then on Tuesday, it published a further review, of the salaries of 824 on-air staff, which also found no evidence of gender bias in pay decisions.\n\nStill, the report noted that there were more men than women in the upper half of pay distribution, and that pay for the highest-profile employees, most of them men, needed to be adjusted.\n\nThe BBC said that it would address these issues and institute \u201csubstantial pay cuts\u201d for some men, while increasing pay for some male and female presenters.\n\nA group of 170 women at the BBC said in a submission to Parliament that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the review\u2019s conclusions, saying they had not been consulted.\n\nSome of these women detailed their experiences in the document, which was submitted to the parliamentary group, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.

All told, those institutions account for about half of the companies that have promised raises or bonuses since President Trump signed the bill into law, according to a running list by Americans for Tax Reform, a group that advocates low taxes.\n\nThe payouts to workers reflect a small slice of the windfall that banks large and small are in line to receive. The law includes a reduction in the corporate rate to 21 percent from a high of 35 percent last year, as well as a 20 percent deduction for income from pass-through companies. One-third of all community banks are organized as pass-throughs, according to the Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents those firms and was among the groups pushing for a lower pass-through rate.\n\nAnalysts projected the financial industry would reap some of the largest benefits from that reduction given that banks typically paid much higher effective tax rates in the past than many other industries, like manufacturing.\n\nThe boon for banks comes as the industry begins to regain some of its swagger in the wake of the financial crisis and as it seeks to roll back some of the post-crisis regulations put in place by the Obama administration under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.\n\nOfficials at top banks have mostly showered Mr. Trump with praise for his economic policy agenda, which they say is expanding growth.

Mr. Bannon was soon ousted as the executive chairman of the hard-right website Breitbart News.\n\nSome legal experts said the subpoena could be a sign that the investigation was intensifying, while others said it might simply be a negotiating tactic to persuade Mr. Bannon to cooperate with the investigation. The experts also said it could be a signal to Mr. Bannon, who has tried to publicly patch up his falling-out with the president, that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s legal threats, Mr. Bannon must be completely forthcoming with investigators.\n\nProsecutors generally prefer to interview witnesses before a grand jury when they believe they have information that the witnesses do not know, or when they think they might catch the witnesses in a lie. It is much easier for a witness to stop the questioning or sidestep questions in an interview than during grand jury testimony, which is transcribed, and witnesses are required to answer every question.\n\n\u201cBy forcing someone to testify through a subpoena, you are providing the witness with cover because they can say, \u2018I had no choice \u2014 I had to go in and testify about everything I knew,\u2019\u201d said Solomon L. Wisenberg, a prosecutor for the independent counsel that investigated Bill Clinton when he was president.\n\nSignificant grand jury activity may undermine the case that White House officials have made for months: that they believe the inquiry is coming to an end and are convinced that the president will be cleared. Mr. Mueller has told Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers that he will probably want to question the president before the investigation concludes, but no interview has been scheduled.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Bannon has limited firsthand knowledge about two key issues within Mr. Mueller\u2019s purview \u2014 the president\u2019s firing of James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, a decision made without Mr. Bannon present, and the drafting of a misleading statement about the subject of the June 2016 meeting with Russians, in which they promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut even Mr. Bannon\u2019s secondhand knowledge could be used to draw a contrast with statements from people with firsthand knowledge whom Mr. Mueller has already interviewed. And Mr. Bannon was directly involved in a number of other major moments, including the decision-making around the firing of Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, who was dismissed after he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition.\n\nMr. Bannon also helped run the transition after Chris Christie, now the former governor of New Jersey, was fired as head of that team. And he was the chief executive of the Trump campaign in October 2016 when WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of stolen personal emails from the hacked account of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.\n\nVideo\n\nIn \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d Mr. Bannon was quoted by the author, Michael Wolff, as suggesting that Donald Trump Jr.; the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner; and Paul Manafort, his campaign chairman at the time, were \u201ctreasonous\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d for attending the meeting with Russians at Trump Tower. Mr. Bannon said he believed there was \u201czero\u201d chance that the younger Mr. Trump did not take them to meet his father, who has said he knew nothing about the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor \u2014 with no lawyers,\u201d Mr. Bannon said in the book.\n\nMr. Trump erupted in anger after the excerpts were published, calling Mr. Bannon \u201cSloppy Steve\u201d on Twitter and saying he had \u201ccried when he got fired and begged for his job.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cToo bad!\u201d\n\nDays after the excerpts were published, a statement was issued in Mr. Bannon\u2019s name in which he tried to back away from his assertions in the book. He said that his reference to treason was aimed at Mr. Manafort, not the president\u2019s son. Mr. Bannon did not apologize, however, and though he had approved the statement, an associate sent it to reporters without his knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe president appeared to ease his anger toward Mr. Bannon at the end of last week.

Burck of the Washington office of the Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan law firm to represent him in the defamation threats from Mr. Trump and the congressional inquiries.

There are four home-based workers in my group, and others in satellite offices away from headquarters. We communicate primarily via email and text messages, or sometimes by phone. Six months ago, the manager who hired me was abruptly transferred. A few months after that, her replacement announced with great fanfare that our unit would now have monthly team meetings, which we remote workers would attend by videoconference. But an hour before the first meeting, the new manager told each of the home-based workers that an emergency had arisen and she had to cancel the meeting.

On the other hand, Mr. Bloomberg routinely splurged on carbon usage by deploying his personal fleet of carbon-inefficient private jets and helicopters for long-distance travel. He would use them to fly to a weekend home in Bermuda, for instance, or to Europe. In an episode so rich you could choke on it, Mr. Bloomberg brought an entourage aboard his personal Falcon 900 to Copenhagen, at a cost in carbon emissions that was 37 times more than if the group had flown commercial.\n\nThe reason for the trip? Mr. Bloomberg was speaking at a conference on climate change.\n\nIn New York, the police regard S.U.V.s as the most prudent for moving and protecting the mayor, and no one should begrudge any officials the security they need to carry out the work they do on behalf of the public. That goes for their recreation, at least for mayors, who put in long hours. At some point, every last one of them winds up splutteringly frayed or fried, so getting to a favorite gym probably helps keep Mr. de Blasio from losing his mind.\n\nJust because it is easier to deplore hypocrisy in others than in ourselves does not make any of us immune to it.

Founded in 2016 by Robert Rosenheck, who has a branding background, and his wife, Cindy Capobianco, who has led public relations for Banana Republic and marketing for Gap, it is a leader in a movement to make marijuana more attractive to a mainstream audience. The packaging, with a baronial crest and gold accents, would look at home in a fashionable department store. That celebrities use the products adds additional cachet.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe closer we get to de-stigmatizing cannabis, the better it is for all,\u201d Ms. Capobianco said.\n\nThat sentiment is shared by upstarts including Cannuka, a line of topical products containing CBD and manuka honey; Khus & Khus, a skin- and body-care line by the ayurvedic specialist Kristi Blustein; and Vertly, a line of lip balm by Claudia Mata, a former W magazine accessories editor, which is introducing body care this year. And beauty lines, including Malin & Goetz and Boy Smells, make reference to cannabis in their products purely for the scent.\n\nFor example, Boy Smells has a cannabis-scented candle called Kush. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that having a cannabis candle is a little provocative, but I personally love the flavor and smell of cannabis,\u201d said Matthew Herman, a founder, who previously worked for the fashion labels Giles Deacon, Proenza Schouler and Zac Posen. \u201cIt has a wet earth smell that is very attractive.\u201d\n\nMr. Herman also noted that the cannabis industry is undergoing a makeover. \u201cA lot of my friends have been getting their products from more \u2018luxury\u2019 cannabis suppliers who are focusing on packaging and branding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like pot is new, but for a long time you had to go to a head shop and buy a cheesy pipe. It was always a little gnarly. Now it\u2019s fun to see modern, minimal, elevated designs.\u201d\n\nBut looks are one thing, efficacy is another. As CBD oil seeks to go mainstream, it\u2019s tough to tell which products hold up to scrutiny. \u201cI get sent a million different brands saying they have CBD, and the stuff doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Ms. Richards said.\n\nThat\u2019s because there is confusion in the marketplace, said Verena von Pfetten, a onetime Lucky digital editor and a founder of Gossamer, a publication dedicated to the chic side of cannabis culture. \u201cThe cannabis plant is complex with many compounds,\u201d Ms. von Pfetten said. \u201cCBD is one of them, and THC is one of them.\u201d\n\nThere are studies, she said, showing that for pain relief, CBD works best within the plant\u2019s cannabinoid system, meaning that combinations of compounds are more effective than isolated ones. That\u2019s termed the \u201centourage effect,\u201d and Lord Jones, for one, has sought to compensate for it by using CBD rendered from the entire hemp plant.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Hemp is a type of cannabis that has had the THC largely bred out of it. It\u2019s legal across state lines, so only CBD derived from hemp can be distributed nationally. There is a lot less CBD and other cannabinoids in hemp than in cannabis strains that contain THC.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the levels of active ingredient in hemp are so low that, though CBD definitely offers benefits, there might not be a wake-up-and-feel-it moment,\u201d Ms. von Pfetten said.\n\nNone of that is stopping companies from expanding beyond wellness into skin care. Lord Jones is introducing a face care line based on CBD early this year. Ildi Pekar, a facialist in Manhattan who has tended to Miranda Kerr and Irina Shayk, said that sales of her CBD facial oil are up and she plans on investing more in the ingredient, which she calls \u201cthe argan oil of the future.\u201d Both cite reports that say CBD has anti-inflammatory qualities when applied topically.\n\nBut Shereene Idriss, a dermatologist in Manhattan, said that those papers are vague. \u201cThere was one study in 2014 that said CBD can help reduce oil production and thereby have anti-acne and anti-inflammatory attributes,\u201d Dr. Idriss said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a perfectly well-rounded study, but it does have merit.\u201d The other study, from 2017, addressed cannabinoids in dermatology in general, including THC, but didn\u2019t deal with risks.\n\n\u201cI would need more, a randomized clinical trial, before I could with full-fledged belief recommend CBD oil as something more than just offering regular hydration,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you\u2019re using CBD lotions for pain relief, Dr. Idriss said, there are better studies demonstrating efficacy but that more needs to be done.\n\n\u201cCBD lotion that also has THC in it, it\u2019s going to help you much more with pain relief,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the ones from hemp, are they going to help as much? It\u2019s hard to tell because we don\u2019t have the data and studies.

{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "Consider his description of the making of the traditional wooden fence called a wattle hurdle. It starts not as you\u2019d expect with the assembly of the required materials, but with the planting and tending of the hazel trees that will eventually provide the timber necessary for the process to begin 10 or so years later. His subsequent account of the (literally) Neolithic process by which horizontal branches are woven together with upright rods into a lattice goes on for a half-dozen painstakingly detailed pages. If Langlands were providing instructions for how you too could make your own wattle, the effect would be unendurably boring, not to mention borderline incomprehensible. Instead, his genuine passion for the activity at hand makes his account hypnotic. To watch a hurdle maker at work, he says, is \u201calmost like watching a concert pianist at one with her instrument.\u201d He is clearly addicted to that place where labor is transformed through mastery into art.\n\nExploring this unfamiliar territory requires navigating a deliciously unfamiliar vocabulary: hafting (attaching an arrowhead to the tip of a spear); laying, pleaching and plashing (all required to nurture a hedgerow); carding, retting, scotching (for textile production); stooking (for thatched roofs); stocking and scudding (for leather); panning, marling and mattocking (for working the earth); flushing (for sheep farming); puddling (for cisterns); and pugging and wedging (for pottery). Of course, we no longer need these words, because most of us no longer participate in the activities these words describe. For Langlands, this loss is tragic. His obsession with successfully learning to make a thatched roof, he says, \u201cproved to me most forcefully that it\u2019s not that we have lost these ancient skills, it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s that we have lost the conception of those skills and what they can do for us.\u201d Ironically, the residue of these lost skills persists today in turns of phrase like \u201cmake hay while the sun shines,\u201d \u201cby hook or by crook,\u201d or having \u201cbeen through the mill.\u201d Once operating instructions, these are used by people who will never clear a field, tend a herd of sheep or qualify as a master weaver.\n\nGiven Langlands\u2019s background, it\u2019s no surprise that he consistently locates true craeft in the years \u2014 the millenniums, really \u2014 before the Industrial Revolution. Is it really gone? As a first-year student in design school, I remember the endless hours spent doing something as simple as drawing a capital letter A, the attention to detail that blurs and vanishes before your eyes, that moment when you lose track of time. Langlands describes the sensation as being \u201ctamed into the work.\u201d \u201cYou resign yourself to it. Your breathing moderates as you become methodical, more controlled. This is a marathon, not a sprint.\u201d Practicing craeft is an experience so universal there\u2019s even a song about it, Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cFinishing the Hat.\u201d Making things is hard but satisfying. Langlands is talking about digging a hole in the ground, but is it so very different from staying up all night writing code?\n\nImage Credit Nicole Natri\n\nBut perhaps I\u2019m giving us too much credit. Beyond the mastery of specialized skills, Langlands is talking about something more holistic: a way of looking at the world. In reconnecting with craeft, he begins to see not just the beauty of an object or a building or a landscape, but the deeper purpose for which each has been created. And he understands, too, the environment they shape and upon which they depend. \u201cArchaeology became so much more than just stuff in the ground,\u201d he says about his own journey. \u201cIt became an exploration of what it was to be human, not only because we are makers but because we are resourcers, gatherers with an inveterate knowledge of the natural world around us.\u201d How comparatively helpless are the rest of us as we contemplate the featureless mirror of the computer screen or the smooth sheen of the smartphone.\n\nIt is a deflating irony, of course, that in a marketplace dominated by mass production, it is the handcrafted item that commands a premium. Wicker baskets, made by our ancestors the same way since 5,000 B.C., are beautiful, versatile and resilient.

So it comes as a surprise to learn that Grafton didn\u2019t have a best seller until the series was eight years old and six books along, when \u201cF Is for Fugitive\u201d finally cracked the paperback list in 1990. \u201cWhen I started writing the series, who even knew this was going to work?\u201d Grafton told the critic and editor Sarah Weinman in a 2009 interview for The Los Angeles Times. That was the year that \u201cU Is for Undertow\u201d came out, and Weinman asked whether Grafton felt any pressure to make it all the way to Z. \u201cFor the first half of the alphabet, people bet I couldn\u2019t,\u201d Grafton replied. \u201cNow, they are rooting for me.\u201d\n\nIn the end, cancer claimed Grafton before she could embark on that final book, which she had planned \u2014 poignantly, it turns out \u2014 to call \u201cZ Is for Zero.\u201d So Kinsey Millhone\u2019s last stand will remain in \u201cY Is for Yesterday,\u201d which was released in August and went straight to the top of the hardcover fiction list. \u201cAs far as we in the family are concerned,\u201d Grafton\u2019s daughter Jamie Clark wrote, announcing the death online, \u201cthe alphabet now ends at Y.\u201d\n\nJ.K.: \u201cGood Night Stories for Rebel Girls,\u201d by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo, is still going strong on the middle grade hardcover list, at No. 4 in its 27th week.

It also means \u201ccomplex.\u201d There are so many ways to be complicit that you could make trading cards and never collect them all. You can be complicit through action or inaction, speech or silence, association or omission. You can engage in outright collusion, aiding in wrongdoing and lying your way through the cover-up. You can take advantage of an immoral situation to promote your book or your brand. But you can also feel coerced into complicity, intimidated or brainwashed. You can look the other way because you fear for your job or your reputation, or because you refuse to feel responsible for the systems around you.\n\nComplicity can be synonymous with collusion, but where collusion describes an action, complicity describes a state of being. It is buttery and passive, a path of least resistance. Complicity often calls for pretending not to know what you know, not to see what you see: playing dumb for the sake of getting along, preserving the comforts of the status quo. As a moral (non) stance, it clears the way for everything from bad manners to genocide. Take, for example, the opioid crisis, which we learn from a recent Washington Post article is a result of a corrupt system peopled with \u201crogue doctors\u201d and \u201ccomplicit\u201d pharmacists.

Our clients use the data we provide to solve boundary disputes and obtain land use permits, as examples.\n\nHow did you get this job?\n\nI worked here part time one summer while pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in surveying engineering technology at the University of Maine. The spring before I graduated, I emailed my boss and said, \u201cIf there\u2019s ever an opening, I\u2019d like to be considered.\u201d He said he just assumed I\u2019d work here when I graduated.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat was your path to becoming a surveyor?\n\nI got a bachelor\u2019s in biology at St. Olaf College in Minnesota and also studied geology, a second major, at its sister school, Carleton College. I wasn\u2019t sure what I could do with those degrees. Then I thought landscape architecture might be my calling, so I interned at an architectural firm and planned to start a master\u2019s degree. It finally hit me that I wanted to be like the surveyors working on the architectural projects, who brought me their data to enter. So instead of a master\u2019s, I studied surveying and found my way here.\n\nWhat do you like about the job?\n\nThe variety. My first project was laying out a runway at the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport, putting stakes in the ground to mark the end of the runway and the edges so that the construction company would know where to pave. Another time, a client wanted to divide a building into condominiums, and I represented the company at a planning board meeting, reporting measurements like the height of each floor.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite part of surveying?\n\nBoundary surveys can involve history going back hundreds of years, and this is the heart and soul of the job for me. It\u2019s like going on a treasure hunt, except you don\u2019t get a map. Reading a deed, we learn about the area from years earlier and the names of the people who lived there. Then we look for evidence on the property that relates to information in the deed. I might try and find a white pine that\u2019s mentioned and go from there.\n\nWhat are your challenges?\n\nI like being outside, but Maine winters can be brutal. When it\u2019s 10 degrees below zero, shady and windy, and my feet are on snow and ice, it gets really cold. But I\u2019ve learned. I have heat packs in my mittens, and big boots so I can wear several pairs of socks. In the spring, when the mosquitoes and black flies are out, I get bitten all day because I have to stand still much of the time.\n\nDo most of your jobs go smoothly?\n\nNot always. Once we were setting corner pins in someone\u2019s lawn and found it extended well over the neighbor\u2019s boundary. The homeowner didn\u2019t like that. He thought he owned more than he did and pulled them out.

It\u2019s not the allure of deathlessness, precisely, but maybe the next best thing: delay. We know from the start \u2014 whether reading the first in a multivolume set or whether further books have merely been announced \u2014 that the disappointment in having to exit the world of this novel will be postponed, that the can will be kickable down the road. The Scottish writer Ali Smith has just published the second of four novels that are being called a seasonal cycle, and there is much to celebrate in this fact, though the allure here (at least so far) is very different from that of other \u201csets.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the reader is in the same place, or with the same main characters. (The seasons, in real life, barely resemble one another, so why should these books?) But shifting from \u201cAutumn\u201d to \u201cWinter,\u201d and then plunging on through the rest of the year, Smith is the one doing the telling, which means the books can\u2019t help connecting through various channels, most notably her vast supply of preoccupations. Of course, all writers have preoccupations, refrains, obsessions; and by using the seasons as a thematic tarpaulin that covers the whole enterprise and publishing the volumes in fairly quick succession (\u201cAutumn\u201d appeared here last February) with some exciting, punctuating overlaps, she allows the books to exist at once separately and in comfortable relation.\n\n\u201cWinter\u201d opens with the world\u2019s temperature being taken. \u201cGod was dead: to begin with,\u201d Smith writes, riffing on the opening of \u201cA Christmas Carol.\u201d \u201cAnd romance was dead. Chivalry was dead. Poetry, the novel, painting, they were all dead, and art was dead. Theater and cinema were both dead. Literature was dead. The book was dead.

Prices range from $195 to $1,500 for ready-made pieces and $295 to $5,000 for custom-made ones. Each comes with a tag describing its lace origin.\n\nMs. Knutsson can trace her interest in lace back to when she was 6 years old and living in her native Sweden. Her grandmother had just died, and the family visited her home to choose which precious items to keep. Young Monika asked about the cotton doilies and lace-trimmed pillowcases she had always loved. \u201c\u2018Oh, unimportant,\u2019\u201d she was told. They were relegated to a backyard bin. She retrieved them.\n\nWhen Ms. Knutsson was in her 20s, with a business degree behind her, she married an American college professor, Bruce Kogut. A university appointment for him in Paris allowed her to study at Esmod International, the French fashion school, after which she got a job designing handbags and trimmings at Isabel Marant. While there, she discovered an artisan who encased fabric in metal for displays. Why not do the same with antique lace, she thought, which was otherwise in danger of discoloration and disintegration? She began buying piles of heirloom lace at estate sales and flea markets.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The Open Thread Fashion Newsletter A look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper.

{"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "text": "To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.\n\nBut what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.\n\nBut none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.\n\nThe open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.\n\nFor all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined \u2014 pages, links, messages \u2014 but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.\n\nThis turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.\n\nThe self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.\n\nBut the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.\n\nOne of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet\u2019s organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words \u201cWelcome to Rivendell\u201d were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d \u201cWe call this house Rivendell,\u201d Benet said sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good Rivendell. It doesn\u2019t have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.\u201d\n\nBenet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.\n\nSitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201d\n\nProtocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.\n\nWhy did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.\n\nAnd yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nRunning Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.\n\nThe first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres \u2014 one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.\n\nThe paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.\n\nHistory is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.\n\nFirst, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.\n\nSecond, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThese two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThese currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.\n\nThe I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.\n\nAdvocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201d\n\nPseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.\n\nLet\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson\u2019s partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. \u201cUber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cYes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map \u2014 and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.\u201d But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there\u2019s a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. \u201cAt some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,\u201d Burnham says.\n\nThe blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.\n\nHow would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.\n\nAs Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201d\n\nEven decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. \u201cHow can we fix the internet if we can\u2019t even make coffee?\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nPlanted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.\n\nThe true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).\n\nThe blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.\n\nWhat would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu\u2019s Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn\u2019t present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I\u2019d be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.\n\nGutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201d\n\nThe token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWould that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201d\n\nAdditional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201d\n\nSo much of the blockchain\u2019s architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.\n\nMuch has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.\n\nThe blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.\n\nLike the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.\n\nYes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone.

(The start-ups contract with other companies to make their chips.) But in designing chips that can provide the particular kind of computing power needed by machines learning how to do more and more things, these start-ups are racing toward one of two goals: Find a profitable niche or get acquired. Fast.\n\n\u201cMachine learning and A.I. has reopened questions around how to build computers,\u201d said Bill Coughran, who helped oversee the global infrastructure at Google for several years and is now a partner at Sequoia, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm. Sequoia has invested in Graphcore, a British start-up that recently joined the $100 million club.\n\nBy the summer of 2016, the change was apparent. Google, Microsoft and other internet giants were building apps that could instantly identify faces in photos and recognize commands spoken into smartphones by using algorithms, known as neural networks, that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large amounts of data.\n\nNvidia was best known for making graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which were designed to help render complex images for games and other software \u2014 and it turned out they worked really well for neural networks, too. Nvidia sold $143 million in chips for the massive computer data centers run by companies like Google in the year leading up to that summer \u2014 double the year before.\n\nIntel scrambled to catch up. It acquired Nervana, a 50-employee Silicon Valley start-up that had started building an A.I. chip from scratch, for $400 million, according to a report from the tech news site Recode.\n\nAfter that, a second Silicon Valley start-up, Cerebras, grabbed five Nervana engineers as it, too, designed a chip just for A.I.\n\nBy early 2018, according to a report by Forbes, Cerebras had raised more than $100 million in funding. So had four other firms: Graphcore; another Silicon Valley outfit, Wave Computing; and two Beijing companies, Horizon Robotics and Cambricon, which is backed by the Chinese government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRaising money in 2015 and early 2016 was a nightmare, said Mike Henry, chief executive at the A.I. chip start-up Mythic.

A third Beijing chip start-up, DeePhi, has raised $40 million, and the country\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology has explicitly called for the production of Chinese chips that challenge Nvidia\u2019s.\n\nBecause it\u2019s a new market \u2014 and because there is such hunger for this new kind of processing power \u2014 many believe this is one of those rare opportunities when start-ups have a chance against entrenched giants.\n\nThe first big change will most likely come in the data center, where companies like Graphcore and Cerebras, which has been quiet about its plans, hope to accelerate the creation of new forms of A.I. Among the goals are bots that can carry on conversations and systems that can automatically generate video and virtual reality.\n\nResearchers at places like Microsoft and Google, which has built its own chip just for A.I., \u201ctrain\u201d neural networks by extreme trial and error, testing the algorithms across vast numbers of chips for hours and even days on end. They often sit at their laptops, staring at graphs that show the progress of these algorithms as they learn from data. Chip designers want to streamline this process, packing all that trial and error into a few minutes.\n\nToday, Nvidia\u2019s G.P.U.s can efficiently execute all the tiny calculations that go into training neural networks, but shuttling data between these chips is still inefficient, said Scott Gray, who was an engineer at Nervana before joining OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab whose founder include Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nSo in addition to building chips specifically for neural networks, start-ups are rethinking the hardware that surrounds them.\n\nGraphcore, for example, is building chips that include more built-in memory so that they don\u2019t need to send as much data back and forth. Others are looking at ways of widening the pipes between chips so that data exchange happens faster.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about building chips but looking at how these chips are connected together and how they talk to the rest of the system,\u201d Mr. Coughran, of Sequoia, said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this is only part of the change. Once neural networks are trained for a task, additional gear has to execute that task. At Toyota, autonomous car prototypes are using neural networks as a way of identifying pedestrians, signs and other objects on the road. After training a neural network in the data center, the company runs this algorithm on chips installed on the car.\n\nA number of chip makers \u2014 including start-ups like Mythic, DeePhi and Horizon Robotics \u2014 are tackling this problem as well, pushing A.I. chips into devices ranging from phones to cars.\n\nIt is still unclear how well any of these new chips will work. Designing and building a chip takes about 24 months, which means even the first viable hardware relying on them won\u2019t arrive until this year. And the chip start-ups will face competition from Nvidia, Intel, Google and other industry giants.\n\nBut everyone is starting from about the same place: the beginning of a new market.", "title": "Big Bets on A.I.

Consider Paul McNamee, the former Australian star who changed from a single-handed to a double-handed backhand at age 24 because he believed the stroke was holding him back.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely hard,\u201d McNamee said recently of the change. \u201cEight to 10 hours a day for four months. I made a pact with myself that I would never go back to a one-hander. It was very embarrassing to begin with.\u201d\n\nAfter the change, McNamee soon broke into the top 25 in singles and reached No. 1 in doubles.\n\n\u201cThe key was the pact,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, I would have retreated back to the familiar quickly. The mental commitment for me was more difficult than the physical, and harder to sustain.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nOther established pros have switched from two-handed backhands to one-handed ones, including Fernando Meligeni, the former Brazilian star, and Tatjana Maria, the German who lost to Sharapova here in the first round.\n\nJill Craybas, the 1996 N.C.A.A. singles women\u2019s champion at Florida, salvaged her faltering pro career in the early 2000s by changing her forehand grip and switching from a closed-stance to an open-stance forehand. She upset Serena Williams in the third round of Wimbledon in 2005 and remained on tour until 2013.\n\n\u201cI remember matches where the racket felt like a foreign object in my hand,\u201d she said of the changes in an interview at Melbourne Park on Saturday. \u201cIt took me at least a year to lock it in. Djokovic is a little bit different because it\u2019s not a grip change, more of a motion change, and he\u2019s doing it more to protect the injury whereas I was doing it more to progress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDjokovic\u2019s serve is significantly different: He no longer drops his racket head low at the start of the motion, which is now more compact. He has said the change, designed to protect his elbow, was the product of discussions with his coaches Andre Agassi and Radek Stepanek and his own input.\n\n\u201cIt had to come from Novak,\u201d McNamee said. \u201cIf not, it is doomed, as he has to own it absolutely or he will revert after a bad loss.\u201d\n\nFor now, he is 3-0 with the new serve and hitting first-serve speeds similar, on average, to what he hit in 2016, when he last won this title. Unlike in 2016, though, the speeds have tailed off as matches have progressed.\n\n\u201cThe toughest thing about it is, the older you get, you become comfortable with routines and what you\u2019ve done for so long,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cWe like to keep what we know. We want to keep it, especially if it\u2019s helped us and if it\u2019s won us Grand Slams.\n\n\u201cBut at certain points in your career, if you\u2019re faced with a challenge, you\u2019re faced with an injury, you have to make those adjustments.

Likewise, they had higher levels of a hormone called ghrelin that makes people hungry and lower levels of a satiety hormone, peptide YY, if they had consumed the liquid meal in the afternoon instead of the morning.\n\nBinge eaters also showed higher initial levels of ghrelin when they started the regimen in the evening, compared to starting in the morning, while those who weren\u2019t binge eaters had the reverse pattern. The binge eaters also reported feeling less sated after the liquid meal and the exposure to the stressor in the evening.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStress drove up hunger in all of the participants, but the hunger hormone ghrelin rose even higher if participants were subjected to the stressful situation later in the day, suggesting stress may have a more profound effect on hunger in the evening.

Using resources in The Times, we have students consider complex questions, like:\n\n\u2022 How should scarce health care resources, such as livers for transplant, be allocated?\n\n\u2022 Should organ donors be paid?\n\n\u2022 What limits, if any, should be placed on the field of human \u201cgenetic engineering\u201d?\n\n\u2022 Should lithium be added to the drinking water supply if it can be proved to lower suicide rates in the larger population?\n\nTo help students address these questions, we introduced them to guiding principles in bioethics in Part I of this teaching resource. In the suggested activities below, we ask students to take on the role of bioethicist, and apply these principles as they consider one or more of the suggested topics.\n\nFor each, we provide related reading, as well as questions for debate, writing or additional inquiry. At the end of this lesson we suggest 14 bioethics topics for further student research.", "title": "Bioethics in Action, Part II: Teaching About the Challenge of Balancing the Needs of Patients", "authors": []}

Opposite me sat a young psychiatrist with an expertly rehearsed concerned listening face. As she fondled her pearl necklace like prayer beads, I talked about my mind as if it were a lost key \u2014 bashfully, impatiently. Where did I have it last?\n\nI\u2019m only 24, but I\u2019ve spent over a decade of my life cycling through hormonal contraceptives, seeking a treatment for the chronic pain caused by endometriosis \u2014 a painful disorder that 1 in 10 American women suffer from but no one ever seems to have heard of. With each new contraceptive, I observed my personality mutate, my grasp on reality fluctuate, and my sense of sanity slip farther and farther out of reach. I came to learn that my experiences tie into a broader pattern of the pharmaceutical industry failing to inform women about and protect them from the side effects of hormonal contraceptives. \u201cBirth Control Your Own Adventure\u201d is my response, an excruciatingly personal short film about my birth control story.\n\nAs early as fifth grade, I missed several days of school each month because of painful periods. During my first gynecological exam, the OB-GYN who delivered me tried to determine the cause of my pain while I tried not to think about how she was my classmate\u2019s mom. She presented a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis in an understated Midwestern tone, the way someone might repeat back a food order over the phone. Luckily, she said, the treatment was simple: Yaz. The innocuous pink pills would stop the pain, and I wouldn\u2019t have to miss any more school. There was no talk of side effects, only an ambiguous directive I would come to hear repeated in OB-GYN offices over the years \u2014 to wait three months and \u201csee how you feel.\u201d\n\nYaz got me through high school and college free of debilitating menstrual pain. Meanwhile, I struggled with depression, and no doctor ever suggested my birth control could be the cause. Instead it was identified as a lack of vitamin D, or being a teenage girl or what happens when you raise a synesthetic child in the monochromatic subdivisions of central Illinois.

While they extol the importance of family and community (in word if not always in policy), Khan-Cullors sees the cultivation of family and community as central to what she does, too.\n\nShe has publicly blasted Democrats for having \u201cmilked the black vote while creating policies that completely decimate black communities,\u201d referring to the crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law. Her father, whom she describes as a gentle man struggling with addiction, was in and out of prison on drug charges until he died of a heart attack in a homeless shelter.

The difference now is that the example of yesterday\u2019s activists is used against Black Lives Matter today.\n\nEven many of those \u201cwho claim sympathy with BLM\u2019s purpose have used the civil rights movement to decry their tactics,\u201d Theoharis writes in her elegant introduction, her rage kept at a controlled simmer. Theoharis, a historian and the author of \u201cThe Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks,\u201d is particularly attuned to how the legacies of Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. have been co-opted into a narrative of uplift, with civil rights history sanitized for public consumption.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt a time when conservative calls to stop \u201cpoliticizing\u201d Martin Luther King Day have become a yearly tradition, Theoharis\u2019s book is a bracing corrective to a national mythology that renders figures like King \u201cmeek and dreamy, not angry, intrepid and relentless.\u201d As it happens, getting King\u2019s birthday declared a national holiday was a 15-year ordeal. King was truly unpopular at the end of his life; a 1966 Gallup poll determined that only 33 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of him. (The figure in 2011 was 94 percent.) King was surveilled by the F.B.I. and went to jail 30 times. Like many other civil rights activists, he was called a Communist \u2014 a label whose loose rhetorical function is echoed in the word \u201cterrorist\u201d today. He was also reviled for having the temerity to criticize the \u201cwhite moderate\u201d who \u201cpreferred order to justice.\u201d\n\nEach chapter of Theoharis\u2019s book presents a historical narrative that is largely unknown outside scholarly books, or otherwise unsung. Several of them are pointed indictments of Northern self-congratulation. Theoharis delves into the stubborn persistence of segregated schools in New York City, as well as \u201cthe redneckification of racism,\u201d wherein white liberals in the North could use naked displays of racism in the South as an excuse to let their own discriminatory systems off the hook. She shows how Southerners eventually learned to use the \u201cveiled language\u201d of Northerners to cloak deeply unequal policies in the seemingly neutral vocabulary of rights and individualism.\n\nTheoharis takes her book\u2019s title from James Baldwin, who described American history as \u201clonger, larger, more various, more beautiful and more terrible than anything anyone has ever said about it.\u201d At bewildering moments like this one, it\u2019s clarifying to read a history that shows us how little we remember, and how much more there is to understand.", "title": "Black Lives Matter and the Intrepid Lives That Preceded It", "authors": ["Jennifer Szalai", "Books Of The Times"]}

It pits him, to some degree, against many of the companies that he\u2019s invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to say that \u2018business\u2019 has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities,\u201d Friedman wrote, almost rhetorically, back in 1970 in this very newspaper. \u201cBusinessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil recently, companies like BlackRock have traditionally been passive investors and have done little to pressure the leaders of companies they invested in; in fact they were known for rubber stamping management\u2019s plans. It was active investors who sought to hold companies accountable \u2014 either by agitating for change or by selling their shares to express their displeasure.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Fink has in the past denounced \u201cactivist\u201d shareholders as too focused on the short term. \u201cIf you asked me if activism harms job creation, the answer is yes,\u201d he told me back in 2014. Now he is changing his stripes.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

In 2016, the firm withheld support from two directors as a protest against Exxon\u2019s \u201cnon-engagement\u201d policy, which barred independent board members from meeting with shareholders like Mr. Fink. Then, in 2017, BlackRock supported a shareholder proposal to enhance the company\u2019s disclosures on climate, in part because Exxon\u2019s policy prevented the firm from getting a full understanding of its long-term strategy and risk exposure.\n\nThe climate disclosure proposal ultimately passed, and just last month Exxon agreed to publish climate impact reports. Perhaps even more notably, Exxon also changed its policy of non-engagement, and now permits meetings between shareholders and independent directors.\n\nBlackRock has even begun siding with activist investors themselves, something it hasn\u2019t publicized. One of its funds voted in favor of the activist Nelson Peltz last year in his proxy fight with Procter & Gamble. It also voted in favor of Bill Ackman against ADP. BlackRock voted in favor of activist-led proposals in 19 percent of proxy fights last year and that number is likely to rise.\n\nIn a surprising twist, even activist investors are taking up social causes. Jana Partners and Calstrs, the huge California retirement system that manages the pensions of the state\u2019s public schoolteachers, wrote a letter to Apple last week demanding that it focus more on the detrimental effects its products may have on children.\n\nThe chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, once referred to Jana as \u201cgreedy bastards\u201d when the firm was attacking him. But here was Jana espousing the importance of issues like public health, human capital management and environmental protection, and saying that \u201ccompanies pursuing business practices that make short-term sense may be undermining their own long-term viability.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the case of Apple,\u201d Jana wrote, \u201cwe believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy, and the company itself, are inextricably linked.\u201d (Side note: It isn\u2019t clear why Jana went after Apple, considering that it has better tools to manage the use of its products by children than anyone else in the industry; but the general idea of technology companies paying more attention to children\u2019s health is a good one.)\n\nMr. Fink makes a point in his letter that the recent corporate tax cut could bring out the kind of activist investors he once denounced. \u201cTax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows,\u201d he said, \u201cand companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite Mr. Fink\u2019s insistence that companies benefit society, it\u2019s worth noting he\u2019s not playing down the importance of profits and, while it\u2019s a subtle point, he believes that having social purpose is inextricably linked to a company\u2019s ability to maintain its profits.\n\nOn that score, Mr. Fink and Friedman aren\u2019t that far apart. \u201cIt may well be in the long-run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government,\u201d Friedman wrote in 1970, adding that this approach may make it easier to attract desirable employees along with \u201cother worthwhile effects.\u201d\n\nBut he also added a dollop of reality to the debate. Noting \u201cwidespread aversion\u201d to things like capitalism, profits and the \u201csoulless corporation,\u201d he wrote that social responsibility is \u201cone way for a corporation to generate goodwill as a byproduct of expenditures that are entirely justified in its own self-interest.\u201d", "title": "BlackRock\u2019s Message: Contribute to Society, or Risk Losing Our Support", "authors": ["Andrew Ross Sorkin"]}

The two had met last spring to discuss another collaboration, but couldn\u2019t coordinate their schedules.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Timbers said he was intrigued by the chance to reconsider the performer\u2019s career. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to ask if Bobby Darin\u2019s legacy has been negatively impacted by the fact you couldn\u2019t put him in a box,\u201d said Mr. Timbers. \u201cHe was always chasing the next wave in music. In one of our first conversations, we were talking about people like Madonna, how she was ahead of the whole EDM thing with \u2018Ray of Light.\u2019 Or U2, when they released \u2018Pop.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf Darin\u2019s singing could seem slicker and less distinctive than that of his more celebrated contemporaries, his range was indeed expansive, encompassing rock (\u201cSplish Splash\u201d), lush and jazzy pop (\u201cDream Lover,\u201d \u201cBeyond The Sea\u201d) and show tunes and songbook staples (\u201cMack the Knife,\u201d most famously).\n\nHe also ventured into film acting, founded a record label and music publishing company, and, as his political awareness grew, crafted \u201cSimple Song of Freedom,\u201d a pacifist anthem for the Vietnam era.\n\nDarin pursued goals like he was running out of time \u2014 \u201clike he had a stopwatch on his life,\u201d noted Mr. Timbers. And with good reason: childhood bouts with rheumatic fever had left the performer\u2019s heart severely weakened; he would die at 37. He nonetheless proceeded at a breakneck pace: marrying movie sweetheart Sandra Dee; collecting an Oscar nomination; holding court at the Copacabana and in Las Vegas; campaigning for Bobby Kennedy before returning to nightclubs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary trajectory for a guy who was told he\u2019d be dead by the age of 15,\u201d said Mr. Timbers.\n\nWhile Darin was prolific in the studio, evidence suggests his live performances could be looser, and swing harder. In the \u201cMack the Knife\u201d captured on \u201cDarin At the Copa,\u201d his voice sounds grittier than on the hit single, and his syncopation is more playful.\n\n\u201cAs with so many great performers,\u201d said Mr. Einhorn, \u201cthere was clearly something about being in the room with him, this great kinetic energy.

After widespread protests of the results and calls by the Organization of American States for a new election after allegations of vote-rigging, Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez declared victory last month, with the support of the United States.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s undeniable that you\u2019re starting to see authoritarian tendencies in parts of Latin America, leaders that are struggling to let go,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to the right or left now.\u201d\n\nBen Raderstorf, an analyst at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group based in Washington, said recent economic troubles, in an area suffering from stagnant commodity prices, is one factor leading to incumbents trying to hold onto power in Latin America.\n\n\u201cWhen economies started to turn downward, political machines started to grasp what they could,\u201d Mr. Raderstorf said.\n\nBefore telling Mr. Morales, 58, in the referendum that it was time he retired, voters had repeatedly backed him, in three consecutive elections, bringing stability to a country that some politicians had considered ungovernable. Five presidents had served in the five years before the swearing in of Mr. Morales in 2006.\n\nWhen he first entered office, Mr. Morales, part of a group of leftist leaders in Latin America who rose to power at a time of high commodity prices, sought to tackle a history of inequality in Bolivia. He strong-armed foreign energy companies to share more profits with the state, investing the proceeds in education and health care while rewriting the country\u2019s Constitution to speed his reforms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA former union leader for coca farmers, Mr. Morales toured the country wearing traditional clothes and touting his indigenous roots. He built a web of aerial cable cars in the capital, La Paz, connecting the city\u2019s poorer periphery to places of employment.

Ms. Zapata, 31, an executive at a Chinese-owned construction company that received large government contracts, was tried and sentenced in 2017 for influence peddling.\n\nThough Mr. Morales has denied any connection to the case, the allegations that he had a relationship with a corrupt businesswoman still follows the president.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI think he is a villain,\u201d said Gabriela de Carpio, 34, an unemployed mother in La Paz, saying that the increasing frequency of corruption scandals involving the president\u2019s confidantes was one reason she voted against the referendum to let him run a fourth time.\n\nThe term limits that Mr. Morales wants to jettison were part of a Constitution he had promoted in 2009. Late last year, the country\u2019s highest court, which critics say is packed with judges loyal to Mr. Morales, ruled that term limits had violated an international human rights treaty from the 1960s, a ruling many legal experts consider dubious.\n\n\u201cIn Bolivia the executive is now the only power and directs all others,\u201d said V\u00edctor Hugo C\u00e1rdenas, a former vice president, and now an opposition politician. He said he fears attacks against opposition parties in coming years similar to those in Venezuela.\n\nBut even though Mr. Morales has said he will run again, that does not mean he will necessarily win in a walkover.\n\nIn judicial elections in December, a majority of Bolivians voiced their anger at the government by nullifying their ballots rather than picking from a list of judges that had been preselected by leftists.\n\nBut some analysts point out that while many voters are willing to express their anger against the president in referendums and judicial elections, far fewer may be willing to reverse his course by sending an untested opposition politician to the presidential palace.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe have the perhaps weakest opposition in Latin America,\u201d said Jorge Lazarte, a columnist for Bolivian newspapers and political scientist, saying few candidates stand a chance against Mr. Morales\u2019s power and charisma.\n\nAs Julio Eguino, a 42-year-old psychologist, put it, \u201cthe question is, if not Evo, then who?\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Eguino is keeping an open mind about who he will vote for next year, he said he has little interest in the opposition and so far has always given Mr. Morales his vote.\n\nHe added that the changes in Bolivia begun by Mr. Morales still have a long way to go.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of even five terms for Evo,\u201d Mr. Eguino said recently at his home in the capital\u2019s middle-class neighborhood of Calacoto. \u201cIt might be a question of a century to see the change we need.\u201d", "title": "Bolivia Tells President His Time Is Up.

The threat of potential Chinese competition has made both the American and European giants eager to buttress their flanks.\n\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said $1.5 billion in Canadian government subsidies for Bombardier would damage United States industry. The 300 percent duties he tentatively approved would have effectively closed the American market to the company. That prompted Bombardier to sell a majority stake in its CSeries program to Airbus.

Apple\u2019s bonuses will cost $300 million, a fraction of the $40 billion, at least, that the tech giant is saving from a single provision in the law, which allows it to return earnings held overseas at less than half the rate it would have paid under the old system.\n\nAnd two days before Walmart snagged glowing headlines for handing out $400 million in bonuses and lifting its minimum wage at a cost of $300 million, the nation\u2019s largest retailer by sales unveiled a plan to buy back company-issued debt.

Many patients are children. The condition can progress and lead to multiple strokes, mental decline and, in adults, death from brain hemorrhage.\n\nMs. Roy had no doubts: Hoping to avoid a major stroke that could cripple or kill her, she wanted brain surgery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHer operation, on Dec. 15, was the first bypass Dr. Langer performed with the Orbeye, though he and his colleagues had used it for other operations. This type of bypass is one of the most difficult neurosurgical operations, and requires stitching together arteries that are only a millimeter or so in diameter. Colleagues say Dr. Langer is one of the few surgeons in the world with the skill and experience to perform it well.\n\nA vessel in Ms. Roy\u2019s scalp \u2014 one that Dr. Langer called \u201cthe Michael Jordan artery,\u201d because his can be seen pulsing at his temple \u2014 would be rerouted to feed a deeper artery whose blood supply had been cut off.\n\nThe cut end of one branch of the scalp artery would be sewn to a hole cut in the side of the deeper vessel. Another branch of the scalp artery would simply be laid atop Ms. Roy\u2019s brain, with the expectation that branches would grow into the nerve tissue, because oxygen-deprived cells secrete substances that can stimulate the growth of blood vessels.\n\nThe procedure started with assistant surgeons touching an ultrasound probe to Ms. Roy\u2019s temple to detect the pulse of the scalp artery, and then marking the vessel\u2019s path with purple ink so that Dr. Langer would know precisely where to cut. Then he would begin the painstaking process of freeing the two branches of the artery from their surrounding tissue.\n\nWhen the scalp artery was free, the surgeons took a drill and a saw to Ms. Roy\u2019s skull, removing a disc of bone about three inches in diameter. Magnified 15 times on the monitor, her brain, webbed with bright red blood vessels, gleamed in the light and pulsated with each heartbeat.\n\nIt took about 10 stitches to sew the scalp artery to the artery in the brain, using a curved needle about the size of an eyelash and fine thread barely visible to the naked eye.\n\n\u201cThe first two stitches are the hardest,\u201d Dr. Langer said. \u201cThey set the whole thing up.

Isik nodded and added, \u201cWe collaborate with our team, with other artists. That\u2019s how it works in Berlin.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor years, despite the city\u2019s reputation as a progressive creative capital, Berlin has launched few noteworthy fashion designers onto the international stage. Both Huseby and Isik admitted that they were attracted to the city because of \u2014 not despite \u2014 its anti-fashion scene. Their first collection (called Collection Zero) took traditional workwear, like German carpenter pants, and made them fitted, using vintage, deadstock or club-friendly fabrics such as vinyl. When Collection Zero launched in 2016, it was immediately picked up by Opening Ceremony; last year GmbH was shortlisted for the LVMH Award.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany designers in the collective (there are between \u201c10-15 of us on any given day,\u201d says Huseby) are the children of immigrants: Huseby was born to a Pakistani father and a Norwegian mother and grew up among pine forests in the Norwegian countryside. Isik is a first-generation German of Turkish descent; he was born in Herne, a small former mining city in the industrial Ruhr district. When they met on Berlin\u2019s clubbing circuit in 2015, Isik was designing a line of tailored men\u2019s wear and teaching at the Academy of Fashion and Design in Berlin; Huseby was a fashion photographer who had recently completed a photographic series about edible urban plants and weeds. \u201cI was interested in the migration of plants as it relates to humans and as weeds as a symbol of migrant workers in Europe,\u201d Huseby says. He eventually turned the series into a book, titled \u201cWeeds & Aliens.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNow, along with Isik and the GmbH collective, he continues to weave these ideas and political statements into the clothes: In some of the knit pieces featured in the brand\u2019s third collection, for fall/winter 2018, a pattern of abstract stinging nettles has been woven or embroidered into the fabric. \u201cThe stinging nettle is our coat of arms,\u201d explained Isik. Huseby added, \u201cIt\u2019s a plant that is not considered beautiful but grows everywhere in this city. It\u2019s a survivor plant.\u201d Isik brought out a sample fabric of jacquard knit with nettle leaf forms woven into it, which would soon be part of a tightly fitted long-sleeve shirt, like a modern compression top. \u201cDuring World War I there was a shortage of cotton in Germany, so many army uniforms were made of stinging nettle fiber,\u201d Isik says.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFighting uniforms and armor were major sources of inspiration for the current fall/winter 2018 collection \u2014 which they presented on Tuesday in Paris at their first runway show, in a sprawling factory in the 18th Arrondissement \u2014 as were Viking and medieval Islamic history. Against the backdrop of modern-day Europe \u2014 where some of the big political discussions involve the integration of refugees and the closing of borders \u2014 Huseby and Isik are interested in stories about how Islamic thought and customs have shaped Western society. \u201cThe starting point for this collection came from a recent BBC article,\u201d says Huseby, who grabbed his laptop from another table to look up the link to the story. \u201cA Swedish textile archaeologist found Arabic characters woven into Viking burial costumes that were found in ninth- and 10th-century graves in Scandinavia.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe designers say they are interested in taking apparel associated with a certain group \u2014 and turning it on its head. For example, Isik says, \u201cwe like to take a Turkish oil wrestling trouser and put it on a woman. Or take apart vintage Scandinavian sweaters and piece them back together with the kind of brown zip-up sweater that our migrant fathers used to wear.\u201d Huseby shows me images of two sleeveless tops made of chain mail that are part of their fall/winter 2018 collection. It\u2019s also an example of a GmbH collaboration: They worked with the London-based designers Alan Crocetti and Fannie Schiavoni on the designs. Unsurprisingly, Berlin\u2019s club scene is also a strong influence on their aesthetic. The name of their current collection, \u201cMy Beauty Offends You,\u201d comes from a line by the vocalist Bobo Secret in the song \u201cAlkahhaf,\u201d by Fatima Al Qadiri, a Kuwaiti\u2013raised composer and artist who often deals with issues of gender, queer culture and race in her music.\n\nGmbH frequently casts their shows with friends from the Berlin underground. For their last offering, spring 2018, the models were all from immigrant backgrounds, many of whom were friends from the club scene. The collection was inspired by Huseby and Isik\u2019s migrant fathers \u2014 and the German expression \u201cGastarbeiter\u201d which translates as \u201cguest worker.\u201d Huseby himself shot that campaign. \u201cWe grew up not even considering that we could be fashion models,\u201d said Isik. \u201cSoutheast Asians or Muslims or transgender people were rarely represented in the fashion world.\u201d Huseby added, \u201cWe can only shift society\u2019s idea of what beauty is by strong representation.\u201d", "title": "Brand to Know: The Fashion Collective Making Modern Armor", "authors": ["Gisela Williams", "On The Verge"]}

In something that Americans might consider to be a kangaroo court proceeding, he sentenced Mr. da Silva to nine and a half years in prison.\n\nThe rule of law in Brazil had already been dealt a devastating blow in 2016 when Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, Ms. Rousseff, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014, was impeached and removed from office. Most of the world (and possibly most of Brazil) may believe that she was impeached for corruption. In fact, she was accused of an accounting maneuver that temporarily made the federal budget deficit look smaller than it otherwise would appear. It was something that other presidents and governors had done without consequences. And the government\u2019s own federal prosecutor concluded that it was not a crime.\n\nWhile there were officials involved in corruption from parties across the political spectrum, including the Workers\u2019 Party, there were no charges of corruption against Ms. Rousseff in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nMr. da Silva remains the front-runner in the October election because of his and the party\u2019s success in reversing a long economic decline. From 1980 to 2003, the Brazilian economy barely grew at all, about 0.2 percent annually per capita. Mr. da Silva took office in 2003, and Ms. Rousseff in 2011. By 2014, poverty had been reduced by 55 percent and extreme poverty by 65 percent. The real minimum wage increased by 76 percent, real wages overall had risen 35 percent, unemployment hit record lows, and Brazil\u2019s infamous inequality had finally fallen.\n\nBut in 2014, a deep recession began, and the Brazilian right was able to take advantage of the downturn to stage what many Brazilians consider a parliamentary coup.\n\nIf Mr. da Silva is barred from the presidential election, the result could have very little legitimacy, as in the Honduran election in November that was widely seen as stolen. A poll last year found that 42.7 percent of Brazilians believed that Mr. da Silva was being persecuted by the news media and the judiciary. A noncredible election could be politically destabilizing.\n\nPerhaps most important, Brazil will have reconstituted itself as a much more limited form of electoral democracy, in which a politicized judiciary can exclude a popular political leader from running for office.

Martin Luther King Middle is a Boston public school \u2014 \u201cmad ghetto,\u201d in Green\u2019s estimation \u2014 where his progressive parents have sent him for sixth grade. He\u2019s not the only white boy in the school, but the other one \u2014 his friend Kev, who\u2019s got lip scruff and spiky black hair along with prowess on the basketball court \u2014 often passes for Puerto Rican. There\u2019s no mistaking Green, though: not with his blue eyes and blond curls and constantly flushed cheeks, not with his monogrammed L. L. Bean backpack, not with his weakness for blurting the word \u201cawesome\u201d (\u201ca Caucasian catastrophe,\u201d he notes). Almost all 12-year-olds are confused about who and what they are, but for David Greenfeld, at school, one conspicuous facet of his identity defines him: not his Green-ness, but his whiteness.\n\nHewing to the classic coming-of-age-novel formula, \u201cGreen\u2019s\u201d Green experiences a variety of awakenings \u2014 sexual, religious, familial, moral and not surprisingly racial \u2014 during the course of his sixth-grade school year (1992-93), all of which get relayed in first-person, present-tense, slanged-up narration. The alarm clock for some of these awakenings is the friendship Green strikes with Marlon Wellings, a pious, studious black classmate who lives near Green in the Robert Gould Shaw Homes, a.k.a. \u201cthe projects.\u201d Marlon, unlike Green, is mostly immune to social tensions, sitting by himself at lunchtime studying for the entrance exam to Boston Latin, the city\u2019s elite public school, where Green also aims to transfer. Green\u2019s first impression is that Marlon \u201clooks pretty soft,\u201d and thus approachable: \u201ccreased khakis, pilled-up flannel, boxy black shoes and a short, unkempt flattop, more like a clumpy cloud.\u201d He has a gap in his front teeth, just as Green does, but the similarities don\u2019t end there. The bond they form is based partly upon a clandestine love for the Boston Celtics \u2014 \u201cno one openly admits they feel the Celtics anymore,\u201d Green says \u2014 and partly upon their shared desire for an upward move to Boston Latin. At Martin Luther King Middle they\u2019re outsiders, and both of them are desperate to get even farther outside.\n\nImage\n\nThe similarities do, however, bear some obvious endpoints. Green\u2019s Birkenstock-shod parents went to Harvard before embarking on a life of bobo activism (\u201cPops gives mad loot to Greenpeace\u201d); Marlon\u2019s father is somewhere down South while his grandmother cares for him along with his mentally ill mother. Green and his 8-year-old brother, Benno, spend summers helping their parents tend a community garden plot; Marlon eats asparagus for the first time at Green\u2019s house and the resultant urine smell triggers a cancer panic. Green is a secular Jew, confounded by what that even means, while Marlon sings in the choir in a storefront church near the Roxbury border. Green\u2019s parents, if they would relax their principles, could conceivably send him to a safer private school (brother Benno, who recently stopped speaking, attends one such school \u201cfor sensitive kids\u201d); Marlon\u2019s grandmother is absent that option. And Marlon is black, while Green, glaringly, is white.\n\nThis dynamic \u2014 the white boy adrift in the urban and predominantly black school, the fraught cross-racial friendship that blooms there \u2014 isn\u2019t new to fiction. Jonathan Lethem probed it, with exquisite grace, in his 2003 novel \u201cThe Fortress of Solitude.\u201d (A line from Lethem\u2019s novel, in fact, could serve as a 10-word summary of Green: \u201cA white boy in sixth grade, squirming in the glare.\u201d) Graham-Felsen isn\u2019t reaching for the same lofty heights as Lethem did (few novelists dare to), but he is reaching in the same general direction: toward the terribly thorny beauty at the heart of cross-racial friendships, which constitutes, per Leslie Fiedler and others, one of our essential American stories. These thorns keep getting denser and sharper as \u201cGreen\u201d progresses, as when Green discovers that the pair\u2019s snow shoveling business is successful only when he approaches potential customers without Marlon in sight.

When Green copies a couple of answers from Marlon during the fated entrance exam, the white proctor takes notice but lets it slide. \u201cA sickening mix of relief and shame sweeps over me,\u201d says Green. \u201cMar knows it and I do, too: I\u2019ve been saved by the force.\u201d", "title": "Bridging the Racial Divide in a Middle School Friendship", "authors": []}

Many who remember City Ballet\u2019s \u201cApollo\u201d during Balanchine\u2019s lifetime would still like improvements, but they\u2019re the same we\u2019ve wanted for years. Mark Stanley\u2019s lighting is too tepid, and several aspects of the choreography are misaccentuated. Andrew Litton\u2019s conducting, though it elicited wonderful orchestral playing, was insufficiently propulsive. When Terpsichore placed her finger onto Apollo\u2019s at the start of the pas de deux, the emphasis was overdone: What should matter more is the line that follows as she turns away.\n\nSo today\u2019s \u201cApollo\u201d lacks playfulness, excitement, naturalness. (Balanchine once described Apollo as \u201ca country boy,\u201d the muses as \u201cthree broads who happen along.\u201d) But its formal qualities remain thrilling: The lines of Mr. Finlay\u2019s dancing open out vastly into the surrounding air.\n\nBalanchine\u2019s \u201cApollo\u201d was an open-sesame. Its revelatory meeting of ancient and modern became the hallmark of his work. Classicism and modernism also coexist in many of his ballets, not least the five others on Tuesday\u2019s and Wednesday\u2019s programs.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Wednesday, \u201cThe Four Temperaments\u201d (1946), one of the peak ballets of the 20th century, was vivid in all its facets, from Lydia Wellington\u2019s gleamingly cool, sure delivery of the opening duet onward. Teresa Reichlen has long been the definitive exponent of Choleric\u2019s thunder-and-lightning steps, while Anthony Huxley, sometimes too contained in the past, broke through as Melancholic to a new fervor, his torso powerfully showing the conflicts embodied here. No conflicts for Tiler Peck\u2019s incisive Sanguinic: She was all full-throttle, outward-bound momentum.\n\nMaria Kowroski, the company\u2019s senior ballerina, and her partner Tyler Angle brought a greater wealth of nuance to \u201cMozartiana\u201d (1981) than they\u2019ve previously achieved. Sara Mearns, the troupe\u2019s most dramatic stylist, firmly steered \u201cCort\u00e8ge Hongrois\u201d (1973) from severity to jubilance, and \u201cChaconne\u201d (1976) from elusive spirituality through to rococo brilliance. She was handsomely partnered by Russell Janzen (\u201cCort\u00e8ge\u201d) and Adrian Danchig-Waring (\u201cChaconne\u201d). Both these men were admirable: More authority will come with more experience. Mr. Janzen seems unnecessarily anxious, as if not knowing how good he is.\n\nWednesday\u2019s account of \u201cDivertimento No. 15\u201d (1956), a celestial work featuring five ballerinas and three cavaliers, was both bold and clear. My cavil here is not a new one: Some of these ballerinas (Megan Fairchild, Abi Stafford) stepped out eagerly into space without illuminating the air around them; they were bubbly but not radiant. But it was good to see Ashley Laracey back from a six-month injury. Could this lovely but often self-absorbed soloist become an exemplar of classical style?\n\nOutside the auditorium, the David H. Koch Theater looked distinctly festive. Jihan Zencirli\u2019s large installation of primary-color balloons in the upstairs foyer is the latest, brightest and merriest of the six art installations the company has presented in the past years; Ms. Zencirli is the first female artist to have been commissioned.

Britain is under pressure to accept more of them, though Mrs. May\u2019s statement made no mention of the numbers that could be admitted.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of defense cooperation, Thursday\u2019s meeting was held at the Sandhurst military academy, and Mrs. May said that three British military helicopters would support French operations against Islamist insurgents in the Sahel region of Africa.

To test the waters for a lieutenant governor run, Mr. Williams is planning to travel the state in the coming weeks.\n\nBut there are already strong headwinds. Supporters have yet to rally around his effort. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council speaker, Corey D. Johnson, have so far declined to offer support, as has the progressive Working Families Party, which backed his early political career. Proxies for Mr. Cuomo, including one of his top advisers, have already launched attacks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him and I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019m not supporting him for the position,\u201d said Charlie King, a former campaign adviser to Mr. Cuomo who twice ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor. Mr. King brought up Mr. Williams\u2019s failed bid to become the City Council speaker, a race that officially ended this month.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Look, you\u2019re going to have to address the question: Why should a million Democratic voters, who don\u2019t know you, want you to lead the state, when 50 of your colleagues, who do know you, didn\u2019t want you to lead their conference?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nYet Mr. Williams\u2019s desire for the state\u2019s No. 2 post appears to already have had an effect. Even as the current lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, vows to run for re-election, alternatives have been floated behind the scenes, including the Rochester mayor, Lovely Warren, who like Mr. Williams is black.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the governor is finally understanding the importance of diversity,\u201d Mr. Williams said sardonically. He brushed off the concern that running against Mr. Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant during the governor\u2019s own re-election year would jeopardize his future in politics, and contrasted his own reputation as a vocal and sometimes intransigent advocate for police reform and progressive housing policy with the sorts of positions taken in Albany.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can change your beliefs based on a political race.

In theatrical roles, the symptoms of his Tourette\u2019s syndrome \u2014 evident in normal conversation \u2014 would often dissipate completely, he said. But even before graduating from Brooklyn College, he began thinking of politics: He ran for student body president, but narrowly lost, a defeat that stuck with him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the rules for term limits changed, giving the Democratic incumbent a third term and a shot at re-election. Still, Mr. Williams, who has struggled to raise money, succeeded in a tight six-way race.\n\nIn his first term, Mr. Williams became one of the Council\u2019s most prominent critics of the Police Department\u2019s stop-and-frisk tactics, co-sponsoring legislation with Councilman Brad Lander that created an inspector general for the police and expanded the prohibitions on profiling. The bills passed after midnight on a summer day in 2013, each with enough votes to survive a mayoral veto. Applause greeted their passage.\n\nFor Mr. Williams, it was a signature moment and an example of the lifelong activist who sticks to principle while engaging in one of the most difficult of political tasks: shepherding contentious legislation over the vehement objections of City Hall. In the years since, crime has gone down, not up.\n\n\u201cHe took an unpopular stance because he knew it was right,\u201d said Joo-Hyun Kang, the director of Communities United for Police Reform, an advocacy group that pushed for the legislation.\n\nMore recently, on Jan. 11, Mr. Williams found himself again facing down the police as he and other demonstrators tried to block an ambulance carrying Ravi Ragbir, an immigrant rights leader detained by federal authorities. No stranger to civil disobedience \u2014 which, in activist jargon, he refers to as \u201cC.D.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Williams expressed shock and disappointment at his and others\u2019 harsh arrests. He said he had been \u201cflung\u201d by officers several times.\n\n\u201cThe type of violence that occurred there should not have occurred,\u201d he said. At least 15 complaints have been filed with the city\u2019s Civilian Complaint Review Board over the episode, which Mr. de Blasio has said is under review.\n\nHis longtime friend, the civil rights activist Kirsten John Foy, called Mr. Williams \u201ca fighter\u201d and the \u201cideal vehicle\u201d for expanding the role of lieutenant governor and using it for advocacy. \u201cI think it is something the state needs,\u201d said Mr. Foy, who was detained along with Mr. Williams by the police at the 2011 West Indian American Day Parade.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Mr. Williams\u2019s commitment to principles has caused him political problems, particularly as he has tried to reconcile his personal religious beliefs \u2014 he worships at St. Paul Community Baptist Church \u2014 with liberal Democratic policies on abortion and gay marriage, leaving himself open to attacks that he is too conservative on the issues. Ms. DeRosa, the secretary to Mr. Cuomo, said in a radio interview that what she had read about Mr. Williams\u2019s views \u201ctroubles me tremendously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI support marriage equality and I support a woman\u2019s right to access safe and legal abortions.

It\u2019s been my blessing and curse.\u201d\n\nSomething else he and The Guy have in common: They both own a \u201977 Travco.\n\nMr. Sinclair wound up with the R.V. because he saw a moon lamp made of fiberglass, and then became fascinated by fiberglass as a building material, and then while researching on the web came across the fiberglass-bodied R.V. How The Guy ends up with it on \u201cHigh Maintenance\u201d is for now a secret, although one assumes the story will also follow a meandering, pot-head logic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was not surprised one bit when he showed me a photo of this R.V. and said he was buying it,\u201d Ms. Blichfeld said. \u201cBen has a flair for drama.

I\u2019m the one who would have been asking for inspections and things and projecting all the ways the R.V. would complicate our life.\u201d\n\nThe motor home, like a fiberglass boat, bobbed and weaved and rocked up the Taconic State Parkway for three hours all the way to Germantown. But Mr. Sinclair looked content behind the wheel. When part of the roof blew off beside a farm on a back road a few miles from the destination, he pulled over, tossed the shards into the back and rolled on. He even arrived at his buddy\u2019s house in time to roll the joint.\n\nIn a few days, Mr. Sinclair was scheduled to leave for a monthlong solo trip to Indonesia, to go scuba diving in Bali and Raja Ampat. When he returned, it would be to a new season of his show, a new apartment, a new New York. He was excited about the trip but also nervous, he said, because he doesn\u2019t like to be alone.\n\nHe thought out loud: \u201cIs it worth being alone for the sake of being alone because you think you should be alone, or to find solitude just because it\u2019s good for you? Or if you like being around people and that\u2019s just what you like, maybe that\u2019s O.K., too?\u201d\n\nSounding like one of the endearingly searching New Yorkers who call upon The Guy, Mr. Sinclair said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to answer those questions for myself.\u201d", "title": "Brooklyn\u2019s Favorite Pot Dealer Returns", "authors": ["Steven Kurutz"]}

They simply satisfy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of beer that gets left behind in our I.P.A. culture,\u201d Orr said.\n\nClay had a more charitable explanation. \u201cIn the \u201990s, everybody made brown ales or porters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes sense that a new generation would want to do something different.\u201d\n\nIn the 1970s and \u201980s, early craft brewers were motivated by what seemed lost. Back then, American beer culture was dominated by the insipid lagers of the big brewers. Dozens of classic styles, developed over centuries of brewing, had largely been abandoned. Porters, amber ales, India pale ales, brown ales \u2014 English styles mostly \u2014 had been read about more than tasted.\n\nInspired by England\u2019s Campaign for Real Ale movement, many American craft brewers set about resurrecting these styles first. Their success, coupled with similar efforts in other countries, encouraged further experimentation, with German and Belgian styles and beyond, as well as a fair amount of creative boundary-pushing.\n\nSome of the results were augmented styles, in which characteristics were exaggerated, sometimes to good effect, but often beyond balance. Hoppy I.P.A.s, for example, became double or even triple I.P.A.s.\n\nOver time, the trend toward amplification spawned a counter-movement promoting session beers, brews that toned down the volume and alcohol without sacrificing flavor. American brown ales, which tend mostly to be in the range of 5 to 6 percent alcohol, do not quite fit the definition of session beers, which typically are around 4 percent. They also have more discernible hop flavors than their classic English counterpart, and occasionally are brewed with additions like nuts or seeds. But brown ales are relaxed and easygoing, pure and pleasing, with flavors that are subtle rather than flamboyant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOur favorites in the tasting all leaned toward the textbook style: malty, with flavors of chocolate, coffee or, sometimes, dried fruit. Mostly these brown ales were dry and nutty, although sometimes they left an impression of sweetness \u2014 Clay found that some had a surprising flavor of strawberry candy.\n\nWe also noted a few examples of experimentation, some more successful than others. Dogfish Head\u2019s Indian Brown Ale, as its name indicates, combines the characteristics of brown ale with those of an I.P.A., quite successfully in our opinion. It was fuller bodied with more alcohol and hoppy bitterness than in a classic brown ale, but it also had discernible malt and chocolate flavors. Over all, it was well integrated enough to be No. 5 among our favorites.\n\nOther similar efforts were so dominated by hops that we had no clue to the style of the beer in the glass.\n\nNow, I should point out that beer tastings, particularly with styles like brown ale, have gotten complicated for us. For these blind tastings, we include only beers that we have purchased from retail outlets.\n\nSome craft beers are distributed nationally, but many of the best are available only in various local markets. In previous years, we could order beers from different parts of the country. But a recent crackdown on interstate shipping of wine applies to beer as well. So for this tasting, we were restricted to those American brown ales that were available in the New York market.\n\nEven so, our No. 1 beer was the Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale, from Arcata, Calif., which was brewed with hemp seeds. The hemp supposedly adds an herbal component, but for us the beer seemed quite classic, dry with a creamy texture and flavors of malt, chocolate and dried fruits.\n\nNo. 2 was Brooklyn Brown Ale, brewed in Utica, N.Y., which had pure, grainy flavors, while No. 3, Bell\u2019s Best Brown Ale from Comstock, Mich., was balanced and subtle. Black Hog\u2019s Granola Brown Ale, from Oxford, Conn., No. 4 on our list, was actually brewed with granola. It was slightly tart, with a tobacco flavor and a refreshing bitterness that prompts the next sip.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Well-made, subtly delicious and refreshing are high accolades, as far as I am concerned, and brown ale fits that bill. Fortunately, many brewers still seem to feel the same way.\n\nTasting Notes\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd HUMBOLDT BROWN ALE BREWED WITH HEMP SEEDS ARCATA, CALIF., 5.7 PERCENT ($1.75, 12 ounces)\n\nDry, creamy and well balanced with lingering flavors of malt, chocolate and dried fruits.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 BROOKLYN BROWN ALE UTICA, N.Y., 5.6 PERCENT ($2, 12 ounces)\n\nRelaxed and pure with flavors of grain, coffee and chocolate.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 BELL\u2019S BEST BROWN ALE COMSTOCK, MICH., 5.8 PERCENT ($2.25, 12 ounces)\n\nBalanced, subtle and easy to drink, with flavors of coffee and chocolate.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd BLACK HOG GRANOLA BROWN ALE OXFORD, CONN., 5.7 PERCENT ($3, 12 ounces)\n\nSlightly tart, with flavors of coffee and tobacco, and a bitterness that lingers pleasantly.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd DOGFISH HEAD INDIAN BROWN ALE WILMINGTON, DEL., 7.2 PERCENT ($2.50, 12 ounces)\n\nFull-bodied and rich, with flavors of chocolate and malt, well-integrated hop bitterness and a touch of heat.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd CIGAR CITY MADURO BROWN ALE TAMPA, FLA., 5.5 PERCENT ($2, 12 ounces)\n\nRich, creamy aromas, with flavors of chocolate, toffee and grain.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd SWEETWATER GEORGIA BROWN, ATLANTA, 5.8 PERCENT ($2.25, 12 ounces)\n\nRich and thickly textured, with smoky flavors of chocolate and grain.\n\n\u2605\u2605 KELSO NUT BROWN LAGER BROOKLYN, N.Y., 5.75 PERCENT ($2.50, 12 ounces)\n\nWell balanced, with flavors of malt, cola and dried fruits.\n\n\u2605\u2605 SMUTTYNOSE DURTY MUD SEASON HOPPY BROWN ALE, HAMPTON, N.H., 8.4 PERCENT ($2, 12 ounces)\n\nStrong and full-bodied, with flavors of malt, dried fruits and sourdough bread.\n\n\u2605\u2605 ROGUE HAZELNUT BROWN NECTAR, NEWPORT, ORE., 5.6 PERCENT ($2.50, 12 ounces)\n\nNot quite sweet, but on the edge, with flavors of buttercrunch, spice cake and hazelnuts.\n\nWHAT THE STARS MEAN Ratings, up to four stars, reflect the panel\u2019s reaction to the beers, which were tasted with names concealed. The beers represent a selection generally available in good retail shops and restaurants and on the internet. Prices are those paid in the New York region. Tasting coordinator: Bernard Kirsch.\n\nRecipe Pairing: No-Smoker Pastrami\n\nA few months ago an intriguing recipe landed among my emails: pastrami made at home without a smoker. It came from La Bo\u00eete, a spice emporium in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. The tasting of straightforward, eminently quaffable brown ales provided an opportunity to try my hand at pastrami. The recipe, which takes almost a week, mostly unattended, turned out extremely well. The essential ingredients are smoked salt and Prague powder (the curing salt sodium nitrite). Both are sold online. With the beer along for the ride, the result \u2014 reheated and served with warm sauerkraut, or sliced on rye with mustard and sauerkraut \u2014 made for superb cold-weather feasting. Keep the pastrami in mind as you plan for the Super Bowl. FLORENCE FABRICANT\n\nFollow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Kesha became pop\u2019s symbol of the fight against sexual assault when, in a 2014 lawsuit, she accused her producer, Dr. Luke, of inflicting years of abuse. (Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, in turn accused Kesha of fabricating the story in an attempt to escape her recording contracts.)\n\nHer voice breaking, Kesha sang \u201cYou brought the flames and you put me through hell,\u201d and \u201cWhen I\u2019m finished, they won\u2019t even know your name.\u201d\n\nAs she finished, she held back tears and the choir gathered around her in a group embrace.\n\nImmediately afterward, Ms. Cabello, a young Cuban-Amerian singer who had been part of Kesha\u2019s performance, introduced a segment highlighting immigration, with the cameras turning to a view of the Statue of Liberty and Emma Lazarus\u2019s poem \u201cThe New Colossus\u201d (\u201cGive me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\u201d).

It walked a fine line between confrontational political commentary and grounding comedy.\n\nMr. Lamar began surrounded by phalanxes of soldiers in camouflage fatigues as he began his song \u201cXXX\u201d with images of the American flag waving behind him on digital screens. After the words \u201cThis is a satire by Kendrick Lamar\u201d flashed behind him, and a brief appearance by Bono and the Edge, the camera cut to Mr. Chappelle, who said: \u201cThe only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.\u201d\n\nThe show then alternated again between Mr. Lamar and Mr. Chappelle, before ending with Mr. Lamar standing among men in red hoodies who were gunned down one by one.\n\nPhoto\n\nLady Gaga then took the stage to sing her ballads \u201cJoanne\u201d and \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d at a white piano draped with the wings of a bird or an angel. \u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lamar next won the first prize of the night, for best rap/sung performance, for \u201cLOYALTY.,\u201d featuring Rihanna, who told him: \u201cCongrats.

Not so long ago, the show drew eye rolls for over-rewarding elder heroes at the expense of pop\u2019s younger, more vital mainstream. (Think Ray Charles beating Green Day and Kanye West in 2005, or Herbie Hancock defeating Amy Winehouse and, ahem, Mr. West in 2008.)\n\nThe Grammys have generally gotten much better at recognizing the pulse of contemporary music. A diverse crop of nominees this year made it likely that the winners of the four most prestigious categories \u2014 album, record and song of the year, and best new artist \u2014 would not be white men.\n\nAt the same time, gender remained very much still an issue. Lorde was the only woman up for album of the year; she did not perform at the ceremony. Julia Michaels and Ms. Cara have credits in the song of the year category (which recognizes songwriters). Otherwise, the top nominees were predominantly male. As a new report indicated, gender diversity at the Grammys \u2014 and in the music industry at large \u2014 has been abysmal.\n\nVideo\n\nThe white roses.\n\nAs the Grammys approached, it became clear that aside from the performance by Kesha, the industry had no organized response to the #MeToo movement planned along the lines of the Time\u2019s Up campaign that was front and center at the recent Golden Globes.\n\nThat changed just days ago, when a small group of midlevel female music executives called for artists to wear a white rose to the show, as a sign of \u201chope, peace, sympathy and resistance.\u201d By Thursday, a handful of stars including Lady Gaga and Kelly Clarkson had pledged their support. On Sunday, the group circulated a list of music-industry professionals and artists who had signed on to the effort, adding Pink, Dua Lipa and Lil Uzi Vert, among others.\n\nAt the preshow ceremony, several artists wore white roses, although their comments about it were muted. Reba McEntire, the country star, was asked about the white rose on her dress after she won best roots gospel album for \u201cSing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy message is, I want to treat you like I want to be treated,\u201d Ms. McEntire said. \u201cIt\u2019s the golden rule. I think if we did that more often, a lot of these problems would be nonexistent. Let\u2019s just treat people kindly.\u201d\n\nLisa Loeb, who won best children\u2019s album, said, only half in jest: \u201cI know some people are saying the music industry took a little while to catch up with some of the other industries. But we haven\u2019t had as many awards ceremonies.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA preshow controversy.\n\nHours before the show began, it already had a Trump controversy. On Saturday night, CNN aired an interview with Jay-Z as part of the inaugural episode of \u201cThe Van Jones Show,\u201d in which Jay-Z commented on the president\u2019s reported denigration of Haiti and African countries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing and it\u2019s hurtful,\u201d Jay-Z said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s looking down at a whole population of people and it\u2019s so misinformed because these places have beautiful people and beautiful everything. This is the leader of the free world speaking like this.\u201d\n\nBy 8:18 a.m. Sunday, the president fired off his response on Twitter.\n\nA little more than an hour later, Mr. Jones \u2014 who is managed by Jay-Z\u2019s company, Roc Nation \u2014 wrote on Twitter in response, noting that he did ask Jay-Z about the president\u2019s record on reducing black unemployment, and Jay-Z responded that the issue was about treating people with respect and not, as he put it: \u201cTreat me really bad and pay me well.\u201d\n\nSome of the stars at the preshow ceremony seized the opportunity to make political or personal statements.\n\nResidente, a Puerto Rican rapper who founded the influential group Calle 13, won best Latin rock album (for \u201cResidente\u201d). Dedicating his prize \u201cto my country, Puerto Rico,\u201d he spoke about the need to seek out reliable sources of news about the island.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Puerto Rico is horrible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been without electricity for six months now. Some people are dying because they are not eating well. All of that, I had it in my heart when I won this a moment ago.\u201d\n\nC\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, a Haitian-American singer who won best jazz vocal album, addressed President Trump\u2019s comments about Haiti and Africa. \u201cAt some points you have to either laugh or cry,\u201d she said. \u201cI choose to laugh.\u201d\n\nThe political material was also played for laughs. In one segment, Mr. Corden had celebrities audition for the job of reading the audiobook of Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire & Fury,\u201d the much talked about look inside the Trump White House. John Legend, Cher, Snoop Dogg and Cardi B \u2014 a Bronx-born former stripper who has instantly become one of the music industry\u2019s most beloved figures \u2014 all incredulously read excerpts aloud. The winning reader turned out to be Hillary Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bit drew laughs throughout the arena, but not everyone was pleased.\n\n\u201cI have always loved the Grammys but to have artists read the Fire and Fury book killed it,\u201d Nikki Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin great music with trash. Some of us love music without the politics thrown in it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPaying tribute to stars.\n\nFor a year that saw the losses of Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Tom Petty, Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Malcolm Young of AC/DC and Walter Becker of Steely Dan, there were several tributes.\n\nAfter the annual \u201cin memoriam\u201d montage, the rapper Logic, in a hoodie with \u201cYou are not alone\u201d on the back, performed his \u201c1-800-273-8255,\u201d whose title is the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. As on the recording, he was joined by Ms. Cara and Khalid.\n\nSome also happened out of sight of the cameras.

Frank Ocean stated that in regards to last year\u2019s show.\n\nAnd while Drake has said that the reason he is not performing is that the Grammys asked him to cancel one of his own shows to appear, he also did not submit his latest \u201cplaylist\u201d album, \u201cMore Life,\u201d for award consideration.\n\nPhoto\n\nNew York, New York.\n\nThe Grammys were being held in New York for the first time since 2003, when the city was still struggling to attract business and tourism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

(The United States, by contrast has about 323 million.)\n\nRather like Washington, Brussels is an administrative, political and lobbying center, chosen not for its political geography or history but because Belgium came first in the alphabet of the founding six nations and so first hosted the new institutions. Except for the Parliament, it evidently was too much trouble to rotate.\n\nBut for all its importance, Mr. Menasse mused in 2010, he didn\u2019t really know much about how the European Union functioned, or for that matter, about the functionaries who ran it. So he rented an apartment in the center, on the Rue du Vieux March\u00e9 aux Grains \u2014 not in the dull European quarter where the Union institutions are. For a writer who loves cities, cigarettes and wine, that would have been a step too far.\n\nHe set about exploring the place, meeting officials, reading the histories, digging into the archives. \u201cThe European Union is man-made, and everything done by man contains a story,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they do all day, what are their biographies, nationalities, coming together with all these different languages and mentalities, and suddenly the institution has a face.\u201d\n\nThe result is a traditional novel, broad-shouldered, omniscient, almost Balzac-ian, but with terrorism part of a plot centered satirically around an all-too-plausible Brussels idea. An unhappy Greek Cypriot eurocrat, Fenia Xenopoulou, \u201cpromoted\u201d to the underfunded, despised department of culture, is charged with revamping the tarnished image of the European Commission, the bureaucracy that administers the bloc, with a big \u201cJubilee Project\u201d to mark its 50th anniversary.\n\nShe is bitter, and thinks: \u201cWhen the Commissioner for Trade or for Energy, yes, even when the Commissioner for Catching Fish had to leave and go to the bathroom, the discussion was interrupted and people waited until he or she returned. But if the Culture Commissioner had to leave, people kept right on talking, no one even noticed whether she was sitting at the table or on the toilet.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Poland argues that Auschwitz was a solely German crime; Germany says that Muslims, now a part of German and European culture, were innocent; Austria says that a Polish horror must not be used to undermine the foundations of the Austrian state. And so on.\n\nBut Mr. Menasse wants to capture the other Brussels as well, including the headquarters of NATO, so there is another thread \u2014 a police detective whose politically sensitive investigation is frustrated and a Polish hit man who kills the wrong person but escapes amid a chaotic protest by pig farmers (and their pigs), demonstrating against an E.U. regulation blocking the export of pigs\u2019 ears to China. The novel ends, eerily enough, with a terrorist bombing of the Maalbeek subway station, in the European quarter.\n\nOver Austrian white wine and cigarettes in a long interview, partly in English, partly in German, at the Savoy Hotel cigar bar in Berlin, he recalled that day in March 2016, when the station and the airport were hit by suicide bombers, killing 32 people.\n\n\u201cWhen I planned the novel I knew it would end with an attack on the Maalbeek metro station, and then it happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in Brussels then and in the beginning I really couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nBrussels might have been an historical accident as the capital of the bloc, but it was inevitable for Mr. Menasse. \u201cBrussels is the capital of a nation-state without a national idea,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has three official languages and 19 mayors\u201d of individual communes \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s like a lab situation for what\u2019s going on in Europe.\u201d It has no national \u201cleitkultur,\u201d or guiding culture, he said. \u201cIts variety is its richness.\u201d\n\nBut it is the very persistence of nationalism, and the increase in power in the European Union of the Council of nation states, that creates the real democratic deficit felt by Europeans toward the Brussels institutions, Mr. Menasse argues. \u201cThe deficit is the result of defending the national democracies within the European system.\u201d\n\nMr. Menasse seems an archetypal European. But his history has all the echoes of a terrible past. His father was Jewish, and in 1938, he was one of the 10,000 or so Jewish children brought to Britain in the \u201cKindertransport.\u201d Mr. Menasse\u2019s uncle also came to Britain and volunteered for the British Army. He fought the Nazis, helping to liberate Vienna. But when he wanted to remain home, Mr. Menasse recounted, his British commanding officer reminded him that \u201cthe British Army was not a club, and he ordered my uncle to go to Burma, where he had to fight the Japanese.\u201d\n\nMr. Menasse\u2019s father also returned to Vienna, and became something of a national hero as a professional football player. \u201cBut anti-Semitism was not over in Austria just because the war was over,\u201d Mr. Menasse said astringently. \u201cBut they liked my father because he was such a great football player.\u201d\n\nThe success of this novel was a complete surprise, he said. He had spent painful years on another novel into which he had poured his soul, \u201cExpulsion From Hell,\u201d published in 2001, which did badly, he said. \u201cWhen I finished that novel I was full of hopes, that I\u2019d get the Nobel Prize, or else I would die unknown.\u201d He smiled ruefully, lighting another cigarette. \u201cUnknown was right, and I was depressed for two or three years \u2014 if you put five, six, seven years of all your emotional and intellectual capacity into one project and no one looks, you can get depressed.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe worked hard on \u201cDie Hauptstadt,\u201d \u201cbut when I gave it to the publisher I had no expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cI was numb in my soul.\u201d And when nominated for the German Book Prize, \u201cI didn\u2019t care.

He turned to count off the pails from the tower of shiny red, yellow and blue plastic behind him.\n\nI plunked my rupees down on the counter, grabbed the massive pulleys and, as best I could under the weight with a floppy infant tied to my chest, ran.\n\nThe pulleys really were for the baby. Little Liam had a bad case of insomnia.\n\nThe first three months of his life, he was colicky. I had memorized the American Academy of Pediatrics sleep guidelines, but every time we put Liam down on his back, he rolled around like a panicked, upturned turtle and howled. His only sleep, day or night, happened face down on my reclined chest or my husband\u2019s with one of our thumbs plugging his mouth like a pacifier. If we tried to give our arms a break by switching out a pruney thumb for a real pacifier, Liam\u2019s eyelids popped open. He scrunched up in a hot, red ball and wailed like a tiny fire engine.\n\nAfter three mind-numbing months of failed sleep, Rani, Liam\u2019s blessed Tamil nanny, intervened. She tied an old, green cotton sari to a wooden ax handle, added a spring at the top for a bit of bounce, suspended the contraption from a branch of the magnolia tree in our front yard, and laid the baby inside, hammock style.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As the momentum built, she flung Liam up, perpendicular to the ground in front of her, and then plunged him back down on alternating sides of her body. Rani reminded me of skiers dodging moguls in the Olympics, only this athlete wore a daisy-print sari and hurled a tiny, green cocoon around her in a blur of centripetal force.\n\nWhen I suddenly remembered the little larva inside that cocoon was my baby, I gripped the door handle, ready to intervene, but then I heard something I had never heard from Liam when he was exhausted: Silence. Only the cicadas hummed in the yard.\n\nFrom that day forward, Liam was a certified hammock sleeper. Rani insisted that totils were only for daytime naps \u2014 certainly not to be used at night when, in her view, babies should be snuggled safely in bed with their parents \u2014 but having failed at her prescription, not to mention back sleeping, we were desperate. So, instead of listening to Rani, we showered her with unwanted praise and rigged up a hook in our bedroom where we could hang the magical sleep machine at night. Our baby would finally sleep like a baby.\n\nWell, kind of. For a while, Liam agreed to one nap a day with Rani, because she was willing to swing him in the totil for over an hour until he fell asleep. But our nights were punctuated with regular nursing breaks every two hours, after which Liam expected to be agitated back into unconsciousness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAround five months of age, Liam started waking up for the day at 4 a.m. I realized we were in bad shape, that we were just conditioning our kid to associate sleep with perpetual oscillation. Moving him to the terra firma of his unused crib and letting him cry it out was the obvious solution, but with my nerves so frayed from exhaustion, I couldn\u2019t take a full night of screaming. So, I caved. Halfway through each night, I relocated from my bed to a comforter on the cold floor under Liam\u2019s totil. I alternately dozed and batted at the baby hammock when he whistled every 20 minutes for rocking service.\n\nThus humbly situated and desperately sleep deprived, one morning I hallucinated that we had installed a pulley system in our bedroom rafters to swing our addicted child from the comfort of our flannel sheets.\n\nAt breakfast, I told Tim about my dream, and within two hours I was at the hardware shop. When I got home, Tim climbed up the ladder and installed one pulley above Liam\u2019s totil and one above our bed, connecting them with rope. As a finishing touch, we tied one of Liam\u2019s rejected pacifiers to our end of the rope as a handle.\n\nThat night, when the boy cried, we yanked on the rope and the room filled with the sounds of a small factory: metal groaning, rope rubbing over hardware. Liam fell silent. Tim and I smothered anxious giggles under the warmth of our down comforter and smiled up at the pacifier dangling above our heads. We knew it wouldn\u2019t last, but in that moment we were so desperate for a reprieve from the exhaustion that suspending our baby in midair from a Rube Goldberg machine felt like the perfect sleep solution.", "title": "Building a Baby Sleep Machine in India", "authors": ["Katie Quirk"]}

One existing 990-foot tunnel, and a second, new one of the same length, will link the two concourses at a cost of nearly $140 million. The airport is spending more than $90 million to construct 14 miles of new roadway. A station for the light-rail line connecting the airport to downtown Salt Lake City will be moved closer to the new terminal.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen the facilities are finished in 2023, they will provide this fast-growing metropolitan area, home to 80 percent of Utah\u2019s three million residents, with improved efficiency at one of the country\u2019s busiest airports, serving nine airlines with 329 daily flights. Traffic has climbed to more than 23 million travelers annually in an airport designed to serve fewer than half that number.\n\nTo ease congestion, Delta Air Lines, which serves 70 percent of the airport\u2019s passengers, agreed to help finance the reconstruction.\n\n\u201cPlanning for this project goes back to the early 2000s master plan, when we were thinking about how to make the existing airport layout work,\u201d said Bill Wyatt, the airport\u2019s executive director. \u201cDelta sat down and also tried to think how they could make that work operationally. They concluded they couldn\u2019t make it work operationally. Everybody began to focus on this new concept, which we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\nDelta, which earned $39.6 billon in total revenue in 2016, uses the hub principally as a link between coastal and mountain cities. Delta\u2019s investment in the airport is a share of the $1.2 billion the airline is spending annually over the next decade to expand and modernize air transport facilities around the country, according to company figures. The money would be spent on airport projects in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Salt Lake City and Seattle, Morgan Durrant, a company spokesman, said in an email message.\n\nMike Williams, the program director for the airport\u2019s Terminal Redevelopment Program, said the nationwide airport reconstruction effort started in 2008, as the country was in the grip of the Great Recession. Three years after a downturn in the American airline industry pitched Delta into bankruptcy in 2005, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport started to build its $1.4 billion, 1.2 million-square-foot Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal.\n\nThe Atlanta terminal opened in 2012 just as fuel prices moderated, the national economy recovered and Americans began filling airline seats and overcrowding the country\u2019s old airports.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The project included a $2.1 billion remodeling and expansion of the international terminal and the addition of a $1.6 billion, 750,000-square-foot midfield terminal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nExpansion is needed. In 2016, 823 million passengers boarded airliners in the United States, 25 million more than in the previous year. Airport and airline executives, mindful of criticism about old facilities and responsive to the growing demand, have escalated construction projects into a nationwide building boom, with New York-area airports leading the way.\n\nLaGuardia is spending $8 billion to replace four terminals with one, build a new parking structure, connect the airport more efficiently to public transit and gain more space for taxiways. Newark Liberty International Airport just broke ground on a $2.4 billion project, much of the money to be spent replacing 44-year-old Terminal A with a one-million-square-foot facility and a 3,000-space parking deck. And Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced a $10 billion project this year to renovate and expand passenger terminals and improve ground transportation at Kennedy International Airport.\n\nOther big airport construction projects include an investment of nearly $800 million at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to build a 450,000-square-foot international terminal to replace one that dates to the 1970s. Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport broke ground almost two years ago on a $807 million, 760,000-square-foot terminal. And Orlando International Airport is in the midst of a $1.1 billion renovation and expansion of its North Terminal, as well as improvements to other facilities.\n\nRebuilding the Salt Lake City airport has attracted broad support from residents, not only because it is financed almost entirely without taxpayer funds but also because the new terminals will enhance one of the most conveniently situated major airports in the country. From almost anywhere in the city or its outskirts, the airport is less than a half-hour car or train ride away.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nTwo features of design and construction distinguish the reconstruction: its linear layout, and the lack of disruption to the airport\u2019s operation.\n\nWhen the project is finished, the airport will consist of an airy central terminal flanked by the two wings of its 3,700-foot-long South Concourse. In front of that will be the 3,400-foot-long North Concourse.\n\nThe unbent concourses, designed by the architecture and engineering firm HOK, are characteristic of airport reconstruction projects to accommodate big planes. The three old terminals, dating to the 1960s, are connected by an outdoor sidewalk and were upgraded sporadically through the decades with clusters of gates served by fans of tightly spaced jet bridges.\n\nThe project can occur without disruption because the 7,800-acre airport has enough room to build all the new facilities, including the first wing of the South Concourse. When gates in the new concourses are ready to serve passengers, the airport will close and demolish the old terminals, then build the rest of the South Concourse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very flexible and efficient design,\u201d Mr. Wyatt said. \u201cIf we need more space after the initial phase of construction, you can add capacity as far as the eye can see, virtually without any disruption at all.\u201d", "title": "Building a Modern Airport in Salt Lake City From One Well Past Its Prime", "authors": ["Keith Schneider", "Square Feet"]}

At one point, there was one \u201cFive Roses\u201d cookbook for every four Canadian households, said Ms. Driver, the bibliographer.\n\nBy midcentury, Eaton\u2019s department store in Toronto included a butter tart in its boxed picnic lunches, and Canadian Betty Crockers like Edith Adams (the fictional home economist of The Vancouver Sun) and Rita Martin (also fictional, with a name pronounceable in French and English) evangelized the tart, along with real-life home economists like Kate Aitken.", "title": "Butter Tarts, Canada\u2019s Humble Favorite, Have Much to Love", "authors": []}

In June, Concord paid almost $600 million for Imagem, which includes the Rodgers & Hammerstein catalog.

Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School. \u201cSo he tried to understand why people resist innovation, and what can be done to make them feel comfortable with change.\u201d\n\nProfessor Juma\u2019s latest book, \u201cInnovation and Its Enemies\u201d (2016), described how technological change is often greeted with public skepticism. Beneath such opposition, he argued, is the belief that only a small segment of society will benefit from potential progress, while the much broader society bears the greatest risk.\n\nSuccessful policymaking must take into account people\u2019s feelings, he believed. When Professor Juma helped design a stove for use in developing countries, its metallic cylinder was replaced with a clay lining to improve efficiency. But the prototype caused less smoke \u2014 attracting more mosquitoes \u2014 and villagers worried that metal workers could lose their jobs. A later model used metal and clay.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all development is experimental; no one knows what they are doing,\u201d Professor Juma said with a laugh in 2014. \u201cAfricans need the chance to experiment as well. They will make mistakes, but they can learn from them, too.\u201d\n\nProfessor Juma could be lighthearted in the classroom or in public in order to make his points. With more than 100,000 followers on Twitter, he shared with them cartoons that teased skeptics of science and innovation. One of his last posts featured a game show called \u201cFacts Don\u2019t Matter.\u201d In it, a contestant is told: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jeannie, your answer was correct, but Kevin shouted his incorrect answer over yours, so he gets the points.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cCalestous was very serious about getting his work right, but he was not serious about himself,\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said. \u201cHe shared his enjoyment of the research and teaching, though he was working on life-or-death issues for many people. He was incredibly optimistic.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

He grew up nearby in Port Victoria.\n\n\u201cPort Victoria was as remote as it gets \u2014 a small fishing village on Lake Victoria at Kenya\u2019s westernmost point,\u201d said Ken Kobe, who taught Professor Juma while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer there in 1969-70.\n\nAfter graduating from Egoji Teachers\u2019 Training College in central Kenya in 1974, Professor Juma became a science teacher in Mombasa, a port city on the Indian Ocean. He went on to write so many letters to the editor of the Nairobi-based newspaper The Daily Nation that it hired him in 1978 to be its first full-time science and environment correspondent.\n\nWangari Maathai, the environmentalist who became the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize, hired Professor Juma to work at a nonprofit in Nairobi. Encouraged by Ms. Maathai, he won a scholarship and earned a doctorate in science and technology policy studies in 1987 from the University of Sussex in England.\n\nHe met his wife, who also works in sustainable development, at a conference in Montreal. They married in 1987 and moved to Kenya.\n\nProfessor Juma experienced two major ecological disruptions in his childhood, Ms. Field-Juma said. One was the introduction of Nile perch to Lake Victoria to help the fishing industry. Though it did benefit the area economically for a time, it also contributed to the depletion, to near-extinction, of stocks of many other types of fish in the lake.\n\nThe second change was the British colonial government\u2019s deforestation of much of the Port Victoria region, which dried out what had been a wet and fertile area. \u201cThe microclimate of that region was irreversibly changed,\u201d Ms. Field-Juma said.\n\nOn his return to Kenya with his wife, he sought a scientific solution to the agricultural crisis.\n\n\u201cI started to run into all the people who had collected seeds of fruits and vegetables, mostly fruits, that had disappeared,\u201d he said in an interview in 2003. \u201cAnd some of them explained to me that those fruits have disappeared because the area had dried up. And they would pose this question to me: \u2018You scientists, are you able to grow these fruits in places where there is less water?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Juma recognized the potential of genetic modification to address such issues and to help solve Africa\u2019s broader agricultural problems, distilling his thinking in the 1989 book \u201cThe Gene Hunters.\u201d\n\nThe book helped pave the way for the Convention on Biological Diversity, a United Nations treaty signed by more than 150 governments in 1992 to protect the survival of diverse species and ecosystems.\n\nBesides his wife, he is survived by his son, Eric, and his sister, Roselyda Nanjala.\n\nUntil he was hospitalized, Professor Juma had planned to host about 20 international students for Thanksgiving in Cambridge. Instead, he joined them from the hospital by Skype, sharing stories and discussing development with them.\n\n\u201cIt was just what he wanted,\u201d Ms. Field-Juma said, \u201cand he wasn\u2019t even there.\u201d", "title": "Calestous Juma, 64, Dies; Sought Innovation in African Agriculture", "authors": ["Adeel Hassan"]}

Lawyers also point out that the Trump administration has not yet appointed its own federal prosecutors in California.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sessions\u2019s memo does not create any additional uncertainty that did not already exist.\u201d\n\nBut the uncertainty is nonetheless substantial. The Sessions announcement may give further pause to large companies that have been reluctant to invest in the marijuana business because of fear of retaliation by federal authorities. And small-scale veterans of the industry \u2014 the cottage marijuana businesses in the famed Emerald Triangle of Northern California, among others \u2014 face potential threats of forfeiture, as they always have. If prosecutors were to crack down, sellers and anyone caught in possession of the drug could go to jail.\n\nYet as a practical matter, officials from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration have said that combating opioid trafficking is much more important than cracking down on marijuana given the agency\u2019s stretched resources.\n\nRuss Baer, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said in an interview last year that most of the agency\u2019s resources were being spent on combating opioids. \u201cWe are spread thin,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal law enforcement is also stretched. Thomas D. Allman, the sheriff of Mendocino County, one of the three counties in the Emerald Triangle, said Thursday that investigating marijuana cultivation was not a high priority, unless it was \u201cout of control\u201d or involved other crimes, such as the environmental damage.\n\n\u201cIf somebody is obeying state law, I\u2019m going to say there are not many local law enforcement agencies who are going to be rushing out to do an investigation,\u201d Sheriff Allman said. \u201cThere are many other crimes we can focus on that impact the safety of the community.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, a cannabis industry group, says while marijuana growers are concerned about the more aggressive federal posture, longtime growers have seen it before.\n\n\u201cFolks that have been at this for a few generations remember that this is a cycle,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cFederal enforcement ebbs and flows and it has for decades. This is another enforcement cycle but this time we have a state government that is working with us. And frankly enforcement wasn\u2019t all that effective in the past.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, among customers at the Berkeley Patients Group, a dispensary that sells recreational marijuana, there was defiance and eye-rolling among those asked about the Sessions memo.\n\n\u201cTo me, they\u2019ve always wanted to destroy everything Obama did. It\u2019s all in that vein,\u201d said Barry Alexander, 61, a supervisor at a Whole Foods supermarket.

Finney, an expert in fire behavior for the U.S. Forest Service and an author of the study, says California forests are much more vulnerable now because, paradoxically, they have been better protected. In their natural state, forests were regularly thinned by fire but the billions of dollars that the state spends aggressively fighting wildfires and restrictions on logging have allowed forests to accumulate an overload of vegetation.\n\n\u201cWe had forests that were very resilient to weather variations and insect disturbances in the past \u2014 maintained by frequent fire on the order of every year, or every few years at the most,\u201d Mr. Finney said.

The entrepreneurs who launched Oscar Health, one of the insurance start-ups to sell policies under the Affordable Care Act, wanted to create something radically different from the competition. But it has had a difficult time living up its initial hopes and has lost substantial sums in what has proved to be a very challenging business.\n\nClassic disruption rarely applies in health care\n\nMost disruptive companies enter a market with a product that is lower in value than that of market incumbents, but much lower in cost. That\u2019s the model for classic disrupters, like Southwest Airlines, MP3s or Japanese carmakers. Health care tends to be different, because consumers don\u2019t usually want to settle for a lower-quality product, even if it is substantially cheaper.\n\nAmitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard, said that perhaps the easiest way to squeeze a lot of dollars out of the health care system would be to reduce what he called \u201clow-value services\u201d \u2014 health care treatments that are expensive, but only slightly more effective than cheaper options.\n\nBut reducing their use is hard because many people still want the better therapy, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good value.

It could, say, lower the prices paid to monopoly hospitals, eliminate services that have no value or tighten the supply chain for drugs. Optimists about the venture say, if the company succeeds, it will most likely do so by finding strategies that improve care and reduce cost.\n\nThese are really different companies, with different priorities\n\nThe three companies are each large but also very different, and they may have different priorities about how to structure their health benefits.", "title": "Can Amazon and Friends Handle Health Care?

First and foremost, it\u2019s been to reinforce to Hezbollah and Iran, through many channels, that they can\u2019t out-crazy Israel. That is, if Hezbollah and Iran think they can place rocket launchers in densely populated Lebanese and Syrian villages and towns \u2014 and expect that Israel will not take them out if it requires large collateral civilian casualties \u2014 they are as wrong today as they were in 2006.\n\nIsraeli military planners are more convinced than ever that the key reason Hezbollah has avoided major conflict with Israel since the big Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon in 2006 is that Israel\u2019s Air Force \u2014 without mercy or restraint \u2014 pounded Lebanese infrastructure, Hezbollah offices and military targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut \u2014 not to kill civilians but not to be deterred by them, either, if they were nested amid Hezbollah weapons or headquarters.\n\nYes, it was ugly and brutal, say Israeli planners, but it worked. This is not Scandinavia. \u201cThe reality here starts where your imagination ends,\u201d said one Israeli officer. Sometimes only crazy can stop crazy. And Hezbollah\u2019s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, definitely got the message. He declared after the 2006 war that he never would have set off that conflict had he known beforehand that Israel would inflict that much damage on his Shiite supporters and their property \u2014 \u201cabsolutely not,\u201d he said.\n\nIsraeli military planners hope he remembers that, and that Iran does, too. They say that if Tehran thinks it can launch a proxy war against Israel from Lebanon and Syria \u2014 while the Iranian home front is untouched \u2014 it should think again. Israel has not purchased Dolphin-class submarines that can operate in the Persian Gulf, and armed them with cruise missiles, for deep-sea fishing.\n\nBut Iran is a determined and wily foe. It has been perfecting its ability to convert dumb surface-to-air missiles, with 1970s technology, into smart, precise surface-to-surface rockets, by reconfiguring them with GPS links, inertial navigation systems, dynamic wings and smart cards. Iran\u2019s ally in Yemen, the Houthis, has used these types of rockets in recent months.\n\nThe Israelis told Putin that they would not allow Iran to build such rocket facilities in Lebanon or to transfer such precision missiles to Hezbollah in Lebanon via any depots or factories in Syria, and that Russia should not interfere with Israeli operations against them. It\u2019s not clear Putin made any promises.\n\nThis is no small matter. Today, if Hezbollah, with its less-precise area rockets, wanted to hit a specific Israeli military building or high-tech factory from Lebanon, it would probably have to launch 25 dumb missiles. By deploying the Iranian upgrades it would have to fire only one \u2014 with a very high probability of hitting the target within 30 meters, meaning it could inflict heavy damage on Israel\u2019s infrastructure in a very short period of time.", "title": "Opinion | Can Crazy Still Keep the Peace Between Israel and Iran?", "authors": []}

So they don\u2019t put a lot of stock in those messengers, and indeed, hearing Democrats sling these kinds of labels around will probably just stir up resentment against the left.\n\nIn an essay in Salon in May 2016 that contended that Trump\u2019s path to victory was much easier than conventional wisdom had it, Al-Gharbi argued that Democrats and\n\nprogressives have done a great job framing racial inequality, feminism and LGBTQ rights as part of the same basic struggle. However, this association works both ways. Accusations of misogyny, for instance, are often heard in the context of a fundamentally anti-white, anti-Christian culture war \u2014 a zero-sum campaign waged against ordinary hard-working Americans by condescending and politically-correct liberal elites.\n\nThe issue of sexual harassment is a useful tool to mobilize Democratic voters in liberal states and districts, according to Leonie Huddy, a political scientist at Stonybrook, but, like Al-Gharbi, Huddy thinks that such tactics should be deployed with caution:\n\nFeminism and anti-feminism are essentially baked into the political parties at this point and it is difficult to believe that there are many people left for the parties to capture on the basis of gender-linked issues including sexual harassment.\n\nHuddy warned specifically against Democrats adopting \u201ca singular focus on harassment and gender issues\u201d given the 2016 election outcome:\n\nGender issues were front and center in Clinton\u2019s campaign and that had something of a polarizing effect that likely contributed to weaker support for Clinton among white working class men.\n\nMore important, according to Huddy,\n\nDemocrats need to figure out how to combine issues linked to gender/feminism, race, and immigration \u2014 identity politics \u2014 into a more coherent economic framework that reduces the sense that one group wins at another group\u2019s expense.\n\nIn a recent paper, \u201cTrending Towards Traditionalism? Changes in Youths\u2019 Gender Ideology,\u201d two sociologists, Joanna Pepin, of the University of Maryland, and David Cotter, of Union College, found evidence of a retrenchment on key gender issues among the young.\n\nUsing polls of high school seniors over the past 40 years \u2014 conducted by the Monitoring The Future project at the University of Michigan\u2019s Survey Research Center \u2014 Pepin and Cotter documented a shift on two key questions: \u201cIt is usually better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family\u201d and \u201cthe husband should make all the important decisions in the family.\u201d The accompanying chart shows the trend line on both of those questions.", "title": "Opinion | Can Democrats Follow #MeToo to Victory?", "authors": []}

A six-figure price tag tends to deter digital impulse buys. Prints, photographs and design objects, which generally exist in multiples, are better suited to online sales platforms, but even here, concerns about condition, authenticity and provenance can be a deterrent.\n\n\u201cThe online space is most active in the sub-$100,000 category,\u201d Mr. Cwilich said. \u201cThe art market is opaque and intimidating, but the internet does give more people a chance to participate.\u201d The internet also gave trading more \u201cvelocity,\u201d he said.\n\nArtsy, which is based in New York, hopes to speed things up even more by opening a 3,500-square-foot hub in the Whitechapel district of London. The team in the British capital will oversee the company\u2019s partnerships with galleries in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nMore than 2,000 galleries pay monthly subscriptions of, typically, $400 to $1,000 a month, to advertise works on Artsy, according to Mr. Cwilich, who started the company in 2012 with Carter Cleveland. Artsy generates further revenue by arranging and administering online bids at live auctions, for which it receives a 5 percent commission on successful sales. Privately owned, the company doesn\u2019t report revenues, profits or losses.\n\nPrices remain a major hurdle for the expansion of the digital art trade, not just because they are often so high, but because of their lack of availability. Consumers looking to buy, say, a shirt online can browse numerous fashion websites where thousands of items are clearly labeled and priced. But all too often, prices on art dealers\u2019 websites \u2014 and in their galleries and booths at fairs \u2014 are \u201con application,\u201d a process that can be both laborious and forbidding.\n\nThat remains the norm at Artsy, but some dealers are becoming more open. Mr. Cwilich said that about a third of the works on the site carried prices. Even Gagosian, an international gallery giant that is traditionally secretive about how much its art costs, is now showing prices for works selling for less than $100,000 by artists such as Damien Hirst and Ed Ruscha.\n\nPhoto\n\nLarry Gagosian, the gallery\u2019s founder, was an investor in a $50 million Artsy fund-raising round that closed in July 2017. Other investors include Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb; and Sky Dayton, founder of the digital services company, EarthLink.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Indian collector Saloni Doshi, who runs the Space 118 artists\u2019 studio project in Mumbai, India, said she read articles on Artsy to find out what was going on. But, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t buy through them.\u201d\n\nMs. Doshi said she preferred to purchase contemporary art online from Paddle8. \u201cYou see the price, then you just bid,\u201d she said. \u201cArtsy isn\u2019t very buyer-friendly.

Since May, Christie\u2019s website has listed results from its online-only auctions, which last year had an average lot price of $7,305, up from $6,047 the year before. Competitors such as Sotheby\u2019s and Paddle8 do not make this information available.\n\nAccording to Marc Sands, Christie\u2019s chief marketing officer, \u201cAs a potential consignor or buyer, it\u2019s important to look at what has happened to interpret value.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt aids transparency,\u201d he added.\n\nResults achieved for artworks resold at live auctions can be viewed at subscription websites such as Artnet and Artprice. But the \u201cprimary market\u201d prices that galleries charge for new works by contemporary artists remain offline, with many dealers regarding them as trade secrets available only to insiders.\n\nA free app, Magnus, which started in 2016, aims to rip through this veil of exclusivity. Smartphone users simply point their device at an artwork in a gallery or fair and visual recognition technology (most times) quickly supplies dealer and auction prices for the relevant artist. In that way, Magnus works for art in a similar fashion to that in which Shazam, the popular song-identifying app, works for music.\n\nMagnus\u2019s database contains about 10 million prices, compiled through crowdsourcing. About 10 percent of those are from the primary market, according to the app\u2019s founder, Magnus Resch, a German entrepreneur based in New York.\n\n\u201cWe are disrupting the art market by making it more transparent,\u201d Mr. Resch said in an email. \u201cMy generation wants all information immediately, and not go through a beauty contest while waiting for the director of the gallery to come and check me out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNot surprisingly, some in the art world have resented those efforts. Late in 2016, Magnus was withdrawn for five months from the Apple app store, after accusations that data had been taken from rival platforms and from individual galleries. But the app, with contested information removed from its database, is now available again and is still free, although Mr. Resch said he was \u201cin the process of developing innovative features and additional services for professional users for which we can charge.\u201d\n\nMr. Resch said the app was \u201cparticularly strong\u201d at art fairs, estimating that it revealed around 80 percent of the prices at events such as Art Basel. But for the moment, business at those fairs continues to be dominated by an older generation of market-savvy buyers who have cultivated personal relationships with gallerists.\n\n\u201cWhy would I use Artsy or Magnus? I have access to the prices,\u201d said one of those, Alain Servais, 54, a Brussels-based collector who attends at least 20 contemporary art fairs per year. \u201cIf you bring too much transparency to the market, you risk harming the mythmaking machine that makes the prices so high,\u201d Mr. Servais added. \u201cYou are not longer part of a clique. Art becomes a common thing.\u201d\n\nMyths and mystique might be keeping prices high at the moment. But sooner or later, the art business is going to have to find a way of engaging the next generation of buyers.

{"date": "2018-01-11 00:00:00", "text": "There is not strong evidence for that contention.\n\n\u201cHigher earnings are positively correlated with longer lifespan,\u201d says a guidance document published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Thursday.\n\nOne comprehensive review of existing studies found strong evidence that unemployment is generally harmful to health, including higher mortality; poorer general health; poorer mental health; and higher medical consultation and hospital admission rates. Another academic analysis found strong evidence for a protective effect of employment on depression and general mental health. A 2013 Gallup poll found that unemployed Americans are more than twice as likely as those with full-time jobs to say they currently have or are being treated for depression. Other community engagement activities such as volunteering are also associated with improved health outcomes, and it can lead to paid employment.\n\n(One citation in that passage is to a health insurer\u2019s survey that asked people who volunteer how it made them feel.)\n\nBut it is not at all clear how much work or income alone improve health. In fact, there\u2019s quite a lot of evidence that causality can move in the opposite direction, since health problems can make it difficult to work or go to school. It might be, as the guidance document suggests, that people who don\u2019t work become depressed. Or it could be that some people who are depressed have a harder time getting or keeping a job. Treating their depression might ease their symptoms and improve their employment prospects. \u201cHaving the medical coverage helps people to get a job,\u201d said LaDonna Pavetti, a vice president at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who has studied work requirements extensively.\n\nSome research does suggest that a boost to income can improve people\u2019s health. Yet a study that examined the earned-income tax credit, a program established specifically to raise the incomes of low-wage workers, wasn\u2019t able to find any clear health benefit.\n\nMore crucially, a work requirement does not guarantee that Medicaid beneficiaries will have an increased income or even find a job. Some people may be nudged by a work requirement into work they wouldn\u2019t have done otherwise. But others may simply be kicked out of the health insurance program because they aren\u2019t able to meet the requirement. States will be allowed to cut off Medicaid benefits to people who can\u2019t demonstrate that they\u2019ve completed the required number of work or activity hours or who don\u2019t qualify for an exception related to a health problem or having a young child. Others might meet the work requirement rule and keep their Medicaid, but still remain poor, because they are able to get only a volunteer or part-time job that keeps their income low.\n\nStudies of the Medicaid population suggest that most of them work already or would qualify for exceptions. The guidance says that states will need to carve out exceptions for people who are medically frail and for people with opioid addictions, so they won\u2019t lose their benefits. But anyone who fails to complete or document their required work and loses benefits won\u2019t get the health benefits of Medicaid coverage or any of the described health benefits that the administration says come from work. States that have asked for work requirements \u2014 10 have submitted applications already \u2014 have estimated reductions in Medicaid enrollment, and not all because of people finding other kinds of health coverage.", "title": "Can Requiring People to Work Make Them Healthier?", "authors": []}

But those policies have a checkered track record.\n\nIn 2000, their first major proponent, the former president and Nobel Peace laureate Kim Dae-jung, secretly and illegally paid Kim Jong-il, North Korea\u2019s leader at the time, hundreds of millions of dollars to secure a summit. Roh Moo-hyun, the next South Korean president, later strained relations with the United States by trying to take on a balancing role between Washington and Pyongyang \u2014 playing arbiter, in other words, between the ally committed to Seoul\u2019s military protection and the regime committed to Seoul\u2019s destruction.\n\nTo his credit, in his short time in office Mr. Moon \u2014 who, by the way, was one of Mr. Roh\u2019s top advisers during those troubled years \u2014 has leavened his own sunshine yearnings with a strong dose of realpolitik. He has pushed for missile defense, for example, as well as for close coordination over international sanctions with the United States despite new strains with President Trump. Last week, Mr. Moon is reported to have said of the upcoming talks with North Korea, \u201cI will not just na\u00efvely push for dialogue as in the past.\u201d\n\nStill, Pyongyang seems to have kept in reserve the option of going on a charm offensive with him. It has already dismissed President Trump as a \u201cdotard.\u201d It called Barack Obama a \u201cwicked black monkey.\u201d It cursed Park Geun-hye, the previous president of South Korea, as an \u201cold, insane bitch.\u201d But it has had nothing bad to say about Mr. Moon (yet).\n\nMeanwhile, the urgency of the North\u2019s diplomatic drive can be explained by both recent wins and menacing losses ahead. Over the past several years, Pyongyang has tested atomic bombs \u2014 and, it claims, one hydrogen device \u2014 and has launched intercontinental missiles. According to Mr. Kim, the United States mainland is now \u201cwithin range of our nuclear strike\u201d and his defense sector is moving to \u201cmass produce\u201d nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.\n\nAll the same, the North\u2019s military rests on an economic base that is not only tiny, but also notoriously dysfunctional and desperately dependent on foreign resources and so uniquely vulnerable to serious sanctions. The United Nations Security Council has voted for new and potentially crippling penalties. China \u2014 North Korea\u2019s main financial backer \u2014 appears finally ready to reconsider, and reduce, its support.\n\nTo date, at least by outward appearance, the North Korean economy has not been much fazed by international sanctions. But we do not know how fast the North is spending down its reserves. Only Mr. Kim does.\n\nIf Mr. Kim is indeed in a race against the clock to forestall economic disaster at home, importuning Seoul to help lift (or at least ignore) international sanctions, relax nuclear counter-proliferation efforts and revive sunshine economic programs could be the most expeditious way to get out of a bind.", "title": "Opinion | Can South Korea Avoid Getting Played by the North?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-03 00:00:00", "text": "There are three approaches state officials could use to undercut the tax law. First, they could encourage families to donate money to the state government by offering them a credit for those gifts against state income taxes. The idea would be to turn state taxes into charitable donations that are deductible against the federal income tax. This might sound like a gimmick that the Internal Revenue Service could easily shut down. But David Kamin, a law professor at New York University, says there is precedent supporting such a policy. For example, some states offer tax credits to people who donate money to private schools, and these donations also qualify for the federal charity deduction.\n\nUnder the second approach, which is advocated by the economist Dean Baker, state governments would replace their income taxes with payroll taxes paid by employers. Those kinds of taxes \u2014 like the one for unemployment insurance coverage \u2014 are deductible for businesses under the Republican tax law. That switch would mean that employers could pay their workers less, but take-home pay would stay the same because employees wouldn\u2019t be on the hook for paying state income taxes.\n\nBut other experts warn that switching to a payroll tax would be complicated and could have unintended consequences if states don\u2019t put in place other safeguards. For example, it might not be possible for employers to reduce the wages of workers who are covered by union contracts or who earn the minimum wage. A switch to a payroll tax might also tempt some businesses to move to nearby states that do not have such a tax.\n\nThe third approach is for states to file a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the tax law. Mr. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would file such a suit, claiming that the provision limiting deductibility of state and local taxes amounts to double taxation. Other officials, including the governor-elect of New Jersey, Phil Murphy, are considering similar legal action. But experts say that such lawsuits are unlikely to succeed because they ask courts to read the 16th Amendment, which authorized the federal income tax, very broadly. Further, Congress already restricts the use of the state and local tax deduction through the alternative minimum tax, says Kim Rueben of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The new law will reduce the number of people who end up paying the alternative minimum tax.\n\nIt is hard to say if any of these maneuvers would be successful. But they could potentially cost the federal government billions of dollars in tax revenue. No doubt Republicans in Washington would be peeved and might try to pass legislation that seeks to outlaw or reduce the effectiveness of these state policies. But that might not be an option if Democrats gain House seats or take control of one or both chambers of Congress in the November election \u2014 an outcome that has probably become more likely thanks to the tax law.\n\nNone of this should come as a surprise. Republican leaders invited taxpayers and state governments to play tax avoidance games by rushing through an unpopular mess of a tax bill that, over time, will benefit few and hurt many.", "title": "Opinion | Can States Fix the G.O.P.

On a recent day I went for a walk with my sister in the snowy Massachusetts countryside, the app counted less than half my steps as outdoor activity.\n\nFrustrated, I turned to reviews on Reddit, Twitter, and app stores where missing points are a common theme.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201c Where are my missing 3000 steps!\u201d Ian Wynne, a sports performance consultant in Britain, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is happening a little too often.\u201d\n\nTo commiserate, I called Mr. Wynne, who won a bronze medal in kayaking at the Athens Olympics in 2004.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little frustrating when you are outside and you are sure that you have taken 1,000 more steps than it claims,\u201d Mr. Wynne said. Nevertheless, he planned to continue using Sweatcoin. He regularly exercised, he said, and liked the idea of getting extra credit for the outdoor activities he was already doing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Fomenko, the Sweatcoin co-founder, told me that the app\u2019s \u201cdraconian algorithm\u201d is meant to deter cheating techniques like, say, strapping a phone to a pet dog. And that fraud-deterrence system may verify fewer steps than users expect, he said.\n\nIn practice, according to the app\u2019s help section, that means the Sweatcoin algorithm typically verifies 65 percent of a user\u2019s total steps. It also means that some frequent consumer behaviors \u2014 using a protective smartphone cover, walking while connected to public Wi-Fi, walking slowly with small children \u2014 could reduce your step count.\n\nIn a follow-up email, Sweatcoin\u2019s co-founders said that they would soon hire a data science team \u201cto help us improve the speed and accuracy of this algorithm.\u201d They also said they were working on a verification algorithm to count indoor activity.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe current system seemed preposterous to me. What\u2019s the point of an unpredictable fitness app?\n\nNevertheless, after about two weeks of intermittent use, I had earned 47.52 sweatcoins. I was feeling pretty good \u2014 a Fitbit could soon be mine.\n\nThen I learned that the rewards could also be fickle.\n\nSweatcoin generates revenue by marketing other companies\u2019 products to its users. When a user redeems reward points for a product through Sweatcoin, the maker of that product pays Sweatcoin a fee.\n\nBut the Fitbit and some other fitness devices on offer when I signed up had disappeared from the app before I could earn one. Now the reward choices included a workout app for 30 sweatcoins that didn\u2019t interest me \u2014 or the iPhone X for a whopping 20,000 sweatcoins. I calculated that, if I took 13,000 total steps every day, it would take me more than five years to get that iPhone.\n\nI felt like Sweatcoin, by offering rewards that seemed near impossible to obtain, could end up demotivating the very people it was trying to nudge to walk more.\n\nAs a reporter who regularly covers data privacy, I also couldn\u2019t help being troubled by the possibility that the app could share or sell the trove of location and motion data it collects from users.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSweatcoin\u2019s founders said they would never do such a thing. \u201cLet me make it very, very clear,\u201d Mr. Derlyatka said, \u201cwe never, ever sell anybody\u2019s user data to any outside parties.\u201d If the fitness start-up were ever acquired by another company, however, the app\u2019s privacy policy states that \u201cpersonal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest downside for me was feeling like Sweatcoin\u2019s behavioral engineering cheapened important experiences. When I used the app, instead of concentrating on the friends I was walking with, I kept checking to see how close I was to being able to redeem my sweatcoins for that Fitbit.\n\nNo trinket or gift card is worth that distraction.", "title": "Can Sweatcoin, a Hot Fitness App, Keep You Off the Couch?", "authors": ["Natasha Singer"]}
{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "John Hughes\u2019s movie \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d (1985) is a classic movie of its genre precisely because it captures this feature of the teenage experience. Five teenagers from different cliques (\u201ca brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal\u201d) bond during enforced Saturday detention. Over the hours together, they discover a common humanity that transcends the social roles into which each had been slotted.\n\nHaving made themselves vulnerable to one another, they ask themselves, in the movie\u2019s climactic scene, whether they will acknowledge one another in school on Monday. Claire (\u201cthe princess\u201d) answers in the negative and is consequently accused by Bender (\u201cthe criminal\u201d) of being nothing more than what she initially seemed: \u201cYou just stick to the things that you know: shopping, nail polish, your father\u2019s BMW \u2026.\u201d Claire in turn, accuses Bender of being unwilling to face the facts. She says, \u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d The eventual romantic resolution of this dispute \u2014 the two characters kiss \u2014 is a cinematic way of signaling that the correct attitude to their future lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nClaire is wrong to be so cynical: If she believes that their association was merely temporary or convenient, then what has happened between them is insignificant and each character is truly trapped in his or her pigeonhole. Consider this line from the New Yorker critic Pauline Kael\u2019s correspondingly cynical review: \u201cThe movie is about a bunch of stereotypes who complain that other people see them as stereotypes.\u201d Kael is not wrong that the characters are stereotypes. But the point of the movie is to give us a glimpse of them trying to be more than that.\n\nNotice, however, that the antidote to cynicism cannot be Bender\u2019s na\u00efve conviction that everything is different now. A person cannot, in a day, do the work needed to transcend years of internalized stereotyping. At the end of the movie, detention ends and the five teenagers part ways with a fragile, doubt-filled faith in the connections they have forged. They have tasted enough of the value of true friendship to know that they have not plumbed its depths and are therefore liable to ignore one another in the halls on Monday morning; their attitude toward the goods of friendship is not one of possession but one of aspiration.\n\nLacking the grounds to conclude that they will greet one another, they can nonetheless have aspirational faith \u2014 try to believe \u2014 that they will do so. The movie suggests that it is possible to see something in the prospect of stereotype-transcending friendship without taking oneself to have seen all that there is to see. What keeps aspirational faith honest is its provisional character, the aspirant\u2019s recognition that she still has a long way to go.\n\nThe problem with Pascal\u2019s wager is that it is a wager, and so the stakes are fixed in advance. Betting is about winning some value you are already aware of, not learning that there is something new out there to be valued. If you set out to acquire beliefs without learning, you are cheating: gaining epistemic ground without doing epistemic work. By contrast, in the cases of aspirational faith, coming to believe that, e.g., we will still be friends on Monday, is part and parcel of a bigger project of learning to become a different kind of person. The project is intellectual, involving a change in beliefs, but it is not only intellectual \u2014 and its intellectual character is inseparable from its affective and motivational character.\n\nPascal may have been making a related point, to the effect that the mind does not have a monopoly on wisdom, when he famously proclaimed that \u201cthe heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.\u201d But that sentiment, however beautifully expressed, leaves the crucial questions unanswered. Because suppose that Pascal is right, and someone\u2019s heart has reasons that her reason does not know. Do things have to stay that way? Couldn\u2019t her reason learn those reasons? And wouldn\u2019t that, in turn, be her heart\u2019s opportunity to grow?", "title": "Opinion | Can We Learn to Believe in God?", "authors": []}

She said a role in an Allen film would be too hard to justify \u2014 a career choice over a possible moral stand.\n\nOthers pointed to the trajectory of artists like Roman Polanski as an example of the entertainment industry\u2019s longstanding moral leniency. In the decades since Mr. Polanski fled the United States to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, he has enjoyed a flourishing career in Europe, where audiences have been conditioned to separate the art from the artist. He continued casting top Hollywood stars and won an Oscar in 2003 for directing \u201cThe Pianist.\u201d (Mr. Allen has long had devoted fans, and more box office fortune, in Europe. \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d which has taken in $9 million overseas thus far, is due to open in France this week.)\n\nAlec Baldwin, a repeat star of Mr. Allen\u2019s films, has come to his defense, writing on Twitter that \u201cthe renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it\u2019s unfair and sad to me.\u201d He called working with Mr. Allen \u201cone of the privileges of my career.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Aronson and other partisans of Mr. Allen\u2019s contend that the efforts of the Farrow family to discredit Mr. Allen are burnished by Ronan Farrow\u2019s role, through his investigative reports in The New Yorker, in exposing Harvey Weinstein\u2019s years of alleged abuse. Mr. Farrow, Dylan\u2019s brother, has also publicly supported her. \u201cRonan is in a good position now,\u201d Ms. Aronson said. \u201cHe\u2019s traveling around with a halo. Unfortunately, he\u2019s wrong\u201d about Mr. Allen.

His last four films have flopped at the North American box office, taking in a cumulative $26.9 million \u2014 roughly half of which goes to theater owners \u2014 while carrying a collective $85 million in estimated production costs, not including marketing.\n\nPoor reviews have played a role. But box office analysts say that women, in particular younger women, have grown increasingly determined to boycott his films since 2013, when Dylan Farrow first spoke in detail about her claims of abuse in an interview with Vanity Fair.\n\nBefore Amazon\u2019s largess, Mr. Allen, like most indie filmmakers, financed his movies by preselling distribution rights. Even as his box office results faltered, he was able to attract continued interest from distributors by casting major stars. And he was able to cast major stars (and often persuade them to work for reduced salaries) because of his reputation as a film legend and because awards sometimes followed. But pull out one element \u2014 the stars \u2014 and the model could collapse.\n\nDespite signs of wavering support in Hollywood, Ms. Aronson was still defiantly confident that Mr. Allen could make any movie he wants.

In October 2007, Medtronic, a leading medical device manufacturer, recalled the lead wires in its Sprint Fidelis defibrillator after they were found to fracture and misfire, harming or even killing patients. The devices had not been clinically tested and were approved for sale by the F.D.A. through the supplement pathway. But in this case, the \u201cminor change\u201d was a fatal one; the new wire was thinner and prone to fracture.\n\nBy the time of the recall, 268,000 leads had been implanted in patients worldwide, the majority in the United States. After the recall, many patients rushed to have the devices removed, but removal posed its own dangers, causing major complications in 15 percent of patients.\n\nEven when devices are subjected to trials, the F.D.A. sometimes ignores danger signs detected by those studies. In 1997, during the approval process of the vagus nerve stimulator, a device made by Cyberonics to treat epilepsy, an F.D.A. adviser voiced concerns about a high death rate noted in patients with the device. But the agency didn\u2019t stop the device from going to market. Instead, it awarded conditional approval, meaning that Cyberonics would have to conduct safety studies after the device was on the market.\n\nThe agency didn\u2019t even require Cyberonics to inform patients that there was concern about the death rate, or that they were effectively being made unwitting guinea pigs. When Cyberonics finally submitted five studies that it said proved the device was safe, it failed to include death data for any of the studies, a move the F.D.A. defended, saying the agency hadn\u2019t asked the company to count deaths, only to \u201ccharacterize\u201d deaths.\n\nHow it\u2019s possible to characterize deaths without including any actual data on deaths is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nWith such shockingly lax regulations, it\u2019s no surprise that device recalls have risen over the years; in 2003, there were eight Class 1 device recalls, which the F.D.A. defines as indicating \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that a device will \u201ccause serious adverse health consequences or death.\u201d In 2016, that number rose to 117, affecting hundreds of thousands of patients.\n\nLoose oversight of devices poses a threat to public health. Yet the Trump administration\u2019s picks to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the F.D.A. are advocates of deregulation, which they insist will speed the march of \u201clifesaving\u201d devices to market.

It was the promise of a country that took pride in being more civilized than the ones that would eventually expel all of their Jewish populations.\n\nToday such distinction feels more blurred and more difficult to defend than at any point since World War II.\n\nWhat hurts most about this realization is that it directly contradicts what Jews like me feel must also necessarily be true: France is our home, as if somewhere in the universe there is a real France, and the one in Europe is just a facsimile that keeps falling off the anti-Semitism wagon.\n\nFrench-speaking Jews may have celebrated this year when Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, La R\u00e9publique En Marche!, defeated the frighteningly far-right and anti-Semitic National Front, but this supposedly new France has done nothing to curb its Jewish problem.

The assessment was based on a statistical analysis of four years of prior calls, using well over 100 criteria maintained in eight databases for jails, psychiatric services, public-welfare benefits, drug and alcohol treatment centers and more. For the 3-year-old\u2019s family, the score came back as 19 out of a possible 20.\n\nOver the course of an 18-month investigation, officials in the county\u2019s Office of Children, Youth and Families (C.Y.F.) offered me extraordinary access to their files and procedures, on the condition that I not identify the families involved. Exactly what in this family\u2019s background led the screening tool to score it in the top 5 percent of risk for future abuse and neglect cannot be known for certain. But a close inspection of the files revealed that the mother was attending a drug-treatment center for addiction to opiates; that she had a history of arrest and jail on drug-possession charges; that the three fathers of the little girl and her two older siblings had significant drug or criminal histories, including allegations of violence; that one of the older siblings had a lifelong physical disability; and that the two younger children had received diagnoses of developmental or mental-health issues.\n\nFinding all that information about the mother, her three children and their three fathers in the county\u2019s maze of databases would have taken Byrne hours he did not have; call screeners are expected to render a decision on whether or not to open an investigation within an hour at most, and usually in half that time. Even then, he would have had no way of knowing which factors, or combinations of factors, are most predictive of future bad outcomes. The algorithm, however, searched the files and rendered its score in seconds. And so now, despite Byrne\u2019s initial skepticism, the high score prompted him and his supervisor to screen the case in, marking it for further investigation. Within 24 hours, a C.Y.F. caseworker would have to \u201cput eyes on\u201d the children, meet the mother and see what a score of 19 looks like in flesh and blood.\n\nFor decades, debates over how to protect children from abuse and neglect have centered on which remedies work best: Is it better to provide services to parents to help them cope or should the kids be whisked out of the home as soon as possible? If they are removed, should they be placed with relatives or with foster parents? Beginning in 2012, though, two pioneering social scientists working on opposite sides of the globe \u2014 Emily Putnam-Hornstein, of the University of Southern California, and Rhema Vaithianathan, now a professor at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand \u2014 began asking a different question: Which families are most at risk and in need of help? \u201cPeople like me are saying, \u2018You know what, the quality of the services you provide might be just fine \u2014 it could be that you are providing them to the wrong families,\u2019 \u201d Vaithianathan told me.\n\nVaithianathan, who is in her early 50s, emigrated from Sri Lanka to New Zealand as a child; Putnam-Hornstein, a decade younger, has lived in California for years. Both share an enthusiasm for the prospect of using public databases for the public good. Three years ago, the two were asked to investigate how predictive analytics could improve Allegheny County\u2019s handling of maltreatment allegations, and they eventually found themselves focused on the call-screening process. They were brought in following a series of tragedies in which children died after their family had been screened out \u2014 the nightmare of every child-welfare agency.\n\nOne of the worst failures occurred on June 30, 2011, when firefighters were called to a blaze coming from a third-floor apartment on East Pittsburgh-McKeesport Boulevard. When firefighters broke down the locked door, the body of 7-year-old KiDonn Pollard-Ford was found under a pile of clothes in his bedroom, where he had apparently sought shelter from the smoke. KiDonn\u2019s 4-year-old brother, KrisDon Williams-Pollard, was under a bed, not breathing. He was resuscitated outside, but died two days later in the hospital.\n\nThe children, it turned out, had been left alone by their mother, Kiaira Pollard, 27, when she went to work that night as an exotic dancer. She was said by neighbors to be an adoring mother of her two kids; the older boy was getting good grades in school. For C.Y.F., the bitterest part of the tragedy was that the department had received numerous calls about the family but had screened them all out as unworthy of a full investigation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIncompetence on the part of the screeners? No, says Vaithianathan, who spent months with Putnam-Hornstein burrowing through the county\u2019s databases to build their algorithm, based on all 76,964 allegations of maltreatment made between April 2010 and April 2014. \u201cWhat the screeners have is a lot of data,\u201d she told me, \u201cbut it\u2019s quite difficult to navigate and know which factors are most important. Within a single call to C.Y.F., you might have two children, an alleged perpetrator, you\u2019ll have Mom, you might have another adult in the household \u2014 all these people will have histories in the system that the person screening the call can go investigate. But the human brain is not that deft at harnessing and making sense of all that data.\u201d\n\nShe and Putnam-Hornstein linked many dozens of data points \u2014 just about everything known to the county about each family before an allegation arrived \u2014 to predict how the children would fare afterward. What they found was startling and disturbing: 48 percent of the lowest-risk families were being screened in, while 27 percent of the highest-risk families were being screened out. Of the 18 calls to C.Y.F. between 2010 and 2014 in which a child was later killed or gravely injured as a result of parental maltreatment, eight cases, or 44 percent, had been screened out as not worth investigation.\n\nAccording to Rachel Berger, a pediatrician who directs the child-abuse research center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh and who led research for the federal Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities, the problem is not one of finding a needle in a haystack but of finding the right needle in a pile of needles. \u201cAll of these children are living in chaos,\u201d she told me. \u201cHow does C.Y.F. pick out which ones are most in danger when they all have risk factors? You can\u2019t believe the amount of subjectivity that goes into child-protection decisions. That\u2019s why I love predictive analytics. It\u2019s finally bringing some objectivity and science to decisions that can be so unbelievably life-changing.\u201d\n\nThe morning after the algorithm prompted C.Y.F. to investigate the family of the 3-year-old who witnessed a fatal drug overdose, a caseworker named Emily Lankes knocked on their front door. The weathered, two-story brick building was surrounded by razed lots and boarded-up homes. No one answered, so Lankes drove to the child\u2019s preschool. The little girl seemed fine. Lankes then called the mother\u2019s cellphone. The woman asked repeatedly why she was being investigated, but agreed to a visit the next afternoon.\n\nThe home, Lankes found when she returned, had little furniture and no beds, though the 20-something mother insisted that she was in the process of securing those and that the children slept at relatives\u2019 homes. All the appliances worked. There was food in the refrigerator. The mother\u2019s disposition was hyper and erratic, but she insisted that she was clean of drugs and attending a treatment center. All three children denied having any worries about how their mother cared for them. Lankes would still need to confirm the mother\u2019s story with her treatment center, but for the time being, it looked as though the algorithm had struck out.\n\nCharges of faulty forecasts have accompanied the emergence of predictive analytics into public policy. And when it comes to criminal justice, where analytics are now entrenched as a tool for judges and parole boards, even larger complaints have arisen about the secrecy surrounding the workings of the algorithms themselves \u2014 most of which are developed, marketed and closely guarded by private firms. That\u2019s a chief objection lodged against two Florida companies: Eckerd Connects, a nonprofit, and its for-profit partner, MindShare Technology. Their predictive-analytics package, called Rapid Safety Feedback, is now being used, the companies say, by child-welfare agencies in Connecticut, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma and Tennessee. Early last month, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services announced that it would stop using the program, for which it had already been billed $366,000 \u2014 in part because Eckerd and MindShare refused to reveal details about what goes into their formula, even after the deaths of children whose cases had not been flagged as high risk.\n\nThe Allegheny Family Screening Tool developed by Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein is different: It is owned by the county. Its workings are public. Its criteria are described in academic publications and picked apart by local officials. At public meetings held in downtown Pittsburgh before the system\u2019s adoption, lawyers, child advocates, parents and even former foster children asked hard questions not only of the academics but also of the county administrators who invited them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do this the right way, to be transparent about it and talk to the community about these changes,\u201d said Erin Dalton, a deputy director of the county\u2019s department of human services and leader of its data-analysis department. She and others involved with the Allegheny program said they have grave worries about companies selling private algorithms to public agencies. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning,\u201d Dalton told me, \u201cbecause public welfare leaders who are trying to preserve their jobs can easily be sold a bill of goods. They don\u2019t have a lot of sophistication to evaluate these products.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother criticism of such algorithms takes aim at the idea of forecasting future behavior. Decisions on which families to investigate, the argument goes, should be based solely on the allegations made, not on predictions for what might happen in the future. During a 2016 White House panel on foster care, Gladys Carri\u00f3n, then the commissioner of New York City\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services, expressed worries about the use of predictive analytics by child-protection agencies. \u201cIt scares the hell out of me,\u201d she said \u2014 especially the potential impact on people\u2019s civil liberties. \u201cI am concerned about widening the net under the guise that we are going to help them.\u201d\n\nBut in Pittsburgh, the advocates for parents, children and civil rights whom I spoke with all applauded how carefully C.Y.F. has implemented the program. Even the A.C.L.U. of Pennsylvania offered cautious praise. \u201cI think they\u2019re putting important checks on the process,\u201d said Sara Rose, a Pittsburgh lawyer with the organization. \u201cThey\u2019re using it only for screeners, to decide which calls to investigate, not to remove a child. Having someone come to your home to investigate is intrusive, but it\u2019s not at a level of taking a child away or forcing a family to take services.\u201d\n\nThe third criticism of using predictive analytics in child welfare is the deepest and the most unsettling. Ostensibly, the algorithms are designed to avoid the faults of human judgment. But what if the data they work with are already fundamentally biased? There is widespread agreement that much of the underlying data reflects ingrained biases against African-Americans and others. (Just last month, the New York City Council voted to study such biases in the city\u2019s use of algorithms.) And yet, remarkably, the Allegheny experience suggests that its screening tool is less bad at weighing biases than human screeners have been, at least when it comes to predicting which children are most at risk of serious harm.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conundrum,\u201d Dalton says. \u201cAll of the data on which the algorithm is based is biased. Black children are, relatively speaking, over-surveilled in our systems, and white children are under-surveilled. Who we investigate is not a function of who abuses. It\u2019s a function of who gets reported.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, black children accounted for 38 percent of all calls to Allegheny County\u2019s maltreatment hotline, double the rate that would be expected based on their population. Their rate of being placed outside their home because of maltreatment was even more disproportionate: eight out of every 1,000 black children residing in the county were placed outside their home that year, compared with just 1.7 of every 1,000 white children.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. Thank you for subscribing. An error has occurred. Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nStudies by Brett Drake, a professor in the Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis, have attributed the disproportionate number of black families investigated by child-welfare agencies across the United States not to bias, but to their higher rates of poverty. Similarly, a 2013 study by Putnam-Hornstein and others found that black children in California were more than twice as likely as white children there to be the subject of maltreatment allegations and placed in foster care. But after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, she showed that poor black children were actually less likely than their poor white counterparts to be the subject of an abuse allegation or to end up in foster care.\n\nPoverty, all close observers of child welfare agree, is the one nearly universal attribute of families caught up in the system. As I rode around with caseworkers on their visits and sat in on family-court hearings, I saw at least as many white parents as black \u2014 but they were all poor, living in the county\u2019s roughest neighborhoods. Poorer people are more likely not only to be involved in the criminal-justice system but also to be on public assistance and to get their mental-health or addiction treatment at publicly funded clinics \u2014 all sources of the data vacuumed up by Vaithianathan\u2019s and Putnam-Hornstein\u2019s predictive-analytics algorithm.\n\nMarc Cherna, who as director of Allegheny County\u2019s Department of Human Services has overseen C.Y.F. since 1996, longer than just about any such official in the country, concedes that bias is probably unavoidable in his work. He had an independent ethics review conducted of the predictive-analytics program before it began. It concluded not only that implementing the program was ethical, but also that not using it might be unethical. \u201cIt is hard to conceive of an ethical argument against use of the most accurate predictive instrument,\u201d the report stated. By adding objective risk measures into the screening process, the screening tool is seen by many officials in Allegheny County as a way to limit the effects of bias.\n\n\u201cWe know there are racially biased decisions made,\u201d says Walter Smith Jr., a deputy director of C.Y.F., who is black. \u201cThere are all kinds of biases. If I\u2019m a screener and I grew up in an alcoholic family, I might weigh a parent using alcohol more heavily. If I had a parent who was violent, I might care more about that. What predictive analytics provides is an opportunity to more uniformly and evenly look at all those variables.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor two months following Emily Lankes\u2019s visit to the home of the children who had witnessed an overdose death, she tried repeatedly to get back in touch with the mother to complete her investigation \u2014 calling, texting, making unannounced visits to the home. All her attempts went without success. She also called the treatment center six times in hopes of confirming the mother\u2019s sobriety, without reaching anyone.\n\nFinally, on the morning of Feb. 2, Lankes called a seventh time. The mother, she learned, had failed her three latest drug tests, with traces of both cocaine and opiates found in her urine. Lankes and her supervisor, Liz Reiter, then sat down with Reiter\u2019s boss and a team of other supervisors and caseworkers.\n\n\u201cIt is never an easy decision to remove kids from home, even when we know it is in their best interest,\u201d Reiter told me. But, she said, \u201cWhen we see that someone is using multiple substances, we need to assure the children\u2019s safety. If we can\u2019t get into the home, that makes us worry that things aren\u2019t as they should be. It\u2019s a red flag.\u201d The team decided to request an Emergency Custody Authorization from a family-court judge. By late afternoon, with authorization in hand, they headed over to the family\u2019s home, where a police officer met them.\n\nThe oldest child answered their knock. The mother wasn\u2019t home, but all three children were, along with the mother\u2019s elderly grandfather. Lankes called the mother, who answered for the first time in two months and began yelling about what she considered an unwarranted intrusion into her home. But she gave Lankes the names of family members who could take the children for the time being. Clothing was gathered, bags packed and winter jackets put on. Then it was time for the children to get in the car with Lankes, a virtual stranger empowered by the government to take them from their mother\u2019s care.\n\nAt a hearing the next day, the presiding official ordered the mother to get clean before she could have her children returned. The drug-treatment center she had been attending advised her to enter rehab, but she refused. \u201cWe can\u2019t get in touch with her very often,\u201d Reiter recently told me. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear she\u2019s not in a good place. The two youngest kids are actually with their dads now. Both of them are doing really, really well.\u201d Their older brother, age 13, is living with his great-grandfather.\n\nIn December, 16 months after the Allegheny Family Screening Tool was first used, Cherna\u2019s team shared preliminary data with me on how the predictive-analytics program was affecting screening decisions. So far, they had found that black and white families were being treated more consistently, based on their risk scores, than they were before the program\u2019s introduction. And the percentage of low-risk cases being recommended for investigation had dropped \u2014 from nearly half, in the years before the program began, to around one-third. That meant caseworkers were spending less time investigating well-functioning families, who in turn were not being hassled by an intrusive government agency. At the same time, high-risk calls were being screened in more often. Not by much \u2014 just a few percentage points. But in the world of child welfare, that represented progress.\n\nTo be certain that those results would stand up to scrutiny, Cherna brought in a Stanford University health-policy researcher named Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert to independently assess the program. \u201cMy preliminary analysis to date is showing that the tool appears to be having the effects it\u2019s intended to have,\u201d Goldhaber-Fiebert says. In particular, he told me, the kids who were screened in were more likely to be found in need of services, \u201cso they appear to be screening in the kids who are at real risk.\u201d\n\nHaving demonstrated in its first year of operation that more high-risk cases are now being flagged for investigation, Allegheny\u2019s Family Screening Tool is drawing interest from child-protection agencies around the country. Douglas County, Colo., midway between Denver and Colorado Springs, is working with Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein to implement a predictive-analytics program there, while the California Department of Social Services has commissioned them to conduct a preliminary analysis for the entire state.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cGiven the early results from Pittsburgh, predictive analytics looks like one of the most exciting innovations in child protection in the last 20 years,\u201d says Drake, the Washington University researcher. As an author of a recent study showing that one in three United States children is the subject of a child-welfare investigation by age 18, he believes agencies must do everything possible to sharpen their focus.\n\nEven in Illinois, where B.J. Walker, the director of the state\u2019s Department of Children and Family Services, is terminating its contract with the companies that developed Rapid Safety Feedback, predictive analytics is not dead. \u201cI still believe it\u2019s a good tool to make better informed decisions,\u201d Walker told me in December. Walker knows Cherna and Dalton and saw the long process they went through to develop the Family Screening Tool. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a careful job,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir transparency has been laudable. And transparency isn\u2019t often your friend, because you\u2019re going to make some mistakes, you\u2019re going to stumble, you\u2019re going to make changes.\u201d\n\nCherna and Dalton are already overseeing a retooling of Allegheny County\u2019s algorithm. So far, they have raised the program\u2019s accuracy at predicting bad outcomes to more than 90 percent from around 78 percent. Moreover, the call screeners and their supervisors will now be given less discretion to override the tool\u2019s recommendations \u2014 to screen in the lowest-risk cases and screen out the highest-risk cases, based on their professional judgment. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to change the mind-set of the screeners,\u201d Dalton told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong, dug-in culture. They want to focus on the immediate allegation, not the child\u2019s future risk a year or two down the line. They call it clinical decision-making. I call it someone\u2019s opinion. Getting them to trust that a score on a computer screen is telling them something real is a process.\u201d", "title": "Can an Algorithm Tell When Kids Are in Danger?", "authors": ["Dan Hurley"]}
{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "So we\u2019re living in an era of political turmoil and economic calm. Can it last?\n\nMy answer is that it probably can\u2019t, because the return to normalcy is fragile. Sooner or later, something will go wrong, and we\u2019re very poorly placed to respond when it does. But I can\u2019t tell you what that something will be, or when it will happen.\n\nThe key point is that while the major advanced economies are currently doing more or less OK, they\u2019re doing so thanks to very low interest rates by historical standards. That\u2019s not a critique of central bankers. All indications are that for whatever reason \u2014 probably low population growth and weak productivity performance \u2014 our economies need those low, low rates to achieve anything like full employment. And this in turn means that it would be a terrible, recession-creating mistake to \u201cnormalize\u201d rates by raising them to historical levels.\n\nBut given that rates are already so low when things are pretty good, it will be hard for central bankers to mount an effective response if and when something not so good happens. What if something goes wrong in China, or a second Iranian revolution disrupts oil supplies, or it turns out that tech stocks really are in a 1999ish bubble? Or what if Bitcoin actually starts to have some systemic importance before everyone realizes it\u2019s nonsense?\n\nI\u2019m not predicting any of these things, and when the next big shock comes it will probably come from some direction I haven\u2019t thought of. But when it does come, we\u2019ll need an effective, coherent response from officials beyond the world of central banking.\n\nSo imagine such an event happening soon. How confident would you feel in the team of Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin? How much leadership could a weakened Angela Merkel exert in a fragmented Europe?\n\nYou might have thought that such concerns would weigh on markets even now.

It appears to be the first use of a controversial Israeli law against calling for boycotts of Israel or the territory it controls.\n\nThe defendants \u2014 one of Palestinian descent, and the other Jewish \u2014 drew attention in December when they published an open letter to Lorde, a fellow New Zealander, which was one of many calls for her to reconsider a scheduled performance in Israel next summer. Days later, she called off the concert.\n\nThe suit, filed on Tuesday, demands 45,000 Israeli shekels, or about $13,200, on behalf of three Israeli teenagers who had bought tickets for the concert. It demands payment not from the singer, but from the authors of the open letter, Nadia Abu-Shanab and Justine Sachs.\n\nIn 2011, the Israeli Knesset passed a law allowing civil litigation by anyone who can claim economic harm from a boycott against Israel, any of its institutions, or an area under Israeli control.

{"date": "2017-12-31 00:00:00", "text": "More troubling still are the wrongful convictions. In 2017, four more people who had been sentenced to death were exonerated, for a total of 160 since 1973 \u2014 a time during which 1,465 people were executed. In many of the exonerations, prosecutors won convictions and sentences despite questionable or nonexistent evidence, pervasive misconduct or a pattern of racial bias. A 2014 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences extrapolated from known cases of wrongful convictions to estimate that at least 4 percent of all death-row inmates are wrongfully convicted. Against this backdrop, it would take an enormous leap of faith to believe that no innocent person has ever been executed.\n\nThis page has long opposed the death penalty, and would continue to even if the penalty\u2019s application were completely free of bias and error. That is an unattainable goal, as should be obvious by now. Perhaps this explains why Americans, whose support for capital punishment climbed as high as 80 percent in 1994, have increasingly lost their appetite for state-sanctioned killing. Support is down to around 55 percent, its lowest level in 45 years.\n\nThe rest of the developed world agreed to reject this cruel and pointless practice long ago. How can it be ended here, for good?\n\nLeaving it up to individual states is not the solution. It\u2019s true that 19 states and the District of Columbia have already banned capital punishment, four have suspended it and eight others haven\u2019t executed anyone in more than a decade. Some particularly awful state policies have also been eliminated in the past couple of years, like a Florida law that permitted non-unanimous juries to impose death sentences, and an Alabama rule empowering judges to override a jury\u2019s vote for life, even a unanimous one, and impose death.\n\nAnd yet at the same time, states have passed laws intended to speed up the capital appeals process, despite the growing evidence of legal errors and prosecutorial misconduct that can be hidden for years or longer. Other states have gone to great lengths to hide their lethal-injection protocols from public scrutiny, even as executions with untested drugs have gone awry and pharmaceutical companies have objected to the use of their products to kill people.\n\nLast summer, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested that the death penalty would eventually end with a whimper. \u201cThe incidence of capital punishment has gone down, down, down so that now, I think, there are only three states that actually administer the death penalty,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said at a law school event. \u201cWe may see an end to capital punishment by attrition as there are fewer and fewer executions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a dispiriting take. The death penalty holdouts may be few and far between, but they are fiercely committed, and they won\u2019t stop killing people unless they\u2019re forced to. Relying on the vague idea of attrition absolves the court of its responsibility to be the ultimate arbiter and guardian of the Constitution \u2014 and specifically of the Eighth Amendment. The court has already relied on that provision to ban the execution of juvenile offenders, the intellectually disabled and those convicted of crimes against people other than murder.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason not to take the final step. The justices have all the information they need right now to bring America in line with most of the rest of the world and end the death penalty for good.", "title": "Opinion | Capital Punishment Deserves a Quick Death", "authors": []}

One number that ABC wanted to take out, Ms. Hart said, featured the former professional football player Rosey Grier singing \u201cIt\u2019s All Right to Cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey wanted us to take that out because they thought we would be creating a bunch of sissies and homosexuals, that it was encouraging that,\u201d Ms. Hart said. \u201cWe refused.\u201d\n\nThe program won an Emmy for outstanding children\u2019s special.\n\nIn the 2013 interview, Ms. Hart talked about the coincidences in her life that she said were not really coincidences at all.\n\n\u201cWhat I realize now is that there were always these synchronicities,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThings would come together that would seem to be coincidences that would take us to certain places.\u201d\n\nA prime example came in the 1980s. She, Ms. Thomas and another producer, Kathie Berlin, had formed a production company and were looking for projects. Debby Franke Ogg brought them her story: She had been given a Stage 4 lymphoma diagnosis, she said, and had beaten the disease with alternative therapies.\n\n\u201cCarole Hart was an activist,\u201d Ms. Ogg said by email. \u201cBy that I mean she was able to see the impossible as possible, and was dedicated to showing people through story, word and image a direction to ponder.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Hart became the point person for turning Ms. Ogg\u2019s story into a TV movie, with Bruce Hart writing the script. Again she met resistance: The legal department at CBS, which was to broadcast the film, was concerned that the movie would cause others to forgo mainstream cancer treatments. But after delays, revisions and a push by Ms. Thomas, the movie, \u201cLeap of Faith,\u201d which starred Anne Archer and Sam Neill, was broadcast in October 1988.\n\nSix years later Ms. Hart had her own reason to look into alternative healing when she received her cancer diagnosis. She availed herself of some standard medical treatments, her sister said, but also pursued other paths, including a 13-hour Native American healing ceremony.\n\n\u201cWhen I emerged from that tepee,\u201d Ms. Hart said, \u201cI felt a profound change in my body, like every one of my cells had been realigned. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. I felt whole in a way I had never felt in my life.\u201d\n\nThe cancer receded over the next year, she said, and she was eventually certified cancer free.\n\nOnly two or three years ago did the disease reappear, Ms. Englander said.\n\nMs. Hart\u2019s other projects included \u201cHot Hero Sandwich,\u201d a TV series, aimed at teenagers, that she created with her husband in 1979, and \u201cSooner or Later,\u201d a 1979 TV movie she wrote with Mr. Hart that starred the heartthrob singer Rex Smith.\n\nBruce Hart died in 2006. In addition to Ms. Englander, Ms. Hart, who died at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, is survived by another sister, Joyce Strickler. She lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nAt her death Ms. Hart was still exploring ways to expand on entrenched lines of thought as a producer of \u201cShirah of Bethlehem,\u201d an animated musical that seeks to add a female figure to the male-heavy imagery surrounding Christmas.\n\nAs the project\u2019s website says, \u201cThis girl-empowered take on the traditional Christmas story asks, \u2018What if the one who guided the shepherds to the manger was a girl?\u2019 \u201d", "title": "Carole Hart, Producer and Writer of Children\u2019s TV, Dies at 74", "authors": ["Neil Genzlinger"]}

No one in the area had reported a break-in. Prosecutors have not said if Mr. Lewis was even the man the 911 caller saw going into yards.\n\nBut Mr. Lewis\u2019s name and birth date were memorialized in a police officer\u2019s memo book. And that note led to his arrest eight months later when, in the middle of a stalled investigation into Ms. Vetrano\u2019s killing, Lieutenant Russo had the memo book unearthed so detectives could investigate the man he remembered once arousing his suspicions.\n\nDigging up Mr. Lewis\u2019s name led them to notes from medical calls when Mr. Lewis, as a teenager, was in distress and told emergency responders \u201che wanted to hurt girls,\u201d prosecutors said. Lieutenant Russo described Mr. Lewis to other police commanders as an \u201cemotionally disturbed person.\u201d Then detectives asked for a swab of Mr. Lewis\u2019s DNA and, after they said it matched DNA from the murder scene, arrested him on Feb. 4, 2017, outside his home in East New York, Brooklyn. They later obtained a confession that Mr. Lewis\u2019s lawyers have argued was coerced.\n\nThe police and prosecutors have portrayed the May 2016 stop as industrious police work by a lieutenant attuned to signs that something was amiss on his block.\n\nTo Mr. Lewis\u2019s defense lawyers, the stop was redolent of the abuses of stop-and-frisk, an act of profiling that put Mr. Lewis under scrutiny because he was a black man walking in a mostly white neighborhood.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWalking on a public street in Howard Beach, albeit very slowly and looking at homes, is not criminal, nor does this violate any sections of the penal law,\u201d Mr. Lewis\u2019s lawyers \u2014 Robert Moeller, Julia L. Burke and Jenny S. Cheung, all of the Legal Aid Society \u2014 wrote in a December filing. \u201cNor is it a crime to pace back and forth in front of a parking lot.\u201d\n\nWith the 911 caller giving only a generic description of a black man in a black track suit and white top, the police did not have reasonable suspicion that Mr. Lewis had committed or was about to commit a crime, his lawyers argued. And after the police stopped him, officers drove Mr. Lewis to a McDonald\u2019s in Far Rockaway, Queens, for reasons that remain unclear. The lawyers cited that trip as evidence that Mr. Lewis was detained for a prolonged period.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe lawyers argued that Mr. Lewis\u2019s name and birth date were \u201cthe direct fruit\u201d of an illegal stop and should be excluded. And because detectives were only able to ask Mr. Lewis for a DNA sample because they had his name from the stop, all the evidence that followed \u2014 the DNA swab and Mr. Lewis\u2019s confession \u2014 should also be held out of trial, the lawyers argued.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And because Mr. Lewis \u201cfit the basic description provided by a known witness\u201d on the 911 call the next day, Lieutenant Russo also had reason to have Mr. Lewis stopped, they contended.\n\nBut even if the police illegally stopped Mr. Lewis, prosecutors argued, his name couldn\u2019t be excluded on those grounds. In a Jan. 10 filing, they argued that Mr. Lewis\u2019s name only led the police to information they already had, like his address and notes from his medical calls. And prosecutors cited previous cases that they said showed that letting a defendant\u2019s name be suppressed would \u201cundermine the administration of the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nThe case is a reminder that stop-and-frisk, shunned by Mayor Bill de Blasio and used less and less by the Police Department, remains a hotly contested piece of some criminal cases. Police failed to fill out a required formal stop-and-frisk report in Mr. Lewis\u2019s case, an issue that a court-appointed monitor overseeing changes to stop-and-frisk policies has identified as a persistent problem.\n\nThe dispute over whether evidence the police gathered by stopping Mr. Lewis can be withheld from trial also highlights the erosion of the exclusionary rule, established by the Supreme Court, which says illegally obtained evidence should be kept from trials, said Stuart Green, a professor at Rutgers Law School.\n\nHe said a 2010 ruling by the New York Court of Appeals seems to have established that a name cannot be excluded from trial in New York, even if it is the result of an illegal stop. That ruling, he said, relied on somewhat \u201cflimsy\u201d reasoning and further limited what evidence could be excluded from trial.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re proposing here is an additional exception,\u201d Mr. Green said. But, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s handled a bit roughly here, and I think more needs to be said about why there is this exception.\u201d\n\nThe rule about excluding evidence, he said, \u201chas been so shot full of holes that there isn\u2019t that much left of it in the end.\u201d", "title": "Case of Jogger\u2019s Murder Hinges, in Part, on Questions Over a Police Stop", "authors": ["Benjamin Mueller"]}

The flaws and limits inherent in overexposure are boredom and attenuation of message \u2014 not weakening of power. Though Mr. Trump can suffer in some way from overexposure, his power \u2014 his scope of action \u2014 remains undiminished. It is not Mr. Trump\u2019s overexposure that should concern anyone, but his juvenile, often alarming, often puzzling dramatics and his ignorance.

After describing requests from publishers to make male characters \u201cless sexist\u201d and a Swedish bill that will require people to give explicit consent before engaging in sexual activity, the women write, \u201cOne more effort and two adults who will want to sleep together will first check, through an app on their phone, a document in which the practices they accept and those they refuse will be duly listed.\u201d\n\nThey continue, \u201cThe philosopher Ruwen Ogien defended the freedom to offend as essential to artistic creation. In the same way, we defend a freedom to bother, indispensable to sexual freedom.\u201d Though the writers do not draw clear lines between what constitutes sexual misconduct and what does not, they say that they are \u201csufficiently farseeing not to confuse a clumsy come-on and sexual assault.\u201d\n\nTranslations of the letter were quickly picked up by Twitter on Tuesday, and responses ranged from supportive to hostile. Asia Argento, an actress who accused Harvey Weinstein of raping her, criticized the Frenchwomen\u2019s letter on Twitter.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, Christina Hoff Sommers, who coined the term \u201cvictim feminism,\u201d tweeted a quote from the letter and her remarks on it.\n\nIn France, tens of thousands of stories have landed on social media under the hashtag #Balancetonporc since the journalist Sandra Muller used it in October in a post on Twitter about an inappropriate come-on she received from a French executive.\n\nThe multitude of revelations in France has led to discussion of legislative proposals that would fine men for aggressive catcalling or lecherous behavior toward women in public, and lengthen the statute of limitations for cases involving minors. Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, France\u2019s junior minister for gender equality, said that France\u2019s parliament would also debate whether to establish a clear age below which a minor cannot consent to a sexual relationship. The decision came after French prosecutors declined to charge a 28-year-old man with rape after he had sex with an 11-year-old girl.\n\nIn March, Ms. Deneuve defended Roman Polanski, the director who pleaded guilty in 1977 to having sex with a 13-year-old girl and who was accused by two other women of forcing himself on them when they were under age. While appearing on a French television channel, Ms. Deneuve said, \u201cIt\u2019s a case that has been dealt with, it\u2019s a case that has been judged. There have been agreements between Roman Polanski and this woman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn concluding the letter, the writers return to the concept of self-victimization and a call for women to accept the pitfalls that come with freedom. \u201cAccidents that can affect a woman\u2019s body do not necessarily affect her dignity and must not, as hard as they can be, necessarily make her a perpetual victim,\u201d they write. \u201cBecause we are not reducible to our bodies.

{"date": "2018-01-12 00:00:00", "text": "There was something about the recent big displays of American sisterhood laid out on the cover of Time magazine, and at the Golden Globes ceremony, where women turned up dressed in black with their \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d pins, that seemed to trigger Gallic irritation. In this week\u2019s letter, the signatories worried that the \u201cthought police\u201d were out and that anyone who voiced disagreement would be called complicit and a traitor. They noted that women are not children who need protecting. But there was also this: \u201cWe do not recognize ourselves in this feminism,\u201d they said, which \u201ctakes on a hatred of men and of sexuality.\u201d\n\nCall it a clich\u00e9 if you like, but ours is a culture that, for better and for worse, views seduction as a harmless and pleasurable game, dating back to the days of medieval \u201camour courtois.\u201d As a result, there has been a kind of harmony between the sexes that is particularly French. This does not mean that sexism doesn\u2019t exist in France \u2014 of course it does. It also doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t disapprove of the actions of men like Mr. Weinstein. What it does mean is that we are wary of things that might disturb this harmony.\n\nAnd in the past 20 years or so, a new French feminism has emerged \u2014 an American import. It has embraced this rather alien brand of anti-men paranoia that Ms. de Beauvoir described; it took control of #MeToo in France, and this same form of feminism has been very vocal against the Deneuve letter. Today, Frenchwomen, too, have the girls\u2019 nights out that Ms. de Beauvoir once found so foreign.\n\nWhen \u201cAmerica Day by Day\u201d was published, American women were incensed. The novelist Mary McCarthy couldn\u2019t stand the book. \u201cMademoiselle Gulliver en Am\u00e9rique,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwho descended from the plane as from a space ship, wearing metaphorical goggles: eager as a little girl to taste the rock-candy delights of this materialistic moon civilization.\u201d\n\nMs. de Beauvoir was in many ways easy to mock: She wrote in a direct, authoritative, self-assured way that may have sounded arrogant to readers unaccustomed to its bluntness. But the epidermic reaction across the Atlantic, to both Ms. de Beauvoir and to that letter, may in fact underscore the sharpness of the French critique. To many of us in France, Simone de Beauvoir could have been writing yesterday: \u201cRelations between men and women in America are one of permanent war. They don\u2019t seem to actually like each other. There seems to be no possible friendship between them. They distrust each other, lack generosity in dealing with one another. Their relationship is often made of small vexations, little disputes, and short-lived triumphs.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Catherine Deneuve and the French Feminist Difference", "authors": []}

The assailants used a van to crush pedestrians along the popular Las Ramblas boulevard in Barcelona and nine hours later, they used another car to careen into tourists on a promenade in the seaside town of Cambrils.\n\nInside the bombed-out ruins of the group\u2019s explosives factory, investigators recovered 500 liters, or about 110 gallons, of acetone, a solvent used in cleaning supplies, and 340 liters of hydrogen peroxide, a bleach commonly used in hair salons. The two chemicals are the raw ingredients used to make triacetone triperoxide, or TATP, which has become the signature explosive used by the Islamic State in attacks in Europe.\n\nInvestigators estimate that the terrorist cell had enough precursor chemicals to make 200 to 250 kilograms, or 440 to 550 pounds, of TATP, according to the study.\n\nPhoto\n\nBy comparison, the suitcase bombs that killed 32 people at the Brussels airport in March 2016 and injured more than 320 had each weighed less than 20 kilograms. And the fighters dispatched from Syria to reign terror on the French capital in November 2015, killing 130 and wounding more than 600, had at most a few pounds of TATP in each of their respective suicide belts.\n\nThe Barcelona cell bought most of the ingredients for its homemade bombs on Aug. 1, 2 and 16, the study found. The two vans used in the attacks were rented on Aug. 16 for seven days, suggesting that the group planned to commit the attack that week.\n\nIn the rubble of the property in Alcanar, investigators recovered a notebook inscribed with the name of Abdelbaki Es Satty, the oldest member of the cell and its presumed ringleader and recruiter. In a sheet inside the notebook, they found a handwritten note in Arabic describing the cell members as \u201csoldiers of the Islamic State in the land of al-Andalus,\u201d the term the militant group uses to refer to the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In his last trip to Paris, he stayed at a hotel in Malakoff, located just six kilometers, or nearly four miles, from the Paris suburb of Villejuif, where on Sept. 6 the French authorities discovered a TATP lab run by men who had been making phone calls to Syria, say the researchers.\n\nTwo other members of the Barcelona cell made an unexplained trip to Zurich in December 2016, and approximately a week before the attack, another member of the group, Driss Oukabir, made a nine-day trip to Morocco.

The Trojans claim that season\u2019s title alongside the B.C.S. winner, Louisiana State, which beat Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl.\n\nThe case against Central Florida\u2019s championship is clear, of course. Its league, the American Athletic Conference, may like to call itself the sixth power conference. But college football\u2019s five major leagues have magnitudes more money to spend on coaches and facilities, and this nearly always translates to better recruits and better teams.\n\nThe widely respected Sagarin rankings, which attempt to rate teams according to the strength of their schedule, rank Central Florida No. 13.

China produces more than a quarter of humanity\u2019s emissions of global warming gases.\n\nOfficials in Davos said they saw little indication that China\u2019s influence in the climate change effort was ebbing.\n\nIndia, for example, is considering whether to follow the United States in putting tariffs on solar panel imports to help its own industry, or whether to bow to the dominance of China, by far the largest maker and buyer of solar panels. China also dominates the business of making wind turbines and is focused on becoming a force in electric cars.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to promote our manufacturers, but they also have to compete with international manufacturers,\u201d said Ramesh Abhishek, India\u2019s secretary of industrial policy and promotion.\n\nThe stakes are high.

Rhodium estimates that China\u2019s energy-related carbon emissions climbed last year 2.2 percent to 4.1 percent.\n\nBy contrast, China had somewhat weak industrial production in the second half of 2015 and the first half of 2016 because of a financial crisis. That hurt the Chinese economy and fossil fuel consumption in both years. China still burns coal to generate three-quarters of its electricity.\n\nWhile China\u2019s official figures for economic output show that growth did not falter in 2015 and 2016, and that there was a slight uptick last year, Western economists are skeptical of Chinese economic statistics.

Emissions per person were only slightly higher in China in 2016 than in the European Union, and were lower than in the United States.\n\nData from sources of human-caused greenhouse gases in China other than fossil fuels, such as from agriculture, won\u2019t be available for several months, but those emissions are smaller.\n\nThe backdrop for climate change worries here came in the form of snow drifts left by a blizzard that dumped more than six feet of snow in a week.\n\nKlaus Schwab, the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, joked with Liu He, a Politburo member from China, which is hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics. \u201cWhen you have the Olympic Games,\u201d Mr. Schwab said, \u201cmaybe we can export some of the snow to your country.\u201d", "title": "China\u2019s Emissions: More Than U.S. Plus Europe, and Still Rising", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher", "Lisa Friedman"]}

The slogan, Mr. Xiao said, would be \u201cLegislation first, full authorization, move forward step by step.\u201d\n\nA property tax could have a profound impact on a crucial part of the nation\u2019s economy. Real estate makes up nearly three-quarters of the assets of Chinese households, according to the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance, an academic institute in Chengdu, in southwestern China. That compares with a bit more than one-third for United States households. Roughly a fifth to a quarter of China\u2019s annual economic output comes from property and related industries, like furniture making.\n\nBut housing is also the source of some of the country\u2019s biggest booms and busts. Local investors \u2014 many of whom do not trust the country\u2019s stock markets and are forbidden by Beijing to move most of their wealth abroad \u2014 simply throw money at housing.

Much of China would be starting from scratch, as the country does not have decades of real estate records like the United States and other places.\n\nOne longtime obstacle \u2014 figuring out who owns which apartment \u2014 appears to have been resolved. For years, many corrupt government officials accumulated homes and resisted creating a database of real estate records.\n\nBut motivated partly by Mr. Xi\u2019s nationwide corruption crackdown, the Ministry of Land and Resources announced in September that it had just completed a database of land ownership across the country. Real estate executives say that the database encompasses the beneficial owners of real estate held through companies and investment partnerships, although wealthy individuals in China have been known to disguise the extent of their holdings.\n\nChina\u2019s absence of a property tax is a legacy of the 1949 Communist takeover. Land ownership was gradually restricted, then banned. When the leadership allowed private citizens to become homeowners again after Mao\u2019s death, it created a system under which the government leased land to developers and others.\n\nIntroducing the tax would be a delicate task for a government prone to ham-handed policy changes.

Young people in China are expected to buy a home before they can get married. Usually the groom is responsible for buying a home, though the bride\u2019s family frequently chips in. Thanks to the now-abandoned one-child policy, China has more young men than young women, setting off a male-led surge to buy homes to make themselves more appealing husbands.

Like other retaliatory measures, however, ditching Treasuries would end up costing China.\n\nThe dollar declined around 0.6 percent against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, hinting at the challenge involved.

In fairness, Rolen had strong seasons for also-ran teams in Philadelphia, and then played in Albert Pujols\u2019s shadow in St. Louis. But he seems to fit best on the Graig Nettles/Buddy Bell level of third basemen \u2014 outstanding, but just under the borderline.\n\nSosa (sixth): In the decade after the 1994 strike, Sosa led the majors in homers, runs batted in and total bases; he is an important figure of that era. Yet he\u2019s polled no higher than 12.5 percent despite, like Bonds and Clemens, never having served a suspension for doping. With 609 career homers, Sosa should have a strong case. But it\u2019s hard to shake the notion that his best years seem so inauthentic.\n\nVizquel (first): Like Rolen, Vizquel was virtually ignored by Most Valuable Player voters; in 24 seasons, he had one 16th-place finish. His hallmarks were defense (11 Gold Gloves) and longevity (a record 2,709 games at shortstop). He was a very different kind of player than the dominant A.L. shortstops of his prime \u2014 Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada \u2014 but their presence obscured him. Ozzie Smith had no such N.L. rivals in the 1980s, and ranks much higher in defensive metrics than Vizquel.\n\nWagner (third): No pitcher with as many innings as Wagner (903) can match him in strikeouts per nine innings (11.9). His 2.31 earned run average is closer to Mariano Rivera\u2019s 2.21 than Hoffman\u2019s 2.87. That\u2019s dominance, and that\u2019s what voters want in a Hall of Famer.

Eighteen voters have checked the top nine plus Walker, making that the most common ballot in Thibodaux\u2019s tracker. Walker could do it all, though his struggles to stay healthy made his career totals (383 homers, 2,160 hits) lower than you\u2019d expect from a star who spent his prime in a hitter\u2019s park in an era of extreme offense.\n\nLastly, we have Sheffield, a fourth-time nominee. It took a while, but on Tuesday morning, I finally found a ballot like the one I would cast, by Tim Kurkjian of ESPN. He voted for the top nine plus Sheffield, who hit 509 homers, rarely struck out, had the same O.P.S.

Sheffield gets docked severely for his defense at third base and in the outfield, but he has more offensive wins above replacement than Martinez, a designated hitter on the cusp of election.\n\nSheffield\u2019s case is complicated by his ties to performance-enhancing drugs, but the link is somewhat flimsy.

The pitcher would bounce the ball and try to knock over a folded license plate on the ground.\n\n\u201cThat actually opened up, to me, my hitting zone,\u201d Guerrero said through an interpreter. \u201cIn order for you to hit the ball, you have to be able to hit balls down on the ground.

The pitch came in so slowly that it made his modest fastball play up.\n\n\u201cIt evolved to more of a palmball,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cIt allowed me to feel comfortable throwing the pitch like a fastball, and I got some decent action out of it.\u201d\n\nHoffman joins Hoyt Wilhelm, Rollie Fingers, Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage and Dennis Eckersley as the only pitchers in the Hall of Fame who primarily worked in relief.

It was, seriously, it was one of the dumbest things. And you know, Andrew and I have a great relationship, we\u2019ve worked really well for seven years, but when he said that, I called him, I said, \u2018What are you doing? That\u2019s all we\u2019re going to hear now.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn James Comey and the F.B.I. case on Hillary Clinton\n\n\u201cI think that Jim Comey was wrong in this respect. Put aside the merits of whether Hillary committed a crime or she didn\u2019t. He should have never been the one making that decision and announcing it. And once he did, he made the F.B.I. political.\u201d\n\nOn advice to those whom the president attacks\n\n\u201cThe sun will come up. O.K.? I mean because, he is, the president is an outspoken, direct, blunt guy. So O.K., he\u2019s going to say those things, but in the end, just keep doing your job and doing it well.\u201d\n\nOn the quality of the president\u2019s legal advice\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what legal advice the president is getting or not getting. But I would say that any legal advice that tries to predict when a prosecutor\u2019s investigation is going to end is just kind of shooting in the dark.\u201d\n\n_____\n\n\u201cThe president, quite frankly, doesn\u2019t get enough credit for the fact that he really has been very fair to Mueller. And you hear all this speculation about things. I will tell you this, I talk to the president fairly frequently, he has never even once even hinted to me about firing Bob Mueller. Never. Never. I think it\u2019s the exact opposite. I think the president just would like him to get the job done.\u201d\n\nOn the aides involved in \u2018Bridgegate\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was bad and stupid. And I was up by 30 points. The idea that like \u2014 the thing that\u2019s always bugged me about this, amongst other things, is that the idea that I would care for five seconds about whether or not I had the endorsement of the mayor of Fort Lee is laughable. Both on the basis of the fact that I didn\u2019t even know who the mayor of Fort Lee was, and secondly, because Fort Lee is a town that has no political significance at all. It\u2019s a little town. I don\u2019t remember how many voters there are in Fort Lee. But not a lot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting to me that people think I would participate in something like that. And I think the entire thing was stupid and ridiculous. And it\u2019s inexplicable to me what they were thinking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_____\n\n\u201cIt was covered as if I was already the nominee or the president. I mean every night, every night, every night, I mean there\u2019s been studies that were done that were given to us about the amount of the coverage that dwarfed like the I.R.S. scandal in the Obama administration by like 12-to-1, in terms of the amount of time in the evening news.\u201d\n\n_____\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. And that\u2019s the switch. Telling it like it is and my personality still works with the people in this state. It just didn\u2019t work for me as much as it did before because some of them, mostly Democrats and some middle-of-the-road independents, abandoned me because it confirmed for them their fear about me. And when that happens, that\u2019s bad.\u201d\n\nOn the tax overhaul\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant, but I think there\u2019s ways we can fight back against it, in this sense. We should right now make property taxes fully deductible on state income taxes. It will only cost about $150-170 million dollars in the state budget, and we should do it right now, because if we don\u2019t, it will affect the real estate market in the state.\u201d\n\nOn election night\n\n\u201cI got home about 4:30 a.m. And Mary Pat, who is the soundest sleeper I\u2019ve ever met in my life, who can sleep through anything, was straight up in bed waiting for me. And she looked at me and said, \u2018Are we going to Washington?\u2019 And I said, I really don\u2019t know, but get ready.\n\n\u201cSo I think both of our expectations that moment was that he would probably offer me something that I was willing to leave office to do. I didn\u2019t know what exactly, but I figured there was probably something that he was going to offer me that I would say, \u2018All right, it\u2019s important enough for me to leave the last year.\u2019 But in the end he never did. Now two days later, I was fired as the chairman of the transition. And I got offered a bunch of stuff in the month of December and in the month of February that I didn\u2019t take because I didn\u2019t think it was important enough for me to leave the job.\u201d", "title": "Chris Christie Interview Excerpts: The Governor on Trump, the Transition and His Record", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Nick Corasaniti"]}
{"date": "2018-01-14 00:00:00", "text": "As the lone correspondent covering New Jersey for The Times, this could sometimes make coverage a little complicated. If I was out reporting a story, I would stop what I was doing to find a place to watch his news conferences streamed on YouTube. Often, this was the front seat of my car, with my laptop propped against the steering wheel and iPhone plugged into the car audio so I could hear; in the summer, with the windows rolled down, this earned me a fair share of bewildered stares.\n\nThere was also the near-midnight call I received from his office last spring, after a spate of rail delays and derailments had renewed a common perception of Mr. Christie as the central villain in the state\u2019s transit problems. He had been noticeably silent, but now the governor was announcing that he would instruct New Jersey Transit to withhold all payments to Amtrak until a \u201cfull review\u201d could be conducted. It was a vintage Christie punishment, meted out in the middle of the night.\n\nThere was the constant willingness to engage in banter with voters, both in-state and out, such as the woman from his hometown of Mendham on Election Day. I had gone to ask the governor a question about the likely election of Philip D. Murphy, but stuck around for the full, 17-minute impromptu conference in a chilly firehouse parking lot. About 15 minutes in, Mr. Christie got into an argument with a voter over town consolidation, sarcastically calling her \u201cfabulous.\u201d\n\nPerhaps no event in the final year of his eight-year tenure as governor showcased the national interest he still commands than when he was caught lounging in a beach chair, his family alone on a 10-mile stretch of beach that had been forced closed by a government that he shut down. Mr. Christie had already commanded our attention in a budget standoff that shut down the state government over the Fourth of July weekend. But it was the now-famous shots by Andrew Mills, a photographer for NJ Advance Media, finding their way into endless memes and cable news, that really seemed to seize the country\u2019s attention.\n\nIndeed, there was seemingly endless interest in the governor \u2014 from readers, co-workers, editors (Exhibit A: the assignment of writing this article) \u2014 on a scale that extends well beyond New Jersey.\n\nAnd for a governor who so relished the spotlight, with a natural ability to captivate and control it, it was a perfect storm of a final term.\n\nHe leaves office on Tuesday with a future uncertain, bound by state ethics laws from negotiating compensation for a next job while still holding public office. He\u2019s floated that he could be interested in media, or law firms, or even in the financial sector, but he maintains that nothing is certain. His only plans are to catch his idol, Bruce Springsteen, on Broadway.\n\nOne thing that is likely, however, is that whatever he decides to do next, we\u2019ll be paying attention. I\u2019ll probably have to pull over my car, pull out the laptop, plug in my iPhone and listen.", "title": "Chris Christie: A Beat Unto Himself", "authors": ["Nick Corasaniti"]}

Are you surprised at the number of men in media who have been implicated? Of course I\u2019m surprised, especially when it\u2019s people you know and you\u2019ve worked with, and then this kind of thing comes to light. But on the other hand, the patriarchy has dominated for thousands of years, and people see it as their God-given right. It\u2019s not just sexual harassment or abuse or all the other sexual issues \u2014 it\u2019s everything. According to the I.M.F., when women are equally represented in all aspects of economy and business, it can cause national G.D.P.s to rise rapidly. In the United States, having equal numbers of women in the work force would raise America\u2019s G.D.P. by five percentage points. In India, by 27 percentage points. If people can\u2019t be persuaded to see a woman\u2019s right to control her own body as a moral issue, it\u2019s most definitely an economic one.\n\nThere has been some hand-wringing about the fired men: that a mass of male talent is departing the industry. Do you agree? That pisses me off. These talented men are suppressing talented women! You cannot put a figure on the number of young women who have been squelched or run out of Dodge because they haven\u2019t been able to tolerate it.\n\nWhat was it like studying how other cultures deal with sex for \u201cSex and Love Around the World\u201d while there\u2019s this crisis back in the United States? I set out to talk to people about their sense of empowerment, of agency over their own bodies, feelings, futures, marriages, their ability to be free in their own society, how much control they have over their sexuality. It just so happens that it dovetailed with this evidence that many people in the West have less control over that than we would like to imagine.\n\nI have to admit, watching it felt like a departure from the reporting we\u2019ve seen from you in the past. In asking people questions about sex, you inadvertently kind of reveal what you think about sex. I hope people will not be shocked. One thing I found: Everywhere we went, everybody had the same questions. You realize that we\u2019re all the same.\n\nYou\u2019ve been at CNN for 35 years. What has it been like for you, as one of the primary voices of the network, having President Trump make it a target? Of course I\u2019m outraged, but I don\u2019t take it personally. I think it\u2019s just a silly distraction. But do I think that we\u2019re in trouble?

Well, that might\u2019ve been true in the early days, but I don\u2019t think anybody benefits from this kind of sustained assault. It\u2019s not just damaging to a network \u2014 it\u2019s damaging to civil society and to the United States\u2019 democracy, which is based on knowing the difference between truth and lies. Truth leads to democracy, lies lead to dictatorship and this is where I think people, whether it\u2019s the president or people around him, are not fully aware of the real impact of what they\u2019re saying. It drives wedges between people, and if anything, these recent elections have told us that the population has become so polarized that people can be affected by lies that are peddled and empty promises that are made, tribalistic policies that are rammed down people\u2019s throats, and you have to be really, really careful.\n\nDo you think that there are ways journalists could be making a better effort to build credibility? One of the big issues is that because of money, so much journalism is being cut back \u2014 not necessarily at the big operations, but in local markets, where it really counts. You have national or international news organizations parachuting into the middle of the country for a few hours, but you don\u2019t have as much of that great indigenous local reporting that you used to have.

The $203 billion lender took a $22 billion charge in the last quarter of 2017 as it wrote down deferred tax assets \u2014 credits against future tax bills \u2014 and took a hit for deemed repatriation of overseas earnings. That left it deep in the red. But its new corporate tax rate of an effective 25 percent will hike earnings in the future. If the tax law had been in effect last year, the 9.6 percent return on tangible common equity Citigroup just reported for the year would have risen above 10 percent \u2014 already beating his target for 2018, and suggesting that Mr. Corbat can be more ambitious.\n\nBeyond that, the impact of the tax cuts becomes less clear, but they will probably still be helpful. If consumers and small businesses feel richer, as its rival JPMorgan Chase said last week they probably will, a beneficiary should be a company like Citigroup, which makes roughly one-quarter of its revenue from credit cards. Mr. Corbat warned last year that the cost of writing down unrecoverable loans was going to rise a little more than expected, and credit losses on its North American own-brand card business rose 10 percent in the quarter. More cash flow for households may keep that in check \u2014 and might actually encourage more borrowing.\n\nWhere Mr. Corbat can steer Citigroup directly, he is doing so. Expenses fell to 58 percent of revenue, compared with 59 percent a year ago. Investment banking was more mixed: Revenue from fixed-income trading, where Citigroup is heavily exposed to flaccid rate and currency movements, plunged by almost one-fifth. Yet the bank is collecting more advisory fees. Its share of the overall pot rose a little to 4.8 percent in 2017, according to data from Thomson Reuters.", "title": "Citigroup Steers Into Recovery, With Others\u2019 Hands on the Wheel", "authors": []}

Without it, Citigroup\u2019s quarterly earnings and revenue exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates. And the bank\u2019s chief executive, Michael L. Corbat, told investors in a statement accompanying its earnings announcement that the tax overhaul would lead to higher profits in the future. The company\u2019s stock rose in early trading on Wall Street.\n\nCitigroup is the second major bank to reveal a one-time loss related to the new tax code. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase said adjusting to the new regime would cost it $2.4 billion.\n\nCitigroup reported a net loss for the quarter of $18.3 billion. Excluding the tax charge, Citigroup\u2019s quarterly profit was $3.7 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared to $3.6 billion, or $1.14 per share, for the same period in 2016. Analysts had expected the bank\u2019s earnings per share to be $1.19.\n\nOf the $22 billion tax charge, $19 billion came from lowering the value of assets on Citigroup\u2019s books that the bank had planned to use to shield itself from taxes under the old, higher corporate tax rate. The top corporate rate under the new law will be lowered to 21 percent from 35 percent. Citigroup\u2019s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24.9 percent.\n\nThe remaining $3 billion came from the cost of moving cash that the bank held overseas back into the United States, as required under the new law.", "title": "Citigroup Takes a $22 Billion Tax Hit, but Sees Higher Profits Ahead", "authors": ["Emily Flitter"]}

Yet local investigations into the crisis, which began after Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar security posts last August, claim that not a single Rohingya civilian was harmed by the Tatmadaw, as the Myanmar military is known.\n\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi has set up at least half a dozen commissions, panels and boards dedicated to the turmoil in Rakhine, including the Advisory Commission Board on Rakhine State, to which Mr. Richardson was named.\n\nKofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general, chaired another panel, which was formed after an earlier military crackdown on the Rohingya in 2016. His commission recommended that the government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar allow unfettered humanitarian access to the epicenter of violence in northern Rakhine.\n\nTo this day, however, the Myanmar government has refused to allow United Nations investigators and the international media to freely visit northern Rakhine. Aid groups have been similarly stymied. Last month, Yanghee Lee, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar who has been a vocal critic of the military crackdown, was denied a visa to the country.\n\nMr. Richardson, a former United Nations ambassador under President Bill Clinton, has a reputation as a diplomatic troubleshooter.

The Redskins are seen by many as having one of the most egregiously insensitive nicknames, though the team and the N.F.L. have expressed little interest in changing it. The Braves, of Major League Baseball, have also drawn criticism, especially for the so-called tomahawk chant performed by fans at games.\n\nIn 2014, under Mark Shapiro, the team president at the time, the Indians reduced the use of the Chief Wahoo logo and introduced a block C as their primary insignia. Shapiro, who is now the Toronto Blue Jays\u2019 president, said the grinning caricature made him uncomfortable. But Chief Wahoo was still used by Cleveland, including during high-profile games in the postseason (the team reached the World Series in 2016).\n\nSmall groups of protesters regularly gather outside Progressive Field before important games, such as home openers and playoff games. While the protesters frequently incur the wrath of fans passing by on the way to the stadium, they have been on amicable terms with the team itself, which often coordinated with the police and the protesters to ensure their safety and right to assemble peacefully.\n\nSome have sought action from the courts to outlaw the logo and the team name. During the 2016 postseason, Douglas Cardinal, an indigenous Canadian activist, sought an injunction from a Canadian court to prevent Cleveland from using uniforms depicting Chief Wahoo or the team name while playing in Toronto.\n\nThe petition was denied, and Manfred said at the time that the courts were not the venue to resolve the dispute. He did, however, promise to engage the Cleveland ownership about significant changes regarding the use of the logo. Last April, during the Indians\u2019 home opener against the Chicago White Sox, Manfred for the first time made clear his desire to get rid of the logo altogether and outlined his intention to push Dolan on the issue.\n\nAlthough the Indians will stop using the logo on their uniforms, they will not relinquish the trademark and still will be able to profit off sales of merchandise bearing the logo at the stadium and in the Cleveland area. But by maintaining the trademark, the team, with the supervision of M.L.B., retains control of the proliferation of the logo. If it relinquished the trademark, or announced an intention never to claim its protections, another party could legally assume control of it and use the logo in other ways.", "title": "Cleveland Indians Will Abandon Chief Wahoo Logo Next Year", "authors": []}

They can sense chemicals given off by fish in their vicinity, and in response they make themselves harder to eat.\n\nSome species grow a massive crest on their head, while others sprout spikes.

When the researchers lowered the pH with hydrochloric acid, the water fleas responded normally to predators.\n\nDr. Weiss hypothesized that carbon dioxide interferes with the nervous system of the water fleas, blunting their ability to look out for predators.\n\nCaleb T. Hasler, a biologist at the University of Winnipeg, said that the new research addressed an unanswered question: the amounts of carbon dioxide that might harm freshwater life.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis paper is really important because it starts to show where those levels might be,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Hasler\u2019s own recent research hints that water fleas may not be the only freshwater animals to be altered by carbon dioxide. He and his colleagues studied minnows swimming in water rich with carbon dioxide and found that the fish don\u2019t respond as quickly to alarm signals released by other minnows.\n\nIn another study, the team studied two species of mussels. One species relaxed its muscles in water high in carbon dioxide, so that its shell gaped open. The other species clamped its shell shut, so that it could no longer filter food.\n\nThese sorts of changes may send ripples out across entire freshwater ecosystems. Mussels are vital for filtering food and keeping water clear, for example. If water fleas do a worse job of escaping predators, their population may decline, leaving less food in the long run for fish.\n\nBut it\u2019s not certain that inland waters around the world are building up carbon dioxide at the rate that Dr. Weiss and her colleagues observed in the German reservoirs.\n\nIn November, Dr. Stanley and her colleagues published a study of carbon dioxide levels in lakes in Wisconsin. Between 1986 and 2011, they detected no significant change at all.\n\nThe mismatch points to the complex chemistry varying from one lake to the next. While lakes and rivers all absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, some also draw in the gas from surrounding soils.\n\nThe chemistry of some inland waters causes a lot of carbon dioxide to be converted into other compounds. Some lakes and streams may support a lot of underwater plants that take up the gas, for instance, while others may have microbes can release more of it.\n\nMaking matters even more complicated, the carbon dioxide levels in any particular body of freshwater can change drastically over time with swings in temperature and other conditions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cYou can have lakes where the carbon dioxide increases tenfold at night,\u201d said Dr. Hasler.\n\nIn decades to come, as carbon dioxide levels continue to climb in the atmosphere, Dr. Stanley speculated, the picture will only get more nuanced.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going,\u201d said Dr. Stanley. \u201cI\u2019ll probably put my money on increased variability from lake to lake. They\u2019re just going to be more extreme.\u201d\n\nDr. Weiss agreed that it wasn\u2019t possible to draw big lessons from the preliminary data. \u201cI think this study we\u2019re publishing is like a door-opener,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope there will be other scientists who will follow.\u201d", "title": "Climate Change Is Altering Lakes and Streams, Study Suggests", "authors": ["Carl Zimmer"]}

Perhaps some of the people affected by the fires in California, the hurricanes in Puerto Rico and Texas, and the drought in the Dakotas will be similarly motivated. Maybe some of these climate change victims will become the climate policy champions we sorely need.\n\nIt is never too soon after one of these disasters to speak truth about climate change\u2019s role.

Ohio State and Penn State were also sued after denying a rental request. Both had pointed to safety reasons. The suits filed on behalf of Cameron Padgett, a Georgia State University student who organizes and books Mr. Spencer\u2019s appearances, argue that his free speech rights were violated.\n\nAnd some 800 miles away from Gainesville, administrators at the University of Cincinnati, who also received a request for Mr. Spencer to speak on campus, eventually agreed to negotiate a date in mid-March during the school\u2019s spring break. Last week, a lawsuit filed in federal court accuses the university of excessive and therefore \u201cunconstitutional\u201d security fees for Mr. Spencer\u2019s appearance. The amount: $10,833.\n\nThe University of Florida would eventually cancel Mr. Spencer\u2019s visit, but not for long. Mr. Spencer, a leader of the far-right white nationalist movement, had the law on his side. When it became clear that his visit was certain, the administration coordinated an event that would come to include a $600,000 price tag. More than 1,000 police officers converged on the ground, in the air, on the roofs \u2014 and there was plenty of soul-searching about the role of public universities as incubators of ideas, even those that are unpopular.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

A self-labeled white supremacist was sucker-punched while wearing a swastika T-shirt (he was later hugged and befriended by two black men) and three Texas men were arrested and charged with attempted murder after they taunted a group of anti-Spencer protesters after the event.

The university had already agreed to a Sept. 12 date and a campus location when Charlottesville erupted.\n\nMr. Fuchs said Mr. Spencer\u2019s message was the exact opposite of the university\u2019s inclusiveness values.

He wondered whether a judge, through the lens of violence, would side with the university.\n\nOn Aug. 16, Florida officially rejected the National Policy Institute\u2019s application, citing public safety concerns. The decision, Mr. Fuchs said, was based on the specter of violence, not Mr. Spencer\u2019s pointed ideology.\n\nMr. Fuchs suspected the decision would not stand. Auburn University had already lost a similar battle when a federal judge ruled Mr. Spencer should be allowed to speak on campus based on his First Amendment rights.\n\nIt foreshadowed the story in Gainesville. A local lawyer representing Mr. Spencer threatened to sue the university. Florida eventually reversed its decision. Mr. Spencer would pay $10,564 to rent the Curtis M. Phillips Center for Performing Arts. He would be speaking on Oct. 19, the first such event at a public university since Charlottesville.\n\nMost every morning until the day Mr. Spencer walked onto the stage, a small circle of university administrators, including Mr. Fuchs and the campus police chief, Linda Stump-Kurnick, held an 8 a.m. planning call.\n\n\u201cWe had to figure out how much or little and the tone of my communications,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the students needed to hear from me personally even if they didn\u2019t agree with my thinking.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe day before Mr. Spencer\u2019s speech, a group of students protested outside the administration building.

It expanded sanctions against Russia by penalizing those who do substantial business with the Russian military or intelligence sectors.\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration announced sanctions against 21 individuals, including Russia\u2019s deputy energy minister, Andrey Cherezov, as well as nine business entities.\n\nMuch of official Washington had paid little heed when the provision with the law was passed, expecting the list to be shelved and forgotten as soon as it was released, as such reports often are. The recent lobbying push \u2014 including a procession seeking assurances from the White House, the State Department and Congress \u2014 has raised the report\u2019s profile and made it, against all expectations, significant.\n\nRussia and sanctions experts say they have been inundated by inquiries about the report, which is being written at the Treasury and State Departments.\n\nPolitical appointees in the Trump administration, spooked by the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election that is being led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, have given the report a broad scope.

Four Republican senators named two oligarchs last week that they said they wanted included. And four Democratic lawmakers said the list could be used to quickly widen sanctions, should Russia interfere in elections scheduled this year in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI understand that the report has created consternation among some who don\u2019t want to be on the list or be seen as associated with the Putin regime,\u201d said Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland. \u201cI hope that this report will lead some to reconsider the wisdom of associating with the Putin regime.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With no penalties associated with being listed, they told people to stop worrying.\n\nThat did not happen.\n\nDaniel Fried, a top White House adviser on Russia to both President Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush, said the surprising unease among Russians had given the list unexpected power.\n\n\u201cIn their anxiety, I sense leverage and opportunity to make a point, and that point is that Putin\u2019s aggression has consequences against Russia\u2019s elite,\u201d Mr. Fried said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLobbyists who represent wealthy Russians said in multiple interviews that their clients\u2019 concerns were twofold: that the American government might one day use the list to impose sanctions, and that banks and other global financial institutions would stop serving them because of that possible risk. None would speak publicly.\n\nThe lobbyists also voiced fears that the report could empower Mr. Putin by pushing oligarchs even more firmly into his orbit \u2014 the opposite of what Congress intended.\n\nA registry of foreign agents to Russia, compiled by the Justice Department, includes many of Washington\u2019s most powerful legal, communications and lobbying firms, including Sidley Austin, Venable, APCO and White & Case. A review of those records, by the Center for Responsive Politics, found 279 registrations of Russian agents in the United States.\n\nAndrey Borodin, a wealthy Russian fugitive and former president of the Bank of Moscow, hired BGR Group to lobby on his behalf. Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi, and Maya Seiden, a former State Department official, were listed on the registry as representing Mr. Borodin for BGR over \u201cvisa issues.\u201d Ms. Seiden declined to comment on her work for Mr. Borodin.\n\nAdam M. Smith, a Washington lawyer and former sanctions adviser for the Treasury Department, said the uncertainty about what would be done with the list was unusual.\n\n\u201cThis has literally never been done before, and it represents an extraordinary outsourcing of our foreign policy,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to tell banks that this person is sanctioned. It\u2019s another entirely to say, \u2018Hey, this person is on a list. Figure out yourself what to do with them.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn putting together a multifaceted lobbying campaign about the report, the oligarchs have collectively caused the very problem they had hoped to avoid \u2014 government scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re that sophisticated, shouldn\u2019t they also be aware this report is relatively small potatoes?\u201d Ms. Rosenberg asked.\n\nMuch of the reason for the Russians\u2019 anxiety, though, is the widely held view in Moscow that events in Washington have become wholly irrational. Few understand what they see as the American obsession with Russian hacking efforts and suspected collusion with Mr. Trump, Mr. Caputo said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFrom the Russian perspective, there is no rhyme or reason to anything going on in Washington right now,\u201d Mr. Caputo said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried Russian banks will go under and people will lose everything, and that\u2019s because what America will do right now is absolutely unpredictable.\u201d", "title": "Coming U.S. List of Oligarchs Linked to Putin Alarms Russia\u2019s Rich", "authors": ["Gardiner Harris"]}

His compulsive tweeting habits, betraying a limited vocabulary, aim to bypass the mainstream media that he loathes; he watches TV, doesn\u2019t read books, takes a lot of time off.\n\nMr. Macron, as soon as he was elected, reverted to a quasi-monarchical presidential role. His goal, he explained, was to restore authority and dignity to an office that had been weakened by his predecessors Nicolas Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande. His Twitter line is kept strictly to official announcements. He communicates through 90-minute speeches and lengthy interviews studded with references to philosophers, archaic words and refined grammar. He doesn\u2019t think much of French journalists; he would obviously rather control them if he could, instead of just attacking them as \u201cfailing.\u201d He is a true workaholic and makes it known that his nights are short.\n\nThe two leaders do have a few things in common. They are both lucky \u2014 and in politics, luck matters. The American president enjoys buoyant economic conditions, part of a global economic surge; similarly, his French counterpart has benefited from an upswing in the eurozone. They both managed to pass, in their first year, a tax reform criticized by their opponents for mostly benefiting the wealthy and intended to convince the corporate world that they are on its side. But neither conforms to a classic ideological line; pundits in their respective countries struggle to define Macronism or Trumpism.\n\nStill, there is one glaring difference: The approval ratings of President Macron, unlike those of President Trump, are on the rise. Polling experts in France say their president, having realized that it would be difficult to regain voters\u2019 confidence on the domestic scene at this early stage of his reforms, has been trying to win it through principled stances and activism on the world scene. In the United States, polling experts note that despite a booming economy, President Trump struggles to raise his approval ratings from levels lower than those of any of his predecessors in their first year in office.\n\nIt is still early in their terms. Keep watching this competition.

But the company was applying a theoretical tax rate that was higher than what was included in the Republican tax package. As a result, Apple is likely to pay about $3 billion less than what its accountants had told it to set aside, said Mr. Harvey, the Villanova professor.\n\nFiguring out how to tally this quickly is giving finance chiefs heartburn. Regulators are offering some breathing room. Two days after Christmas, the Securities and Exchange Commission essentially gave companies an extension to report any expected tax-law-related losses or gains, if they could not come up with a \u201creasonable estimate\u201d by the end of the year.\n\nGoing forward, the tax code will be more profitable for multinational companies based in the United States. The simplest change: The corporate income tax rate is dropping to 21 percent, from 35 percent. Overnight, the United States becomes one of the lowest-tax jurisdictions in the developed world.\n\nUnder the previous tax regime, American companies owed federal income taxes on their worldwide profits, regardless of whether they were generated domestically or internationally. (They could indefinitely defer the taxes on profits earned abroad \u2014 as long as those profits stayed overseas.)\n\nThe new tax law changes that. Now companies have to pay full income taxes only on profits that they say were earned in the United States. Income earned abroad will be subject to federal income taxes at half that rate \u2014 10.5 percent \u2014 and potentially even less. As a result, companies are likely to shift even more profits into tax havens \u2014 even if they want to use that money in the United States.\n\nIt is not only American companies bracing for short-term losses from the legislation.\n\nIn Europe, several companies said the new tax law would generate one-time hits to their profits. On Tuesday, BP said the law would lop $1.5 billion from profit in the fourth quarter of 2017. That\u2019s because the lower corporate rate will reduce the value of future tax deductions that the British oil and gas company had been expecting to benefit from.\n\nCredit Suisse said last month that it would take a $2.3 billion write-down because of the tax bill. Royal Dutch Shell said on Dec. 27 that it would subtract up to $2.5 billion from its quarterly profits.\n\nSeveral companies said the tax overhaul would result in a one-time gain.

Since then, it has applied the same method to many other parts of the car, including systems that predict what will happen on the road and plan a route forward. Now, the industry as a whole is moving in the same direction.\n\nBut this shift raises questions. It is still unclear how regulators and lawyers \u2014 not to mention the general public \u2014 will view these methods. Because neural networks learn from such large amounts of data, relying on hours or even days of calculations, they operate in ways that their human designers cannot necessarily anticipate or understand. There is no means of determining exactly why a machine reaches a particular decision.\n\n\u201cThis is a big transition,\u201d said Noah Goodall, who explores regulatory and legal issues surrounding autonomous cars at the Virginia Transportation Research Council, an arm of the State Department of Transportation. \u201cIf you start using neural networks to control how a car moves and then it crashes, how do you explain why it crashed and why it won\u2019t happen again?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe seeds for this work were planted in 2012. Working with two other researchers at the University of Toronto, a graduate student named Alex Krizhevsky built a neural network that could recognize photos of everyday objects like flowers, dogs and cars. By analyzing thousands of flower photos, it could learn to recognize a flower in a matter of days. And it performed better than any system coded by hand.\n\nSoon, Mr. Krizhevsky and his collaborators moved to Google, and over the next few years, Google and its internet rivals broke new ground in artificial intelligence, using these concepts to identify objects in photos and to recognize commands spoken into smartphones, translate between languages and respond to internet search queries.\n\nPhoto\n\nOver the holiday break at the end of 2013, another Google researcher, Anelia Angelova, asked for Mr. Krizhevsky\u2019s help on the Google car project. Neither of them officially worked on the project. They were part of a separate A.I. lab called Google Brain. But they saw an opportunity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRather than trying to define for a computer what a pedestrian looked like, they created an algorithm that could allow a computer to learn what a pedestrian looked like. By analyzing thousands of street photos, their system could begin to identify the visual patterns that define a pedestrian, like the curve of a head or the bend of a leg. The method was so effective that Google began applying the technique to other parts of the project, including prediction and planning.\n\n\u201cIt was a big turning point,\u201d said Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of Google\u2019s original self-driving car team and is now chief technology officer at Waymo, the new company that oversees the project. \u201c2013 was pretty magical.\u201d\n\nMr. Urmson described this shift in much the same way. He believes the continued progress of these and other machine learning methods will be essential to building cars that can match and even exceed the behavior of human drivers.\n\nPhoto\n\nMirroring the work at Waymo, Aurora is building algorithms that can recognize objects on the road and anticipate and react to what other vehicles and pedestrians will do next. As Mr. Urmson explained, the software can learn what happens when a driver turns the vehicle in a particular direction at a particular speed on a particular type of road.\n\nLearning from human drivers in this way is an evolution of an old idea. In the early 1990s, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University built a car that learned relatively simple behavior. Last year, a team of researchers at Nvidia, the computer chip maker, published a paper showing how modern hardware can extend the idea to more complex behavior. But many researchers question whether carmakers can completely understand why neural networks make particular decisions and rule out unexpected behavior.\n\n\u201cFor cars or flying aircraft, there is a lot of concern over neural networks doing crazy things,\u201d said Mykel Kochenderfer, a robotics professor who oversees the Intelligent Systems Laboratory at Stanford University.\n\nSome researchers, for instance, have shown that neural networks trained to identify objects can be fooled into seeing things that aren\u2019t there \u2014 though many, including Mr. Kochenderfer, are working to develop ways of identifying and preventing unexpected behavior.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike Waymo, Toyota and others, Aurora says that its approach is more controlled than it might seem. The company layers cars with backup systems, so that if one system fails, another can offer a safety net. And rather than driving the car using a single neural network that learns all behavior from one vast pool of data \u2014 the method demonstrated by Nvidia \u2014 they break the task into smaller pieces.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne system detects traffic lights, for example. Another predicts what will happen next on the road in a particular kind of situation. A third chooses a response. And so on.

The city is experimenting with ways to reduce its jail population with a goal of closing the Rikers Island jail complex. And as state lawmakers consider eliminating cash bail, an idea boosted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in his State of the State address, some prosecutors have stopped requesting it for most misdemeanor offenses.\n\nBut for now, Mr. Stringer and others are pushing for meaningful changes under the existing law, which gives judges options to set bail with bonds that can be paid in court with little to no money. Unlike commercial bail bonds, payments are returned when the case is resolved.\n\nWhile current bail reform efforts mainly target people charged with misdemeanor offenses and nonviolent felony crimes that do not involve domestic violence, Mr. Stringer\u2019s proposal could aid any defendant eligible for bail.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that alternative bail forms are just as effective in making sure people return to court. In one analysis released in September, the Vera Institute of Justice tracked 99 cases where judges set alternative bail options. Sixty-eight defendants were released on bail and five were freed on their word, and they returned to court at roughly the same rate as people who are released without bail conditions or freed after paying cash or posting a bond.\n\n\u201cThe problem is old,\u201d Insha Rahman, the author of the analysis, said.

Kendi notes that Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson said racist things at various points in their lives. But the important thing is that both men overcame their earlier sentiments to eventually free the slaves (Lincoln) and sign comprehensive civil rights legislation that included protection of voting rights (Johnson). In both cases, these men decided that they loved the ideals \u201cliberty and justice for all\u201d with such conviction that they overcame their inner demons. Then they acted on their conviction. It is important what they did, not what they said.\n\nNEIL CAREY, ANNANDALE, VA.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIbram X. Kendi did an incredibly succinct job of highlighting the disconnect between racist ideologies and the perpetrators of these ideologies who refuse to admit to participating in the first place. Senator Richard Durbin\u2019s take on President Trump\u2019s comments about Haiti and Africa as being \u201chate-filled, vile and racist\u201d is well founded. As presidential scandal after scandal cycles through the news like clockwork, we are drawn to the conclusion that Mr. Trump is the worst thing to happen to the Oval Office in American history.\n\nGranted, his presidency is definitely high on that scale. But when we take a step back and look in the greater context of American politics, we see a troubling trend. As Mr. Kendi reminds us, eight presidents owned slaves while in office. Lyndon B. Johnson said the N-word repeatedly, and even Abraham Lincoln was guilty of bigotry. Racism, and repeated denial of such beliefs, have been an integral part of our government since its founding, as much as we might try to deny it.\n\nEMILY GETNER, CHICAGO\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nAs a cultural anthropologist and educator, I accept the premise that ethnocentrism and racism are universal human traits. Given this, it is simply natural that at one level all of us are racists and all of us have certain innate tribal tendencies. However, at the same time human beings have the capacity to understand that skin color is not a legitimate or even practical means of measuring or comparing individual human worth, character or potential. This assumption lies at the heart of modern democracy, the American Constitution and an efficient global economy.\n\nIf indeed at one level all of us are born with racist tendencies, feeling a natural preference for those who look like us, then what does it mean to be called a \u201cracist\u201d? Unfortunately, it is a descriptor that has been used so often in recent years that it has lost its meaning. The fact is there is a condition in some Americans, including our president, that runs much deeper than simple \u201cracism,\u201d a condition that causes them to debase people of color with impunity. It makes individuals seem oblivious to the regressive nature and sheer cruelty of their actions.\n\nYes, this is racism, but also something much more serious. It is what I would call \u201cpathobigotry,\u201d a mental condition born of one\u2019s own feelings of inadequacy that drives one to degrade and consciously discriminate against others who are different as a means of bolstering one\u2019s own sense of self-worth.", "title": "Opinion | Confronting Racism in America", "authors": []}

Trucks and commercial vehicles would be charged a fee of $25.34 to enter during peak traffic times. The plan would also impose a surcharge of $2 to $5 on trips in for-hire vehicles, including yellow taxis and Uber cars, in much of Manhattan.\n\nWhile congestion pricing has been adopted in cities around the world including London, Stockholm and Singapore, it has never been tried in New York despite repeated attempts going back to at least the 1970s. Its basic premise is that traffic can be reduced by charging a fee or toll at peak hours that would serve as a disincentive to drivers. An effort by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2008 would have charged a fee of $8 to drive into Midtown and Lower Manhattan, but it died in the State Assembly without coming to a vote.\n\nMr. Cuomo said that he would review the task force\u2019s report and discuss options with state lawmakers over the next several months. He can reject any or all of the plan.\n\nMr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is up for re-election this year, almost certainly faces a legislative battle over congestion pricing, especially with lawmakers from the boroughs outside Manhattan who fear that a congestion plan would hurt their constituents who drive because they have limited access to subways and buses.

A last-minute bill, signed the day before the rest of the federal government\u2019s appropriations were set to expire, guaranteed that I and the rest of the military would continue to receive our paychecks. It was comforting, I suppose, to know that at least Congress could muster the bipartisan will to accomplish something, but even at the time it struck me as absurd: The same Congress and administration that jumped at the opportunity to demonstrate how much they cared about the troops seemed perfectly comfortable with the status quo of endless war. Missing a paycheck would have been an inconvenience. Fighting in a war that I still don\u2019t understand, however, has affected me and my brothers and sisters in uniform in far more pernicious and long-lasting ways.\n\nOn Saturday morning, after congressional negotiations over a short-term spending bill once again ran aground, triggering a partial shutdown of the federal government that lasted through Monday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, tweeted a photo of a TV. Some active-duty service members and veterans on Twitter guessed that the TV was likely in a dining facility on a military base in Afghanistan, although that has not been confirmed. It displayed the message that the American Forces Network (AFN) had been shut off by the shutdown and that the troops wouldn\u2019t be able to watch the A.F.C. and N.F.C. championship football games on Sunday.\n\nAs political theater, it was as effective as it was unsubtle: Barbara Starr, the Pentagon correspondent from CNN, was soon asking Pentagon representatives and deployed service members about workarounds that might allow them to stream the game; Jake Tapper picked up and shared the news in a tweet as well. The White House phone line, meanwhile, played a recorded message: \u201cWe cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities, hostage to an unrelated immigration debate. Due to this obstruction, the government is shut down.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, as the shutdown loomed, Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a news conference that the military was being used as a \u201cpolitical bargaining chip.\u201d Defense Secretary James Mattis echoed that line in a speech he gave Friday morning at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies: \u201cAs hard as the last 16 years have been, no enemy in the field has done more to harm the readiness of the U.S. military than the combined impact of the Budget Control Act, defense spending cuts and operating in nine of the last 10 years under continuing resolutions.\u201d Most extraordinarily, Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech in front of the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing, deployed to Jordan, on Sunday that broke with conventions of nonpartisanship in addresses to the military, accusing a \u201csmall minority in the Senate\u201d \u2014 a thinly veiled reference to Democrats \u2014 of \u201cplaying politics with military pay.\u201d Pence promised that the administration wouldn\u2019t reopen negotiations on \u201cillegal immigration\u201d until \u201cthey reopen the government and give you, our soldiers and your families the benefits and wages you\u2019ve earned.\u201d", "title": "Congress Suddenly Cares About the Troops When a Shutdown Looms.

It\u2019s actually an omnibus bill composed of three acts:\n\nFirst, the Fair Play, Fair Pay Act, which establishes a performance right for artists. Right now, radio stations don\u2019t have to pay artists whose songs they play on the airwaves (the stations pay performance royalties to the music publishers and the songwriters). The United States is the only developed country where this is the case. This act would require stations to pay artists and record companies a royalty. It also includes the Allocation for Music Producers Act, which would enshrine in law the right for producers to receive royalties due them. The Fair Play, Fair Pay Act has bipartisan support. But the legacy radio broadcasters oppose this measure.\n\nSecond, the Classics Act, which closes the loophole in federal copyright law that prevents recordings from before 1972 from receiving compensation. Even the United States Copyright Office has noted the inconsistency that pre-1972 works aren\u2019t covered adequately with copyright protection. The Classics Act would allow for the payment of royalties to artists and record labels that made songs many decades ago. This act, which would particularly benefit older musicians who are struggling financially, also has bipartisan support.\n\nThird, the Music Modernization Act, which creates a blanket license for mechanical royalties. (Mechanicals are the royalty payments due publishers and songwriters when their songs are reproduced in various formats like CDs, LPs, downloads and streaming.) Currently a copyright board determines the rate of compensation according to a fixed legal standard. But this act would enable the board to base rates on the market value of what a buyer or seller is willing to pay. A change to this more dynamic standard would mean that songwriters could be compensated more in line with the market.\n\nDespite the bipartisan support for these measures, it will still take substantial effort to pressure Congress to act. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a growth of interest in creator activism like never before,\u201d Mr. Friedman said. The Recording Academy has marshaled significant resources toward promoting these bills \u2014 for instance, starting the Grammy District Advocate Program, in which thousands of members of the academy meet with elected officials every year in support of legislation. Until now, Congress has been waiting for some type of industry consensus and bipartisan support to emerge, and now it has.

Because it has not and cannot change the reality that abortion is a present and permanent part of Irish life.

Flourishing animal spirits involve complacency, a playful mood, a \u201cdamn the torpedoes, full speed ahead\u201d feeling of confidence.\n\nThat kind of exuberance now seems to be fueling the stock market, where prices have outstripped fundamental valuations. Real (inflation-corrected) corporate earnings per share for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index were, for the third quarter of 2017, only 6 percent higher than they were in the second quarter of 2007, just before the financial crisis. In contrast, real stock market prices were 39 percent higher. That disproportionate increase is based much more on how earnings are being valued than on how the level of earnings has increased.\n\nSuch surges have happened before. The four major confidence indexes took a long ride up between 1990 and 2000, again after a recession. From the bottom of the Michigan index in October 1990 to a peak in February 2000, real S.&P. 500 price per share rose 256 percent while real earnings per share rose only 78 percent.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nWhy did share prices rise so much in that period? A traditional explanation is that investors had a \u201crational expectation\u201d of future earnings increases, but it is clear that they were grossly mistaken. The S.&P. 500 lost just over half its real value from its peak on March 24, 2000, to its trough on Oct. 9, 2002. No concrete event caused this plunge, though we can point to the bursting of the dot-com bubble and a recession. Both were plausibly caused by a drop in overinflated confidence.\n\nThe critical question, then: What drives these decade-long swings in confidence, including the upsurge that is still underway?\n\nTake the current confidence cycle. While Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidency may have exerted some impact on animal spirits in the last year, it doesn\u2019t explain the preceding eight years of slowly improving confidence. And I am skeptical that the upward swing can be entirely explained by standard factors like government and central bank stabilization policy or technological innovation.\n\nScholars are working on this problem. At the American Economic Association annual meeting in Philadelphia this month, I chaired a session on \u201cConfidence, Animal Spirits and Business Cycles.\u201d All three researchers presented papers describing how animal spirits are helping to drive the economy in the United States and across the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAyhan Kose, director of the World Bank Group\u2019s work on global macroeconomic outlook and forecasts, summarized work by the bank\u2019s researchers on confidence indexes and the business cycle. They compiled a new database of such survey-based indexes and measures of economic activity in 95 countries. Much of their data goes back before 2000, and in some cases to the early 1960s. The researchers found that consumer and business confidence tended to start declining before the peak of the business cycle, and to start recovering before recessions ended.\n\nIn short, confidence indexes are indeed leading indicators in a vast array of countries, and these individual country confidence indexes are driven by a global cycle, though how this cycle is synchronized still isn\u2019t clear. Fluctuations in animal spirits remain an essential mystery for economists, though it is encouraging to see that quantitative studies of the issue are underway.\n\nAs a practical matter, consumer confidence numbers are important but still limited in their predictive power. For example, the latest consumer confidence index numbers do not strongly suggest any imminent change in the uptrend we have been seeing for so long. That bodes well for the economy over the short term.\n\nBut history indicates that a long uptrend like this one will eventually shift downward, even if we can\u2019t say when it will happen. While the timing will be a surprise, we can expect a sharp change in direction that is likely to have serious consequences for the economy in the United States and around the world.", "title": "Consumer Confidence Is Lifting the Economy.

{"date": "2018-01-08 00:00:00", "text": "For decades, a dozen judges on the federal bench in Buenos Aires have let corruption cases languish without action, often running out the clock on the statute of limitations. Breakthroughs in high-profile cases often follow a reversal of political fortunes, calling into question the fairness of punitive measures. And even when prominent politicians have been convicted, they typically find a way to stay out of prison and keep their assets.\n\n\u201cMy conclusion is that Argentines cannot trust Argentine justice,\u201d said Laura Alonso, the head of Argentina\u2019s anticorruption office, a once-obscure federal agency that has gained visibility and authority since Mr. Macri was elected in 2015. \u201cIt responds to political spasms.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nArgentine prosecutors initiate corruption investigations by bringing forward allegations of wrongdoing. Judges have the authority to take or reject cases. In those that move forward, judges have the primary responsibility to investigate and decide whether a defendant should face trial.\n\nThe system does not subject judges to deadlines or much oversight. One of the 12 current federal judges in Buenos Aires, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that much of the criticism leveled against him and his colleagues was on point.\n\nWhile each judge has his own style of working, some are influenced by politics, he said, adding that the system had been set up in a way that allowed judges to manage the timing of their cases without any consequences.\n\nThe early-morning detention of former Vice President Amado Boudou in November seemed to exemplify this dynamic as a federal judge ordered his pretrial arrest in a yearslong money laundering and illicit enrichment case. Video footage of a barefoot and sweatpants-clad Mr. Boudou in his apartment while a judicial official read the charges against him shocked Argentines.\n\nMr. Boudou\u2019s arrest came shortly after a judge ordered the detention of a former planning minister, Julio de Vido, as part of two corruption-related investigations. The Oct. 25 detention took place days after Mr. Macri\u2019s coalition won a resounding victory in the country\u2019s midterm elections. Seemingly determined to avoid a perp-walk photo, Mr. de Vido turned himself in while law enforcement officers went to his apartment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFormer President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, who was recently elected to the Senate, faces five sets of corruption charges. She has also been indicted on a treason charge, accused of conspiring with Iran to cover up that country\u2019s role in a 1994 bombing in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people.\n\nShe and several top officials in her administration charged in the Iran case, including former Foreign Minister H\u00e9ctor Timerman, were ordered detained while they await trial. Mrs. Kirchner enjoys immunity from detention as a sitting senator.\n\nThey have all denied wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that the government uses the judiciary for political ends, specifically to tame and discipline the opposition,\u201d said Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, who served as the head of cabinet for President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s late husband and predecessor.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is very concerning,\u201d added Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez, who teaches criminal law at Buenos Aires University, \u201cbecause what is now being used against members of the opposition could one day target regular citizens.\u201d\n\nYet few Argentines doubt that corruption was rife during the Kirchner era. A former public works secretary, Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez, was caught with almost $9 million in cash stuffed in duffel bags. A former transportation secretary, Ricardo Jaime, sailed on a yacht and flew on a private plane provided by industry leaders his department awarded contracts to.\n\nTo grasp just how pervasive Argentina\u2019s culture of impunity has been, consider the case of former President Carlos Menem, who governed from 1989 to 1999. When he was questioned over the propriety of accepting a Ferrari from a government contractor, Mr. Menem responded defiantly, \u201cThe Ferrari is mine, mine, mine!\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nA flurry of investigations into corruption during his time in power dragged on for decades until a court in 2015 sentenced him to four years in prison for embezzling public funds to dole out bonuses to others in government. Yet the continuing appeals and the immunity from incarceration provided by Mr. Menem\u2019s Senate seat have so far allowed him to disregard the sentence.\n\nMr. Menem\u2019s successor, Fernando de la R\u00faa, who was in power from 1999 to 2001, was prosecuted, and acquitted, over allegations that he had bribed lawmakers to pass a labor reform.\n\nMacri officials and good-government watchdogs say corruption reached epic proportions during the governments of Mr. Kirchner and Mrs. Kirchner, his wife. The left-leaning Peronists governed from 2003 to 2015, an era that began with a windfall from a commodities boom and ended during a period of economic contraction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt began looking more like a kleptocracy,\u201d said Natalia Volosin, an Argentine human rights lawyer who studied the history of corruption while obtaining a doctorate at Yale.\n\nMr. Macri came into office as corruption scandals were rattling several countries in the region, most notably Brazil, where a team of judges and prosecutors have recovered billions of dollars and sentenced scores of politicians and businessmen for their roles in kickback schemes. Those cases have made corruption a top concern among voters throughout Latin America.\n\nPhoto\n\nSoon after taking office, Mr. Macri\u2019s government expanded a public records policy and made government bids and contracts accessible online. It also increased the number of public officials who have to disclose their assets in public filings.\n\n\u201cWe have a strong public demand in favor of public integrity,\u201d said Ms. Alonso, the anticorruption official, who is a former lawmaker. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let a single one slip through.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, at Mr. Macri\u2019s urging, Congress passed a corporate responsibility law that subjects firms that pay bribes to fines and prosecution, and a change to criminal procedure that established a mechanism for plea deals.\n\nPlea deals were decisive in getting a Brazilian corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, off the ground in 2014. Defendants, in a break with the past, began being detained before trial, and trials began taking months rather than years.\n\nYet in Argentina only one low-level corruption defendant has sought a plea deal so far. The reason, according to experts and government officials, is that most defendants regard the possibility of being ultimately held accountable as remote.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the spate of arrests will change that calculus. After all, final convictions in corruption cases remain the exception.\n\nMany within the judicial system are skeptical that there can be a fundamental change in the way things operate without a wholesale overhaul of the penal code and the judiciary.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome judges sincerely want to clean up the judiciary, the federal judge said, but others who have grown used to the system have no interest in changing it.", "title": "Corruption Arrests in Argentina Raise Hope, and Skepticism", "authors": ["Ernesto Londo\u00f1o", "Daniel Politi"]}

A referendum could then be held on whether to accept the terms.\n\nA referendum could also be triggered by a breakdown in the Brexit negotiations, with Britain facing either a hard Brexit or no deal. That, experts say, could create the political storm Mr. Featherstone spoke about.\n\nWho Would Support It?\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are, so far, the only party to have made a second vote on Brexit a driving priority in their agenda. But with only 12 seats in Parliament, they are only a minor factor in the House of Commons, and the public shows few signs of rallying to their cause.\n\nAs things stand now, said Tony Travers, the director of LSE London, a research center at the London School of Economics, only \u201ca minority of British politicians would like a second referendum.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for that, Mr. Travers said. Obviously, pro-Brexit lawmakers would vote against it, but so would many anti-Brexit ones who fear that a second victory for the \u201cleave\u201d side would shatter their hopes for a soft Brexit.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is not clear that the process could be reversed, even if the British public voted in a second referendum to remain.\n\n\u201cAs I see it, there are two routes to do this: a political and a legal one,\u201d Mr. Maugham said.

His specialty is election law, and at the Patton Boggs law firm, he worked under Benjamin Ginsberg, a veteran Republican campaign lawyer, defending clients against Federal Election Commission investigations into coordination between Republican campaign committees and outside groups.\n\nLater, President George W.

He and his father, Joseph Tigano Sr., were charged with marijuana distribution and were scheduled to appear in court in March 2009.\n\nAfter the father asked for a brief delay, the parties met in Federal District Court in Buffalo that April. During the hearing, the opinion said, Mr. Tigano, 53, was eager to get things moving and reminded the court at least 10 times of his right to a speedy trial. The behavior struck his lawyer, Thomas Farley, as unusual. Mr. Farley requested that his client take a mental competency test.\n\nFour months later, the results came back: Mr. Tigano was perfectly fit for trial. But he was also angry at Mr. Farley for having forced him to take the test and asked the court if he could represent himself. Another month went by as the court considered his request and assigned a \u201cstandby\u201d lawyer to assist him. Then, in January 2010, the second lawyer asked for a competency test.

In a statement Tuesday, FIFA said it was awaiting the reanalysis of the samples of Russian athletes who were implicated by a trove of data obtained from Moscow in November before trying to re-establish contact with Rodchenkov. The reanalysis of the doping samples, expected to happen later this month, may be necessary to establish further evidence to successfully discipline athletes. The lab in Switzerland that is conducting the analysis is giving priority to samples from the tainted 2014 Winter Olympics before the Winter Games next month in South Korea.\n\n\u201cFIFA will continue its investigations, working in close collaboration with WADA and exploring every possible avenue,\u201d FIFA officials said in the prepared statement.\n\nJames Walden, a lawyer for Rodchenkov, said FIFA officials had never gotten in touch with him.\n\nTygart said that was unacceptable. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s exasperating. Clean athletes and the public deserve to have the impact of Russian doping on football, if any, resolved immediately. We are over three years into dealing with this mess and there is no excuse for FIFA failing to contact the star witness at this point,\u201d Tygart said Tuesday.\n\nRodchenkov is currently in hiding in the United States. His testimony ultimately led to the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision in December to ban Russia\u2019s Olympic Committee from next month\u2019s Winter Olympics. After conducting their own investigation, the I.O.C.\u2019s investigators surmised that Rodchenkov, branded a traitor in Russia, had largely been telling the truth.\n\nRodchenkov has evidence of Russian soccer players being protected by the state doping program, according to Walden. Those claims first appeared in the explosive 2016 report for the World Anti-Doping Agency from the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren based his report on forensic evidence and the cooperation of Rodchenkov. The report said more than 1,000 athletes from across 30 sports may have had their samples covered up, including soccer players that were on Russia\u2019s 2014 World Cup roster.\n\nFIFA released a timeline of its investigation so far, which has yielded no evidence of doping by Russian soccer players. Critics say the organization is trying to avoid acrimony with the country that is playing host to the World Cup next summer. FIFA said if it can find evidence \u201cto demonstrate an antidoping rule violation by any athlete, FIFA will impose the appropriate sanction.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor all the time and work FIFA put into this defensive timeline, it could have picked up the phone and arranged an interview of Dr. Rodchenkov 10 times over,\u201d said Walden, the lawyer for Rodchenkov.\n\nPhoto\n\nRodchenkov remains an active participant in the ongoing process in which scores of athletes have been barred following a reanalysis of their samples.

Russia\u2019s broadcasters finally signed a deal to broadcast the tournament in late December after more than a year of balking at FIFA\u2019s demands.\n\nPresident Gianni Infantino\u2019s efforts to generate excitement for the tournament were torpedoed when a news conference before last month\u2019s World Cup draw was overshadowed by questions about doping and the continued presence of Vitaly Mutko, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, as head of the organizing committee. Mutko had days earlier received a lifetime ban from the Olympics for his role in the doping scandal. He had been Russia\u2019s sports minister at the time of the Sochi Games.\n\nMutko has since stepped down from the organizing committee and temporarily resigned from his post as head of Russian soccer\u2019s governing body.\n\nJiri Dvorak, FIFA\u2019s top doctor for 22 years until his ouster in October 2016, expressed surprise that his former employers had yet to reach out to Rodchenkov. Dvorak had an active role the last time a drugs scandal threatened to overcome the tournament.\n\nIn 1994, he resisted pressure from some of FIFA\u2019s most senior officials when the Argentine superstar Diego Maradona, then among the most famous men on the planet, was ousted for failing a drug test. \u201cThat was against opinion of some of the South Americans. But Maradona had to be removed because when it comes to things like this you have to act according to the laws and the regulations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe I.O.C. has defended its own prolonged investigation that ultimately reiterated what had largely been known for more than a year. The organization blamed the delay on the challenge of coming up with a scientific test that could categorically confirm the claims that bottles containing urine samples had been tampered with. Investigators in November also secured the crucial data from Russia\u2019s drug testing laboratory that helped the I.O.C. to identify athletes whose positive tests had been covered up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRodchenkov\u2019s lawyer said while there may have been some natural skepticism when the whistle-blower first made the claims of a widespread doping conspiracy, the chemist\u2019s credibility as a witness has been strengthened by the world\u2019s antidoping regulator, its independent investigator and now the I.O.C.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s overwhelming evidence showing that he\u2019s told the truth,\u201d Walden said. \u201cAt this point we would have thought FIFA would want to talk to him as one of its first priorities.\u201d\n\nFIFA hasn\u2019t hired an independent investigator to analyze the suspected doping cases. So far no soccer samples have been analyzed by the Lausanne laboratory that developed the complex tests to detect anomalies in Russian samples. FIFA has asked for its samples to be given priority after the last of the Sochi samples are tested later this month.\n\nDvorak, now a consulting neurologist at Zurich\u2019s Schulthess Clinic, said FIFA needed to act quickly to avoid allowing the Russian team to play under a cloud of suspicion. Reedie, the WADA president, added that it was up to the federations to verify WADA\u2019s information and act accordingly.\n\n\u201cWe want them to go ahead and act on this because they are responsible for the results,\u201d he said.", "title": "Critics Say FIFA Is Stalling a Doping Inquiry as World Cup Nears", "authors": ["Tariq Panja"]}

But the true impact would fall on Democratic representation at all levels of government, because Latinos and other minorities are largely reliably Democratic constituencies.\n\nThe last census failed to find 1.5 percent of the Hispanic population, the Census Bureau said, an undercount exceeded only by the 2.1 percent of African-Americans who were missed. No reliable estimate exists of how many more might be deterred from participating in the census by a citizenship question, but among several experts interviewed, the consensus was that it could be substantial.\n\nEven small variations can have large political consequences. In 1997, Republicans vigorously fought a proposal to statistically adjust census results to address undercounts and overcounts, in no small part because their own study suggested the tweaks could affect election results in as many as 26 of the 435 House seats.\n\nIn a so-called long-form version of the census that was dropped after 2000, about 17 percent of respondents were asked whether they were citizens, although not whether they were in the country legally. Since then, the citizenship question has been asked annually in the American Community Survey.\n\nThe citizenship question proposed by the Justice Department differs little, if at all, from the one in the American Community Survey.

Impoverished people are often unable to pay the bail set by judges in their cases and spend months or years in jail, unable to help with their defenses, and without knowing the strength of the case against them, defense lawyers say.

Still, the market remains minuscule, compared with, say, the roughly $1.5 trillion in United States corporate debt issued annually.\n\nBonds labeled \u201cgreen\u201d have existed for about a decade, said William D. Sokol, director of E.T.F. product management for VanEck. Fixed-income securities financed environmental projects before then but weren\u2019t often called green bonds (or, as they\u2019re also known, climate or sustainability bonds). That changed in 2014 with the creation of the Green Bond Principles by the International Capital Market Association in Zurich, Mr. Sokol said. The principles are voluntary guidelines. Coupled with increased concern about climate change, they have fostered this niche, he said.\n\nMr. Sokol\u2019s company sponsors the VanEck Vectors Green Bond E.T.F., an indexed offering. Built around the S.& P. Green Bond Select Index, it began in March and carries a net expense ratio of 0.4 percent. It invests worldwide in about 80 government, international and corporate securities. Mr. Sokol said he viewed the E.T.F. as helping diversify the holdings of United States investors. \u201cIt\u2019s the same investment case as for global bond investing \u2014 diversification with a multisector, multicountry portfolio.\u201d The greenness of the securities in the index \u2014 and thus the E.T.F. \u2014 is evaluated by the Climate Bonds Initiative.\n\nTwo actively managed mutual funds also devote themselves to this form of investment: the Mirova Global Green Bond Fund and the Calvert Green Bond Fund. The Mirova offering, managed by Mr. Wigley, started in the United States in February. It replicates a fund that Mirova, which is based in Paris, has offered in Europe since 2015. The United States version of the fund, sponsored by Natixis Investment Managers in Boston, invests in a variety of countries and types of issuers. It has a net expense ratio of 0.7 percent.\n\nAmong its recent top holdings were bonds of both the French government and Southern Power, a wholesale electricity generator that is a subsidiary of the Southern Company in Atlanta.\n\nFind Your Fund Explore Fund Results \u00bb See how the largest, leading and lagging funds compare.

Calvert, which factors environmental, social and governance factors into its investment decisions, has a team of analysts who investigate the green bona fides of bonds, he said. All the Calvert bond funds \u2014 there are 10 \u2014 must clear environmental thresholds, but the green fund \u201cfocuses even more on the environmental pillar,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors seeking a cheaper, more seasoned fund than the Mirova or Calvert one might look outside the strict green-bond niche to funds that invest more broadly \u2014 but still according to environmental, social and governmental principles \u2014 like the one managed by Ms. Palm at Parnassus. Hers, with a net expense ratio of 0.68 percent, began in 1992, and she took over in 2013. Another such offering is the TIAA-CREF Social Choice Bond Fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.67 percent and started in 2012.\n\nThat fund\u2019s manager, Stephen M. Liberatore, a managing director at TIAA Investments, said he aims to identify the best environmental performers and projects, regardless of whether their bonds are labeled green. That approach led him to Topaz Solar Farms. \u201cTopaz wasn\u2019t labeled, but it\u2019s a commercial-scale solar power project,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was once the largest in the U.S. \u2014 it\u2019s producing enough power for about 160,000 homes.\u201d Topaz is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a subsidiary of Warren E. Buffett\u2019s investment holding company.\n\n\u201cWhat my investors want is for us to use our expertise to get as close as possible to an end project with an environmental benefit,\u201d Mr. Liberatore said.\n\nA claim often made by proponents of green bonds is that investing in them addresses climate change and other environmental problems more directly than buying green stocks does. Bond proceeds, this argument goes, finance specific projects with the potential for measurable gains. With an equity investment, in contrast, you just own shares in a company with a reputation for environmental stewardship. The company\u2019s management still has discretion over its investments.\n\nJon F. Hale, director of sustainability research for Morningstar, said he regarded that argument as credible. \u201cWhen you think about impact, dollar for dollar, you probably are having a bigger impact\u201d with a green bond fund than an environmentally minded stock fund, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are estimates out there of the trillions of dollars in investments needed in renewables and energy efficiency over the next 30 years, and that\u2019s what these kinds of bonds are financing,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hale cautioned, however, that investors shouldn\u2019t abandon prudence for the sake of environmental purity. They should still stick to such investing tenets as keeping costs low, diversifying and allocating their money based on their goals and tolerance for risk.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, you should be allocated across asset classes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can activate your desire for sustainability with your bond investments, too.\u201d", "title": "Cutting Carbon Emissions While Earning Cash", "authors": ["Tim Gray"]}

And in a measured criticism of Mr. Trump\u2019s move, it said that working for peace requires \u201cmutual respect and trust,\u201d adding that \u201carbitrary deadlines, unilateral pronouncements and shifting goal posts are counterproductive in addressing common threats.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAcross the Pakistani political spectrum, officials accused the United States of making Pakistan a scapegoat for the failures in Afghanistan.\n\nImran Khan, a prominent opposition politician whose positions on foreign and defense policy are often closely aligned with Pakistan\u2019s security establishment, called for steps to disengage diplomatically from the United States.\n\n\u201cWe must immediately remove excessive U.S. diplomatic, nondiplomatic and intelligence personnel from Pakistan so that diplomatic parity is established according to international legal norms governing diplomatic relations between states,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that the ground and air routes for American military supplies should also be shut down.\n\nIn past cases when relations frayed and Pakistan blocked American access to its supply routes, the United States military relied on a more expensive alternative that connects Baltic and Caspian ports through Russia and Central Asian countries. But that route is vulnerable to Washington\u2019s chilly relations with Russia, which has used its influence over Central Asian states to limit access.\n\nAt its peak, when the United States had about 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, the alternative route helped with the transportation of about one third of nonlethal material with Russia\u2019s consent. The American-led coalition also used Manas, a major air base in Kyrgyzstan, as the transit point for almost all of the coalition troops and a refueling center for tens of thousand aircraft.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Russia is concerned about the rise of an Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan, most of whose fighters are from the tribal areas of Pakistan, while China fears that an unstable Afghanistan provides sanctuary to its Uighur insurgency.\n\n\u201cYou have an anti-American sentiment in the region on the one hand, but on the other hand you have the fear of terrorism and extremism in the region,\u201d said Davood Moradian, the director of the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies in Kabul. \u201cIf the U.S. uses active diplomacy, it can convince the regional players to align with efforts to stabilize Afghanistan, because they will not compromise on their own national security for the sake of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nMr. Moradian said factors that make Pakistan a military power, such as hardware and training, are oriented toward the United States, with China less able to easily fulfill them. And he described the Pakistani elite as more integrated in the West \u2014 with houses, business, and bank accounts there \u2014 and thus more likely to feel the pressure of targeted sanctions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Pakistan will be able to absorb sustained U.S. pressures,\u201d Mr. Moradian said. \u201cIn the Pakistan-American dynamics, Pakistan is far more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cPakistan\u2019s success has been in absorbing pain for a short period, and then getting away.

The revelation came on the heels of a distressing series of major hacks: In 2017, Yahoo revealed that all of its three billion accounts were compromised, WannaCry ransomware shut down hospitals across the globe, and an Equifax breach affected approximately 145.5 million consumers in the United States. The latest news about the computer security problems \u2014 whose names, \u201cSpectre\u201d and \u201cMeltdown,\u201d appropriately convey their seriousness \u2014 is just the latest evidence that true digital security remains out of our reach.\n\nBut when these vulnerabilities are exposed and damaging attacks occur, there are few lasting repercussions. Almost without fail, stock prices bounce back, customers return, executives keep their jobs or exit with golden parachutes, and government mostly looks the other way. After the news of Equifax\u2019s massive breach, for example, the company\u2019s stock dropped roughly 35 percent. But it\u2019s already recovered nearly half of its lost market value, and Fortune reported that the former chief executive officer Richard Smith retired with as much as $90 million in compensation. Resilience is one of the hallmarks of stable, mature markets, but something isn\u2019t right here.\n\nThe tepid consequences are part of a growing problem. From a corporate governance and accountability perspective, cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal inspired the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s increased standards for corporate disclosures. With the privacy and personal data of hundreds of millions of people at risk, and especially now with the increasing ubiquity of connected devices in our lives, the security of digital assets is too important for that kind of treatment. We need to bolster a culture of responsibility around cybersecurity, combining stronger and more uniform corporate governance with a clearer government commitment to enact better defensive policies.\n\nA complex hack may not be a C.E.O.\u2019s fault, but it is absolutely his or her responsibility. Investors and consumers need to demand more from the executives to whom they entrust their digital lives. The same holds true for government. Protection of the welfare and livelihood of its citizens is a foundational principle of government, and yet for more than a decade there has been very little consequence for nation-states and state-affiliated groups who\u2019ve pilfered the intellectual property, and violated the personal privacy, of citizens and companies around the world.", "title": "Opinion | Cybersecurity Today Is Treated Like Accounting Before Enron", "authors": []}

Over all, turnout was more than 66 percent.\n\n\u201cFive years ago, 2.7 million voters gave me their trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, it was 2.8 million.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Zeman\u2019s victory will most likely be viewed with concern by the country\u2019s traditional allies like France and Germany, as well as leaders who are looking for greater integration among the European Union\u2019s member nations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey will continue to have to deal with an unpredictable, grumpy populist; with an oligarch prime minister; and the support of the communists\u201d in the Czech Republic, Mr. Koran said.\n\nEliska Haskova Coolidge, a Zeman supporter and influential public figure, said that many fears of those in the West were overblown. She said she thought that Mr. Zeman\u2019s goal was a healthy relationship with Russia, not a subservient one.\n\nMs. Coolidge, whose family fled the country after World War II, spent two decades working in Washington before returning home. She said she was no fan of Mr. Zeman\u2019s vulgarity, but was willing to overlook some of his flaws because she admired the depth of his experience.\n\n\u201cIt is so important to have a leader who understands politics and who has met with world leaders,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the end, Czech voters agreed.\n\nMr. Drahos conceded the race and congratulated Mr. Zeman. \u201cThis is not the end,\u201d Mr. Drahos told supporters gathered in Prague. \u201cWe will carry on.\u201d\n\nHe then led members of the crowd, some in tears, in a solemn rendition of the national anthem.\n\nMr. Zeman\u2019s re-election was also a victory for the country\u2019s billionaire prime minister, Andrej Babis, who was appointed by Mr. Zeman and supported his campaign. The president has vowed to stick with him even though Mr. Babis is facing criminal fraud charges. After his victory, Mr. Zeman again promised to give Mr. Babis all the time he needed to form a government.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

His impolitic remarks \u2014 like jokes about \u201cliquidating\u201d journalists \u2014 have earned him comparisons to President Trump.\n\nMr. Drahos, the former leader of the Czech Academy of Sciences, has never held political office, and his inexperience was evident in the first of two debates. Looking nervous, he sat on the edge of his seat, while Mr. Zeman reclined and looked as if he were in his own living room, drink in hand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the second debate, Mr. Drahos was more confident and more direct in his attacks on the president.\n\n\u201cMr. Zeman is the past,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is now a symbol of division and name-calling.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nFor many of Mr. Zeman\u2019s supporters, however, his indecency is his strength, and they say his blunt speech is needed to counteract cowardly political blather.\n\nMr. Zeman was elected in 2013 in the first direct presidential vote held in the Czech Republic after it broke free from Soviet rule in 1989. Although he has a long history in politics and had served as prime minister, he cast himself as a populist savior working for the common man.\n\n\u201cYou are not alone anymore,\u201d was the Zeman slogan plastered on billboards and echoed in meeting after meeting in small towns and villages. His victory then was seen by many as a rebuke of the right-of-center political establishment that had grown smug and out of touch.\n\nBut as the migrant crisis in Europe blossomed in 2014, and countries confronted the greatest flood of humanity seeking refuge on the continent since the end of the Second World War, Mr. Zeman was one of the first European politicians to seize on the issue.\n\nHe sought to seal off the country and defied efforts by the European Union to force member nations to share the burden equally by taking in migrants through a quota system.\n\nMr. Zeman said Muslims could never be integrated in Czech society and warned of jihadists who could \u201cblow the Prague castle up in the air,\u201d tapping into an anxiety felt deeply throughout the country and the region. The message would soon be championed by a host of populist leaders, including those in neighboring countries.\n\nBut this Czech election campaign was notable for the lack of debate on immigration. The Zeman position was the default position. Still, Mr. Zeman sought to portray Mr. Drahos as a danger to society. \u201cStop migrants and Drahos,\u201d read an ad in newspapers and on billboards. \u201cThis country is ours. Vote for Zeman.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Drahos returned fire by attacking a top Zeman adviser, Martin Nejedly, who is known for his close ties to Russia. \u201cStop Russian Invasion and Nejedly,\u201d the Drahos team wrote in a social media campaign. \u201cThis country is not yours. Vote for Drahos.\u201d\n\nThe question of whether the Czech Republic will continue to look to China and Russia was a critical issue in the last days of the campaign. While Mr. Zeman has often said he is committed to the European Union and NATO, he said during his victory speech that he would continue to support allowing Czechs to decide their own futures, including a referendum on membership in the bloc.\n\n\u201cI have come to the conclusion that many politicians and journalists have inferior intelligence compared to normal people,\u201d Mr. Zeman said. \u201cAnd, therefore, I want those normal citizens to have a chance to decide not only in a referendum, but also in direct elections for local government.\u201d\n\nHe also said he would try to be less \u201carrogant,\u201d but he used his speech to go over old grievances, including against Czech journalists who had repeatedly written him off.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s another reason why I consider Czech journalists to be idiots,\u201d he said.", "title": "Czech Republic Re-elects Milos Zeman, Populist Leader and Foe of Migrants", "authors": ["Marc Santora"]}

He said that previous beneficiaries of DACA, known as Dreamers, must be allowed to renew their status in the program, though the government would not be required to accept new applications from immigrants who had not previously submitted one.\n\nOn Sunday morning, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for preventing progress on a legislative deal that would permanently legalize the young immigrants and give them an eventual path to citizenship in exchange for tougher border security and enforcement measures.\n\nThe president criticized Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have suggested that they will not support efforts to fund the government by a deadline later this week unless Congress passes the DACA legislation.\n\n\u201cDACA is probably dead because the Democrats don\u2019t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nIn a second tweet, Mr. Trump said that immigration legislation should include an end to the diversity visa lottery system, in which the State Department encourages diversity in immigration by holding a lottery for those wanting to come to the United States.\n\nThe president has criticized the program as a threat to the country\u2019s security even though people selected are screened in the same ways that other immigrants are.

The bird\u2019s fluid grace and quirky flickers are captured in modern choreography by Tong Ruirui, who also directed the production, to a score by Guo Sida drawing from classical Chinese music.

But in those improv classes, there was no pressure to be anything except honest, and that made me happy.\u201d Although he knew he had \u201ccaught the bug,\u201d he didn\u2019t have the confidence, he added, to express a desire to act.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you are from the estates, you don\u2019t say that,\u201d he said. \u201cActually, the biggest problem is that you don\u2019t know it\u2019s possible.

{"date": "2018-01-04 00:00:00", "text": "What kinds of books bring you the most reading pleasure these days?\n\nBiographies, letters, journals \u2014 the records of people\u2019s lives, and the traces they themselves leave behind. This may be a middle-aged thing: When you\u2019re (somewhat) closer to the end of life than to the beginning, it\u2019s hard to resist the impulse to start \u201ctaking stock\u201d of yourself and what you\u2019ve done, and so it\u2019s interesting to see how the lives of talented or celebrated or important people looked to those people while they were still living those lives. And of course, what the letters and journals show is that most of our lives are mostly a jumble while we\u2019re living them, because we\u2019re caught up in the day-to-day for the most part; it\u2019s for the biographers to perceive the contours, once it\u2019s all over. I find that reassuring.\n\nWhich genres are you drawn to and which do you avoid?\n\nI was long immune to the allure of fantasy literature. Even when I was a kid, I couldn\u2019t get into \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d and all the rest of it. I\u2019m not sure why, really. It may be that I got hooked on history and biography when I was still very young \u2014 ancient Egypt, Greek and Roman history, Plantagenet history, Elizabeth I, Mary, Queen of Scots \u2014 and I just couldn\u2019t imagine why anyone would need to invent a whole world or civilization when the ones we already have are so fascinating. But I may be evolving: I hugely enjoyed reading, and very much admired, all of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d books, which I tackled a few years ago for a piece I wrote about the TV series.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a genre I\u2019ve always loved is historical fiction. There are a lot of terrible examples out there, but when it works \u2014 when a deep sense of history (not just the props, but the spirit) is married to an authentic novelistic sensibility, as they are in the novels of Renault or Patrick O\u2019Brian or Hilary Mantel, to name a few of the best \u2014 it\u2019s tremendously satisfying. I find it amusing that this genre is still denigrated by some critics as being a lesser form of the novel. I always want to remind them that \u201cWar and Peace\u201d and \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d are historical fiction.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite book to teach to students at Bard?\n\nYou\u2019re fishing! \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d of course, is one \u2014 of the two Homeric epics it\u2019s the one that students tend to enjoy more. But I also love teaching Greek tragedy \u2014 it\u2019s at once so formally strange, so stiffly stylized and yet (of course) so eternally relevant in its themes. One of my favorite teaching experiences was when I participated in Bard\u2019s Prison Initiative last autumn, teaching Sophocles and Euripides to the inmates at a maximum-security facility about an hour from campus. I was blown away by the men\u2019s responses to the texts we read \u2014 by the way in which they brought what they knew about violence and shame and disgrace and guilt to dramas that are, of course, about those very things. As you can imagine, it was very different from what even the smartest 19-year-old undergraduates can bring to the seminar table.\n\nDo you have a favorite book about writing or about literary criticism?\n\nI have a favorite book of literary criticism, which is Edmund Wilson\u2019s \u201cAxel\u2019s Castle.\u201d I think most of us who are professional critics are shadowed by the secret fear that time will prove us wrong \u2014 the virtues of our enthusiasms will prove to be ephemeral, or the things we panned will turn out to be classics. What\u2019s so remarkable to me about Wilson\u2019s book, which he published in 1931 and which is contemporary with some of the authors he wrote about \u2014 Proust, Joyce, Pound, Stein \u2014 is that he got everything just right. And right away, too: Within 10 years of the publication of Proust\u2019s \u201c\u00c0 la recherche du Temps Perdu\u201d he\u2019d completely grasped everything about it that was important and revolutionary.\n\nWhat book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\n\nI\u2019ve got piles of books about home d\u00e9cor and haute couture all around my house. I\u2019m currently slavering over the catalog for the Dior exhibition at the Louvre.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\n\n\u201cA Titanic Hero,\u201d the biography of Thomas Andrews, the shipbuilder who designed the Titanic (and went down with it). I was a Titanic groupie when I was a kid \u2014 I belonged to the Titanic Enthusiasts of America \u2014 and one day when I was around 12 an old family friend who was visiting presented it to me.

Disabled people who cannot access many subway stations and are compelled to drive, he said, would be unfairly burdened by a congestion fee.\n\nThose concerns may be legitimate, but the need for a congestion pricing plan is more pressing, said Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t legislate for the handful of people who may need to drive into Manhattan for a doctor\u2019s appointment, every once in a while, and leave the six million New Yorkers taking the train every day in the lurch.\u2019\u2019\n\nTo arrive at its conclusions, analysts working for the group used data from the most recently available American Community Survey, which details demographic variables as granular as mode of transportation by race and by income from 2011 to 2015. To decipher whether those New Yorkers commuted into the proposed congestion zone, the group sorted data from the previous five-year census, which recorded where people drive to, and then correlated it to Assembly and Senate district maps. (The commuting data from the 2011 to 2015 survey has not been released.)\n\nThe districts with the highest number of commuters who drive into the proposed congestion zone, the report found, are in Manhattan, where people take a mix of personal cars and taxis, both of which would be subject to a congestion charge. For example, the highest percentage came from the 73rd Assembly District on the Upper East Side, where 9.2 percent of those entering the congestion zone rode in private vehicles.\n\nDespite the report\u2019s conclusions, the fate of any congestion pricing plan, which would have to be approved by the Legislature, will likely depend on addressing the concerns of Mr. Weprin and other lawmakers who represent districts outside Manhattan.\n\nAfter the congestion pricing plan was released, Mr. Weprin convened a news conference in Manhattan where he was flanked by many lawmakers from the other boroughs.\n\n\u201cIf there were so few people driving in, I don\u2019t think it would produce anything near the revenue that they\u2019re claiming it\u2019s producing,\u201d Mr. Weprin said, pointing out the high volume of traffic that spills across the M.T.A.-controlled bridges and tunnels each rush hour. \u201cThere are a lot of people moving over them into Manhattan,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are the people coming from?\u201d", "title": "Data Shows City Drivers Won\u2019t Face the Brunt of Congestion Fees", "authors": []}

Prices have jumped in recent months thanks to strong global demand and output curbs orchestrated by Saudi Arabia and Russia; Brent crude has now climbed back to the $70 a barrel range.

But when Mr. Chappelle says some of the sexual assault victims speaking out are now experiencing \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d a particularly cruel turn of phrase, this is surely not the funniest thing he can think of. And it is expressed with as little empathy as possible.\n\nMr. Chappelle \u2014 who has always been far more savvy and engaged on race than on gender (his TV series \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show\u201d flashed a leering teenage sensibility) \u2014 is not aiming merely for transgression. He embraces this new movement, calls himself a feminist and offers sober political analysis, with a passionate argument for focusing on structural issues. \u201cYou got all the bad guys scared, and that\u2019s good,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the minute they\u2019re not scared anymore, it will get worse than it was before. Fear does not make lasting peace.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

It\u2019s expressing a moderate\u2019s caution and hope for reconciliation in the face of a revolutionary social movement. It\u2019s the same impulse that led Mr. Chappelle, hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d just after the presidential election, to urge us to give Donald J. Trump a chance. (He has since apologized.) In his current incarnation, Mr. Chappelle often carries himself less like a mischievous outlaw than a comedy statesman. (At the close of Netflix\u2019s \u201cDef Comedy Jam 25,\u201d Mr. Chappelle, who as a young comic criticized how the show set expectations for black artists, delivered a reverential coda about its historical importance.)\n\nMuch of his 2017 comedy had a professorial tone, weaving long pocket histories into his act. But in this paradigm-shifting moment, when victims are speaking out and revealing secrets long buried, Mr. Chappelle is ignoring the historical context, the systemic barriers preventing women from speaking up about abuse or succeeding in comedy. It\u2019s perhaps why an audience member off screen balks at one joke, to which he responds: \u201cI know you\u2019re right, baby. I was right once. Remember that?\u201d\n\nFor many young viewers, some of whom know him mainly for his much-criticized recent jokes about transgender people, the answer is no. They don\u2019t remember \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d which premiered 15 years ago, or that he quit the series abruptly. At the time, his reasons for leaving were slightly unclear but, because of an interview he gave, were widely seen as involving his discomfort with white viewers\u2019 response to his racial humor rooted in stereotypes. The departure helped cement his reputation as a comic with a social conscience, willing to pass up tens of millions of dollars because of a principle. In 2017, Mr. Chappelle made tens of millions of dollars from his specials, but one wonders how much he cares about why people are laughing at his new jokes.\n\nIn an abrupt pivot, he ends this unusually topical special by asking audience members if they want to know the real reason he left \u201cChappelle\u2019s Show,\u201d a mystery that lost its urgency years ago and suggests a comic nostalgic for old glories. In a funny bit of self-awareness, Mr. Chappelle says he never wanted to be a hero but, rather like Paul Revere, to be known for a single heroic act.\n\n\u201cPaul Revere\u2019s ride was only one night, then 40 years of him being like: Remember that time when everyone was asleep and I was up, and the British was coming?\u201d Mr. Chappelle says, pausing. \u201cBoy, good thing I was awake.\u201d", "title": "Dave Chappelle Stumbles Into the #MeToo Moment", "authors": ["Jason Zinoman"]}

Mr. Toschi, though, was bothered by Callahan\u2019s penchant for administering his own brand of justice. He is said to have walked out of a screening of the movie, which was released when the Zodiac investigation was in full swing.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo, who spent time with Mr. Toschi preparing for his \u201cZodiac\u201d role, said in a 2007 interview with the website Collider. \u201cIt was so simplified.\u201d\n\nMr. Toschi\u2019s daughter said he always thought that a suspect named Arthur Leigh Allen, who died in 1992, was Zodiac. But, unlike Harry Callahan, he and his fellow officers were bound by the evidence.\n\n\u201cIf you get into who these cops were,\u201d Mr. Ruffalo said in another 2007 interview, \u201cyou realize how they have to take their hunches, their personal beliefs, out of it. Dave Toschi said to me, \u2018As soon as that guy walked in the door, I knew it was him.\u2019 He was sure he had him, but he never had a solid piece of evidence. So he had to keep investigating every other lead.\u201d\n\nIn a 1978 interview, Mr. Toschi estimated that he had talked to 5,000 people during the Zodiac investigation. His letter-writing misstep not only took him out of the investigation that year, but also brought a more serious accusation \u2014 that he might have written a letter from around that time that claimed to be from the Zodiac killer. He vigorously denied that speculation.\n\nOther letters claiming to be from Zodiac turn up periodically, most of them hoaxes, and new theories and even confessions surface from time to time. The case has inspired numerous books and episodes of true-crime television shows, including a five-part series on the History channel that concluded in December.\n\nMr. Toschi retired in 1985 after 32 years on the force. He worked in private security afterward. In addition to Ms. Toschi-Chambers, he is survived by his wife, the former Carol Bacigalupi, whom he married in 1957; another daughter, Karen Leight; and two granddaughters.", "title": "David Toschi, 86, Detective Who Pursued the Zodiac Killer, Dies", "authors": []}

They also suggest a rejiggering of some traditional divisions.\n\nPeople who live in rural provinces, long viewed as supporters of the authorities, are now leading most of the demonstrations. And while people in Tehran have also taken to the street, the capital is not the center of the protests, as it was during the so-called Green Movement in 2009. In Tehran, many middle-class Iranians share the discontent but also fear insecurity.\n\nThe frustrations that led to the protests also appear different from the sentiments in 2009.\n\nThat year, a wave of demonstrations broke out after the contested election of a hard-line president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and then turned into a wider protest movement against Iran\u2019s leaders.\n\nThis time, it is the failure of President Rouhani, a moderate, to deliver greater political changes and economic opportunity, despite the lifting of some of the sanctions against Iran as part of the nuclear deal.

Protests occurred sporadically, with people shouting slogans and leaving. The day before, protesters in provincial towns tried to storm police stations, military and installations, and also attacked a seminary, state television reported, showing footage of burned cars and fires.\n\nProtests have taken place in at least half a dozen cities, including Karaj, Qazvin, Qaemshahr, Dorud and Tuyserkan, it said.\n\nAccess to the Telegram messaging app and the Instagram photo and video sharing app continued to be blocked by the authorities, cutting off the main communication tool for protesters. Special software used to circumvent the government filters could still be downloaded easily. And on Monday, as on other days, there were calls for protests online and on foreign-based Persian-language satellite channels.\n\nSome residents said they were determined to continue the demonstrations, and several hundred gathered at central squares.\n\nWhile the number of protesters in Tehran was small on Monday, the discontent was widespread. Many people on the streets complained about high prices, corruption and lack of change.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve our economy, and the people\u2019s voices must be heard,\u201d said a 28-year-old woman, a piano teacher in Tehran, who asked not to be named out of fear of repercussions. \u201cI\u2019ll go out tonight again.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nMany youths in larger cities enthusiastically voted for Mr. Rouhani when he was re-elected in May, raising expectations among many in the reform camp. But since then even many of the president\u2019s supporters say he has failed to fulfill his promises for improving an economy sorely hobbled by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement.\n\nEven the lifting of economic sanctions under Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with large foreign powers including the United States has not unleashed the growth Mr. Rouhani had hoped for, as key sectors of the economy remain under the thumb of obscure powers, including religious foundations and the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. There is mismanagement and widespread corruption in all levels of the state apparatus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeyond that, the United States has continued other sanctions, making it still harder for Mr. Rouhani to make gains.\n\nThe economic frustrations do not appear to have been offset by the greater social freedoms that the president has granted young people. Under Mr. Rouhani, strict Islamic rules have been somewhat relaxed. Concerts have been allowed, and the morals police are largely off the streets. Illegal parties are usually no longer raided, although there have been exceptions.\n\nBut there is a wide gap between Iran\u2019s changing and modernizing society and Iranian leaders who insist on keeping up their anti-Western policies and the state interpretation of Islam.\n\nMr. Rouhani\u2019s decision not to include any women in his cabinet and his failure to put the relaxation of the rules into law have made many bitter.\n\nThe president has complained that power centers dominated by hard-liners have blocked many of his plans and decisions. Now some protesters are venting their frustrations at the political and clerical establishment.\n\nIn Takestan, west of Tehran, several people were arrested after attacking a seminary, the Iranian news media reported. In Karaj, also close to Tehran, a gas station was burned, a witness reported.\n\nEarlier on Monday, ILNA quoted Hedayatollah Khademi, a representative for the town of Izeh, in Iran\u2019s oil-rich but poor Khuzestan region, as saying two people had died there on Sunday night.

The report also showed a fire-brigade vehicle that was said to have been seized by protesters in Dorud, Lorestan Province.\n\nBy Monday evening, riot police officers belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps waited in an alley near Tehran\u2019s city theater for a potential protest to start, as men and women anxiously walked the sidewalks.

I am a sucker for forbidden or unusual romances with strong female characters and equally strong prose. Colleen McCullough\u2019s \u201cThe Thorn Birds,\u201d Reynolds Price\u2019s \u201cBlue Calhoun\u201d and Eimear McBride\u2019s \u201cThe Lesser Bohemians\u201d are right up my alley, as are Samantha Harvey\u2019s \u201cDear Thief,\u201d Rachel Cusk\u2019s \u201cOutline,\u201d \u201cMariette in Ecstasy,\u201d by Ron Hansen, and \u201cThe English Patient,\u201d by Michael Ondaatje. I thought the love scene in the seaside cabin in Jennifer Egan\u2019s \u201cManhattan Beach\u201d was a tour de force in restrained eroticism. Neither Domenico Starnone\u2019s \u201cTies\u201d nor Ali Smith\u2019s \u201cAutumn\u201d gripped me as much as I\u2019d anticipated, and I\u2019ve never been able to get into Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s \u201cLove in the Time of Cholera,\u201d although perhaps I was too young or too na\u00efve when I tried. Can you recommend some good love stories for a woman recently on her own after 20 years of marriage?\n\nN. SMITH\n\nDENTON, TEX.\n\nDear N.,\n\nAs an English professor, you surely know the thrills of classic romance narratives \u2014 triangles, stolen moments and ill-advised liaisons, among other sublime pleasures \u2014 in books like \u201cWomen in Love,\u201d by D.H. Lawrence, \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God,\u201d by Zora Neale Hurston, and \u201cSummer,\u201d by Edith Wharton. These are always ripe for rediscovery and rereading.\n\nShort Stack\n\nAnd then there is the underappreciated art of seduction in short stories. The form\u2019s constraint provides the perfect come-on. Its limits, made for both innuendo and artful elision, align with passionate longing: You fall in love with what isn\u2019t there.\n\nUnsettled passions stir beneath much of the work of the Nobel laureate Alice Munro. In \u201cCarried Away\u201d (from her story collection \u201cOpen Secrets\u201d), a librarian with an affinity for order has her romantic life thrown into disarray by a series of peculiar, haunting encounters. The reverberations of an affair between a young actress and her director in Munro\u2019s \u201cThe Children Stay\u201d (from \u201cThe Love of a Good Woman\u201d) haunt her more than 30 years later.", "title": "Dear Match Book: Forbidden Love", "authors": []}

With both I felt as though I were behind the curtain/camera, or at least the proverbial fly on the wall. Can you recommend any other books, fiction or nonfiction, on that theme? I\u2019m not looking for something technical; I would like the books to be as equally character- and plot-driven as those mentioned above.\n\nBARBARA PROVUS\n\nTUCSON, AZ.\n\nDear Barbara,\n\nThe seductive charms of insider tales \u2014 alluring in books about, say, politics or advertising too \u2014 multiply in stories that feature actual scripted scenes. Facades make fine metaphors, and a constellation of celebrities, real and imagined, gives the stories extra wattage.\n\nThe attraction to glitz isn\u2019t limited to readers. Legions of writers have turned to stage and screen to craft compelling dramas. The writers and books I initially thought to suggest \u2014 Bruce Wagner; Carrie Fisher; Eve Babitz; William Goldman; \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d by Robert Evans; \u201cThe Player,\u201d by Michael Tolkin \u2014 project a wider view of the glimmer, the glare as well as the lowlights of Hollywood and Broadway. I think you\u2019d like them all. But since you requested books about specific productions, I narrowed the focus of my recommendations accordingly.\n\nPage to Screen\n\nYour affection for \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Candy\u201d suggests to me that you might like \u201cMonster,\u201d by John Gregory Dunne, another fascinating, detailed account of the making of a thorny, star-studded film adapted from a book. Throughout his story, Dunne\u2019s straight-shooting tone comically belies the absurdly twisty tale of writing, along with his wife, Joan Didion, the screenplay for the 1996 movie \u201cUp Close and Personal,\u201d which starred Robert Redford and Michelle Pfeiffer and took eight years to make.", "title": "Dear Match Book: Tales From Behind the Camera?", "authors": ["Nicole Lamy", "Match Book"]}

Adrian Nicole LeBlanc spent more than a decade reporting her immersive saga, \u201cRandom Family,\u201d about the bleak and beautiful experiences of a network of kin in the Bronx. In \u201cBehind the Beautiful Forevers,\u201d Katherine Boo focused for nearly three and half years on Annawadi, a \u201csumpy plug of slum\u201d in Mumbai. The result is an artfully constructed account of the privation that persists alongside the surge of prosperity brought to India by globalization.

As evidence, the critics cite polls showing that most voters believe the Dreamers deserve to remain in this country.\n\nOf course, polls also showed Obamacare to be unpopular in 2013. More important, recent polls showed that most voters didn\u2019t believe the government should be shut down over the Dreamers. Most polls also showed support for the Democrats slipping as the debate dragged on. And as I explained in my column yesterday, there is abundant evidence that a prolonged debate over illegal immigration helps Republicans, not Democrats.\n\nIn the end, I think a long shutdown was more likely to hurt the Dreamers than to help them. Congress would not have passed a law to protect them before reopening the government, and the Dreamers\u2019 allies in Congress \u2014 the Democrats \u2014 would be in a weaker position than they are now.\n\nThat said, the critics\u2019 disappointment stems from a profoundly decent instinct. They\u2019re worried about Dreamers being ripped from their lives in this country. I share the worry \u2014 and the anger at Republican leaders who refuse to solve this problem.\n\nBut it\u2019s just not the case that a minority party can force the majority party to do what it wants if only it summons enough righteous anger. It never has been. It\u2019s another version of the Green Lantern Theory of politics \u2014 that if you care enough and try hard enough, you can do anything.\n\nThe best hope for the Dreamers was not a shutdown that was somehow supposed to end differently from every other recent shutdown. The best hope, first, is to see if there is a solution over the next few weeks, away from the chaos and heat of a shuttered federal government.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, there is only one reliable way to change a policy that the majority party won\u2019t change: Turn that party into the minority party.", "title": "Opinion | Deep Breath: The Democrats Did Just Fine", "authors": []}

In New Jersey, the Department of Transportation had used 104,000 tons of South American salt, 254,000 gallons of liquid calcium and 564,000 gallons of brine to clear roads as of Dec. 31.

When used to generate power, crude oil is also subject to air emissions caps set by environmental regulations.\n\n\u201cAs oil inventories are depleted, replenishment of these fuels will be important given the uncertainty around weather and future fuel demands for the remaining two months of the winter period,\u201d Ms. Blomberg wrote in an email.\n\nThe price of gasoline, which is used in generators as well as in vehicles, rose in 41 states over the past week, according to GasBuddy.com.

Paper, $15.95.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis carefully drawn, lyrical debut approaches memoir from another angle. It\u2019s a style choice that has become increasingly popular in the past decade, as, not coincidentally, M.F.A. programs have churned out a growing number of creative nonfiction writers whose work shuns traditional narrative structures and centers itself at the intersection of poetry and prose.\n\nVanasco\u2019s training and gifts as a poet are clear; the language, rhythms and density of her prose make for a hypnotic reading experience as she pieces together the shards of memory that make up a continuous narrative arc of the self.\n\nWhile, again, the through-line of this memoir is the story of the narrator\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder, \u201cThe Glass Eye\u201d is also a haunting exploration of perception, memory and the complexities of grief. In language that is understated and economical, Vanasco brings to life the father she loved with an almost frightening force, and the dizzying collapse of reality she experienced in the wake of his death.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The narrator observes the world of her childhood through this kaleidoscopic lens to enormously powerful effect; the shifts in perspective from that of a child to that of the narrating adult are seamless, lending the reader a sense that he too is as caught between equally viable realities, suspended in what the writer Scott Russell Sanders refers to as \u201cthe perennial present of memory.\u201d\n\nIn the latter third of \u201cThe Glass Eye,\u201d Vanasco draws too much attention to the writerly process of constructing the book. The array of metaphor and image becomes cluttered; the structural precision she has so far sustained slips slightly; and the narrative threads of memory, father and grief get lost, as Vanasco tries to force this strange and lovely lyrical work toward a closure that it doesn\u2019t need.

This story too follows the onset, diagnosis and treatment of the author\u2019s bipolar disorder, but the book\u2019s stated aim \u2014 to be both memoir and journalistic exploration of the history and uses of lithium \u2014 is never realized. The result is a memoir that seems bent on dodging the usual memoir clich\u00e9s, but in doing so, overcorrects, falling prey to the solipsism it tries to avoid. There is very little in the way of scene or reflection, and this absence robs the book of both narrative pull and any emotionally revelatory power.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe research-driven passages feel like Wikipedia entries, summary and brief; additionally, there are a number of points at which the reader would welcome supporting evidence for the author\u2019s sometimes overly broad claims, such as the assertion that lithium is \u201cusually the first medication tried with bipolar patients\u201d and is \u201ceffective for most of them,\u201d both statements difficult to prove. The narrator herself stops taking lithium when it causes kidney damage, prompting a personal quest in which she travels to the world\u2019s natural lithium sources; however, this more concerted investigation of the element and its uses doesn\u2019t begin until more than two-thirds of the way through the book.\n\nWhile authors are rarely responsible for the design, title or marketing copy of their books, \u201cMental\u201d promises to delve into both personal experience and substantive research.

That consensus did not emerge fully until January 2017 when American intelligence agencies released a report saying that the Kremlin\u2019s intentions were twofold: to \u201cundermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process\u201d and to \u201chelp President-elect Trump\u2019s election chances.\u201d\n\nMr. Simpson, in his testimony, called the Times article \u201ca real Halloween special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a concern that the F.B.I. was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people and that we didn\u2019t really understand what was going on,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cSo he stopped dealing with them.\u201d\n\nThe concerns prompted Mr. Steele to share his work with a former British diplomat, who passed the information to Senator John McCain after the election.\n\nMr. McCain is believed to have then met with James B.

The House has already passed its own far more sweeping deregulatory effort. And progressive Democrats who warn that the legislation would return Wall Street to its more reckless past are mobilizing in hopes of derailing the legislation \u2014 even if that means attacking fellow Democrats who support it.\n\n\u201cThis bill increases the risk of another taxpayer bailout, and I will continue to challenge supporters of this bill \u2014 from both parties \u2014 to explain why they stand on the side of big banks instead of working families,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nStill, lobbyists, lawmakers and administration officials say this is the make or break year for overhauling Dodd-Frank.\n\nRob Nichols, president of the American Bankers Association, said the legislation would correct what banks view as regulatory overreach borne of a hasty legislative effort to shore up a cratering financial system after the 2008 crisis. \u201cWhat I do think is significant here is that you have a recognition that\u2019s been building for several years that parts of the policy response were misguided, ill-conceived and missed the mark,\u201d Mr. Nichols said.\n\nBanking giants such as J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs \u2014 which would see little in the way of change under the Senate bill \u2014 have said little about the looming legislation. But Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.P. Morgan, has been a vocal proponent of revising the Dodd-Frank law, saying in a letter to shareholders in April 2017 that \u201cpoorly conceived and uncoordinated regulations have damaged our economy, inhibiting growth and jobs.\u201d\n\nSome industry lobbyists have pointed out that rules ushered in after the financial crisis have in some ways been beneficial for the big banks, acting as a barrier to entry for any bank without the resources to handle the additional compliance costs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe bill that is working its way through the Senate was brokered primarily by Senator Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican who chairs the banking committee, and moderate Democrats such as Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Senator Jon Tester of Montana, Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Senator Mark Warner of Virginia. Eleven Senate Democrats are co-sponsoring the bill, making its passage in the Senate likely.\n\nBackers argue that the bill would offer much-needed relief to small banks and credit unions in parts of America that have been struggling under regulations that had primarily been aimed at the biggest banks.\n\n\u201cA lot of what was Too Big To Fail under Dodd-Frank became \u2018too small to succeed\u2019 because of the onerous regulatory burdens,\u201d Ms. Heitkamp said.\n\nUnder the bill, firms with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempt from the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making risky bets with federally-guaranteed deposits. Mortgage rules for small lenders would also be eased.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome critics of the bill say it goes too far. They argue that many of the institutions that received bailout money during the downturn would get less oversight.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to increase stress on the financial system,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit organization calls for tougher regulation of Wall Street. \u201cIt\u2019s going to increase the risk to individual banks and when significant numbers of individual banks go bust, that increases the stress on the system.\u201d\n\nStill, in a sign of the fight to come, other critics \u2014 including some House members \u2014 say the Senate legislation does not go far enough. House Republicans passed a far more aggressive bill last summer, which would be far more crippling to Dodd-Frank. That bill would, among other things, remove the prohibition against using federally insured funds for risky lending and gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Cohn, director of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, telling Bloomberg News earlier this month that the Senate bill would \u201cchange the regulatory environment for the vast, vast majority of banks in the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we\u2019ll have something on that.\u201d\n\nEfforts to loosen Wall Street regulations are already underway, even without legislation. The Office of Financial Research, which is supposed to spot red flags on Wall Street, lost its director last month and the Treasury Department is seeking to reduce its funding and staff. The Treasury Department has also issued a series of reports recommending changes to a number of other post-crisis rules, including rescinding a requirement that companies disclose the pay ratio between chief executives and workers.\n\nMr. Trump has been hiring regulators who have expressed reservations about \u2014 or been critical of \u2014 some of the post-crisis rules. In November, Mr. Trump tapped Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Mulvaney once characterized the bureau as a \u201csick, sad\u201d joke.\n\nMr. Mulvaney has been hiring like-minded staff members to ensure that the consumer bureau\u2019s new leadership will not be prone to what he considers regulatory overreach. Mr. Mulvaney has also frozen the bureau\u2019s data collection system, a move that has slowed its ability to conduct examinations.\n\nMr. Trump is expected to soon announce a nominee to lead the consumer bureau. J. Mark McWatters, the head of the National Credit Union Administration, is widely considered to be the top choice, but the administration is still considering other finalists. Some bank lobbyists have raised concerns about whether Mr. McWatters, who has asked the consumer bureau to exempt credit unions from examination and enforcement, would give them preferential treatment.\n\n. The appointment last year of Randal K. Quarles as the Federal Reserve\u2019s vice chairman for supervision is also expected to benefit those seeking looser oversight: Mr. Quarles has suggested that some of the strictures imposed on the financial industry since 2008 should be relaxed.\n\n\u201cI think the bigger changes to Dodd-Frank in 2018 will come from changes at the regulators from the new regulatory team and not from new legislation, even if it is enacted,\u201d said Aaron Klein, policy director of the Center on Regulation and Markets at The Brookings Institution.\n\nDespite the bipartisan support for legislative action, it will not happen without a fight, especially when Wall Street is generating record profits and after companies just received large tax cuts. Moderate Democrats who sign on to a bill to help community banks can expect to hear from the party\u2019s progressive wing that they have defanged Dodd-Frank.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dissension among Democrats was evident as the banking committee considered the bill last year. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Ms. Warren were especially vocal in their opposition to a bill that they viewed as a dangerous giveaway.\n\n\u201cThis major move to deregulate the big banks is a major move to undermining Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cEspecially in these Red States where economic populism is the key to Democrats winning re-election in 2018, the folks in the most competitive elections should realize that doing the bidding of the banks is not especially helpful to them.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren is expected to mobilize her network of progressive activists to oppose the changes to Dodd-Frank. She is even prepared to make her Democratic colleagues cast difficult votes during the amendment process to drive home the point that banks that received bailout money should not be deregulated.\n\nFor Democrats who are crossing Ms. Warren on the issue, the hope is that the fallout will be minimal.\n\n\u201cWere going to agree to disagree,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who sits on the banking committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to split open the kind of unity you\u2019ve seen in the Democratic Party.\u201d", "title": "Democrats Add Momentum to G.O.P.

Their balancing act reflects the broader tension in the party as it tries to reconcile the fervor of blue-state opponents of Mr. Trump and the caution of Democrats in states where they must appeal to Trump supporters.\n\nDemocrats need to protect 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election in states carried by the president and appeal to the swing voters who could flip control of the House. Those vulnerable Senate Democrats were key to sparking the bipartisan drive to bring the shutdown to an end. Yet many of the Senate Democrats considered potential 2020 presidential candidates voted to keep the shutdown going.\n\nHeading into the showdown, Mr. Schumer and other top Democrats figured that Mr. Trump was at a vulnerable moment, given the uproar surrounding racially charged comments made in a recent meeting with senators to discuss immigration, disturbing words that came on top of persistent accounts of Oval Office chaos.\n\nAnd they saw the so-called Dreamers \u2014 the young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children \u2014 as a particularly appealing group, as they faced deportation to countries they barely knew through no wrongdoing of their own.

And while the Dreamers may be a highly sympathetic group, using them as a rationale for shuttering the federal government was not playing well.\n\nThe president, top Republicans and their allies had some success in framing the showdown as a case of Democrats putting the interests of \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d ahead of American citizens, a line of attack Democrats felt they could not weather.\n\nMr. McConnell, who sat at his Senate desk with a satisfied smile before the vote to reopen the government on Monday, archly drove that point home in brief remarks.\n\n\u201cI think if we have learned anything during this process,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn\u2019t understand and would not have understood in the future.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They managed to highlight the plight of the Dreamers while avoiding a prolonged shutdown that could have ultimately damaged their cause. And by conceding defeat on Monday, Democrats avoided widespread disruptions in government operations that would have cascaded during the week and beyond.\n\nThey also won the pledge from Mr. McConnell to allow broad bipartisan negotiations on immigration, overall spending, health programs and other unresolved issues. If those fail to produce an agreement by Feb. 8, he promised to open an immigration debate on the Senate floor. Senators on both sides of the aisle saw that as a breakthrough that could provide a chance for the polarized chamber to engage in what has become a rare occurrence: actual legislating.\n\nWhat they do not have is any certainty that Mr. Trump will back whatever legislation the Senate produces or that the House will even consider it.\n\nThe agreement to end the shutdown came after weekend negotiations among a bipartisan group of about two dozen lawmakers assembled by Mr. Manchin and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Members of the group all saw the shutdown as unacceptable and contributing to public disgust with Washington, motivating them to pursue a solution outside the chamber\u2019s leadership.\n\nHere Are the Senators Who Brokered a Bipartisan Solution to the Government Shutdown\n\nThey say they are intent on finding a way to protect the immigrants covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program as well as fashioning a \u201cglobal\u201d agreement on spending, disaster aid and a variety of other issues that have defied resolution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublican participation in the bipartisan group was crucial for Democrats seeking assurances from Mr. McConnell on the way forward. While they were nervous about accepting the word of Mr. McConnell given their history of clashes with him, they doubted that he would undercut such a substantial number of his fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cI expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate, to me and to the bipartisan group and abide by this agreement,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIf he does not, of course \u2014 and I expect he will \u2014 he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic senators, but members of his own party as well.\u201d\n\nStill, immigration activists found fault with putting any faith in Mr. McConnell. And they noted that even if the Senate can draft a measure that attracts a broad majority, it faces a steep test in the House, which ignored a 2013 Senate immigration measure that passed with 68 votes.\n\nNegotiations will now begin with Democrats in a new posture. During a Friday meeting with Mr. Trump aimed at settling the dispute, Mr. Schumer said Democrats would agree to provide significant funding for the wall along the Mexican border that Mr. Trump has made a central and symbolic element of his agenda. They had previously opposed any funding for the wall.\n\nWhile Democrats gave that ground, they are not without weapons. Should the negotiations collapse, they will be able to pound Republicans for abandoning the Dreamers. They could also vote again to shutter the government, though that seems unlikely after this episode.\n\nAs lawmakers looked ahead to a few difficult weeks, Republicans chose not to crow over the outcome.\n\n\u201cI think we should be magnanimous,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, in what might be the most telling observation about which side prevailed.", "title": "Democrats Blink in Shutdown Impasse, Hoping for a Bargain", "authors": ["Carl Hulse"]}

Racially tinged conflict has been the defining feature of the Trump era. Most of the outrage has been caused by the president picking at the nation\u2019s wounds. But by now both parties have racial identity wings, which believe that political life is inevitably a power competition between identity groups. Both parties build their coalitions by magnifying racial identity and exploiting racial difference.\n\nBut there are some of us who are uncomfortable with the whole identity-politics drill. We believe that while racism is the central stain on American history, racial conflict is not inevitable. By reducing inequalities, by integrating daily life, we can eventually make our common humanity more salient and our racial difference less so. We believe that America has already made strides in this direction and that it\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to make racial diversity a creative spark and not a source of permanent hostility.\n\nOne of these days some party should pay attention to us folks.", "title": "Opinion | Democrats Go for the Jugular!

And more than a quarter of Dreamers live in deep blue California, which declared itself a \u201csanctuary state.\u201d Politically, Democrats can pin the failure of a legislative fix on Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities, and could possibly do even better in the midterms by keeping the issue on the table.\n\nThis kind of hopeful thinking is seductive but dangerous. When the legal protection of 800,000 people is at stake, Democrats need to expect the worst, even while hoping for the best. That means assuming that if DACA expires without a fix, the administration will be aggressive about deportations, the Senate will remain Republican, judicial stopgaps will fail, a Republican will win the White House in 2020, hundreds of thousands will be pushed into the shadows and many tens of thousands will be rounded up, detained and ejected from the country.\n\nThis dark timeline might be unlikely, but unlikely things happen. (Donald Trump, I\u2019ll remind you, is president of the United States.)\n\nSo a deal that includes money for the wall ought to be a no-brainer for Democrats. Every viable proposal under discussion includes a hefty \u201cborder security\u201d element, but not any of them include a literal solid wall spanning the entire southern border. Last week, Kellyanne Conway, a White House counselor, said that Mr. Trump understands that \u201cpart of it will be the physical wall, part of it is better technology, part of it is also fencing.\u201d\n\nThe wall Mr. Trump promised isn\u2019t going to materialize, and he\u2019s not going to insist on it. Of course, Mr. Trump will say that new border security enhancements constitute a wall.

I have often performed this exercise, with a modicum of writerly envy, over the decades of reading his work: What exactly is the alchemical magic in these pages? Everyone who started writing seriously in the 1980s or 1990s can tell you where he or she first consumed the morsels that eventually made up \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d Johnson\u2019s breakthrough 1992 story collection. To behold those lines for the first time was to see language unaccountably capturing emotions in a way unfamiliar in recent American prose. Johnson once noted that he was working under the star of Isaac Babel while writing \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d and it showed; just as Babel saw (for example) the Russian sunset as others had not previously, Johnson transformed his misfits and heroin addicts until they became like protagonists from the time of epics.\n\n\u201cAngels,\u201d Johnson\u2019s 1983 debut novel, was similarly revelatory \u2014 making the homely backdrop of a Greyhound bus journey suddenly appropriate to the highest American literature. If Johnson sometimes stumbled in later books (he was prolific), they were exceptions in a long, restless and varied career that included not only fiction but plays, nonfiction and some impressive poetry collections. (I recommend \u201cThe Incognito Lounge.\u201d)\n\nWhat made the effective books so effective? In part, it is the consciousness of mortality found everywhere in his best work. This is the guy, after all, who wrote \u201cResuscitation of a Hanged Man\u201d and \u201cAlready Dead.\u201d It is the rare Denis Johnson work that doesn\u2019t explicitly take up end-of-life questions. From the death-row sequences of \u201cAngels\u201d to the murder and car crashes and heroin addiction of \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d to the Vietnam War setting of \u201cTree of Smoke,\u201d his 2007 National Book Award-winning novel, there is ever a wafting of mortal fumes across Johnson\u2019s paragraphs.\n\n\u201cThe Largesse of the Sea Maiden,\u201d Johnson\u2019s new and presumably final collection \u2014 he died from liver cancer in May \u2014 is no outlier. Without exception the five stories that make up this volume, averaging about 40 pages each, feature intimations of mortality. There\u2019s the former wife of the adman narrator, in the title story, who telephones to tell our man she\u2019s dying, but without specifying which former wife she is. (\u201cIn the middle of this,\u201d he notes, \u201cI began wondering, most uncomfortably, in fact with a dizzy, sweating anxiety, if I\u2019d made a mistake.\u201d) There are the murderous, delusional inmates of a county lockup in \u201cStrangler Bob,\u201d and the fanciful and grim formulations about Elvis and his lost twin that haunt \u201cDoppelg\u00e4nger, Poltergeist,\u201d the last story in the volume.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThroughout is Johnson\u2019s familiar anguish at our passing over. What makes \u201cThe Largesse of the Sea Maiden\u201d different is that in this case Johnson knew his own time was short, and embarked on his material with an admirable and pitiless openness he conveys through his characters: \u201cIt\u2019s plain to you that at the time I wrote this, I\u2019m not dead,\u201d one says. \u201cBut maybe by the time you read it.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe movement across the whole of the collection echoes Dante: down, concentrically, into the revelations of illness and death, to \u201cthe phase in which these visits to emergency rooms and clinics increased in frequency and by now have become commonplace.\u201d", "title": "Denis Johnson\u2019s Death-Infused Last Stories", "authors": ["Rick Moody", "Denis Johnson"]}

Wolfe Jr., who would found the radio station WFKX in Jackson. They married in 1977; he survives her, along with their children, Ray Kight, Dawn Beard and Bridgette Wolfe.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1982, Ms. LaSalle eased her music slightly toward blues and signed to the Mississippi-based Malaco label, where she recorded for most of the next three decades and wrote songs for other performers, including Z.

While sales are healthy, consumers are actually buying fewer new vehicles. Purchases by individual customers at dealerships \u2014 known as retail sales and considered the most accurate reflection of demand \u2014 declined slightly in both 2016 and 2017. Some automakers are offsetting lower consumer purchasing by selling more cars to fleets like rental-car companies.\n\nMore worrisome is that the drops in retail sales have come even as manufacturers have resorted to heftier discounts, which eat into their profits. Sales incentives are now equal to more than 11 percent of the average vehicle\u2019s sticker price. As recently as 2014, that figure was below 8 percent.\n\nThere are other troubling signs, too. Interest rates have started rising, which increases the cost of financing or leasing a new car. Younger buyers are showing less interest in owning cars than older generations.

But the costs of chronic illnesses are predictably high.\n\nGermany offers people with chronic disease better-than-standard coverage. Every German is required to have insurance \u2014 and guaranteed access to it \u2014 typically through more than 100 public nonprofit insurers. People can pick which \u201csickness fund\u201d to join, and the system is financed through a \u201ccontribution\u201d equal to roughly 15 percent of their income \u2014 nearly half coming from their employer and the rest from their paycheck. The total payment is capped at about 650 euros per month for adults, which includes coverage for dependent relatives.\n\nWhile co-payments exist \u2014 for prescriptions and hospital stays, for example \u2014 they are capped at 2 percent of gross earnings, and people with chronic disease pay half of that, according to Dr. Z\u00f6llner, with their out-of-pocket spending on health cost capped at 1 percent of income.\n\nSince expensive prescription drugs are a big component of many treatments, Germany\u2019s state health insurers have been negotiating prices with drugmakers since 2011, and drug prices there are generally lower than in the United States. The patient contribution for any prescription is five to 10 euros.\n\nKaitlyn West, an American with Type 1 diabetes who recently moved to Germany for graduate school, said that in the United States she had been paying on average $400 per month in out-of-pocket expenses \u2014 close to $5,000 each year. The amount fluctuated wildly depending on how her insurance policy at the moment covered her pumps and medicines.\n\nOn German public insurance, the monthly contribution is about $105 and her yearly out-of-pocket spending is capped at about $140 for supplies and $45 for insulin. \u201cThere are no fees for doctors\u2019 visits, no fees for my blood draws and no hassle getting things done,\u201d she said. \u201cThis system allows me to live a normal, stress-free life.\u201d\n\nThe German health system is based on the principle of solidarity, not individuality, Dr. Z\u00f6llner said.

Hedy LAMARR was a famous Hollywood actress who was originally from Austria and made the majority of her film appearances in the 1930s to 1950s. She was considered to be one of the most beautiful actresses of her time and \u2014 hey, don\u2019t wander off, she was awesome! When she wasn\u2019t pouting for the camera, Ms. LAMARR was an inventor, and she and a friend created a secret communications system that changed radio frequencies to keep the Nazis from intercepting the Allies\u2019 codes during World War II. The system she invented was later used to help develop technology to maintain the security of your cellphones.

But it did undergo one major transformation. The obvious first thought was to have small, medium and large in phrases going down, with the downsizing revealer as the final, fourth entry. But then MUMBO JUMBO came to mind and was too perfect to disregard. That left the revealer for the spot where you find it now. The grid constraint was that I wanted the size words to go sequentially down the grid as well as just being down entries. Which meant finding answers and placing them such that each key word was lower than the previous one. My preview copy of the puzzle (courtesy of XWordInfo.com) had the words shaded, which would be Will\u2019s addition. The turnaround on this puzzle was astoundingly fast. I sent it in at the tail end of October and got an acceptance email on January 10. And here it is still January. Maybe a record. In looking this over, I can see I made some compromises. LASSI, ESSES, and ET ALII , as well as good old IDI, would not be my pick of fill. But that was the best I could do without changing the basic grid design. Will did make one teeny grid change. At 7-Across, I had BMI rather than TGI. Most clues were unchanged.

That has been the lodestar of monetary policy in the United States for the past 40 years. But a growing chorus of voices inside and outside the Fed think it\u2019s time for a change. Interest rates are expected to remain low for the foreseeable future, and the combination of low rates and low inflation leaves little room for the Fed to respond to future economic downturns. Experts have advanced a variety of alternatives, which can be sorted into two broad categories: Replace the 2 percent target permanently, or agree to replace it temporarily when the economy next needs the Fed\u2019s help. On Monday, the Brookings Institution will hold a discussion on the alternatives that will include the former chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke, and the presidents of the Boston Fed and the San Francisco Fed, among other experts.

When their hosts confuse Nelson for his brother, who immigrated to California, Manuel and Nelson decide to play along. For Nelson, this is a chance to do some acting \u2014 he recently graduated from the conservatory \u2014 but for everyone else at the table, believing their guest to be visiting from America, it is only a reminder that they have been left behind. The story lays bare how much immigration is a game of pretense. The immigrant pretends to be happy and prosperous in his adoptive country, the locals pretend they\u2019re proud of him and pleased with his success. As he leaves the restaurant, Nelson realizes why his hosts were so irascible, so resentful. \u201cWe\u2019d reminded them of their provincialism.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nAlarc\u00f3n has explored displacement in various forms throughout his career. His first book, \u201cWar by Candlelight,\u201d was published in 2005, and it, too, is a collection of short stories. Of those carefully constructed and well-polished pieces, several of which appeared in prestigious magazines, the one that has stayed the longest with me is the gem \u201cThird Avenue Suicide,\u201d about a young man who has to erase himself from the apartment he shares with his girlfriend whenever her conservative mother visits. Two novels followed, \u201cLost City Radio\u201d and \u201cAt Night We Walk in Circles.\u201d Both are set in unnamed countries in Latin America, and both feature characters struggling to reconnect with loved ones from whom they were separated by political turmoil. A few years ago, Alarc\u00f3n began producing the podcast \u201cRadio Ambulante,\u201d to tell stories of and by Spanish-speaking people from around the world. And he\u2019s written essays and reportage for Harper\u2019s Magazine, Granta and The New York Times Magazine. This is, in short, a writer with range, one who is willing to take risks with form and is deeply curious about the world.\n\nSeveral of the stories in \u201cThe King Is Always Above the People\u201d are stylistically daring. \u201cThe Thousands,\u201d which describes how a community comes together to build itself a town from scraps salvaged from the city, is told from the first-person-plural point of view. \u201cThe Ballad of Rocky Rontal,\u201d about an abused boy who becomes a gang member, is narrated entirely in the subjunctive mood. (I was surprised to discover that Alarc\u00f3n previously approached this subject in another form \u2014 in the indicative mood and as nonfiction \u2014 as a profile of an actual gang member for The California Sunday Magazine.) \u201cAbraham Lincoln Has Been Shot\u201d features Honest Abe as a romantic interest, \u201ca good man, a competent lover, a dignified leader with a tender heart.\u201d These stories are intriguing, but I found myself gravitating more to the longer, fuller stories that come later in the book.\n\nAt the titular intersection of \u201cRep\u00fablica and Grau,\u201d the streetlights are timed, allowing for three minutes of begging for coins among idling cars, followed by another three minutes of waiting. The beggars are a blind man and a 10-year-old boy, the boy hired from his father for this specific purpose. In this story, too, there is pretense. As soon as the pair of beggars arrive at the intersection, \u201cthe blind man\u2019s smile disappeared, and his jaw went slack,\u201d leaving the child in the role of caretaker. The boy\u2019s father is unhappy with his cut and makes him keep track of the coins. Meanwhile, the blind man is scheming to get more money out of their act. The truth, when it arrives, destroys the pretense with a shocking display of violence.\n\nAlarc\u00f3n is at his finest when he couples narrative experimentation with deliberate pacing and imaginative empathy. In \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d a young man faces two daunting tasks: settle the estate of his uncle and break the news of the death to his father, who is currently held in a mental hospital. Reading this story is like walking down a hallway filled with mirrors \u2014 the young man and his father are both lawyers, the uncle and his wife are both interpreters, their house has just one pair of each utensil \u2014 so that I half-expected a turn to magical realism. (In a playful nod to that expectation, the character who sets off the main action is called Gregorio Rabassa, surely a play on the name of Gregory Rabassa, the late, great translator of Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Julio Cort\u00e1zar.) But there are no old men with enormous wings here, or women who have been transformed into talking spiders. The main character will instead have to journey to another part of town, a neighborhood so remote from his, and so heavy with police presence, that it has earned the nickname \u201cGaza.\u201d\n\nA recurring theme in \u201cThe King Is Always Above the People\u201d is the need to explore how leaving home, and returning to it, changes you irremediably. Alarc\u00f3n manages to offer a fresh look at migration, the oldest story of all. \u201cThe place you are born,\u201d he writes, \u201cis simply the first place you flee.\u201d", "title": "Displaced Persons", "authors": []}

Even her relatives in the village stayed aloof because they feared being associated with the wife and son of a Communist fighter.\n\n\u201cMy mother and I felt hurt but we blamed nobody because of the overlapping control from two adversaries,\u201d said Mr. Phac, now 63. \u201cIn that time of suspicion, the husband could not believe his wife and vice versa; parents distrusted their children, and siblings suspected each other.\u201d\n\nTo further alienate Communist warriors from their families, the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem encouraged officials to form sexual relationships with the wives of rebels. While this may have been the impetus for Mr. Binh\u2019s ill-fated affair with Ms. Lien, her oldest son, Mr. Phac, said they loved each other.\n\n\u201cHis house was close to ours, only 10 to 15 meters,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was afraid that she might begin an affair so I would lie down on her belly and refuse to move. But I failed to prevent her from loving him.\u201d\n\nBecause of Ms. Lien\u2019s connection to the former village chief, the local Vietcong felt safe using her house as a dead-letter drop and a way station for their troops and officials.\n\nThe son she had with Mr. Binh, Le Dang Dung, now 56, would soon help cover for them. \u201cWhen I was a little boy,\u201d said Mr. Dung, \u201cevery morning, I had to wake up early around 4 a.m. to sweep the courtyard to erase the footprints of cadres who hid in my mother\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut his mother did not escape suspicion of the authorities. \u201cThey arrested, tortured, and sent her to jail many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI lived with her in the prisons and I suffered seeing my mother brutalized by the soapy waterboarding.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Subscribe to the Vietnam \u201967 Newsletter This weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts, rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam War.

Mr. Dung did not know until years later that the fighters whom he protected with his sweeping would force his mother to choose between her life or his father\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt was a battle test,\u201d Mr. Phac said bitterly.\n\nMr. Phac and Mr. Dung and their mother were lucky compared with the family of Nguyen Huu Thoang, now 64, who lived in a nearby commune.\n\nMr. Thoang\u2019s mother also had a Vietminh husband who went north in 1954, when Mr. Thoang was 1 year old. In 1957 his mother became a concubine of the chief of the commune and gave birth to sons in 1960 and 1962. On a night in 1963, she and the chief were arrested and murdered by the local Vietcong.\n\nAt age 10, Mr. Thoang had to take care of his two half brothers in a government strategic hamlet, going alone to the jungle to work as a charcoal burner.\n\n\u201cOur life was so miserable,\u201d Mr. Thoang said in an interview in his house at Cam Chinh, in central Vietnam. \u201cWe starved all day. The authorities allowed us to bring only a small beer can of rice out of the hamlet because they were afraid that we would provide rice to Vietcong in the jungle. I had to eat wild bananas to survive.\u201d\n\nEvery three to six months local administrators and security officers interrogated and tortured the families of Vietcong soldiers to ferret out Communists and sympathizers, Mr. Thoang said. But almost all families in disputed lands were divided in loyalty. Many parents faced the heartbreak of having their children face off and die on different side of battlefields.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather\u2019s four children, including three sons and a daughter, were Vietcong fighters,\u201d said Vo Quyet, who lived as a child in Trieu Phong, a strip of coast north of Hue and the site of bloody battles in the summer of 1972. \u201cMeanwhile, my grandfather\u2019s brother\u2019s four sons were ARVN soldiers\u201d \u2014 South Vietnamese troops. \u201cAll of them were killed in action but my aunt.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOur people were forced to choose a side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did not have rights; we did not have choices; we could not decide our destinies.\u201d\n\nDao Cong Kiet, 75, who lived in Trung Hai, a commune near the Demilitarized Zone, said his family, too, had to walk a fine line. \u201cWe needed to treat both sides well,\u201d he said. When American and South Vietnamese troops came, \u201cI invited them to eat bananas or drink tea.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe also provided rice for the Vietcong when they demanded.\u201d\n\nLater, he was drafted into the South Vietnamese Army but escaped and fought with the Vietcong. \u201cMy leaders ordered me to murder the puppet officials, but I did not kill them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were my neighbors who lived in the same village, so how could I kill them?\u201d\n\nHowever, even now, over 40 years since the war ended, its divisions persist.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1977, Mrs. Lien held positions in the Communist Party leadership. Then she was kicked out of the party because of her \u201cillegitimate pregnancy\u201d with a \u201ccounterrevolutionary lackey.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mother devoted all her life for them but after gaining the victory they trampled on her,\u201d Mr. Dung said.\n\nHis family, like so many others, remains, as his brother said, \u201ctangled people who were tortured by the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were many wars intertwined in our blood,\u201d Mr. Phac said. \u201cWe were Communists but we were not Communists. We were puppets but we were not puppets.\u201d\n\nA painting of his father stands on the family altar. It has the face of his uncle because he did not know his father\u2019s. Nor does know the date of his death, so he and his mother chose the 15th day of the seventh lunar month as the anniversary.

This is why I\u2019m here.\n\nIt\u2019s the moment where I\u2019m following Ron dancing; he\u2019s creating something, and we\u2019re letting that zone happen. This part reminds me of when I first got into the company, looking at his feet and trying to capture it all.\n\nHow did Arcell end up in Evidence?\n\nBROWN He would come take class, and one day he said, \u201cRon, I would like to be an apprentice.\u201d I don\u2019t really believe in apprentices \u2014 but he convinced me. I had him understudying a role.\n\nCABUAG There was one day in a rehearsal \u2014 they were working on [the 1998 dance] \u201cUpside Down\u201d \u2014 and Ron said: \u201cEverybody come over here, and Arcell lay down.

Maybe for the other scholarship students this was their opportunity to be seen and get a job. He was just going for it.\n\nPhoto\n\nHave you had many tap dancers in your company?\n\nBROWN No. His relationship to rhythm helps. I don\u2019t really count so much, but if I sing the rhythm of it, he can follow. He hears the rhythm.\n\nCABUAG Even when we\u2019re teaching or working with the Ailey company [where Mr. Brown has choreographed several pieces], I tell dancers: \u201cWatch Ron\u2019s feet first. Get the rhythm in the feet.\u201d Once the feet happen, you can really see what\u2019s going on with the torso. Everything is moving independently. You compartmentalize what\u2019s going on, and then it\u2019s really just the feeling of what he\u2019s doing.

It\u2019s almost having a dream come true that you didn\u2019t know you had. [Laughs]\n\nHow has your relationship to dancing changed as you\u2019ve gotten older?\n\nCABUAG I\u2019m learning how to feel it more. Now I feel a deeper sense of really listening to what Ron is saying. He will tell us stories, but not say, \u201cThis connects to this movement right here.\u201d It\u2019s more about, how do we take that story and really listen to it so that it comes through our bodies?

Cue the name change. The reinvention also fit it in with the corporate decision under a new chief executive to focus on six of Viacom\u2019s bigger brands (BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr., and now Paramount), at the expense of its smaller ones (TV Land, CMT, VH1 and Logo).\n\nParamount Network, which bills itself as \u201ctelevision\u2019s destination for premium entertainment and storytelling,\u201d will showcase original programming (about a third of the schedule), supplemented by TV series and feature films culled from the Viacom and Paramount vaults (\u201cPitch Perfect,\u201d \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d). There will also be many fewer showings of \u201cCops.\u201d\n\nThe network was set to begin its new life with a live episode of \u201cLip Sync Battle\u201d on Thursday, Jan. 18, followed on Wednesday, Jan. 24, with its first big offering, \u201cWaco,\u201d a mini-series about the botched siege of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993. The show epitomizes the network\u2019s chase for the cinematic, with grand vistas; a fully reconstructed Texas compound; and name actors, including Taylor Kitsch (\u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d) as David Koresh, and Mr. Shannon as the F.B.I. hostage negotiator tasked with bringing him in.\n\nInhabiting the role of that embattled cult leader, accused pedophile and wannabe rocker took its toll, Mr. Kitsch admitted. \u201cIt took two months to come out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, and counseling.\u201d\n\nLater this year comes \u201cYellowstone,\u201d created and directed by Taylor Sheridan (\u201cHell or High Water\u201d) and starring Mr. Costner, who did not come cheap. The network is paying him half a million dollars an episode. \u201cTo get Kevin to agree to do multiple seasons of a TV series,\u201d Mr. Kay said, \u201cyou have to pay him what he\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new name of the network probably helped lure Mr. Costner, too. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he shows up for Spike,\u201d Mr. Kay said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n(Both \u201cWaco\u201d and \u201cYellowstone\u201d were high-profile entries from the Weinstein Company.

In the new series, Ms. Doherty\u2019s character, Heather Duke, is a gay male, while Heather NcNamara is now African-American.

She became board certified in obesity medicine, and when she later got pregnant, she said, she worried that her child might struggle with weight as she had done.\n\n\u201cI was really focused on my weight gain and essentially weighed myself every day of my pregnancy,\u201d she said. She exercised until two days before she delivered the baby. She was determined not to have a cesarean section so the baby would have a healthier microbiome from picking up the right bacteria during the passage through the birth canal. She was resolved to breast-feed.\n\nAnd now she had a child who was \u201cinstantly a very dramatically hungry baby, so much so that I was unable to nurse him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried for five weeks and I had five different lactation consultants. He wouldn\u2019t be patient enough to wait for milk to let down.\u201d Determined to give him the benefits of breast milk, she ended up using a breast pump throughout his first year of life.\n\nRemembering a lecture Dr. Lumeng had given about voraciously hungry babies, she emailed her. \u201cI essentially asked if she would be willing to give me any advice, any studies, what to do if your baby seems to be starving to death.\u201d\n\nIn \u201ca very thoughtful and kind response,\u201d Dr. Kerns recalled, Dr. Lumeng wrote that there was no research to guide her. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t really give me advice other than her own experience with her own children: Just feed him, trust your instincts.\u201d\n\nDr. Lumeng suggested that doctors should acknowledge to parents that \u201cmodern science really doesn\u2019t fully understand what causes obesity.\u201d We are expecting parents to do something for their children that we adults have great difficulty doing for ourselves, she said; of those who do successfully lose weight, many gain it back within a year. \u201cAdults can\u2019t keep it off either, why are we expecting parents to do this?\u201d\n\nWhen both parents and children are overweight, that\u2019s probably at least in part evidence of a common genetic predisposition, she said. And that biological risk may be expressed in part through differences in children\u2019s metabolism, but also through differences in their appetites, in their responses to food, and even in their propensity to exercise.

We think of medical innovation as being driven by doctors, scientists and entrepreneurs, but patients play an important role, too. They must be willing to try new treatments and technologies for them to spread, but are unlikely to do so if they don\u2019t trust in the therapy\u2019s effectiveness or the prescriber\u2019s motives.\n\nOne study found that for cancer patients considering experimental chemotherapy, trust in their physician was one of the most important reasons they enrolled in a clinical trial \u2014 on par with the belief that the treatment would be effective.\n\nToday, in the era of wearable devices and electronic health records, trust that personal data will be kept secure and private \u2014 and that such technologies are useful \u2014 remains a barrier to greater acceptance and use. Despite millions of dollars being poured into telemedicine, Americans are still much less likely to trust diagnoses made remotely than those made in person.\n\nResponding to Epidemics\n\nPerhaps most concerning is evidence that low levels of trust can weaken the ability of governments and public health agencies to respond to epidemics. A recent study suggests that Ebola spread more widely and persisted longer than it otherwise would have if there were higher levels of institutional trust.\n\nResearchers surveyed people in Liberia about their knowledge of Ebola, about how much they trusted the government, and how likely they were to take recommended precautions against Ebola. These precautions included adopting safe burial practices; abiding by restrictions on travel, social gatherings and curfews; keeping a bucket of chlorinated water at home; and avoiding physical contact with those displaying symptoms.\n\nPeople who didn\u2019t trust the government were much less likely to take recommended precautions. They weren\u2019t less well informed about Ebola, nor did they hold more erroneous beliefs. They just trusted less.\n\nCan Trust Be Rebuilt?\n\nTrust, of course, requires trustworthiness. Waning trust in the health system is partly a result of the sometimes well-founded public perception that its key players pursue profits at the expense of patients. (The United States is the only wealthy advanced nation that has not committed to universal health care.)", "title": "Do You Trust the Medical Profession?", "authors": []}

From the waiting room, I watch him run from one patient to the next. It dawns on me to ask him if he even takes a lunch break. He doesn\u2019t. I calculate that in an eight-hour period he has only seven to 12 minutes for each patient \u2014 an impossible situation for any doctor. In the past year, two more retina specialists have told me that their work schedule is equally hectic.\n\nBut I am overwhelmed, too. When I first started having vision problems, I was given a diagnosis of wet macular degeneration. I religiously took a nutritional supplement called AREDS 2, which a major study from the National Eye Institute had shown could slow the progression of the disease. It was only when I went online to research degenerative myopia that I learned something that my doctors did not tell me. The kind of wet macular degeneration that I have, caused by my degenerative myopia, is different from the far more common age-related macular degeneration that afflicts so many older adults. AREDS 2 would not do anything to preserve my vision.\n\nMembers of the low vision support group that I facilitate tell me they have had similar experiences with doctors. They complain that doctors sometimes don\u2019t explain what\u2019s going on with their eyes and avoid giving them bad news.\n\nA member once told her doctor about our low vision support group, and she was surprised to hear him complain. \u201cWhy is it that some of my patients seem ignorant about their eye condition?\u201d Doctor, doctor, she thought, why are you asking me? Aren\u2019t you the one who is supposed to do the explaining? But it\u2019s more than just lack of information.\n\nNature, life experience or both endow some doctors with excellent bedside manners. Others, however, need help. In recent years, some medical schools, like Columbia and Duke, and hospitals, like Massachusetts General, have begun to train doctors in the art of empathy after evidence-based research demonstrated its power to improve patient outcomes and reduce doctor errors, malpractice suits and physician burnout. Especially noteworthy is that training doctors in empathy produces happier doctors.\n\nSadly, many doctors remain empathy illiterate. The unfortunate consequence is that some doctors can be excessively blunt, or, in my case, saying nothing at all. Either can result in confusion and suffering.\n\nFor example, a close friend who fainted in a restaurant woke up in a hospital and was abruptly told by an oncologist that she had lung cancer and only three months to live.

Studies have found a link between low levels of magnesium, an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in a wide range of bodily processes, and sleep disorders. But if you are concerned you aren\u2019t getting enough magnesium, changing your diet may be a better option than taking a supplement, as \u201cthere is really sparse evidence that taking super-therapeutic doses of magnesium will give you a benefit,\u201d said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a professor of pulmonary and sleep medicine at the University of Southern California.\n\nThe mineral is widely available in both plant and animal-based foods, and the kidneys limit urinary excretion of magnesium, so deficiencies are rare in healthy people. Leafy green vegetables, nuts, legumes and whole grains are good sources of magnesium; fish, chicken and beef also contain magnesium. Older adults and people with certain disorders, such as Type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases and alcoholism, however, may have inadequate amounts.\n\n\u201cMagnesium deficiency has been associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety and difficulty relaxing, which are key ingredients to getting good sleep at night,\u201d Dr. Dasgupta said. He noted that magnesium interacts with an important neurotransmitter that favors sleep.\n\nOne small double-blinded clinical trial of 43 elderly people in Tehran who were randomly assigned to receive either 500 milligrams of magnesium or a placebo for eight weeks found that those who received the supplement fell asleep faster and spent more of their time in bed asleep, but their total sleep time was not necessarily longer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn even smaller study of 10 people done nearly 20 years ago found that taking a magnesium supplement helped people with restless leg syndrome get more sleep.\n\nIf you suspect you\u2019re deficient in magnesium or want to take magnesium supplements, talk to your doctor first. Magnesium can interact poorly with other drugs, and taking excessive amounts in the form of supplements can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea.

Not being able to witness the real-time reactions of every player involved snuffs out any usefulness for a player draft; James and Curry essentially confirmed as much afterward by taking to Twitter after their draft call to lament the absence of cameras.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere are three main reasons this format, which initially inspired so much hope among hoop romantics that it could pump some much-needed life into the league\u2019s midseason showcase, was conducted behind closed doors:\n\n1) The league did not want to risk embarrassing the last player chosen \u2014 or anyone else.\n\n2) The league did not want to put the captains in a position where they might upset teammates by passing over them.\n\n3) The league adopted both of those positions at the behest of the players\u2019 union. Some All-Stars want the draft televised, but some don\u2019t. So the league acquiesced.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd that left N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver to do most of the explaining in recent weeks. In a recent NBA TV interview, Silver said: \u201cThe goal was to improve the All-Star Game, not put a cherry on top of the cake.\u201d\n\nMichele A. Roberts, the executive director of the N.B.A. Players Association, declined interview requests this week through a union representative. But the N.B.P.A. did issue a statement Thursday to SB Nation, saying \u201cit was the absence of a consensus by prospective players likely to be affected that led to support\u201d for keeping the draft off the air.\n\nThe rampant tiptoeing around this whole thing is silly. It\u2019s the All-Star Game. It\u2019s a game, in other words, that doesn\u2019t even count. Let\u2019s hope Curry was right when he predicted last week that the television element would eventually come to fruition, urging patience because the new format still has its \u201ctraining wheels on.\u201d\n\nUncomfortable as it might be at the moment for an All-Star to be snubbed by a fellow All-Star on a public stage, for whatever reason, let\u2019s also not forget the wise words of Curry\u2019s coach in Golden State. As Steve Kerr told us during the 2015 N.B.A. Finals, and has been fond of repeating ever since, he and the players get paid \u201ca lot of money\u201d thanks to \u201cthe intense interest worldwide in the sport.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith that,\u201d Kerr often reminds us, \u201ccomes scrutiny and criticism.\u201d\n\nKerr gets it. There\u2019s a trade-off here. The N.B.A. is enjoying maybe the greatest period of broad relevance in its history, which has taken compensation to dizzying new levels, largely because the audience finds the league\u2019s various personal interactions and back stories so intoxicating.\n\nNo sports league on Earth lays bare its innermost feelings \u2014 its feuds, grudges and animus \u2014 better than the National Basketball Association. When so much of the league, as well as its television partners, is profiting so handsomely from life under the microscope, why pretend otherwise?\n\nThursday\u2019s draft simply wasn\u2019t the new format to implement if you don\u2019t go all the way.

He\u2019s a dramatist and a linguist who can be glorious about the ordinariness and misery of duty and work. His plays \u2014 like \u201cThe Beauty Queen of Leenane\u201d or \u201cThe Cripple of Inishmaan\u201d \u2014 tether behavior to state of mind. You believe what people do because they appear to be making the choices \u2014 ugly ones \u2014 as opposed to an author you can picture yanking the strings.\n\nBut his movies are all strings. Often they feel as if other filmmakers are doing the pulling. \u201cIn Bruges\u201d featured two hit men on a chatty stroll in Belgium, and certain people\u2019s passion for it is fit for Valentine\u2019s Day. But it was Tupperware Tarantino to me.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo \u201cThree Billboards\u201d admirers and to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the outfit that hands out the Golden Globes, something about the movie rings true or feels timely. That presumption of truth is driving some of the annoyance over this movie. My favorite bad thing about \u201cThree Billboards\u201d is its ambition to play around with America\u2019s ideological and geographical toys.\n\nOne of the toys is the word \u201cnigger.\u201d Another is the concept of political correctness. There\u2019s a scene between Mildred and a hotheaded dimwit cop \u2014 the racist \u2014 named Jason (Sam Rockwell), in which she baits his racism by calling him a \u201cnigger torturer.\u201d He hits the roof. \u201cPerson-of-color-torturing\u201d is what Jason says you must call it now, with exasperated lament. They volley the word and poke fun at its impropriety. You can tell that Mr. McDonagh relished the application of absurdism to the political correction (he knows \u201cperson-of-color-torturing\u201d really is linguistic torture, maybe even for a person of color). But he also seems to like the loaded nonsense in the sound of the word \u201cnigger.\u201d What you hear in a scene like this is a kind of careless virtuosity. It\u2019s a fun scene that\u2019s sunk by how much fun it\u2019s having with things you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with. The whole movie is like that \u2014 it\u2019s like Mildred \u2014 rude for sport and proud of it.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly a place for a white artist to poke, laughingly, at our racial and class messes. (Mel Brooks, for instance, excelled at it.) But Mr. McDonagh doesn\u2019t want to do more than poke. The Danish director Lars von Trier tried a more explicit damnation of the United States with \u201cDogville\u201d (2003) and \u201cManderlay\u201d (2005). But I liked the nihilism in Mr. von Trier\u2019s respective approximations of racism and slavery, even if he followed a European habit, especially in documentaries, of diagnosing America\u2019s ills in the least surprising and most patronizing way.\n\nFor a movie that asks you to behold so much violence \u2014 defenestration and talk of rape, a bludgeoning, a suicide, charred skin, a dental drill that treats a thumb like drywall \u2014 \u201cThree Billboards\u201d feels weirdly benign. Its black comedy doesn\u2019t leave a bruise. The violence curdles into the cartoonish. The movie could be about grace and vengeance, but they\u2019re presented as hoary lessons and hokey contrivances \u2014 happening upon a deer, sharing your orange juice with the madman who tried to murder you, juxtaposing the reading of an inspirational letter with an inferno. There\u2019s no reckoning with anything, no introspection, just escalating mayhem. The mix of the silly and the serious puts the movie in Coen brothers territory. But they can adjust the settings for their cynicism. Even at their worst, they\u2019ve got their finesse. Mr. McDonagh just keeps bashing away.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis really is an action movie whose action is played for laughs. Mildred beats up teenagers and tells off priests. Her precision with a Molotov cocktail should land her in the Super Bowl. Ms. McDormand certainly makes the most of the tirade machine Mr. McDonagh has built for her. (Not since \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d has anybody gotten to tell off this many people with this much gusto.) You feel for Mildred, but you fear her more. When she approaches a table in a restaurant carrying a wine bottle, the audience practically begs her not to use it. By this point, Mildred is way past being a mad mommy. She\u2019s Charles Bronson.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut she\u2019s not the only bereft mother fueled by vengeance. The foreign language Golden Globe went, in a surprise, to Fatih Akin\u2019s \u201cIn the Fade,\u201d which has Diane Kruger as a white German who must endure the legal trial of the neo-Nazi terrorists who killed her Turkish-German husband and their young son. It doesn\u2019t rank up there with \u201cHead-On\u201d (2004) and \u201cThe Edge of Heaven\u201d (2007), Mr. Akin\u2019s masterwork melodramas. It\u2019s too well oiled a machine, too morally simple to be completely satisfying. But it\u2019s more clear-eyed and serious than \u201cThree Billboards\u201d about what it means to inflict pain. Maybe there\u2019s a way to laugh through rage, but Mr. Akin doesn\u2019t know what way that would be. Neither, I would argue, does Mr. McDonagh.\n\n\u201cThree Billboards\u201d is a cupcake rolled in glass. It all just feels off. The redemption of the racist cop doesn\u2019t bother me \u2014 Sam Rockwell studiously plays him as a dangerous dope. But the way two other black characters (Amanda Warren and Darrell Britt-Gibson) and a smitten dwarf (Peter Dinklage) bop around Mildred is almost Muppet-like. (Mr. Dinklage\u2019s stature is meant to be a source of unapologetic amusement. More stuff you\u2019re not supposed to have fun with!)\n\nEventually, the film introduces a temporary black police chief (Clarke Peters) who seems meant to draw out \u2014 Sidney Poitier-style \u2014 some of the bigotry coursing through town, or at least through the precinct. But he\u2019s as much a prop as one of the billboards.\n\nI thought a lot about this movie watching \u201cAmerican Vandal,\u201d an eight-part, sitcom-length show created by Dan Perrault and Tony Yacenda, on Netflix. It parodies the true-crime boomlet epitomized by \u201cThe Jinx\u201d on HBO, \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d on Netflix and podcasts like \u201cSerial.\u201d And, like \u201cThree Billboards,\u201d the series revolves around jerks. Someone spray-painted 27 penises on 27 cars in the staff parking lot of a high school in Oceanside, Calif. And two student reporters investigate. The prime suspect \u2014 a stoner-skate punk senior named Dylan Maxwell \u2014 has been expelled. The two reporters poke holes in the case against him and explore a gamut of alternative culprits.\n\nLike Mr. McDonagh\u2019s movie, \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d takes a circuitous route to earnestly asked philosophical questions about human nature. The show has a breezy confidence that never tips all the way into mockery. But it\u2019s a lot less impressed with itself. It undermines the piety and ethical lapses in nonfiction mystery shows, while sharing with \u201cThree Billboards\u201d a belief in semaphores and that people aren\u2019t any one thing. Also \u2014 and this feels important \u2014 it feels like the people who made this show understand their setting and the people who live there. I\u2019ve never been to Oceanside, but I believe this show\u2019s rendition of it.\n\nEven in a setting as generic as an American high school, the show has a sense of place. And it\u2019s a white show whose nonwhite characters don\u2019t feel like objects. I\u2019m not sure what Ebbing is. You can feel that uncertainty in the movie\u2019s cop-out of a finale, in its bewildering loftiness (\u201cOscar Wilde\u201d as a character\u2019s last words) and in the coveralls Mildred spends most of the movie wearing. Her job is at a rustic gift shop, but the coveralls point to the harder blue-collar work we\u2019ve seen Ms. McDormand do in movies like \u201cNorth Country.\u201d Here, these clothes signify emotional work, yet they feel like a put-on, too. Three billboards, sure \u2014 but outside a coffee shop in Portland, Ore.\n\nThe movie isn\u2019t an explicit work of politics, but it reaches something political in certain people in the same way it touches something emotional in others. And yet in arguing about this movie what I don\u2019t want, but where I\u2019m afraid we are \u2014 with lots of film this time every year \u2014 is in another fight over a movie\u2019s politics that manages to leave the movie itself behind.\n\nWhose fault is that? We\u2019ve been seduced and bullied into thinking of the awards season as a process of politics. The people who make the movies also run or finance \u201ccampaigns.\u201d There is opposition research, and, in the form of other award shows, primaries, so to speak. And it all culminates with the election night we call the Academy Awards broadcast. So it\u2019s only natural that we tend to think of best picture (and a few of the major, ancillary categories) as a kind of vote in which, while average people have no say, we\u2019re all invested in the symbolism and catharsis of the outcome.\n\n\u201cThree Billboards,\u201d which is not based on a true story but does have some reality flavoring, must appear worthy of elected office, in some way. This was at first the illusion presented by the people running the campaigns, and in turn over the years, has become the custom for lots of us.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe movie can\u2019t be just the misfire that it is. The enthusiasm for it has to represent the injustice the movie believes it\u2019s aware of \u2014 against young murdered women, their suffering dysfunctional families and black torture victims we never see \u2014 but fails to sufficiently poeticize or dramatize what Mr. McDonagh is up to here: a search for grace that carries a whiff of American vandalism. Of course, few movies can predict their moment, but \u201cThree Billboards\u201d might be inadequately built for this one.", "title": "Does \u2018Three Billboards\u2019 Say Anything About America?

Animals with hands point at the mark and may touch it.\n\nThe dolphins passed that test at 24 months, which was the earliest researchers were allowed to draw on the young animals.

One is DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has provided temporary work permits and reprieves from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. These are the so-called Dreamers, who number about 800,000.\n\nAnother issue is the Temporary Protected Status program under which undocumented foreigners who were in the United States when disaster or conflict struck their homeland are allowed to remain in the United States. In November, the Trump administration ended the protection for about 60,000 Haitians, and on Monday the administration lifted it for almost 200,000 Salvadorans, most of whom have been in the United States for two decades.\n\nA third issue is the future of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants who have come to the United States over decades and have effectively integrated into American life. The Trump administration has ordered a broad immigration crackdown against them.\n\nAnd finally there\u2019s President Trump\u2019s imagined wall.\n\nWhat is concerning is not the wall, or the word \u201cshithole\u201d or the vacillation on the Dreamers or the Salvadorans.

We knew it in the 1970s, when he and his father were twice sued by the Justice Department for refusing to rent apartments to black people. We knew it in 1989, when he took out a full-page newspaper ad calling for the execution of five black and Latino teenagers charged with the brutal rape of a white woman in Central Park. (The men were convicted but later exonerated by DNA and other evidence, but Mr. Trump never apologized, and he continued to argue as late as 2016 that the men were guilty.) We knew it when he built a presidential campaign by demonizing Mexicans and Muslims while promoting the lie that America\u2019s first black president wasn\u2019t born here.

Like the majority of his Republican colleagues in Congress, he reckoned that he could somehow get more than he was giving up, which included his dignity. He reckoned wrong.\n\nRight now, we\u2019re supposed to \u2026 what? Thank Graham for his candor, because he effectively confirmed that in a meeting about immigration in the Oval Office on Thursday, a vulgar comment was uttered, and because he stood up to the president at the time, telling him that America was an idea, not a race?\n\nOr should we instead note how far Graham had previously traveled to prop up this same president? It was Graham who recently joined Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, in undercutting the credibility of federal inquiries into Trump\u2019s ties with Russia by recommending that the Justice Department investigate Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote that famous dossier.\n\nDid Graham tell himself then that he was craftily staying in Trump\u2019s good graces so that he could coax the president toward saner, better immigration policy? How did that wager work out? We now know the answer, and so does Graham.\n\nHe\u2019s hardly the worst of the obsequious lot. On Monday The Washington Post reported that when Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and David Perdue, a Georgia Republican, strenuously disputed the initial accounts that Trump said \u201cshithole\u201d in the Oval Office, it was not because his talk was actually statesmanlike. No, they heard him fume about immigrants from \u201cshithouse countries\u201d rather than \u201cshithole countries,\u201d and in that scintilla of semantic difference they found a rationale for muddying the waters and rallying around the president.

{"date": "2018-01-20 00:00:00", "text": "Professional women always walk a balance beam of respect, pushed to excel without seeming ambitious, pulled by social expectations of female niceness tempered by concerns that female likability exists in opposition to perceptions of female competence, inevitably blown off-kilter. What Mr. Trump demands of his female subordinates, though, is something greater than your still-sexist but wholly run-of-the-mill concerns about gendered expectations in the workplace. Women like Ivanka Trump, Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway don\u2019t just counsel the president and liaise with the press and public; they offer a feminine salve, simultaneously sanctioning Mr. Trump\u2019s sexist commentary and buttressing his ego by situating themselves as little girls in need of direction from Big Daddy (literally, in Ivanka\u2019s case). In return, Mr. Trump\u2019s usual hostility may be temporarily eased into something resembling benevolence toward them.\n\nHostile sexism \u2014 hateful misogynist comments or the physical abuse of women, for example \u2014 is easy to identify and condemn. (And to be clear, Mr. Trump has displayed plenty of that, too.) Benevolent sexism is more insidious. In the view of the benevolent sexist, women and men should occupy fundamentally different roles, with the men as patriarchs and women, with our naturally maternal and gentle dispositions, as helpmates and caretakers. In some conservative, religious or simply strongly male-dominated communities, you see this dressed up as a form of feminism \u2014 the idea being that women can find respect and purpose by tapping into our intrinsic maternal nature. When Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders use the fact that the president has employed and encouraged a handful of women \u2014 to, as we now know, also serve as his uncompensated therapists \u2014 as a shield against accusations of sexism, they are deploying a similarly mendacious argument.\n\nAnd women in places where sexism permeates every corner have little choice but to accept it if they want to get by, and so perform whatever psychological gymnastics necessary. Sure, your boss doesn\u2019t treat you the same way he treats the guys, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re different and special. So what if the requirements for being treated as \u201cspecial\u201d involve playacting hyperfemininity, stroking a man\u2019s ego and carefully managing his feelings? That\u2019s just how men are, and that\u2019s what men want.\n\nAnd yet taking this approach to rising through the ranks of the Trump White House \u2014 or any workplace \u2014 is a fool\u2019s errand, and it takes a toll. Most bosses are not as extreme as Mr. Trump, but it\u2019s not just right-wing men and gold-plated patriarchs who expect that female employees and co-workers will tend to their emotional shifts and personality quirks as readily as they do the day\u2019s to-do list. Assumptions that women will monitor and manage men\u2019s emotions span industries and political persuasions. It\u2019s not that subtly sexist men refuse wholesale to hire women; it\u2019s that they often hire a small number of us, with the unspoken but swiftly understood expectation that we will be the uncompensated \u201cchief feelings officer.\u201d Then they often lose respect for us because we play this very role.\n\nOf course not every man in the workplace demands this kind of emotional labor from his female colleagues; most don\u2019t. But when faced with bosses or colleagues who require this hybrid of good-daughter devotion and quasi-maternal coddling from their \u201cwork wives,\u201d women have two choices: Expend the unpaid effort and lose valuable time and energy, all while knowing you\u2019ll never be as respected as a man who doesn\u2019t have to handhold and head-pat his employer; or refuse to do it, and risk losing the job altogether. It\u2019s not just the craven Kellyannes and Hopes and Ivankas of the world who opt for the former.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump and His Work Wives", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "text": "Last Thursday, 11 of these \u201cforever prisoners\u201d filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court in Washington, D.C. The men, all foreign-born Muslims, say their continued detention violates the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process and the 2001 law that gave presidents the power to send enemy combatants to Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nOne of the plaintiffs, prisoner No. 893, a 45-year-old Yemeni named Tolfiq al Bihani, has been held at Guant\u00e1namo for nearly 15 years. He was cleared for conditional release in 2010. The Saudi government agreed to accept him in 2016, along with nine other Yemenis. Those nine were all transferred, but Mr. al Bihani remains at Guant\u00e1namo without explanation.\n\nPresident George W. Bush may be guilty of creating the constitutional calamity that is Guant\u00e1namo, but at least he made an effort to empty it of men who clearly posed no threat to the United States, releasing 532 detainees by the end of his second term. President Barack Obama, who was blocked by Republicans in Congress from keeping his campaign promise to close the prison, established regular reviews of each inmate\u2019s case and worked intensively to negotiate the transfer of those who could not be returned safely to their home countries. In the end, he released 197 detainees.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump bragged that he would \u201cabsolutely authorize\u201d torture techniques like waterboarding, on the ground that terrorism suspects \u201cdeserve it anyway.\u201d The remaining Guant\u00e1namo prisoners appear fated to stay locked up not based on an individual assessment of their cases \u2014 there will be none of those under Mr. Trump \u2014 but because they serve as convenient symbols of the aggressive antiterrorist and anti-Muslim platform he ran on.\n\nAnd yet the men make a straightforward case for their release. The Supreme Court has ruled that prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo must have a \u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to challenge the legal and factual grounds for their detention, which means that the federal courts have the power to review those claims and grant any appropriate relief.\n\nIf the Constitution stands for anything, the plaintiffs argue in their suit, which was filed on their behalf by the Center for Constitutional Rights, it must stand for the proposition that the government cannot detain someone for 16 years without charge.", "title": "Opinion | Donald Trump vs. Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s Forever Prisoners", "authors": []}

Ms. Goldin is still feeling her way back into a world filled with ghostly reminders of addiction, but she decided that she was strong enough for a new battle. That began recently when, in her most personal project yet, she publicly confronted OxyContin\u2019s manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, and that company\u2019s longtime owners, who are also prominent art patrons: the descendants of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, two of three physician brothers who built Purdue Pharma into a pharmaceutical behemoth.\n\nPhoto\n\nFoundations run by those members of the Sackler family have given tens of millions of dollars to institutions like the Victoria and Albert Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, the Solomon Guggenheim Foundation and the Dia Arts Foundation.\n\nThe January issue of Artforum published photographs by Ms. Goldin, including searing self-portraits, that depicted her life while addicted. They were accompanied by an essay in which she described her constant search for drugs: \u201cI went from three pills a day, as prescribed, to eighteen. I got a private endowment and spent it all. Like all opiate addicts my crippling fear of withdrawal was my guiding force.\u201d\n\nShe went on to announce the formation of an advocacy group and pressed the Sackler family and company \u2014 who, she wrote, \u201cbuilt their empire with the lives of hundreds of thousands\u201d \u2014 to fund addiction treatment and education.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI realized that I wasn\u2019t alone and that I had to help people,\u201d she said inside the courthouse. \u201cI always do what\u2019s closest to me. This is what I\u2019ve lived through. And I\u2019m a survivor of OxyContin \u2014 talk about hell.\u201d\n\nElizabeth A. Sackler, the founder of a center for feminist art at the Brooklyn Museum, responded to her essay with a statement pointing out that her father, Arthur M. Sackler, who had owned Purdue Pharma with his brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, died in 1987, before OxyContin existed. (It was approved for use in 1995.) No money from the drug had gone to his descendants, she added.\n\n\u201cThe opioid epidemic is a national crisis and Purdue Pharma\u2019s role in it is morally abhorrent to me,\u201d Ms. Sackler continued. \u201cI admire Nan Goldin\u2019s commitment to take action and her courage to tell her story.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA spokeswoman for other members of the Sackler family did not comment. But in a statement to The New York Times, Robert Josephson, a spokesman for Purdue Pharma, said, \u201cWe are deeply troubled by the prescription and illicit opioid abuse crisis, and we would welcome an opportunity to sit down with Ms. Goldin to discuss her ideas.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Goldin elaborated on those ideas during an evening-long interview in Lower Manhattan that began at a cafe on West Broadway and moved to the courthouse on Centre Street, its cinder block walls plastered with old tabloid covers about the accused East Village murderer Daniel Rakowitz (\u201cThe Monster of Tompkins Square\u201d ) and the patrician Sydney Biddle Barrows (the Mayflower Madam). \u201cI love this place,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most New York place left in New York.\u201d\n\nThe conversation lasted until 10 p.m. Dinner was a Diet Pepsi, pretzels and peanut butter crackers, which Ms. Goldin selected from a courthouse vending machine.\n\nPhoto\n\nOver the years Ms. Goldin\u2019s photographs have captured the rebellious and transgressive realities of a pre-gentrified New York City. Among her best-known works are the 700 images in a collection titled \u201cThe Ballad of Sexual Dependency.\u201d They illustrate the world she inhabited, showing people having sex or shooting heroin, sometimes with excruciating intimacy.\n\nMs. Goldin said that her OxyContin addiction began with a prescription. In 2014, while she was living in Berlin, doctors prescribed 40 milligrams a day for tendinitis in her wrist, which later required surgery. Ms. Goldin said she ended up using 450 milligrams of the drug each day, seeking prescriptions from multiple doctors and finally turning to a dealer in New York who shipped her pills via FedEx. After years of OxyContin she moved to street drugs including heroin, which deliver a comparable high for much less money, a pattern that experts say has created the public health crisis that has terrified the nation.\n\nMs. Goldin, who is 64, kept working throughout, even preparing a major show at the Museum of Modern Art. But she said that the drug sealed her off from the rest of the world, leaving her dulled and depressed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a party drug. It\u2019s not a social drug.\u201d Addiction, she said, is \u201ca heavy foot on your head.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe overdose helped push her to finally confront her fear of withdrawal. She entered McLean Hospital\u2019s Fernside treatment program in rural Massachusetts, where, over two months, Ms. Goldin got clean. She began researching OxyContin and learned that Purdue\u2019s parent company had pleaded guilty in 2007 to a federal felony charge of misbranding the drug. Since then, a new federal investigation has begun and lawsuits have accused Purdue of deceptive marketing. Asked about those assertions in November, shortly after they were made, a company spokesman said, \u201cWe vigorously deny these allegations and look forward to the opportunity to present our defense.\u201d\n\nThe deaths related to opioids, some 200,000 from 1999 to 2016, remind Ms. Goldin of H.I.V.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201980s I lost a whole community and to my mind there\u2019s a generation missing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo are we going to watch now while another generation is being wiped out?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Goldin\u2019s new group, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, or P.A.I.N. \u2014 urged museums to reject future donations from the Sackler family. Its focus so far has been a petition on change.org demanding that \u201cthe Sackler family and Purdue Pharma\u201d fund rehabilitation centers, relapse prevention and holistic approaches; advertise the dangers of opioids; and re-educate doctors to stop overprescribing.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Josephson, the Purdue spokesman, said that for more than 15 years the company has supported much of what Ms. Goldin advocates. He said it funded state prescription drug monitoring programs and distributed federal guidelines for prescribing opioids. It recently announced educational initiatives aimed at teenagers, warning of opioid dangers, he added.\n\nMs. Goldin\u2019s group meets once a week in her apartment in Brooklyn and includes about a dozen members \u2014 former abusers, people close to addicts and others sympathetic to the cause.\n\nThe group has discussed making a documentary on OxyContin and also direct protests but is not yet ready to make its plans public, Ms. Goldin said.\n\nShe explained that detox treatments are often unaffordable and added that she hoped the petition could serve as a form of moral suasion, especially if friends of the Sacklers endorse its demands.\n\n\u201cI want people who go to cocktail parties with them to sign,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Saturday Ms. Goldin and three friends headed to the Upper West Side to give out leaflets promoting the petition during a women\u2019s march. Some in the crowd declined to take the fliers. But a man near Lincoln Center accepted one, saying his sister-in-law had died in West Virginia as a result of opioids.\n\nDuring a lunch break inside a cafe, a woman at a nearby table told Ms. Goldin that her son had been addicted to opioids. The two exchanged personal stories and hugged. Ms. Goldin and her friends began batting around ideas for future pamphleteering.\n\n\u201cWe can make some fliers for museum goers,\u201d Ms. Goldin mused playfully. Maybe next time, she added, \u201cwe\u2019ll go to the Museum of Natural History or the Guggenheim.\u201d", "title": "Don\u2019t Call Her a Victim: After Surviving Opioids, Nan Goldin Goes After the Makers", "authors": ["Colin Moynihan"]}

Bush and Obama administrations.\n\nTechnically, the Department of Homeland Security is right that the conditions created by those quakes no longer exist. But the reasons the Salvadorans, like the Haitians and Nicaraguans, should be allowed to stay far outweigh the technically legal reasons to send them home.\n\nThere is nothing stopping Congress and the Trump administration from rewriting immigration law to avoid such harsh choices in the future.

He asked the bat boy to bring him his glove. Then, without turning, he said, \u2018Young fellow, I don\u2019t know what league you came from, but we use the same plate. It\u2019s 17 inches wide.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I realized why they called him Stan the Man, and I learned not to anticipate the call. I introduced timing to umpiring. That\u2019s my gift to baseball. My heritage. My legacy. Before, the umpires were always told: \u2018Be quick! Be decisive!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Harvey was chosen for Cooperstown, Tommy Lasorda, the former Los Angeles Dodgers manager, recalled how \u201cyou could see every time he was on the field, he gave every ounce of energy he had, and I can\u2019t say that about a lot of guys.\u201d\n\nBut Lasorda was not always thrilled with Harvey. One time, when Keith Hernandez, the Mets\u2019 first baseman, was batting, Harvey\u2019s calls of two balls and no strikes brought howls from Lasorda in the dugout. \u201cDon\u2019t let those guys intimidate you,\u201d Hernandez told Harvey. His response: \u201cNobody\u2019s ever intimidated me, son.\u201d\n\nDoug Harvey was born on March 13, 1930, in South Gate, Calif. He was a teenager when he decided he would become a sports official, figuring he could do better than those he saw. He got his start in professional baseball as a ticket taker and a bat boy for a minor league team in El Centro, Calif.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter attending San Diego State University, where he played basketball, football and baseball, Harvey began his umpiring career in 1958 in the California League, earning $350 a month.\n\nPhoto\n\nJoy Harvey, in an interview with Lee Gutkind for his book on umpiring, \u201cThe Best Seat in Baseball: But You Have to Stand!,\u201d remembered how, while her husband was umpiring in the low minors, \u201cwe scrimped and saved so he had enough money to drive up to San Francisco for a night and a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first place we went was Candlestick Park. In all his years in baseball, Doug had never, up to that time, been in a major league stadium, so we went that morning and asked if we could go in and walk around.\u201d\n\nThey sat in the top row of the stands in a silent and windy park, and then, said Joy Harvey: \u201cIt came right out of a Grade B movie, but I knew for all he was worth, Doug meant for it to come true. \u2018Some day,\u2019 he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to umpire in this stadium.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarvey, who chewed tobacco during his umpiring years, was found to have oral cancer in 1997 and spoke out about the dangers of smokeless tobacco following his treatment. He is survived by his wife; his brother Nolan; his sons Scott and Todd; six grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nFor all of his authoritative presence, Harvey once became embroiled in a controversy in which he came out second best.\n\nOn July 14, 1978, he ejected Don Sutton, the Dodgers\u2019 star pitcher, after accusing him of throwing defaced baseballs in a game at St. Louis. The infraction carried a 10-day suspension, but Sutton, proclaiming his innocence, said he would sue the National League and Harvey for depriving him of a livelihood. The league president, Chub Feeney, never imposed the suspension.\n\nHarvey\u2019s reputation was evidently well earned, but there was at least one person besides the sometimes aggrieved ballplayer or manager who made sure he did not get carried away by his lofty aura.\n\nOne Christmas, Joy Harvey gave her husband a T-shirt that read: \u201cWe\u2019ll Get Along Just Fine as Soon as You Realize I\u2019m God.\u201d", "title": "Doug Harvey, Hall of Fame Umpire Players Called God, Dies at 87", "authors": ["Richard Goldstein"]}

{"date": "2018-01-18 00:00:00", "text": "Most of the plan would require the approval of the state legislature, which is expected to receive it Friday.\n\nIn announcing his support last summer for congestion pricing, Mr. Cuomo said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the region\u2019s umbrella transit agency, needs a new, reliable source of funds. Depending on how the prices are structured, the task force estimated that up to $1.5 billion could become available annually.\n\nWith New York\u2019s population at an all-time high, its streets snarled by mounting traffic and its famed public transit system in steep decline both above ground and below, it has become increasingly apparent that the city is choking on its own growth. Mr. Cuomo is gambling this proposal will succeed where earlier attempts have failed, though the dire transit situation, as well as improvements in technology, give it a far better shot at becoming reality than past attempts.\n\n\u201cNew York City traffic congestion now ranks second worst among cities in the United States and third worst among cities in the world,\u201d a draft of the report says. If not abated, the congestion will cost the economy of the metropolitan area $100 billion over the next five years, the task force estimated.\n\nThe governor is picking up a cause that was championed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2008, but that met stiff resistance. It died in the State Assembly without coming to a vote. The current mayor, Bill de Blasio, has said that he favors a tax on millionaires and has argued that congestion pricing hurts the middle class and poor who live outside Manhattan and drive into it.\n\nThe report dismissed those claims, saying only 4 percent of residents of other boroughs commute to jobs in Manhattan in a vehicle, or approximately 118,000 residents. Of those, it said, more than half were higher income individuals, and fewer than 5,000 of them would qualify as working poor.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAs important as the study has been for the city, the openly hostile relationship between the governor and the mayor was reflected in the makeup of the task force: Of its 15 members, none are from the de Blasio administration. The report called for increased traffic enforcement by the city, and said the distribution of official parking placards should be subject to a joint review by city and state officials.\n\nPeople who live within the congestion zone would not be exempt from the new fees.\n\nThe new plan reflects a changed technological and political landscape since Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s effort. It was described by people familiar with its details who asked not to be identified because it has not yet been presented to state legislators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew technology can identify vehicles on any roadway and automatically charge them, so the task force was able to draw a narrower \u2014 and perhaps more politically palatable \u2014 cordon limited to the most crowded streets. In turn, that means drivers can enter Midtown and Lower Manhattan by two bridges without paying as long as they go directly to the F.D.R. Drive along the East River and then continue on it until they are out of the congestion zone.\n\n\n\nWith current street configurations, that is possible only at the Edward I. Koch Queensboro Bridge at East 59th Street and the Brooklyn Bridge downtown; coming into Manhattan via the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges, drivers are only able to continue into streets covered in the zone.\n\nThe crisis in the transit system may also make it easier for Mr. Cuomo to sell the pricing plan to the legislature. When Mr. Bloomberg made his pitch a decade ago, the transit system was in far better shape. In fact, the Bloomberg plan was intended to address surging ridership and anticipated the budget pressures that led to maintenance cuts.\n\nSince then, the city\u2019s traffic problems have also worsened, even though fewer vehicles are driving into the central business district, the report said. In expanding and creating bicycle lanes and pedestrian malls, the city has decreased driving lanes for vehicles. The iPhone, released in 2007, led to an explosion of Uber and ride-hail cars that jam streets in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. Truck deliveries and rampant construction routinely block traffic. Midtown traffic now crawls at an average of 4.7 miles per hour, down from 6.5 miles per hour five years ago.\n\nEver more pedestrians and cyclists are fighting for elbow room on crowded sidewalks and streets: The city\u2019s population of 8.5 million has increased by a half-million since 2000. An estimated 60 million tourists visited last year, up 25 percent since 2010.\n\nThe gridlock is not only a problem for commuters. Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a group of top business leaders, said that longer commutes and work trips resulted in lost productivity, increased business costs, and higher fuel and vehicle expenses. In an analysis released this week, the partnership calculated that worsening congestion now costs the New York region about $20 billion annually, up from $13 billion annually in 2006.\n\nSam Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who served on the state task force, said that these recommendations could make a real impact in addressing New York City\u2019s transit and traffic morass. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the work that the panel has done, and I\u2019m very encouraged with the courage the governor has shown in raising congestion pricing as an alternative.\u201d", "title": "Driving a Car in Manhattan Could Cost $11.52 Under Congestion Plan", "authors": ["Jim Dwyer", "Winnie Hu"]}

That December night in Los Angeles, after Wentz left with a knee injury, and after Foles came on to direct them to a division-clinching victory against the Rams that improved their record to 11-2, safety Malcolm Jenkins gathered the team in a cramped Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum locker room and peddled positives. Nothing had changed, he said. The goal remained the same.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfterward, speaking to reporters, he said, \u201cDo we have a quarterback on the roster?\u201d\n\nYes.\n\n\u201cO.K., then,\u201d Jenkins said.\n\nThe Eagles had Foles, who, as his teammates will readily remind you, threw 27 touchdowns in 2013. He broke his collarbone the next season, then got traded in 2015, nearly retired in 2016 and returned to Philadelphia in 2017, to back up Wentz.\n\n\u201cYou feel like you played a great game in L.A., you have the best record in football, and you lose your most valuable player \u2014 or maybe the league\u2019s most valuable player,\u201d the Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said. \u201cHowever, we made such a concerted effort to make sure we could get Nick back on the team. Who knew it would come to this?\u201d\n\nFoles threw four touchdowns in his first start, against the Giants, but muddled through a tight win against Oakland and sputtered against Dallas in Week 17. Directing a simplified game plan last week, when the Eagles were the first top seed in N.F.L. history to be favored to lose its playoff game, Foles guided them over Atlanta.\n\nBut the Vikings?\n\n\u201cWhen people doubt you, you can feel it,\u201d Foles said after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re all human and I\u2019m keeping it real. When someone doubts you, you know. These guys that I play with knew that I would eventually just keep working at it. They know me as a person and they know me as a player, and we just kept working.\u201d\n\nAccording to N.F.L. research, the last five teams that won a playoff game on a touchdown in sudden-death or as time expired, as the Vikings did with Stefon Diggs\u2019s 61-yard catch against the Saints, lost their next game, by an average of 23 points. Minnesota, with a defense that ranked second against the run and pass and first in points allowed, seemed immune to such unraveling.\n\nBy the game\u2019s third drive, which ended with Robinson\u2019s interception, the Eagles had rendered Diggs\u2019s catch anticlimax. Long whacked the arm of Vikings quarterback Case Keenum, sending the pass fluttering toward Robinson, who knew at once that he would catch it.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it just pumped the offense,\u201d Foles said. \u201cI think it pumped up the whole city of Philadelphia. I think everyone down Broad Street heard that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Eagles kept coming. Minnesota had dared Foles to beat them, but now the Eagles were daring the Vikings to stop him. Foles executed the run-pass option with precision, reading the Minnesota linebacker to either hand off or, more often, throw short passes \u2014 and usually complete them. In speaking about him last week, Offensive Coordinator Frank Reich cited Foles\u2019s pedigree as a coveted point-guard recruit before he chose to play football.\n\n\u201cHe can give you the no-look pass,\u201d Reich said. \u201cHe can be looking one way and hit a guy. He has that knack and feel.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia pummeled the Vikings\u2019 units, one by one. The defense first, with a 75-yard drive, capped by LeGarrette Blount\u2019s 11-yard trucking of Eric Kendricks en route to the end zone. Then, with Minnesota in the red zone, a strip-sack of Keenum by the rookie Derek Barnett \u2014 taken with the first-round pick Philadelphia received for trading Sam Bradford to Minnesota \u2014 was recovered by Long. Keenum, harassed all night, committed all three turnovers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all just trying to get to the quarterback,\u201d Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. \u201cCoach always says, \u2018Stop the run, go have fun.\u2019 We got a chance to do that and do a bunch of different things. We had a chance to go out and dominate.\u201d\n\nTheir defense did. Their offense did, too. The Eagles lost several players to season-ending injuries \u2014 a superb left tackle (Jason Peters), a middle linebacker (Jordan Hicks), a slippery running back (Darren Sproles), a special-teams ace (Chris Maragos) \u2014 but the rest of the team just kept playing. They kept playing and playing, winning and winning, and now look.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to the Super Bowl,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the stinking Super Bowl.\u201d", "title": "Eagles March Past Vikings to Super Bowl, Just as They Predicted", "authors": ["Ben Shpigel", "On Pro Football"]}

Snowden, the former American intelligence contractor who leaked documents about surveillance programs.\n\nHe also offended potential supporters in the Democratic Party by allowing WikiLeaks to become the conduit for emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic National Committee and leaked to harm the presidential candidacy of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAmerican intelligence agencies have concluded that Russian hackers working for the Kremlin carried out the intrusions, but Mr. Assange insists he did not know the source of the emails, under the working rules of WikiLeaks. He has denied working for Russia or any other government.\n\nThe United States attorney general, Jeff Sessions, has said that arresting Mr. Assange is a priority. \u201cWe have professionals that have been in the security business of the United States for many years that are shocked by the number of leaks, and some of them are quite serious,\u201d he said last year.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn Thursday, Steve Goldstein, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs, said that \u201cthe decision to grant Julian Assange citizenship is a decision between Julian Assange and Ecuador.\u201d He said the United States would \u201cnot discuss\u201d whether it wanted to arrest Mr. Assange.\n\nWhen Swedish prosecutors dropped their effort to have Mr. Assange extradited last year, they said it was not for reasons of guilt or innocence but because they saw no hope of compelling him to leave the embassy.\n\nThe British police say, however, say he is still subject to arrest on charges of jumping bail.

Rafael Correa, the president who decided to grant Mr. Assange asylum, was widely seen as wanting to burnish his credentials as a leftist leader who would not be cowed by the United States. But he found Mr. Assange to be a headache as well: In October 2016, Ecuador temporarily suspended Mr. Assange\u2019s internet access after WikiLeaks published documents from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nMr. Correa left office in May after a decade as president. He was succeeded by Len\u00edn Moreno, who although an ally of Mr. Correa\u2019s has demonstrated little enthusiasm for Mr. Assange\u2019s cause. He has called Mr. Assange a hacker, and warned him not to meddle in politics.\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Espinosa said Ecuador was exploring a variety of possible resolutions to the dispute. She mentioned \u201cdialogue with the United Kingdom\u201d and mediation by other states or international organizations that could \u201cfacilitate a just, lasting and dignified resolution for all the involved parties.\u201d\n\nShe said that Ecuador had \u201cthe best relations of friendship and cooperation\u201d with Britain.\n\nIn a separate statement, the ministry said Mr. Assange had \u201ccommitted to not intervening in affairs outside the scope of his asylum status,\u201d which seemed an oblique reference to his penchant for creating a stir.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGreg Barns, a lawyer who advises Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks, said in a telephone interview from New Zealand that the situation was \u201cintolerable\u201d for his client and for Ecuador.\n\nThe embassy is in the affluent Knightsbridge section of London, but he said Mr. Assange had been effectively \u201cimprisoned with no access to natural light and fresh air for a period of five and a half years.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the London police ceased round-the-clock surveillance of the embassy, citing the cost, but warned that Mr. Assange would still be arrested if he left. In 2016, United Nations experts concluded that Mr. Assange had been arbitrarily detained in violation of international law. But Britain and Sweden argue that by choosing to jump bail and seek asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy, Mr. Assange has effectively imprisoned himself.\n\nMr. Barns suggested that the Australian government would be an obvious third-party mediator, given that Mr. Assange is a citizen of Australia, which has excellent relations with Britain.\n\nRicardo Pati\u00f1o, who was foreign minister of Ecuador under Mr. Correa and has described Mr. Assange as the victim of persecution, said he hoped that Britain would relent and allow a mediator \u2014 like a country or even a distinguished individual \u2014 to try to facilitate Mr. Assange\u2019s departure from the embassy.\n\nAnother former foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Ayala-Lasso, who also has served as the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, said that diplomatic immunity would have been an elegant solution to the problem because it would have exempted Mr. Assange from facing punishment in Britain for bail jumping.\n\nBut since Britain has rejected that option, Mr. Ayala-Lasso said, it is difficult to see how mediation would work. \u201cThis is a conflict that is judicial-political in nature,\u201d he said, \u201cand Britain will not cede its position.\u201d\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, an Ecuadorean scholar of international relations, said the problem was one of Ecuador\u2019s own making.\n\n\u201cEcuador never should have accepted Assange as a refugee because of his questionable reputation, but it was done anyway in search of international attention,\u201d he said in an interview.", "title": "Ecuador Gives Assange Citizenship, Worsening Standoff With Britain", "authors": ["Maggy Ayala", "Steven Erlanger"]}

One approach would be to lift the 200,000 vehicle cap and continue the credit indefinitely, a move that would most likely be welcomed by makers and consumers of electric vehicles and has the support of green energy lobbying groups. But the price tag for the government could become prohibitive if electric car sales surge.\n\nOr Congress could phase out the incentives beginning at a target date that would apply to all manufacturers, or after total industry sales hit a level that suggests a move to electric vehicles is sustainable. Depending on the time or level of sales chosen, that could address concerns about the impact of the tax credit on the deficit.\n\nTesla and G.M. have not proposed a specific fix.\n\nMany countries have far more robust subsidies for electric cars than the United States, including most of Europe. Norway has by far the highest percentage of electric car ownership in the world (about one-third of the vehicles sold there last year were electric or hybrid), along with the most lavish subsidies, which include sharply reduced sales taxes as well as free parking and use of uncongested bus lanes. The country has set a goal of zero auto emissions by 2025.\n\nWhile no one expects the United States to go to such an extreme, revising the electric vehicle tax credit and bolstering other incentives for renewable energy could be a rare source of bipartisan agreement. When it comes to jobs, a top priority for both Congress and the Trump administration, the Department of Energy reported that in 2016, 3.38 million Americans were employed in the clean energy sector, 10 percent more than the 2.99 million employed in fossil fuels.\n\nHow the renewable energy subsidies managed to survive to be part of the tax law remains a subject of debate, but nearly every explanation points in part to Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the powerful Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a staunch supporter of renewable energy, especially wind. Iowa is a leader in wind power, which generates 36 percent of the state\u2019s electricity. The wind power industry employs 9,000 people in the state, according to the Iowa Wind Energy Association.

The Asian elephants also sometimes slapped their trunks against the ground in fear.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Asian elephants react differently to bees because the bees in Asia are less aggressive. Or maybe the elephants simply have different behavioral responses, the way people from one culture might laugh if they\u2019re nervous and those from another might fidget or talk fast, said John Poulsen, a tropical ecologist and assistant professor at Duke University, who has helped conduct similar elephant-bee research.\n\nIn Africa, Save the Elephants, a nonprofit conservationist group, builds wire and beehive fences at a cost of about $1,000 for a one-acre farm \u2014 roughly one-fifth the cost of an electrified fence, said Dr. King, who also heads the human-elephant coexistence program for the charity. The farm gets protection against elephants and a modest new source of income from a twice-a-year honey harvest.\n\nThe beehives have to be strung on a wire sturdy enough to hold them up, but not so sturdy that the hives can\u2019t sway in the breeze.

But Mr. Trump\u2019s support has tilted the scales, leading members of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government to conclude that Israel can take a stronger position without fear of forceful foreign intercession.\n\n\u201cThe map of external pressures has changed dramatically,\u201d said Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Bar-Ilan University. \u201cInstead of Obama, we have Trump. The European Union is divided, Brexit occupies the British agenda, Germany has coalition problems. There\u2019s no consensus in Europe, no single policy putting pressure on Israel. So this is a very easy arena in which we can go ahead.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, corruption investigations into Mr. Netanyahu and his advisers have weakened him politically and led to speculation that he could be indicted. That has spurred ambitious members of his party, and of his governing coalition, to behave as though 2018 were an election year, staking out positions intended to appeal to their base. The next parliamentary elections are not due until November 2019, but they could come sooner if the government were to fall.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t discount that people are saying, \u2018Maybe we can get away with more now because nobody in the international community seems to care,\u2019\u201d said Shalom Lipner, an analyst at the Brookings Institution who was an aide to several prime ministers. \u201cBut the more impactful motivating factor seems to be politics. There\u2019s a certain amount of blood in the water right now, and everybody\u2019s smelling it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nArguably the most provocative, though least substantive, of the flurry of Israeli actions was a nonbinding but unanimous vote on Sunday by the central committee of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s party, Likud, to support the \u201cfree construction and application of Israeli law and sovereignty in all liberated areas of settlement\u201d in the West Bank.\n\nIf such a measure became law, it would effectively annex Israeli settlements on land that the Palestinians demand for a future state and leave them with an archipelago of disconnected territory. The West Bank is now under military jurisdiction, though settlers are subject to civilian law, as Israeli citizens.\n\nMr. Netanyahu, who at the height of his political powers could have been expected to quash the vote, was not present for it. But most of the Likud ministers in his government endorsed the proposal, which was roughly equivalent to the adoption of a plank in a party platform. Party leaders acknowledged that Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line support of Israel had created an urgency to seize the moment.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven as Likud met near Ben Gurion Airport, Israel\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, published a new formal instruction to all government offices on Sunday, as part of an agreement with the Justice Ministry, that any new legislation explicitly state how it should be applied on the West Bank, or else the responsible government agency must say why it should not apply there.\n\nJustice Minister Ayelet Shaked played down the instruction, telling Kan Radio that it would speed the application of Israeli law to areas where settlers live, which now sometimes takes years, she said, because it must first be adopted by the military commander, who lays down the laws of the occupation. \u201cWhat we did is an attempt to decrease the gap between Judea and Samaria and Israel,\u201d Ms. Shaked said.\n\nBut opponents of the occupation said the little-noticed bureaucratic move had great significance. \u201cThe Knesset cannot pass laws that are valid in Japan,\u201d said Hagit Ofran, an advocate at Peace Now, a leftist group that opposes settlements, referring to the Israeli Parliament. \u201cYou can only legislate in places that you have jurisdiction. And if they claim jurisdiction over occupied territories, it means they\u2019re annexed.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Until now, a peace deal that gave up any part of the city could have been ratified either with a supermajority in Parliament, or with a simple majority and a national referendum. Under the new law, it may be ratified only with a supermajority, or 80 of 120 votes.\n\n\u201cThis is the current right-wing ideological majority shackling the future,\u201d Mr. Seidemann said. The law itself, however, could be reversed, by a simple majority vote in Parliament.\n\nThe other effect, and the more significant one in the short term, would have cleared away potential legal obstacles to redrawing the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem. Some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s allies have sought this power to remove Palestinian neighborhoods from the city, enhancing the Jewish majority in municipal elections.\n\nProponents had in mind several fast-growing Palestinian neighborhoods, like Kufr Aqab and the Shuafat refugee camp, that are within the city limits but outside the security barrier that Israel built to prevent terrorist attacks. Largely denied city services because of concerns about the safety of municipal workers, those areas have become boomtowns of unregulated construction by Palestinians seeking affordable housing.\n\nThose neighborhoods now include perhaps as many as 100,000 Palestinians who can vote in city elections. A chief sponsor of the bill, Ze\u2019ev Elkin, the minister of Jerusalem affairs, told The Jerusalem Post recently, \u201cWe are facing a ticking demographic time bomb\u201d in those neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWhat it actually means is the establishment of the first Bantustans of Israel,\u201d said Ms. Ofran of Peace Now. \u201cLike in South Africa \u2014 they said, \u2018They have their own townships, they run independently, run their own services,\u2019 while having actually zero resources to do that. We have Jerusalem, a poor city but with huge capacities, a huge budget, the national government\u2019s help, and now you\u2019re telling us that if you throw them away, they can do by themselves.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s doing exactly what they had in the apartheid regime.\u201d\n\nIn a surprising twist, however, the leader of the right-wing Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett, insisted that the municipal-boundaries language be dropped from the bill, saying that making changes to the city\u2019s borders was at odds with the idea of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital.\n\n\u201cPeople tried in the past to partition Jerusalem,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cIt is not within the authority of any Jew, of any Jewish body, or the entire Jewish people, to give up any part of the land.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAviv Tatarsky, a researcher for Ir Amim, a Jerusalem advocacy group that lobbied against the bill, welcomed Mr. Bennett\u2019s change of heart after waking up to learn of it. \u201cWe will send him flowers and say thank you,\u201d Mr. Tatarsky said.", "title": "Emboldened Israeli Right Presses Moves to Doom 2-State Solution", "authors": ["David M.

The agreement, which includes a firm commitment to buy 20 aircraft and an option for 16 more, comes just days after Airbus said it would end production of the A380 if it did not receive more orders.\n\nWhen Airbus started delivering the A380 a decade ago, it pitched the plane as the future of aviation, offering a solution to airport congestion and to increased demand for international travel. The number of planes that can land at an airport on a given day is limited, the European company argued, so the A380, with the capacity to carry more than 500 passengers, would allow airlines to transport more passengers.\n\nBut the bet on the four-engine plane turned out to be a financial disaster for Airbus as the industry increasingly used smaller airports, a shift that favored its main competitor, Boeing, and other manufacturers of midsize aircraft.\n\nAirbus did not book any orders for the A380 last year; in fact, orders for two planes were canceled. The poor performance for the aircraft overshadowed an otherwise decent year for the company.

The data confirmed that the penguins continued to take moonlight swims throughout the breeding season. The researchers believe the males ceased their hunting activity once the females laid their eggs.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe findings, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, suggest that previous research on emperor penguins was focused on too small a population to be taken as representative for the entire species, Dr. Kooyman said.\n\nMore Reporting on Penguins\n\n\u201cAlmost all the studies about winter breeding have been conducted from the research station Dumont D\u2019Urville, which is about 100 meters away from a colony,\u201d he said. That colony, which was prominently featured in \u201cMarch of the Penguins,\u201d is also 100 kilometers from the ice edge, making it impossible for penguins that breed there to take breaks for fishing.\n\nThe colony that Dr. Kooyman observed was farther south than Dumont D\u2019Urville, and was located only about 10 kilometers from the ice edge. Thus the authors suggest that the length of a fast depends largely on the breeding colony\u2019s proximity to water. The male emperor penguins in Cape Washington probably fast for about 65 days, they estimated.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery that penguins \u2014 who are believed to be visual hunters \u2014 can successfully hunt in the dark may be good news for a species that is contending with loss of habitat because of a warming planet. Researchers have expressed concern that the loss of stable ice in Antarctica could make it difficult for the animal to perform their breeding ritual.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s global warming, the bird has the resilience to go south, where they will continue to have stable sea ice for breeding that they would not have in the northern colonies,\u201d said Dr. Kooyman.\n\nAs for why the researchers waited 20 years to publish their findings, Dr. Kooyman said he had hoped to return to Cape Washington to conduct a more detailed study.\n\n\u201cI think that emphasizes the difficulty of observing what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after 20 years I said, \u2018Well, I think it\u2019s time to write something about it.\u2019\u201d", "title": "Emperor Penguins: Good Dads, but Less Dedicated Than You May Have Thought", "authors": ["Douglas Quenqua"]}

What are a few things you\u2019ve observed recently \u2014 tactics, statements \u2014 that made you wince and think: \u201cThat\u2019s too strident. That\u2019s not wise.\u201d\n\nTRIPPI: A partisan from either party who is in a marginal district and lashes out at the other side is likely to hurt themselves with these voters. How is this candidate not going to add to the chaos and hostility in Washington? How is this candidate going to get anything done for me?\n\nDemocratic activists want someone who is going to attack and fight the Republicans at every turn. That will work great in a Democratic district \u2014 it may work to attract support and money and win praise from the base. But in marginal districts, particularly places that have voted Republican for years (like Alabama, for instance), that will squander an otherwise winnable district or state.\n\nWe can\u2019t be a one-size-fits-all party. I should point out that Doug Jones did not have a competitive primary, whereas the G.O.P. had exactly the ideological fight we need to avoid in marginal districts. It\u2019s the candidates we nominate in the primaries of 2018 that will determine how successful we are.\n\nBRUNI: Governor Patrick, but aren\u2019t the \u201cmeans\u201d really everything?

For example, Obamacare started out as a Republican idea, conceived by a right-leaning think tank and tried out (successfully) in Massachusetts. When President Obama proposed and passed it in Congress, it soon became clear that the only thing Republicans didn\u2019t like about it was the Obama part. Now they want to fuss about alternatives, including Medicare for All or even a Medicare option in the marketplace. But they have yet to propose any idea to ensure health care for everybody.

And that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong.\n\nBRUNI: As a member of the (very populous) camp of Americans who believe that President Trump is a great danger to us and that we desperately need him to be checked by at least one chamber of Congress in Democratic control, I have to admit that I\u2019m spooked by some of what I\u2019ve seen recently.

{"date": "2018-01-30 00:00:00", "text": "Bailenson is the director of the Virtual Human Interaction Lab at Stanford, and most of his book reads like a remarkably interesting report on the cool new experiments he\u2019s conducting. He\u2019s found that virtual reality can help people overcome PTSD, endure painful skin-grafting procedures and practice surgery. An early chapter deals with quarterbacks using the technology to go over what they might have missed during practice. And although his discussion of certain applications of V.R. can sometimes read like an advertisement, he gets what it\u2019s really good at, at least for the time being: creating pricey, immersive experiences that are planned in advance, either by capturing something live or by creating it.\n\nImage\n\nThe N.F.L. knows that the moment a quarterback gets the ball, a million things will happen over the next few seconds that can be caught by expensive cameras, and they made the bet that the cost of capturing those moments to train one person to be better at his job would be worth it. The other objective, committing the time and resources to build something immersive \u2014 say, underwater field trip experiences for children who would not otherwise have the chance to swim with sharks \u2014 needs more broad application to justify the currently steep price.\n\nBailenson defines V.R. as a scientific and cultural tool. He explores the idea of creating interactive stories \u2014 and even has words of advice for their would-be directors \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s first and foremost a scientist, testing hypotheses and proposing new therapies.\n\nLanier\u2019s book is, by contrast, intimate and idiosyncratic. He carries us through his quirky and fascinating life story, with periodic nerdy side trips through his early thinking on more technical aspects of virtual reality. If you liked Richard Feynman\u2019s autobiographical \u201cSurely You\u2019re Joking, Mr. Feynman\u201d but thought it was rather self-indulgent, this book will prompt similar reactions. You could almost say that Lanier\u2019s vivid and creative imagination is a distinct character in this book, he discusses it so much. Midway through, Feynman himself makes an appearance, and it seems as if we\u2019re meeting an old friend.\n\nLanier has been credited with inventing the term \u201cvirtual reality,\u201d and he founded one of the original companies to produce it, VPL Research. He goes over the technology\u2019s history in detail, outlining not only the obstacles to getting consistent hardware but some personalities and interpersonal conflicts that ultimately led to his company\u2019s breaking up. He also demonstrates the role personal connections and interactions play in Silicon Valley. This narrative illuminates the overlooked importance of women, referred to by Lanier as G.N.F.s, for Grand Networking Females, in making the connections and taking up the work essential to starting tech companies. For example, at the moment that Lanier was offered start-up funding and needed a corporate lawyer, a G.N.F. introduced him to the right people. Although Lanier goes out of his way to give credit to these women, I\u2019m left with that familiar sinking feeling that, although successful in their own right, they formed the social glue upon which all companies depended but never became as famous as the men they helped.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Lanier was a sought-after speaker in California, an enthusiastic supporter for theoretical, mind-bending experiences that technology would someday offer to audiences of blissed-out hippies. (Lanier discusses lots of drug use in the book but says he doesn\u2019t personally partake, \u201cnot even marijuana.\u201d) Two consequences of this early guru persona come out in the book: First, he offers dozens of different definitions of V.R. as a holistic force and cure-all. Second, he comes off as both a technically savvy inventor and a cult leader.", "title": "Enter the Holodeck", "authors": []}

M.L.S. and its owners counter that a plan like Wynalda\u2019s would crater the country\u2019s top division and waste the hundreds of millions of dollars they have invested in it since it began play in 1996.\n\nTo Wynalda, this misses the larger point.

He also speaks to the grievances of those in charge of the second-division North American Soccer League, many of whom believe U.S. Soccer has stymied them from legitimately competing with M.L.S.\n\nIn early January, responding to speculation that he did not have the resources to mount a campaign, Wynalda told Sports Illustrated that he had received financial support from Riccardo Silva. Silva owns Miami F.C. in the North American Soccer League and is one of U.S. Soccer\u2019s loudest antagonists. The N.A.S.L. has sued U.S. Soccer in federal court over its second-tier status. Miami F.C. has filed a claim at the Court of Arbitration for sport, arguing that FIFA\u2019s rules mandate the implementation of promotion and relegation. A victory potentially could be worth tens of millions of dollars to Silva, enabling his team to rise into the top division without paying an expansion fee.\n\n\u201cWe are very aligned with Mr. Silva and his belief system,\u201d Wynalda said, \u201cand he wants, clearly, to see change in this country.\u201d", "title": "Eric Wynalda Discusses His Financial Problems \u2014 and Everything Else", "authors": []}

They are the biggest potential investors in Iran and also have been fierce defenders of the nuclear deal that Mr. Rouhani supported against deep skepticism from the hard-liners and Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s statement, issued Tuesday night by the high representative for foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini, says that the deaths of demonstrators are \u201cinexcusable\u201d and calls on the Tehran government for restraint, while noting that Mr. Rouhani has said Iranians have the right to peaceful political protest.\n\nIt says that such rights are fundamental and \u201capply to every country, and Iran is no exception.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect all concerned to refrain from violence and the right of expression to be guaranteed, also in light of the statements made by the Iranian Government,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMs. Mogherini has been criticized for delay in making the statement, but the European Union works by consensus, and diplomats have been caught on holidays.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, was criticized for responding too blandly to the situation, but on Monday he also called for freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate peacefully to be respected, and said that the issues raised by the protesters were legitimate.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a telephone call with Mr. Rouhani on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron also asked for restraint and agreed to postpone a visit scheduled for this week by the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the German government issued a similar statement, urging the Iranian government to initiate talks with the protesters and respond proportionately.\n\n\u201cThe federal government considers it legitimate when people courageously protest their economic and political woes on the streets as is happening in Iran at the moment and they have our respect,\u201d said a government spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer.\n\nThe European Union and other signatory members, France, Britain and Germany, have regularly defended the Iran nuclear deal against American criticism and said Iran was in full compliance.\n\nThey have argued that the deal is only about the nuclear program, not other Iranian actions, some of which are already sanctioned. But Mr. Trump thinks the accord was too limited and did not do enough to constrain Iranian actions in other areas.\n\n\u201cIf the Iranian regime would use more violence to crack down, then I\u2019m sure the European Union would take a tougher stance,\u201d said Raz Zimmt, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at Tel Aviv University.\n\n\u201cBut for now the Iranian regime doesn\u2019t want to use too much force,\u201d fearing escalation inside the country and a harsher reaction outside, he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut he expressed skepticism that the European efforts to push Mr. Rouhani would significantly hasten economic reforms and civil liberties.\n\n\u201cI doubt that Rouhani will be able to do something significant without the approval of the supreme leader, and the supreme leader, as we all know, is quite concerned with any change in Iran,\u201d Mr. Zimmt said.\n\nThe European Union has also been firmly opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. European officials have been troubled also by a symbolic, nonbinding resolution by the Likud Party, led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank, across the green line that marks Israel\u2019s pre-1967 boundaries.", "title": "Europe Resists Trump\u2019s Call for Tougher Measures on Iran", "authors": ["Steven Erlanger"]}

But while the school is new, his program, Timbalooloo, is not: Mr. Etkin founded it in 2005 to teach jazz and world music to young children as a conversation among instruments.

The Queens organization Project Connect aims to bridge any generation gaps through lively movement, particularly the Lindy hop (named for Charles Lindbergh\u2019s historic trans-Atlantic flight). Its interactive show, free to children and teenagers, uses big-band music to recreate the mood of the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem in the 1920s-1940s as it follows the fate of Lillian Carlyle, an aspiring dancer.

Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez will begin this Queens appearance with an interactive workshop in which he\u2019ll teach participants how to work with this material, first on paper and then on a small light table.

A cartoonist and musician, Mr. Taylor creates songs and videos about Gustafer, who looks like an animated drop of butter and now resides in the colder climes of a rather fantastical version of Minnesota.

When the author and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats created his most famous character, Peter, in 1962, he helped change the face of children\u2019s books, literally and figuratively. Peter was black, and though he was a little boy, he was a huge pioneer. Now his adventures have been adapted by Jerome Hairston in this production, directed by Julia Beardsley O\u2019Brien and playing on Saturdays at 11 a.m. The show features four books about Peter: The first, the award-winning \u201cThe Snowy Day,\u201d which explores the boy\u2019s discovery of snow; \u201cWhistle for Willie,\u201d about his pet dachshund and learning a new skill; \u201cGoggles!,\u201d in which Peter and a friend encounter bullies; and \u201cA Letter to Amy,\u201d which centers on a first friendship with a girl.

{"date": "2018-01-04 00:00:00", "text": "There are lots of arresting details in the book. We learn that the administration holds special animus for what it calls \u201cD.O.J. women,\u201d or women who work in the Justice Department. Wolff writes that after the white supremacist mayhem in Charlottesville, Va., Trump privately rationalized \u201cwhy someone would be a member of the K.K.K.\u201d The book recounts that after the political purge in Saudi Arabia, Trump boasted that he and Kushner engineered a coup: \u201cWe\u2019ve put our man on top!\u201d\n\nBut most of all, the book confirms what is already widely understood \u2014 not just that Trump is entirely unfit for the presidency, but that everyone around him knows it. One thread running through \u201cFire and Fury\u201d is the way relatives, opportunists and officials try to manipulate and manage the president, and how they often fail. As Wolff wrote in a Hollywood Reporter essay based on the book, over the past year, the people around Trump, \u201call \u2014 100 percent \u2014 came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wolff, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, called Trump an \u201cidiot.\u201d (So did the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, owner of Fox News, though he used an obscenity first.) Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, compares his boss\u2019s intelligence to excrement. The national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, thinks he\u2019s a \u201cdope.\u201d It has already been reported that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a \u201cmoron,\u201d which he has pointedly refused to deny.\n\nAnd yet these people continue to either prop up or defend this sick travesty of a presidency. Wolff takes a few stabs at the motives of Trump insiders. Ivanka Trump apparently nurtured the ghastly dream of following her father into the presidency. Others, Wolff writes, told themselves that they could help protect America from the president they serve: The \u201cmess that might do serious damage to the nation, and, by association, to your own brand, might be transcended if you were seen as the person, by dint of competence and professional behavior, taking control of it.\u201d\n\nThis is a delusion as wild, in its own way, as Trump\u2019s claim that the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was faked. Some of the military men trying to steady American foreign policy amid Trump\u2019s whims and tantrums might be doing something quietly decent, sacrificing their reputations for the greater good. But most members of Trump\u2019s campaign and administration are simply traitors. They are willing, out of some complex mix of ambition, resentment, cynicism and rationalization, to endanger all of our lives \u2014 all of our children\u2019s lives \u2014 by refusing to tell the country what they know about the senescent fool who boasts of the size of his \u201cnuclear button\u201d on Twitter.\n\nMaybe, at the moment, people in the Trump orbit feel complacent because a year has passed without any epic disaster, unless you count an estimated 1,000 or so deaths in Puerto Rico, which they probably don\u2019t.

In that work, the researchers had allowed some lab mice to run and others to sit around for most of their adult lives. Gut material from the mice was then transplanted into animals that had been bred to be germ-free, so that their guts would easily incorporate these new tribes of bacteria. After the animals\u2019 microbiomes were established, the scientists exposed the mice to a substance that can cause tissue irritation and inflammation in the colon.\n\nThe scientists found that the animals with gut bugs from the runners were better able to resist and heal tissue damage and tamp down inflammation than those whose microbes had come from sedentary mice.\n\nNow the scientists wished to see if exercise would likewise affect the functioning of microbes in people.\n\nThey began by recruiting 32 men and women who did not exercise. About half were obese and the rest of normal weight.\n\nThe scientists took blood and fecal samples and tested everyone\u2019s aerobic fitness. Then they had the men and women begin supervised workouts, during which their efforts increased over time from about 30 minutes of easy walking or cycling to about an hour of vigorous jogging or pedaling three times per week.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The researchers also found changes in the operations of many microbes\u2019 genes. Some of those genes were working harder now, while others had grown silent.\n\nMost of these changes were not shared from one person to the next. Everyone\u2019s gut responded uniquely to exercise.\n\nBut there were some similarities, the researchers found. In particular, they noted widespread increases in certain microbes that can help to produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are believed to aid in reducing inflammation in the gut and the rest of the body. They also work to fight insulin resistance, a precursor to diabetes, and otherwise bolster our metabolisms.\n\nMost of the volunteers had larger concentrations of these short-chain fatty acids in their intestines after exercise, along with the microbes that produce them.\n\nThese increases were greatest, though, among the volunteers who had begun the experiment lean compared to those who were obese, the scientists found.\n\nAnd perhaps not surprisingly, almost all of the changes in people\u2019s guts dissipated after six weeks of not exercising. By and large, their microbiomes reverted to what they had been at the study\u2019s start.\n\nStill, the study\u2019s overall results suggest that even a few weeks of exercise can alter the makeup and function of people\u2019s microbiomes, says Jeffrey Woods, a professor of kinesiology and community health at the University of Illinois who conducted the study, along with his doctoral student Jacob Allen (now a postdoctoral researcher at Ohio State University) and others.\n\nIn theory, Dr. Woods continues, these changes could contribute to some of the broader health benefits of exercise, such as its ability to reduce inflammation throughout the body.\n\n\u201cBut more studies need to be done to prove this,\u201d he says.\n\nHe also hopes that future research can explain why the obese volunteers showed smaller gains in their fatty-acid producing microbes than the leaner men and women.

A single confessional blog post by Susan Fowler, a former employee of the ride-hailing company Uber, led to a swirling online campaign that eventually brought down Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s once indomitable chief executive \u2014 an outcome that, as far as I can tell, not a single observer of Uber predicted would happen long before it did.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that one-off stories cause huge cascades; it\u2019s that in a connected world, there are now so many one-off stories capable of setting off cascades, and no one knows which ones will hit.\n\nNote how Mr. Trump was not brought down by the series of sexual harassment claims against him during the presidential campaign \u2014 and yet just a few months later, claims against a host of other powerful men spiraled into a culture-shaping movement that has upended many parts of the economy.\n\nTo continue the butterfly-effect analogy: \u201cIt used to be that there were a trillion butterflies each in their own weather system, but we have now connected all those butterflies into one planetary weather system \u2014 and you never know which one is going to have some kind of autocatalytic effect, and which one isn\u2019t,\u201d said Alexander Rose, executive director of the Long Now Foundation, an organization that aims to promote a long-term outlook on the world.\n\nAs if all that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s another complication to fold into the chaos: Technology isn\u2019t stopping. The pace of technological change is in many cases too fast for anyone of us to comprehend or get used to; as a result, just as the world seems to get its head around one new force unleashed by tech, another comes along to discombobulate our efforts to respond to it.\n\nFor example, in the last year and a half, social networks have tried several ways to tamp down the misinformation flowing online. Their efforts have been fitful at best, but already they risk being outdated. Soon artificial intelligence and augmented reality software will make it trivially easy to create not just text-based misinformation but entirely fake audio and video, too.\n\nLast year, researchers at the University of Washington used A.I. to scan through footage of Barack Obama speaking, giving them a way to put just about any words into the former president\u2019s mouth. Someone else thought up a more vulgar way to show off similar tech \u2014 a fake pornographic video of the actress Gal Gadot.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2018 election, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks have vowed to take on the kinds of misinformation and trolling that ran amok in 2016. But what if social media is hit with a wave of explosive, realistic-looking viral videos whose authenticity can\u2019t be confirmed? It\u2019s highly unlikely that the social networks, the news media or the political class will know how to respond to such a situation.\n\nMr. Rose pointed out that in the long span of human history, periods of turbulence aren\u2019t unusual; technological change often prompts social and political instability and unpredictability. What is unusual now is that many of us aren\u2019t used to this sort of chaos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 39, about to turn 40, and people like me who came of age in America in the \u201980s and \u201990s, we got used to a fairly predictable world,\u201d said Nate Silver, the founder of the data-news site FiveThirtyEight, whose uncannily accurate forecast of the 2012 presidential election while at The New York Times set off wide interest in data-based journalistic predictions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cSo I do think people are now realizing the world is less predictable than we thought it was,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cBut in some ways that\u2019s a return to normal.\u201d", "title": "Expect 2018 to Be More Sane?

He had worked quietly in the hopes of keeping the F.B.I. out of the president\u2019s cross hairs.\n\nSince taking over the F.B.I. about six months ago, Mr. Wray has had to defend the bureau against the president\u2019s broadsides.

In December, when Mr. Trump said the F.B.I.\u2019s standing was the \u201cworst in history\u201d and its reputation in \u201ctatters,\u201d Mr. Wray sent a message to the bureau\u2019s more than 35,000 agents and support staff saying that their professionalism and dedication were inspiring.\n\nStephanie Douglas, a former top F.B.I. executive, said Mr. Wray had to act on his concerns.\n\n\u201cHis role as the F.B.I. director is about credibility,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s obligated by his role to speak the truth.

Mr. Mueller removed Mr. Strzok from his team over the summer after learning that the two had exchanged texts expressing a dislike of Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Republican memo, which was written by Mr. Nunes\u2019s staff, is said to claim that the F.B.I. abused its powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, to spy on the Trump campaign. Democrats did not know it existed until a committee meeting last week, during which its members voted along party lines to share it with the rest of the House.\n\nRepublicans, conservative commentators and social media accounts linked to Russian influence networks immediately began calling for the memo\u2019s public release, portraying it as revealing a major scandal. Committee Republicans are reportedly weighing whether to invoke an obscure House rule to make public classified materials.\n\nPeople familiar with the memo said it centers on a fall 2016 application for a FISA warrant targeting Carter Page, a onetime member of the Trump presidential campaign who had recently visited Russia. The memo is said to stress that the application used information from a former British intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, without adequately explaining to the judge that his research was financed by Democrats.\n\nBut people familiar with the underlying application have portrayed the Republican memo as misleading in part because Mr. Steele\u2019s information, which was also compiled into a notorious dossier, was insufficient to meet the standard for a FISA warrant. The application, they said, drew on other intelligence that the Republican memo misleadingly omits \u2014 but revealing that other information to rebut the memo would risk blowing other sources and methods of intelligence-gathering about Russia.\n\nThe Justice Department is \u201cunaware of any wrongdoing relating to the FISA process,\u201d Mr. Boyd wrote.

It later emerged that Mr. Nunes had learned that from Mr. Trump\u2019s aides at the White House, and other Republicans concluded that there had been no improper unmasking.\n\nMr. Schiff said that Democrats would ask the committee on Monday to make their rival memo available to the House on the same terms as the Republican memo, and that if the president declassified the Republican document, he should do the same for the Democratic version.

Since 1998, the World Cup has included 32 teams. FIFA has reminded Morocco specifically about its bidding rules, according to a person with direct knowledge of those discussions.\n\nAt a meeting last week with journalists in London, officials from the United States, Canada and Mexico said they had no plans for new development programs ahead of the meeting on June 13 when FIFA\u2019s member nations will vote on the location of the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\u201cAll three of us have done that in the past for years,\u201d said U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati, referring to soccer development programs. \u201cWe are not starting any new ones between last year and now.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe previous World Cup selection process, held in 2010, was so tarnished with allegations of vote-trading that FIFA was forced to change the procedure. For the first time, its entire membership will get to vote on the host; in the past, that choice had been reserved for its 24-member executive board. More than the half the members of that group in 2010 were later implicated in the wrongdoing during the process, which led to Russia\u2019s hosting the 2018 tournament, and Qatar\u2019s victory in the bidding for the 2022 event.\n\nNorth American soccer leaders had hoped to avoid a bidding competition altogether by lobbying to expedite the selection process, but FIFA last year rejected a request to review the North American bid \u2014 widely seen as the heavy favorite to win \u2014 before opening up the competition. That opened a pathway for Morocco to enter the race for the fifth time. The North African country lost to a United States bid in 1994 and also failed to secure the event in 1998, 2006 and 2010. Details produced by American investigators in a 2015 corruption indictment revealed Morocco had tried to bribe voters in two of those races.\n\nSeveral African soccer leaders, including the regional soccer president Ahmad Ahmad, have given their public backing to Morocco\u2019s bid for 2026. The 54-member continental bloc is expected to vote next week on whether to endorse the bid. Such a move also could violate FIFA guidelines, according to Ms. Samoura\u2019s letter.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The organization has been bleeding cash as a result of the United States corruption inquiry and related legal matters. FIFA\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, is also trying to make good on a 2016 campaign pledge to quadruple development funding to soccer\u2019s 211 member associations.\n\nAn expanded World Cup in North America would smash revenue and attendance records. The 1994 tournament sold more tickets than any other before or since, even though it involved only 24 teams, and thus had fewer matches.\n\n\u201cFIFA\u2019s finances are heavily, heavily dependent on one event, the men\u2019s World Cup,\u201d said Mr. Gulati, the chairman of the North American bid. \u201cSo there\u2019s a direct line between funding for programs around the world and what happens at the World Cup, and the revenue that\u2019s generated.\u201d\n\nThe North American bid has a built-in financial advantage because of a broadcast agreement signed in 2015 between FIFA and the U.S.-based broadcasters Fox and Telemundo, who are televising the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The deal, the result of a no-bid contract extension that angered the companies\u2019 domestic rivals, included a $300 million escalator if the 2026 tournament is held in the United States. FIFA allowed those companies to extend their contracts to avoid litigation over its decision to move the 2022 World Cup in Qatar to December from its usual June-July calendar slot.\n\nMorocco\u2019s pitch is partly reliant on an argument that FIFA will be able to extract more revenue from European television companies because more games will be shown in prime time in some of soccer\u2019s largest markets.\n\nFor the first time, FIFA will produce a score of the technical merits of each offer.

In 2005, speaking at Stanford, he described how he and a friend were \u201cseeing if we could use the information that we had to compute who we thought were going to be in relationships. So, we tested this about a week later, and we realized that we had over a third chance of predicting whether two people were going to be in a relationship a week from now.\u201d Through this deep knowledge of its users, Mr. Zuckerberg explained, Facebook could determine \u201cwhat actually matters to each person on a more granular level.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade later, Facebook is still using these social-engineering tools to probe its users\u2019 psyches.

Tab\u00e0rnia is something like Peter Pan\u2019s \u201cNeverland\u201d for the unionists, said Salvador Garcia Ruiz, the chief executive of Ara, a pro-independence newspaper.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe territorial tensions within Catalonia, he added, are manageable and comparable to those provoked by other heated political debates, like Britain\u2019s referendum on leaving the European Union or the election of President Trump in the United States. \u201cIn democratic countries, such differences are resolved at the ballot boxes,\u201d Mr. Garcia Ruiz said.\n\nTab\u00e0rnia\u2019s theoretical borders would contain two-thirds of Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million residents. Unlike the Catalan republic that Mr. Puigdemont and other separatists want, Tab\u00e0rnia would swear allegiance to the Spanish monarch, Felipe VI, while using its own flag and coat of arms.\n\nTab\u00e0rnia is a parody, but one that feeds into the debate raised by the Catalan independence movement over \u201cthe limits of the principle of self-determination,\u201d said Manuel Mu\u00f1iz, the dean of the school of international relations at IE University in Madrid.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe mock territory raises the issue of \u201cwho is to vote and when\u201d within a democratic system, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz said. \u201cAre regions the ones entitled to decide on their independence or would cities also qualify? Or should it be neighborhoods within cities?\u201d\n\nSimilar questions, Mr. Mu\u00f1iz said, could apply to \u201cScotland, London and other constituent parts of the U.K. once a slim majority of Brits took the decision to leave the E.U.\u201d\n\nPablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos, Spain\u2019s far-left party, recently criticized the promoters of Tab\u00e0rnia for fueling a \u201cwar of flags\u201d that he said helps neither Spaniards nor Catalans.\n\nBut Mr. L\u00f3pez Alegre, the spokesman, said the goal was never to fragment Catalonia itself, but instead to try to end what he sees as a disruptive chapter of Catalan secessionism.\n\nTab\u00e0rnia has its own flag and symbols. \u201cActa est fabula,\u201d the Latin saying for the \u201cplay is over,\u201d is the motto on its coat of arms.", "title": "Fake Country Carved From Catalonia Means to Mock Separatism", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"]}

Mr. Trump is, after all, a president who loves branding of all kinds, is obsessed with image and visual messaging, has an alliterative way with a nickname and whose occasionally garbled use of language (remember covfefe?) has become part of the national lexicon in a way that practically begs a coffee cup.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe flurry has all picked up steam since the presidential campaign, which included fashion statement making and symbolism on both sides: women who dressed up in pantsuits or suffragist white to support Hillary Clinton, and Mr. Trump and his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d red baseball cap.

{"date": "2018-01-27 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nThe world of social media has become a de facto public square. Much of our politics and business is conducted there, yet it remains in many ways a kind of Wild West. Today\u2019s report is one of the first to shed light on the machinations taking place in the shadows: a sketchy digital economy where fake accounts known as bots, some modeled on real users, are bought and sold \u2014 the lifeblood of a booming trade in influence and deception.\n\nThe investigation began last March, when Gabriel Dance, a deputy investigations editor at The Times, ran into an old friend, Mark Hansen, at a conference. Mr. Hansen, the director of the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, had been studying the use of bots on social media. He mentioned that Devumi, a company selling social media followers to users hoping to increase their influence (or manufacture its appearance), seemed to be using bots with information, pictures and biographies taken from real users. (Selling followers is ostensibly a violation of the rules of most social media platforms \u2014 Twitter forbids buying followers, retweets or likes, for instance.)\n\nThe Times investigative team was already exploring social media manipulation, \u201cpartly because of the Russia investigation, and reporting into firms like Cambridge Analytica,\u201d said Nicholas Confessore, a reporter for the team, referring to a data company that worked for Donald J. Trump during the presidential campaign and is now under congressional scrutiny. \u201cWe were looking for a way into describing the economy of false influence on social media.\u201d Devumi would be an exemplar of how that economy worked.\n\nTo begin untangling Devumi\u2019s bots from real Twitter users, the Times team purchased tens of thousands of bot followers, including from Devumi itself (25,000 at a cost of $225). The team could then analyze the overlaps in whom the bots were following \u2014 a group so wildly disparate and geographically diverse that there was little chance so many humans were following them all \u2014 and thus begin to track which users were probably paying for them. Combing through those users\u2019 followers led to still more bots, who led the team to yet more users. The result, Mr. Confessore said, was a \u201cworld of fake accounts that were interconnected.\u201d Millions of them.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOn an account-by-account basis, it can be very difficult to tell if something\u2019s a bot,\u201d Mr. Dance said. \u201cSome things are just weird. There are weird people.\u201d On the aggregate, however, certain tellingly inorganic patterns become apparent. So Mr. Hansen of Columbia University, along with the graphics editor Richard Harris and Jeremy Ashkenas, formerly of The Times, developed software that would pull data from Twitter that the team could then analyze. Thousands of accounts all simultaneously deciding to follow the same real Twitter user, for example, was \u201ca very strong indicator of centralized control,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cAnd so we had this process that we called fingerprinting, which allowed us to pretty easily look at someone\u2019s Twitter account and determine whether they had artificial followers or not.\u201d", "title": "Faked: The Headquarters.

N.F.L. rules explicitly state that a teammate may not lift a ball carrier to continue his forward progress, but the penalty is rarely called, and the Rams did not challenge the touchdown.\n\nColeman added 40 yards as the Falcons combined for 39 carries for 124 yards. That helped set up plenty of opportunities for Jones, who had nine catches for 94 yards. It was a rare red-zone touchdown by Jones in the fourth quarter that iced the victory.\n\nThe loss by the Rams ended a remarkable turnaround year in which the team improved by seven wins from last season, while its offense went from the worst in the N.F.L. to the most potent.\n\nThere were flashes of that offensive brilliance on Saturday night, with quarterback Jared Goff having a strong game after a silent first quarter. Todd Gurley II, who led the N.F.L. in yards from scrimmage, averaged 7.2 yards a carry on his way to 101 rushing yards, and receivers Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp had their share of highlight-reel plays.\n\nBut the Falcons, who had preceded the Rams as the league\u2019s top-scoring team, had more to offer on both sides of the ball, and they will move on to face the top-seeded Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe ghosts of the Super Bowl collapse could hardly be exorcised by one playoff win, but the perseverance the Falcons showed in Los Angeles should give them something to build on.", "title": "Falcons Hang On Against the Rams for a Tough Playoff Win", "authors": ["Benjamin Hoffman"]}

The United States has been the world leader in these categories for so long that we have stopped believing it could be any other way. But other nations, seeing us lose focus, are seizing the chance to rise.\n\nScientific and technological leadership doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It results from an open political and competitive economic system, from a commitment to recruit and train top talent from all social and economic levels, and from sustained investment. Since World War II, federal investment in research has been a key to keeping the United States at the forefront. Federal dollars have enabled scientists and engineers to investigate advanced ideas and the most unlikely technical solutions, to develop new knowledge before it\u2019s clear whether it will be profitable. That new knowledge has revolutionized health care, spawned new businesses and created the digital world. As President Ronald Reagan put it, \u201calthough basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cone of the most practical things government does.\u201d\n\nOther nations understand this and are aggressively challenging our lead by trying to copy the United States model. They are making scientific investment a priority and are pushing for partnerships between government, universities and industry.\n\nChina is the clearest example. Since 2000, China\u2019s spending on research and development has grown by an average of 18 percent each year, while ours grew by only 4 percent. This has placed China a decisive second in R & D expenditures behind the United States, where the government and private sector together invest far more than any other country. Even so, the share of R & D funded by the federal government declined to about 25 percent from just over 30 percent from 2010 to 2015.", "title": "Opinion | Falling Short on Science", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-01-13 00:00:00", "text": "Now, as he tries to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons capability and ensure that Iran never acquires one, Mr. Trump is poised to make public a new policy that commits America to an increasing investment in those very weapons, according to a draft document made public by HuffPost and confirmed by The Times.\n\nA major departure in the new policy is the plan to build new low-yield nuclear weapons. The rationale is that most modern weapons are so powerful that no one believes they will ever be used, so lower-explosive warheads are needed to maintain an effective deterrent. This logic is insane.\n\nThe United States already has immense nuclear and conventional capabilities, and experts say there is no evidence these so-called more usable low-yield nuclear weapons will force adversaries to behave better. Enlarging the United States arsenal will certainly lead other countries to seek equivalent arsenals of their own, while also raising the odds that weapons fall into terrorists\u2019 hands and heightening the risk of accidental war. Investing huge sums this way is also unlikely to protect us from tomorrow\u2019s threats.\n\nThe administration, however, would have us believe that America is falling behind in military capability. Mr. Trump was compelled to act, the document argues, primarily because of Russia\u2019s \u201cunabashed return to Great Power competition,\u201d including modernization of its nuclear weaponry. Russia is unquestionably a growing problem that needs to be confronted, but that\u2019s a cynical rationale for a president who so far has refused to acknowledge the Kremlin\u2019s interference in the 2016 election or its threat more generally to Western democracies.\n\nMaking matters worse, Mr. Trump, in a separate decision on Friday, continued to put the 2015 deal that froze Iran\u2019s nuclear program in jeopardy. The president warned European allies that they must agree to overhaul the deal in 120 days, or he would withdraw the United States from it. Although he again stopped short of reimposing sanctions, his demands would effectively require renegotiating the deal, something the other parties to the agreement have refused to do.", "title": "Opinion | False Alarm Adds to Real Alarm About Trump\u2019s Nuclear Risk", "authors": []}

Emergency alerts are still broadcast via TV, radio and air siren, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nPhoto\n\nArriving with distinct ringtones and vibrations, the wireless alerts resemble text messages when they pop up on cellphone screens, but they rely on different technology. All wireless carriers participate in the system, and Hawaii\u2019s emergency agency is among hundreds of federal, state, local, tribal and territorial authorities with the power to use them, according to FEMA.\n\nThere are three types of wireless alerts: those issued by the president; those involving imminent threats to safety or life; and Amber Alerts for missing children. More than 30,000 alerts have been sent since the system\u2019s introduction, according to the communications commission. In 2016, law enforcement officials in New York used the system to circulate a kind of digital wanted poster in hunting for a man wanted in bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey. The alerts are free; consumers can use their phone settings to opt out of getting all but those sent by the president.\n\nThe system has come under growing scrutiny in recent months, with public safety officials complaining that it requires upgrades on several fronts. Critics say alerts are often sent too widely, sowing fear among people unlikely to be affected by the threat in question. There have also been calls for the alerts to be sent in languages other than English.

Blair, a nuclear security expert and a research scholar at the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, said he immediately suspected that the alert was false because it involved such a significant national security threat that was directed solely at Hawaii.\n\nIf there had been a missile fired toward the United States, military and intelligence officials would have first notified the president, who would have then decided whether to issue a national emergency alert, he said, although he added that it was reasonable to believe that Hawaii, given its proximity to North Korea, would be on heightened alert.\n\nStill, Mr. Blair said, the episode did expose a potential system flaw that has significant implications.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis a system that is hackable and prone to human and technical error.\u201d", "title": "False Missile Warning in Hawaii Adds to Scrutiny of Emergency Alert System", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang"]}

{"date": "2018-01-26 00:00:00", "text": "Kamilla Benko\u2019s debut, \u201cThe Unicorn Quest,\u201d another first-in-series novel, sneaks a tribalism parable into a Narnia-esque story structure. The book begins with two sisters, Claire and Sophie, exploring the eerie old mansion of their recently deceased great-aunt, so you know it\u2019s only a matter of time before they discover a portal to another world.\n\nThe fantasy kingdom of Arden is a place where magic is intrinsically tied to art, but rather than its citizens finding unity in their shared abilities, they have segregated themselves, geographically and culturally, into four different mini-nations: Forgers (who sculpt mystical metals), Spinners (who can weave threads into man-eating carpets and such), Tillers (who would all score an A+ on a Hogwarts herbology exam) and Gemmers (who have power over rocks and jewels). And it\u2019s more extreme than just Blue State-Red State rancor. The Ardenites are hard core about these divisions: One young character\u2019s father was executed because of her parents\u2019 mixed marriage. Some of the groups will grudgingly do business with one another, but for the most part, Arden is isolationism run amok. And no group is more universally reviled than the Gemmers, the former ruling class who infamously committed atrocities against their own people. When one character discovers ancestors in the Gemmer bloodline, the reaction has the horror of a progressive activist who learns there are slave owners in his family tree.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIt\u2019s the appearance of Claire and Sophie that serves as a catalyst for change in Arden. When the girls uncover a dangerous conspiracy, it will once again take members from different magical guilds to unite as a team and prevent the resurrection of a legendary queen. (Different queen, this time \u2014 no ants.) Benko does a stellar job of painting Arden for the reader (the battlements on a castle are \u201ccut like jack-o\u2019-lantern teeth,\u201d for instance) and clearly delineates the distinct cultural elements of the different guilds, like the smoke-scented streets of a Forger town and the vine-coated walls of a Tiller home. Also clear is how much more wonderful this world would be if these cultures were ever allowed to mingle.\n\nThe true heart of this book, though, is the relationship between Sophie and Claire. Sophie, the older and bolder of the two sisters, has recently recovered from a mysterious illness and lengthy hospital stay, leaving Claire to both hero-worship her older sibling and fret about her like a helicopter parent. And when the sisters find themselves separated, it is Claire\u2019s dedication to and need for her older sibling that drives her on her quest.\n\nRather than pitting groups against one another, Catherine Gilbert Murdock (\u201cDairy Queen,\u201d \u201cPrincess Ben\u201d) presents an anti-discrimination tale with a much more individual focus in her Dark Ages fable, \u201cThe Book of Boy.\u201d The central character, known only as Boy, lives a life harder than most, which is saying a lot, since the story is set during the Black Death. In addition to all the standard hardships you\u2019d expect for an impoverished medieval orphan, Boy must also endure being the constant target of rage, ridicule and fear. Terms like \u201cthing,\u201d \u201cfiend,\u201d \u201cmonster\u201d and \u201chunchback\u201d are thrown at him regularly. Saddest of all, Boy takes these insults to heart. Despite the sweetness and selflessness that is so obvious to the reader, Boy thinks of himself as a mistake \u2014 something made \u201cwrong\u201d \u2014 and wishes for nothing more than to be a \u201creal boy.\u201d\n\nThen along comes Secundus, an ersatz pilgrim with a mysterious past who recruits the na\u00efve and overly trusting Boy to assist him in liberating (i.e., \u201cstealing\u201d) holy relics so he can use them as a bargaining chip to get into heaven. (The book is firmly rooted in Christian lore.) Secundus is the first person to recognize that there\u2019s more to Boy than the hump between his shoulders \u2014 like preternatural agility and the apparent ability to communicate with animals. The adventure the two embark on features thrilling chases, many comic observations from Boy (a sheep, for instance, described as a \u201cwet, smelly cloud\u201d), and more fart references than one might expect in a religious allegory. And the climactic revelation of Boy\u2019s true nature is a genuinely surprising twist.\n\nBut \u201cThe Book of Boy\u201d runs into pitfalls. Readers who feel bullied or excluded for being \u201cdifferent\u201d may heavily invest in Boy\u2019s internal debate over whether to hide his true self. This goes double for kids with disabilities or those who are gender nonconforming, as those are two specific points about which Boy is taunted. Unfortunately, the artistically ambiguous ending gives no explicit answer to the question. While Boy ultimately learns to love himself for who he is, we never quite get the assurance that anyone else in his cruel world will. Will Boy have to be content with a future in which he can be his real self only in private? It\u2019s open to interpretation. Yet surely many kids could benefit from having this answer spelled out for them. Perhaps the main lesson here is to remember that one person\u2019s uplifting finale can be a major downer to someone else.", "title": "Fantasies for Young Readers, With an Eye on Today\u2019s Fears and Divisions", "authors": ["Christopher Healy", "Children S Books"]}

I think the thing that worries me here is that a software patch to fix Meltdown could result in slowing your computer down by as much as 30 percent, which is nuts! Can you imagine how long it will take me to tweet insults at you after that?\n\nAnd as for Spectre, fixing the issue could actually require redesigning how computer chips are built. This whole thing has the big tech companies freaked out, from chip makers like AMD and Intel to software giants like Google and Microsoft. And honestly, they should be. People should probably be more worried about this than they appear to be, but it\u2019s difficult to convey a sense of urgency about complicated technical issues when the president of the United States is tweeting about the possibility of nuclear war.\n\nSocial Media Is Still Wild\n\nMike: And that might not even be the weirdest thing on the internet this week. Social media superstar Logan Paul stepped in it big time, posting a video of himself stumbling upon a person who had killed themselves in Japan\u2019s \u201cSuicide Forest.\u201d His discovery was an accident, but the posting and presentation \u2014 he and his entourage treated the whole thing as a kind of a thrilling spectacle \u2014 were entirely Mr. Paul\u2019s choices, and they were terrible. The internet rightly flew into an outrage almost immediately after he posted the video to YouTube, and eventually Mr. Paul pulled down the clip and apologized to his fans and the dead man\u2019s family.\n\nFarhad: Oh, that\u2019s interesting, Mike, but before you go any further let me just ask one small thing: Who? Logan Paul? I\u2019ve never heard of him and I\u2019m certainly not a subscriber to every one of his channels, definitely not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMike: Er, O.K. But seriously, the whole thing really sours me on the internet and vlogging culture writ large. To me, it\u2019s a prime example of how social media stars and lifestyle bloggers seem to lose perspective on what\u2019s appropriate to share. When your entire success is based on capturing every moment of your daily life, it might be more difficult to step back and say, \u201cHey, maybe sharing this would be completely insensitive?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more worrisome is that this sharing culture seems to be fast becoming normalized and ubiquitous, advanced by the many tools we have at our disposal to put more of ourselves online. Even slayings and suicides have been live streamed. And the ability to attach these things to massive social networks means everyone has a built-in, captive audience.\n\nIn short, Black Mirror isn\u2019t so much a satire anymore \u2014 it\u2019s basically a reality show.\n\nFarhad: I think this story presents a growing issue for YouTube. If 2017 was the year that everyone noticed the dangers of Facebook \u2014 prompting Mark Zuckerberg to announce that he\u2019s spending this year trying to fix the platform \u2014 I suspect our attention will now increasingly shift to YouTube.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming the world\u2019s biggest platform for information, its influence surpassing even Facebook\u2019s. How YouTube polices itself \u2014 how it\u2019s aiming to improve the place, and the backlash its efforts generate \u2014 is probably going to be one of the bigger stories of the year, I\u2019d guess.\n\nBut that\u2019s too heavy for the new year.

The company has lately been trying to crack down on abusive accounts. So some people on Twitter started to wonder, would the company possibly decide that Mr. Trump had crossed the line?\n\nOh, no, not at all. On Monday, Twitter said the tweets of world leaders got special deference from the company; world leaders can now essentially say anything on Twitter. \u201cBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,\u201d it said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

And I saw some good arguments for allowing the president to stay on Twitter. As Will Oremus at Slate argued, barring Mr. Trump from the site is a \u201cmisguided fantasy\u201d that wouldn\u2019t really stop the underlying problem of his saying things that many people consider outrageous.\n\nStill, I do think there\u2019s something to the argument that Twitter \u2014 by its very nature a platform meant for people to yell things at the news, usually without nuance \u2014 encourages the sort of reflexive communication that we probably don\u2019t want in our world leaders.\n\nSure, if Twitter barred him, he could always just go on TV and say what he had planned to tweet. But that would be slower and less automatic, and perhaps \u2014 I\u2019m going out on a limb here \u2014 he might not blurt out threats of nuclear war.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nComputer Security Is a Mess, Almost by Design\n\nWe\u2019re still seeing fallout from Meltdown and Spectre, the two big computer chip flaws that were announced last week. Intel said this week that its fixes for the two flaws would slow computers down by single-digit percentages; the exact performance hit depends on what you\u2019re doing on your machine.\n\nThis is a small slowdown, but it\u2019s not insignificant. After all, people buy new computers for speed, so being hit with a slowdown after you\u2019ve already purchased the thing is going to make lots of customers seethe.\n\nThere\u2019s a bigger story here: When technology is found to be insecure, many companies evade any great degree of responsibility for the problems. As Nathaniel Fick, chief executive of the security company Endgame, wrote in The Times, \u201cCybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the Enron scandal.\u201d There are few lasting repercussions for flaws, and after a time everything goes back to normal. Equifax, for example, has already partly recovered after its massive breach.\n\nUnless the government steps in with stricter penalties, this system seems headed for catastrophe. Everything is interconnected now; it\u2019s only a matter of time until there\u2019s a hack big enough to cause widespread social and economic disruption. We should probably do something about that, maybe?\n\nBig Changes to the News Feed\n\nFinally, in a late-breaking update, Facebook said on Thursday that it would be making huge changes to make you feel less terrible about using the service. It\u2019s an unusual goal for a tech company \u2014 Facebook plans to alter its News Feed to increase your interactions with friends and family and reduce how many posts you see from brands and publishers, all in an attempt to make the service more \u201cmeaningful\u201d for users.\n\nThe move could have wide repercussions for media outlets \u2014 which depend on Facebook for traffic \u2014 and potentially for Facebook\u2019s own bottom line. But as with all Facebook product changes, it will probably be months before we know how the move plays out. One thing is for sure: Initially, you\u2019re bound to hate it, because that\u2019s just how it goes with anything new online.\n\nO.K., that\u2019s it for now.

U.S. Amazon!\n\nOne thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale \u2014 the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don\u2019t make for great optics. There\u2019s a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites.\n\nWell, they want you to know they aren\u2019t.\n\nAmazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday, the company announced the 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There\u2019s one city in Canada \u2014 Toronto \u2014 and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there\u2019s oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win.\n\nMeanwhile, in its own very well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money \u2014 the largest tax bill ever paid \u2014 and invest billions in new facilities and people in the United States. The company is also giving many of its employees a $2,500 bonus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nApple\u2019s announcement made Trump very happy. And the president\u2019s victory lap is, I think, somewhat deserved. Trump and the tech industry have not had the warmest relationship, but it\u2019s clear that his campaign \u2014 in which he constantly harangued Apple and Amazon for perceived slights \u2014 has shaken the industry from its presumption that everyone in the country loves it.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

Now that there\u2019s just so much stuff on Netflix \u2014 so many comedies, so many dramas, so many dumb movies, so many smart movies \u2014 it has become not just another premium cable channel but something like a replacement for TV itself. In other words, it\u2019s indispensable. You can expect to keep paying for it forever.\n\nA Smart, if Tardy, Speaker\n\nRemember HomePod? Probably not. Last summer, Apple unveiled a smart speaker inspired by Amazon\u2019s Echo and Google\u2019s Home, because it is apparently the rule in the tech industry that if one big company does something, every other company has to do it, too. Think Same.\n\nThen, nothing.\n\nA new Apple device is usually a Big Deal event, one of those campaigns that Apple rolls out with the precision of a military conquest. But nobody heard anything more about the HomePod until late November, when Apple announced that the timing had slipped and that HomePod wouldn\u2019t come until after the holidays.\n\nIt was a crucial miss \u2014 the Echo seems to have had a gangbusters holiday, with Amazon expanding its head start in the category by probably tens of millions of devices.

Apple announced this week that HomePod was back in action \u2014 available to order on Friday, and in stores starting Feb. 9.\n\nIt\u2019s still an odd announcement; Apple provided only a short demo of the device in June, so people brave enough to order will be going in blind. But you count Apple out in the hardware business at your peril. It will be fun to see what happens here.\n\nDemocrats vs. Silicon Valley\n\nMy colleagues Cecilia Kang and Daisuke Wakabayashi had an interesting article this week about the growing tensions between the tech industry and the Democratic Party. Democrats and techies have long been reliable allies \u2014 techies donate tons of money, and Democratic candidates get to show off their association with widely admired visionaries of the future.\n\nThat\u2019s past. Now that the tech industry has become more a cause of national angst and confusion rather than of wondrous gadgets and money, Democrats are being called on to police the business more stringently. Lefty activists want antitrust investigations of big tech companies and regulations on political advertising \u2014 a generally more combative relationship between the government and the pursuits of business.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s another side to this story, too: While tech C.E.O.s have very publicly sparred with President Trump on a variety of issues, they\u2019re all enjoying a once-in-a-lifetime windfall of profits from the Republican tax plan. As rich people running wealthy companies, the tech industry\u2019s leaders have short-term corporate interests that are obviously very well served by the low-tax, low-regulation Republican Party.\n\nIt\u2019s an election year.

The New York City law, which was enacted in May and took effect in late November, is the first of its kind.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important about this law is it provides for a way for fast-food workers to help sustain a nonprofit organization that\u2019s dedicated to advocating for issues that members say is important to them,\u201d said Tsedeye Gebreselassie, chairwoman of Fast Food Justice\u2019s board and a senior staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project. For example, the group\u2019s leaders said many members were interested in pushing for reduced transit fares for low-wage workers.\n\nFast Food Justice\u2019s leaders say they hope to get 5,000 workers to contribute by the end of 2018, and 10,000 by the end of 2020. (New York City has about 65,000 fast-food workers.) Contributions from 5,000 workers would mean revenue of more than $800,000 a year.\n\nThe Restaurant Law Center\u2019s lawsuit asserts that the New York law and Fast Food Justice are merely mechanisms to help the service employees\u2019 union ultimately unionize fast-food restaurants. Its lawsuit also argues that the law should be overturned on the basis that the National Labor Relations Act already regulates labor organizations.\n\nFast Food Justice asserts that it is not the type of labor organization regulated by federal law. It also argues that the New York law doesn\u2019t violate restaurants\u2019 First Amendment rights because the money being forwarded belongs to the workers and not the restaurants. But the Restaurant Law Center says even having to process the payments violates employers\u2019 free-speech rights.\n\nEven though LaShawn Herbert said her employer, Shake Shack, treats her well, she is a strong backer of the Fight for $15 and Fast Food Justice.

Everyone who doesn\u2019t get their news from Fox has basically known this for a while, although Wolff helps focus our minds on the subject.\n\nIt seems to me that that the real news now is the way Republicans in Congress are dealing with this national nightmare: rather than distancing themselves from Trump, they\u2019re doubling down on their support and, in particular, on their efforts to cover for his defects and crimes.

A visitor to eastern Oregon would find country covered in sagebrush and juniper, hills painted with belts of ocher, orange, brick-red sand, Mars-like pillars formed by waterfalls and volcanic sludge, glacial lakes, volcanic uplifts, ancient seabeds and between all this, small human settlements: wheat fields, alfalfa farms and cattle ranches. The geographer Paul Starrs writes about the photograph in his essay \u201cAn Inescapable Range, or the Ranch as Everywhere.\u201d \u201cThe dark space is ranching,\u201d he says. \u201cRanching\u2019s realm is really, then, definable as being where most people are absent.\u201d\n\nI thought about this photograph when I first returned and began speaking with the people. After only a few generations living here, what made them feel the land so completely belonged to them?\n\nRobin Olson told me that a lot of the region\u2019s thinking about politics in the West originated from a publication called Range magazine. \u201cWhat you will find,\u201d she told me, \u201cis that it was never about the sage grouse, never about the spotted owl and never about the wolf. It was about getting people off the land.\u201d I asked Robin about the sage grouse, whose population had plummeted from 16 million to a few hundred thousand, and she told me, \u201cI don\u2019t think they are really endangered.\u201d The sage grouse \u201cjust happened to live in almost every Western state\u201d and that\u2019s why \u201cthe government chose it.\u201d\n\nRange could be found in almost every grocery and tack store in rural Oregon. The glossy quarterly claims a readership of around 170,000, half of them ranchers and farmers in the rural West. Range, its website says, is \u201cdevoted to the issues that threaten the West, its people, lands and wildlife,\u201d and it intends to \u201chalt the depletion of a natural resource, the American cowboy.\u201d In an article from 2012, the Endangered Species Act and the spotted owl are described as tools \u201cused by radical environmentalists and government agents to destroy the timber industry in the 1990s.\u201d The publication calls Rachel Carson\u2019s \u201cSilent Spring\u201d a work of liberal propaganda. It is critical of the concept of global warming and suggests the real concern is global cooling. The magazine published features on the Malheur occupation and articles supporting the Bundys\u2019 fight against the federal control of Western land.\n\nIn many ways, it seemed, the people were constructing their ideas of the land upon a fantasy of the past. In the 2003 book \u201cWhere Land and Water Meet: A Western Landscape Transformed,\u201d Nancy Langston, an environmental historian, writes about how each wave of white settlers to the Malheur ignored the history preceding their own. When Peter French first arrived in 1872, Langston writes, \u201cthe place had seemed nearly empty to him, and indeed it was this apparent emptiness that made the watershed such a fine place to establish an empire.\u201d Of course, the land was not empty at all, but belonged to the Paiute Indian tribe, which had been living in the region for at least 13,000 years. In the decades after the land was designated a wildlife refuge in 1908, under the orders of President Theodore Roosevelt, conservationists built dikes, storage dams, canals, ditches and channels, and sprayed rotenone, an aquatic poison, to kill invasive carp. All these manipulations were done to make the Malheur seem wild again, the way it was before white settlers arrived.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the 1970s, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act shifted the focus of the Bureau of Land Management from resource extraction to conservation. The policy marked the beginning of the Sagebrush Rebellion, a grass-roots revolt among ranchers, loggers and miners against environmental laws, like the 1964 Wilderness Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Rural communities believed these new restrictions and regulations undermined their prosperity and shifted the fate of small-town economies into the hands of the federal government. If an endangered species lived on the range, for example, the bureau could decide to cut cattle numbers. Such protections fueled theories that the government was trying to eliminate ranchers to control the land.\n\nThe history of Oregon is filled with stories of violent and racist groups. Communes, cults, alternative religious communities, militias: The state has been home to nearly 300 of them since 1856, including the Christian Identity movement, Posse Comitatus, Aryan Nations and the Roy Masters\u2019 Foundation of Human Understanding. African-Americans were legally barred from residence in Oregon until 1926; the state, according to some historians, was essentially founded as a kind of white utopia. No one in my family, three generations of Oregonians, had ever heard about that.\n\nWhen my mother revised her understanding of the past, her romance with the West came to an end. A few years ago, she decided to start using the word \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe the fate of the American Indians at the hands of white settlers. My grandparents had been involved in cults and fringe religious groups, and my mother and father attended past-life readings. One day she handed me a stack of these readings. On these pages was a story scribbled in the curvy cursive loops of the religious leader who told my mother that she had once been a brave pioneer on the edge of the Western frontier defending hard-won land from the onslaught of Indians.\n\nFor many years, my family made it a habit to drive out to places like the Malheur and other remote areas. We carried rock picks. We found artifacts and fossils in the cracked mud of dry lake beds. We searched behind the high school baseball diamond in Fossil for the imprints of ancient ferns and crawled through buildings abandoned by the cult of the Rajneeshee. We saw arrowheads scattered on land where scientists uncovered the bones of ice-age sloths. We dug up an agatized root and dragged it home. We slept under the stars or in a trailer my father sometimes hitched to the truck. My mother filled my backpack with survival gear, and my father always carried a loaded gun. We cut down trees where we saw one; built a fire where we wanted one; slept on the ground in the valleys, among the sagebrush, near Indian burial sites. The eastern Oregon desert felt like a world that belonged to me. I felt antipathy toward visitors; even a lone hiker on the trail felt like a disturbance. In these moments, I figured that I, too, had arrived to an empty place. The rest of the world, the rest of America, were distant news.\n\nIf you drive two hours south of John Day on Route 395, you\u2019ll pass 1.7 million acres of Malheur National Forest, and end up in Burns, a town of a few thousand people. Outside Burns, on an old ice-age lake bed, is the ranch of Joe Cronin. In the spring, Cronin\u2019s ranch fills with birds from the neighboring Malheur National Wildlife Refuge: great egrets, trumpeter swans, black crowned night herons.\n\nAt 7 a.m. one day last January, there were more tractors on the road than cars. Cattle huddled in the snow-covered fields. I drove beneath a wood ranch gate, fitted with steer horns, and Cronin stepped out of his house to greet me in the driveway. He was a blue-eyed, 68-year-old, with a white goatee, wearing a plaid Elmer Fudd hat, baggy bluejeans and a mossy-oak camo coat with matching gaiters. His wife, Gay, made coffee in the kitchen, and their son Dirk loaded frozen hay bales onto a tractor bed. This was Cronin\u2019s \u201chome ranch,\u201d where he housed his cattle in the winter and provided shelter for their newborns. In the spring, he gathered the cattle in trailers the size of semis and hauled them north, into the Malheur National Forest, where he owned 320 acres of land. He also had a permit that allowed him to graze his cattle for five and a half months of the year, usually June to October, on lands in the Malheur managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Every year he and Gay attended a required meeting to discuss the terms of their permit. Usually, the Forest Service decided how many cattle he could let out on the range and for how long. If an endangered species lived on the federal land, the terms of the permit were subject to change.\n\nCronin told me that he wasn\u2019t at the Meeting That NEVER Happened because he was advised by his lawyer not to attend. He called the Bundy takeover of the refuge a protest and didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that. He was quiet for a minute. \u201cWell, they probably shouldn\u2019t have taken over that refuge, but what I liked about it was that it got this conversation going about government overreach. People wouldn\u2019t believe it otherwise.\u201d He remembered the day the F.B.I. came to Burns and barricades went up at the courthouse. The school turned into a staging ground. He said the town looked like \u201csomething out of that \u2018Red Dawn\u2019 movie, for Christ sakes\u201d and that \u201cit was World War III in Harney County.\u201d\n\nJoe and Gay didn\u2019t travel much because the cattle always needed to be looked after. In Burns, they didn\u2019t have a local radio station, and they got their news when they could from television. Cronin didn\u2019t attend college, and the farthest east he had traveled was Boise, Idaho. \u201cI\u2019ve worked out here all my life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my degree.\u201d Joe had the sleep cycle of a lumberjack, waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning and going to bed around 7 in the evening. It was what his family had always done. In 1955, Joe\u2019s dad took a job at the Edward Hines sawmill, which purchased a 67,400-acre tract of timber in the Malheur National Forest. Burns was a vibrant timber town until around 1973 when the mill started laying off workers, and the unemployment rate in Harney County reached 30 percent. The mill closed after the Forest Service restricted the cutting of old-growth forest in the mid-1990s. For-sale signs went up and people moved away. Cronin graduated from high school in 1968 with about 120 people in his class, and his grandson\u2019s class will graduate with about half that many. The biggest employers in the region are now the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and other government agencies. Cronin was in the logging business for years, but it was hard to make ends meet. He bought a small ranch in 1994. He started with four cows, and after 10 years those four cows turned into a 600-head operation. He didn\u2019t use antibiotics or hormones, and his cattle were grass-fed, no fertilizers in the field. Each calf was born into his open arms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter he fed the cows, he took me for a drive on some icy back roads. Near Rattlesnake Creek, we stopped to gaze at a herd of half-starved mule deer. \u201cOur main problem,\u201d he said, \u201cis with the Fish and Wildlife Service.\u201d A few years ago the agency found the bull trout was vulnerable, including on the river that runs through Cronin\u2019s land and determined grazing cattle endangered the fish\u2019s spawning grounds.\n\n\u201cThey say the cows are killing the fish,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a vehicle to remove cattle off national forest. I can\u2019t see anything wrong with that river. I think the government science is slanted.\u201d Cronin asked a riparian ecologist who had been at the University of Montana to run an independent analysis of Little Crane Creek, where his livestock grazed. \u201cHe said that it was one of the healthiest riparian areas he\u2019s ever studied,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cExcellent shape.\u201d The ecologist sent a copy to Cronin and another to the Forest Service office in John Day. \u201cNever heard anything about it,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m hurting that stream, I want to know about it. I just don\u2019t understand it. They are saying the numbers are down. I think there ought to be an independent study. We just get the feeling that the science is out of touch all together.\u201d\n\nCronin\u2019s friend David Torrence came up the road in a pickup. People called him \u201cBig Hat.\u201d He wore a gray hoodie and a pretty big hat. There were two Chihuahuas in the passenger seat. He and Cronin caught up on the weather and chatted about the bald eagles in the canyon. \u201cThe Forest Service didn\u2019t let us haul logs in the canyon,\u201d Cronin told me, \u201cbecause of those birds. They said the trucks were waking up the birds. Look at all of them.\u201d\n\nBig Hat asked about me. Cronin looked my way. \u201cShould I say it?\u201d he said. He meant my New York Times affiliation. Big Hat got out of his truck, stuck his sun-wrinkled face in the open window and folded his arms over the door. He asked about the meeting I attended in John Day. \u201cWas there any violence or anything?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was no violence,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou know, Trump,\u201d Big Hat said, \u201che has been having all this with the media, you know? How they twist [expletive] up and everything? I was watching the news, and it showed a local reporter who was at the meeting. She told Jeanette [Finicum] she was expecting violence and demonstrations, you know? Jeanette was all teary-eyed, and she said: \u2018Hey, we are not outlaws. We are not criminals. We are full-blooded American ranchers. We don\u2019t want no violence.\u2019 \u201d He pointed at me. \u201cYou people are talking about violence and the meeting hasn\u2019t even started? We just think that the government got too much control.\u201d He opened his mouth and shook his head. \u201cWe just want to live our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told her my story,\u201d Cronin said. \u201cI get up at 3 a.m. and start watching Fox News. I\u2019m so pissed off by 5 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cFox News is a good channel.\u201d Big Hat said he voted as a Democrat until Donald Trump\u2019s election. \u201cTrump has been the best guy we\u2019ve dealt with in 30 years,\u201d Big Hat said. \u201cI voted for Trump. But all my sisters and stuff are all pissed off at me because I\u2019d been a Democrat.\u201d\n\nCronin switched parties because of gun control in the \u201980s. \u201cI went right up to the courthouse and changed to a Republican.\u201d He tapped the gun on the dashboard: a .22 Magnum he\u2019d packed for 30 years. \u201cI don\u2019t have a permit to carry concealed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those guys who wants you to see my goddamn gun.

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, which had traded as high as 2839, slipped to 2817 an hour after the Fed\u2019s statement. It recovered in the final hour of trading to finish up at 2824.\n\nReactions:\n\nEconomists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote that the change to the Fed\u2019s inflation language was \u201cdecisive\u201d and a hawkish signal. The bank also noted: \u201cAdding to the conviction of higher inflation, the FOMC noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low. This shows that the Fed is taking notice of the recent shift in market perception about inflation.\u201d\n\nIan Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics: \u201cIn short, the statement sets up the March hike, which will be followed by Jay Powell\u2019s first press conference. We\u2019re expecting continuity of approach, at least for a while.\u201d\n\nGreg McBride, Bankrate.com: \u201cWhile there is a lot of continuity between Yellen and Powell, many other faces on the committee are changing, and this could mean a Fed that is more inclined to raise interest rates than what we\u2019ve become accustomed to under Janet Yellen.\u201d\n\nG.E.\u2019s troubles could cost it a 122-year honor\n\nAnalysts over at Deutsche Bank think the chances are increasing. They write:\n\n\u201cGE continues to face substantial challenges including earnings and cash pressure, tough global power generation markets, aggressive downsizing, shrinking its portfolio, management shake-up and SEC investigations.\u201d\n\nThe analysts add:\n\n\u201cAs the company\u2019s absolute share price has continued to drop (and as the share prices of the other companies have been increasing), GE increasingly falls into the category of outlier and consequently a likely candidate for removal, in our opinion. \u201cThe committee reportedly prefers for the Dow to incur no more than a 10:1 ratio between the component companies\u2019 highest share price and lowest share price. Currently, the ratio between Boeing (the highest) and GE (the lowest) exceeds 20:1.\u201d\n\nThe context: A S&P Dow Jones Indices committee meets twice a year to review the makeup the Dow industrials.\n\nG.E. was among 12 original Dow components when the index was started in 1896 and is the only one of those companies still in the Dow. After briefly being removed twice during the Dow\u2019s first five years, G.E. has been a member of the index for more than 110 years.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nThe C.F.P.B. setup is constitutional.\n\nA federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s director can only be fired by the president for cause. The NYT\u2019s Stacy Cowley reports:\n\nWhen Congress created the bureau seven years ago, it specified that the director \u2014after being nominated by the president to a five-year term and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 could only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance.\u201d That is different than the structure of most other federal agencies, whose leaders can typically be removed at will by a president. Last year, a three-judge appeals court panel found that setup unconstitutional. On Wednesday, the full court issued a new ruling vacating the previous decision and upholding the constitutionality of the agency\u2019s structure.\n\nPhoto\n\nTensions grow between Britain and the E.U. over finance\n\nThe European Union appears to be leaning against striking a special deal for London, instead giving the financial center more limited access to the European single market.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore from Jim Brunsden of the FT, who first reported on the news, citing unnamed sources:\n\nEnsuring that financial services are not badly hit by Brexit is a top priority for the UK, since the sector is Britain\u2019s biggest source of exports and tax revenue.

The tax cut was the primary reason for the higher estimate, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference.\n\nThe estimate reflected the view of Fed officials that the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut will be attenuated by higher interest rates, as the federal government seeks to borrow more money.\n\nThe account also said that some firms were likely to give the windfall to investors or use the money to pay down debts rather than making the types of investments likely to expand the economy.\n\nThe internal debate about how quickly to raise rates revolves around the pace of inflation. Last year was the sixth straight year the Fed fell short of its 2 percent inflation target.\n\n\u201cOne thing is for certain and that is that inflation has become the most important economic variable steering the Fed\u2019s policy,\u201d wrote Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.\n\nSome officials have sought to suspend rate hikes until inflation shows greater strength. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, voted against the December rate hike, and said in a post-meeting statement that the Fed needed to demonstrate a commitment to its target.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that too many observers have the impression that our 2 percent objective is a ceiling that we do not wish inflation to breach,\u201d Mr. Evans said in the statement.", "title": "Fed Plans to Raise Rates in 2018 but Lacks Consensus on Frequency", "authors": []}

The Department of Veterans Affairs is also expressing interest in participating.\n\nIn all, about 300 hospitals are now included in the group. Other hospitals are expected to join.\n\nDr. Harrison said they planned to focus only on certain drugs. \u201cThere are individual places where there are problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not indicting an entire industry.\u201d\n\nDr. Kevin A. Schulman, a professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine who has studied the generic drug market and is advising the effort, said: \u201cIf they all agree to buy enough to sustain this effort, you will have a huge threat to people that are trying to manipulate the generic drug market. They will want to think twice.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe idea is to directly challenge the host of industry players who have capitalized on certain markets, buying up monopolies of old, off-patent drugs and then sharply raising prices, stoking public outrage and prompting a series of Congressional hearings and federal investigations. The most notorious example is of Martin Shkreli, the former hedge fund manager who raised the price of a decades-old drug, Daraprim, to $750 a tablet in 2015, from $13.50.\n\nHospitals have also struggled to deal with shortages of hundreds of vital drugs over the past decade, ranging from injectable morphine to sodium bicarbonate (the medical form of baking soda), shortfalls that are exacerbated when only one or two manufacturers make the product.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an acceleration of both shortages and escalation of prices,\u201d said Dr. Richard Gilfillan, the chief executive of Trinity Health, a large Catholic system that operates in nearly two dozen states and is part of the group. \u201cThere\u2019s not been any effective push back on either of these.\u201d\n\nIntermountain executives would not discuss many details of the project, citing fears that competitors could shut them out of the market by quickly dropping the price of the drugs in question, then raising them again later.

While she said the agency is able to negotiate good prices for veterans, \u201cwe don\u2019t necessarily control supply\u201d and have experienced many of the same shortages, including the recent lack of saline fluids, as the other health groups.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly scanning the horizon and constantly attentive to interruptions of supply chains of medicines,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to Daraprim, several old, off-patent drugs have seen sharp price increases over the past several years. In 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International became a Wall Street darling after it sold investors on its business model of buying up old drugs, then raising the prices precipitously. That year, it sharply raised the prices of two heart drugs, Nitropress and Isuprel, adding millions to hospitals\u2019 drug bills almost overnight. Valeant\u2019s practices led to a series of investigations and Congressional hearings as well as a shake-up of the company\u2019s leadership.\n\nRepresentatives for the generic drug industry have noted that many of the most high-profile cases have involved old, off-patent drugs for which there has been no generic competition.\n\nThe trade group for generic manufacturers, the Association for Accessible Medicines, said its members generally welcome competition. \u201cThe whole generic industry is premised on competition, and that competition brings dramatic savings for patients,\u201d said Allen Goldberg, a spokesman for the group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut generic drug makers have also come under scrutiny.\n\nThe hike in the price of doxycycline hyclate, an antibiotic, which increased to $3.65 a pill in 2013 from 5.6 cents in 2012, led to a congressional investigation as well as state and federal price-fixing inquiries into some of the industry\u2019s biggest players. Last fall, a coalition of state attorneys general broadened a lawsuit over price fixing, accusing 18 companies of engaging in illegal practices involving 15 drugs.\n\nAnthony R. Tersigni, the chief executive of Ascension, said he and other hospital executives felt they had little choice but to try to solve the problem themselves. \u201cWe took the position collectively rather than waiting and hoping for the generic drug companies to address it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to address it head on.\u201d\n\nIntermountain executives said that they would seek approval to manufacture the products from the Food and Drug Administration, which has vowed to give priority to companies that want to make generics in markets for which there is little competition.\n\nThe project boasts a high-profile list of advisers, ranging from Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator of Nebraska, to Dr. Donald Berwick, a former administrator for the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, as well as two former executives with Amgen, the drug manufacturer.\n\nErin Fox, a drug shortage expert at the University of Utah, said the idea of creating a nonprofit drug company is promising. \u201cI think anything that increases the number of suppliers will help,\u201d she said.

{"date": "2018-01-29 00:00:00", "text": "The White House said the idea was very preliminary. The administration has thrown its support behind the development of more secure wireless networks using 5G technology, according to two administration officials who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were at an early stage. Some White House officials have pushed for greater federal involvement in the private sector\u2019s efforts, but the administration doesn\u2019t prefer the idea of the government building a network on its own with public funding, the people said.\n\nDiscussions on the government\u2019s involvement in 5G networks are likely to take at least six months before reaching the president for consideration. In a news conference on Monday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said any discussion was at its \u201cearliest stages.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is becoming increasingly concerned about the economic and security threats posed by China\u2019s development of mobile technology and 5G networks. Among the concerns is the ability of the Chinese government to spy on American citizens and businesses.\n\nThe American government has long been suspicious of Huawei, a giant Chinese technology company that is behind much of the 5G network development in that country.

This time around, I\u2019m a different player, different person, slightly different game, slightly different understanding of the game and different mental processes during the matches. I have to keep that for the final.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to view the final as a foregone conclusion: Federer winning in four sets, tops. He is 8-1 against Cilic and thumped him, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4, in the 2017 Wimbledon final, when Cilic was suffering from severe foot blisters and ended up in tears on a changeover. One of Federer\u2019s coaches, Ivan Ljubicic, is Croatian like Cilic, and knows Cilic\u2019s game well.\n\nThe second-seeded Federer is as fresh as a 36-year-old father of four can presumably be at this stage, after winning all of his matches in straight sets and having to play for only 62 minutes in the semifinals after Hyeon Chung retired with severe foot blisters of his own when trailing, 1-6, 2-5.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou do take the faster matches whenever you can because there\u2019s enough wear and tear on the body,\u201d Federer said. \u201cThere\u2019s enough tough matches throughout the season.\u201d\n\nThe surface in Rod Laver Arena, though apparently not quite as quick as in 2017, suits Federer\u2019s attacking game beautifully. In his last 40 outdoor hardcourt matches, he is 37-3.\n\nThere are always big numbers in the mix when it comes to Federer at this stage, but he can surely see the allure of trying to win his 20th Grand Slam singles title. A year ago, when he arrived at the Australian Open after a six-month injury break, he had 17 and had not won a major title since Wimbledon in 2012.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a number that I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to or be close to,\u201d Federer said of No. 20. \u201cLast year before this tournament I would have been happy to say that I\u2019d win one more Slam before the end of my career. I\u2019d been trying for four or five years to win one more, and I would have said, \u2018One more? Great!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter winning last year\u2019s Australian Open and Wimbledon, he is here at 19, just one win from becoming the oldest man to claim a major singles title in the Open era since Ken Rosewall won the Australian Open at 37 in 1972. (That would not quite be an apples-to-apples comparison because of the comparative weakness of that 1972 field, which was missing many leading players, including Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe and Ilie Nastase.)\n\nBut several coaches in Melbourne do see a pathway for the sixth-seeded Cilic to spring an ambush, just as he did in the 2014 United States Open semifinals on his way to his only major title. He also nearly did it in the 2016 Wimbledon quarterfinals before Federer saved three match points and prevailed in five sets.\n\n\u201cObviously Roger goes in the favorite,\u201d said Neville Godwin, who coached last year\u2019s surprise United States Open finalist, Kevin Anderson, and is now coaching Chung. \u201cBut Marin does have a chance if he can press Roger and get the points moving and maybe try and expose Roger on the backhand side, because Roger can be exposed there. Marin has the good weapons to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nGodwin added: \u201cHe also has to serve really well, hit his spots really well.

{"date": "2018-01-01 00:00:00", "text": "But our bodies make a limited range of enzymes, so that we cannot break down many of the tough compounds in plants. The term \u201cdietary fiber\u201d refers to those indigestible molecules.\n\nBut they are indigestible only to us. The gut is coated with a layer of mucus, atop which sits a carpet of hundreds of species of bacteria, part of the human microbiome. Some of these microbes carry the enzymes needed to break down various kinds of dietary fiber.\n\nThe ability of these bacteria to survive on fiber we can\u2019t digest ourselves has led many experts to wonder if the microbes are somehow involved in the benefits of the fruits-and-vegetables diet. Two detailed studies published recently in the journal Cell Host and Microbe provide compelling evidence that the answer is yes.\n\nIn one experiment, Andrew T. Gewirtz of Georgia State University and his colleagues put mice on a low-fiber, high-fat diet. By examining fragments of bacterial DNA in the animals\u2019 feces, the scientists were able to estimate the size of the gut bacterial population in each mouse.\n\nOn a low-fiber diet, they found, the population crashed, shrinking tenfold.\n\nDr. B\u00e4ckhed and his colleagues carried out a similar experiment, surveying the microbiome in mice as they were switched from fiber-rich food to a low-fiber diet. \u201cIt\u2019s basically what you\u2019d get at McDonald\u2019s,\u201d said Dr. B\u00e4ckhed said. \u201cA lot of lard, a lot of sugar, and twenty percent protein.\u201d\n\nThe scientists focused on the diversity of species that make up the mouse\u2019s gut microbiome. Shifting the animals to a low-fiber diet had a dramatic effect, they found: Many common species became rare, and rare species became common.\n\nAlong with changes to the microbiome, both teams also observed rapid changes to the mice themselves. Their intestines got smaller, and its mucus layer thinner. As a result, bacteria wound up much closer to the intestinal wall, and that encroachment triggered an immune reaction.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a few days on the low-fiber diet, mouse intestines developed chronic inflammation. After a few weeks, Dr. Gewirtz\u2019s team observed that the mice began to change in other ways, putting on fat, for example, and developing higher blood sugar levels.\n\nDr. B\u00e4ckhed and his colleagues also fed another group of rodents the high-fat menu, along with a modest dose of a type of fiber called inulin. The mucus layer in their guts was healthier than in mice that didn\u2019t get fiber, the scientists found, and intestinal bacteria were kept at a safer distance from their intestinal wall.\n\nDr. Gewirtz and his colleagues gave inulin to their mice as well, but at a much higher dose. The improvements were even more dramatic: Despite a high-fat diet, the mice had healthy populations of bacteria in their guts, their intestines were closer to normal, and they put on less weight.\n\nDr. B\u00e4ckhed and his colleagues ran one more interesting experiment: They spiked water given to mice on a high-fat diet with a species of fiber-feeding bacteria. The addition changed the mice for the better: Even on a high-fat diet, they produced more mucus in their guts, creating a healthy barrier to keep bacteria from the intestinal walls.\n\nOne way that fiber benefits health is by giving us, indirectly, another source of food, Dr. Gewirtz said. Once bacteria are done harvesting the energy in dietary fiber, they cast off the fragments as waste. That waste \u2014 in the form of short-chain fatty acids \u2014 is absorbed by intestinal cells, which use it as fuel.\n\nBut the gut\u2019s microbes do more than just make energy. They also send messages.\n\nIntestinal cells rely on chemical signals from the bacteria to work properly, Dr. Gewirtz said. The cells respond to the signals by multiplying and making a healthy supply of mucus. They also release bacteria-killing molecules.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

They rest atop the gut\u2019s mucus layer at a safe distance from the intestinal wall. Any bacteria that wind up too close get wiped out by antimicrobial poisons.\n\nWhile some species of gut bacteria feed directly on dietary fiber, they probably support other species that feed on their waste. A number of species in this ecosystem \u2014 all of it built on fiber \u2014 may be talking to our guts.\n\nGoing on a low-fiber diet disturbs this peaceful relationship, the new studies suggest. The species that depend on dietary fiber starve, as do the other species that depend on them. Some species may switch to feeding on the host\u2019s own mucus.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWith less fuel, intestinal cells grow more slowly. And without a steady stream of chemical signals from bacteria, the cells slow their production of mucus and bacteria-killing poisons.\n\nAs a result, bacteria edge closer to the intestinal wall, and the immune system kicks into high gear.\n\n\u201cThe gut is always precariously balanced between trying to contain these organisms and not to overreact,\u201d said Eric C. Martens, a microbiologist at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the new studies. \u201cIt could be a tipping point between health and disease.\u201d\n\nInflammation can help fight infections, but if it becomes chronic, it can harm our bodies. Among other things, chronic inflammation may interfere with how the body uses the calories in food, storing more of it as fat rather than burning it for energy.\n\nJustin L. Sonnenburg, a biologist at Stanford University who was not involved in the new studies, said that a low-fiber diet can cause low-level inflammation not only in the gut, but throughout the body.\n\nHis research suggests that when bacteria break down dietary fiber down into short-chain fatty acids, some of them pass into the bloodstream and travel to other organs, where they act as signals to quiet down the immune system.\n\n\u201cYou can modulate what\u2019s happening in your lung based on what you\u2019re feeding your microbiome in your gut,\u201d Dr. Sonnenburg said.\n\nHannah D. Holscher, a nutrition scientist at the University of Illinois who was not involved in the new studies, said that the results on mice need to be put to the test in humans. But it\u2019s much harder to run such studies on people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn her own lab, Dr. Holscher acts as a round-the-clock personal chef. She and her colleagues provide volunteers with all their meals for two weeks. She can then give some of her volunteers an extra source of fiber \u2014 such as walnuts \u2014 and look for changes in both their microbiome and their levels of inflammation.\n\nDr. Holscher and other researchers hope that they will learn enough about how fiber influences the microbiome to use it as a way to treat disorders. Lowering inflammation with fiber may also help in the treatment of immune disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nFiber may also help reverse obesity. Last month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Dr. Holscher and her colleagues reviewed a number of trials in which fiber was used to treat obesity. They found that fiber supplements helped obese people to lose about five pounds, on average.\n\nBut for those who want to stay healthy, simply adding one kind of fiber to a typical Western diet won\u2019t be a panacea. Giving mice inulin in the new studies only partly restored them to health.\n\nThat\u2019s probably because we depend on a number of different kinds of dietary fiber we get from plants. It\u2019s possible that each type of fiber feeds a particular set of bacteria, which send their own important signals to our bodies.\n\n\u201cIt points to the boring thing that we all know but no one does,\u201d Dr. B\u00e4ckhed said. \u201cIf you eat more green veggies and less fries and sweets, you\u2019ll probably be better off in the long term.\u201d", "title": "Fiber Is Good for You.

Mr. Egeland said more than 500 people required urgent evacuation.\n\nAfter two days of talks in Damascus, Mr. Lowcock said on Thursday that he hoped for a number of positive developments \u201csoon\u201d on measures to relieve humanitarian suffering, but that more discussions would be needed.\n\nRussia, the main ally of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, has repeatedly said in recent months that it is winding down military activities in the country\u2019s nearly seven-year-old war. But the offensive aimed at insurgents in Idlib appeared to suggest otherwise.\n\nPart of Russia\u2019s aggressive response in Idlib may reflect anger over an attempted armed drone assault on Russian bases in Syria last weekend. The Russian Defense Ministry said the 13 drones, which were either shot down or crashed before reaching their targets, had been launched by insurgents in Idlib.\n\nAt a Defense Ministry briefing in Moscow on Thursday, officials suggested that the explosives carried by the drones may have been manufactured in Ukraine. There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian officials about that assertion.\n\nThe increased fighting in Idlib has put at risk an effort by Russia to convene a meeting of Syrian adversaries in the Russian city of Sochi at the end of this month.\n\nTurkey, which backs some insurgent groups fighting Mr. Assad but has been collaborating with his allies, Russia and Iran, on efforts to stop the fighting, insisted this week that the bombing attacks in Idlib must stop, the Turkish news media reported.\n\nMevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said Mr. Assad\u2019s forces were responsible for most of the fighting in Idlib, and could \u201cnegatively affect efforts to launch a process for a political settlement.\u201d", "title": "Fighting Rages in Syria\u2019s Last Major Insurgent Stronghold", "authors": ["Nick Cumming-Bruce", "Rick Gladstone"]}

Animal remains were sometimes incorporated. Explosions, intentional and otherwise, were not uncommon.\n\nThe authorities were frequently involved. On YouTube, you can watch video of Mr. Pauline being confronted by a fire marshal after a 1992 performance before a groundbreaking at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nDespite the conflict, his safety record is largely intact, with one notable exception: A 1982 explosion in his shop badly wounded Mr. Pauline, taking most of the fingers from his right hand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAn enterprise that began in solitude has grown, and Mr. Pauline has come to work with a number of assistants, largely volunteers.\n\nThe creations, mostly built with castoff and recycled materials scavenged from Bay Area factories and corporate labs, have traveled with Mr. Pauline around the world. In 1999, he set up an internet connection to allow users in California to control a machine in Tokyo. And despite the occasionally medieval appearance of his works, he has continually updated them to remain at the leading edge of technology. One machine at the Marlborough gallery, \u201cThe Big Walker,\u201d was created in 1986. Another, \u201cTrack Robot,\u201d was first built in 1998 and has recently been updated to be controlled via a 3-D Oculus Rift headset.\n\nFor the gallery director Pascal Spengemann, who organized the show, the exhibition offers a chance to connect Mr. Pauline to an art-world audience that may not be familiar with his work, and to look at his machines as sculptural objects on their own.\n\n\u201cThey have this kind of operatic presentation,\u201d Mr. Spengemann said, \u201cbut what does it mean when you extract one?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe gallery declined to share information about pricing for the works.

He also left out some standard grievances. He did not renew his threats to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities that decline to work with federal immigration authorities, nor did he devote much time to promising to rip up trade agreements.\n\nDemocrats in the chamber spent much of the speech refraining from applause, scowling at his boasts, and at one point hissing in disapproval at his proposal for restricting the number of family members immigrants can bring to the United States. As he took the dais at the Capitol, Mr. Trump had the weakest approval rating of any president of the modern era entering his second year in office, with 37 percent of Americans approving of his performance in the job.\n\nBut Mr. Trump stepped behind the lectern still popular with his most ardent supporters, who see him as an unpredictable and entertaining commander in chief who posts vitriol on Twitter against the advice of the White House staff, the Republican leadership and those closest to him.\n\nMr. Trump built his speech around the theme of heroes, using the stories of ordinary people who had overcome extraordinary challenges \u2014 a police officer who adopted the child of a heroin-addicted mother, an Army staff sergeant who won the Bronze Star while fighting in Syria, a North Korean defector who now rescues other defectors \u2014 to argue that \u201cthe state of our union is strong because our people are strong.\u201d\n\nVideo\n\nMost presidents have made sure that there is a choreographed rollout of political messages and policy prescriptions before a State of the Union address. But Mr. Trump\u2019s past week has been consumed by the revelation that he sought last year to fire Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel leading a Russia investigation, and by the abrupt departure of the F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe, whom the president had railed against as politically corrupt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, Republicans are pushing to make public a classified memo that they say shows a politically driven effort by the F.B.I. and the Justice Department to malign Mr. Trump with manufactured allegations of links to Moscow. Democrats say the memo is a set of cherry-picked facts to distort the origins of the Russia investigation and undermine the inquiry. On his way out of the chamber, Mr. Trump could be heard reassuring a Republican congressman that he supports the release of the memo \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nPresidents historically use the annual State of the Union address to tout the successes of their administrations. Mr. Trump went even further, using his time in the spotlight to describe what he views as his major successes during his first year in office: job growth, the confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, the rollback of regulations, a $1.5 trillion tax cut, the defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and historic gains in the stock market.\n\n\u201cJust as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reform in American history,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump delivered his roughly 80-minute speech \u2014 the longest since President Bill Clinton in 2000 \u2014 almost verbatim from a teleprompter, staying uncharacteristically faithful to his prepared script as he paused for ovations, savoring an opportunity to promote his agenda and reaching for lofty statements about the strength of what he called \u201cone American family.\u201d\n\nYet similar rhetoric by Mr. Trump has not lasted long. When he addressed a joint session of Congress weeks after his inauguration last year, Mr. Trump called for an end to \u201ctrivial fights.\u201d Days later, he was on Twitter charging that President Barack Obama had tapped his phones in Trump Tower.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s tone became markedly sharper as he turned to the issue of immigration, seeking to link crime and terrorism to the United States\u2019 immigration policies. He highlighted the parents of young girls killed by immigrants who entered the country as \u201cillegal, unaccompanied alien minors,\u201d saying it was time for Congress to \u201cfinally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13 and other criminal gangs to break into our country.\u201d\n\nThe president delivered his speech in the middle of an intense immigration debate in Congress about the fate of the so-called Dreamers, young people who were brought illegally to the United States as children. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the Dreamers and used the speech to reiterate his proposal to grant them legal status, including a path to citizenship, in exchange for stepped-up enforcement, the building of a wall on the southern border with Mexico and a reordering of immigration laws that gives priority to higher-skilled immigrants.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president, who shocked lawmakers this month at an Oval Office meeting by using a vulgar term to disparage African nations, went out of his way to present himself as tolerant and appreciative of the nation\u2019s diverse people.\n\n\u201cSo tonight I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens, of every background, color, religion and creed,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the proposal has drawn condemnation from Democrats who call it meanspirited and anti-immigration activists who see it as an unacceptable grant of amnesty.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

In the last few years, however, 20- and 30-somethings, lured by the neighborhood\u2019s affordable rents and proximity to downtown Los Angeles, have moved in and are giving local entrepreneurs a new incentive to open new restaurants, bars and boutiques. Many are on old Figueroa Street, now a vibrant thoroughfare full of pedestrians.\n\nHighland Park Bowl\n\nA bar, restaurant and bowling alley all in one space: originally a popular bowling alley dating back to 1927, this sprawling space was a punk rock music venue until a local hospitality company, 1933 Group, took it over and restored it to its former glory with the original bowling lanes, candy machines and placards. There\u2019s also a Neapolitan pizza restaurant and four bars. Bowling is $50 per hour per lane; each lane accommodates six people.\n\n5621 North Figueroa Street, highlandparkbowl.com", "title": "Five Places to Go in Los Angeles", "authors": []}

The show follows five Israelis \u2014 a hippie, a chemist, a bride on her wedding day, a teacher, a Brit \u2014 who, seemingly out of the blue, are identified on the news as Mossad agents who pulled off a political kidnapping in Russia months earlier. But they\u2019re not! Or are they, actually \u2026 ?\n\n\u201cFalse Flag\u201d is the rare ensemble thriller, which adds an extra layer of who\u2019s-scamming-whom intrigue, with an almost \u201cLost\u201d-like vibe of surprising connections and shifting alliances. Political thrillers sometimes err on the side of edginess over emotional credibility, but mercifully that\u2019s not a problem here.\n\nI Want a Drama I Can Go Nuts Over\n\nFaran Tahir in \u201cThe Magicians.\u201d Eike Schroter/Syfy\n\n\u2018The Magicians\u2019\n\nWhen to watch: Seasons 1 and 2 are on Netflix now; Season 3 starts Wednesday at 9 p.m., on Syfy.\n\n: Seasons 1 and 2 are on Netflix now; Season 3 starts Wednesday at 9 p.m., on Syfy. Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThis stylish, sexy adaptation of the novels by Lev Grossman starts its third season with a particularly terrific episode. It highlights the show\u2019s surprising strengths, like its pop-culture obsessions (one coded conversation takes place entirely in allusions), the fun it likes to have with updating classic mythologies (with Bacchus as a New York party bro), and its ability to be serious and direct when that\u2019s called for (like when a character speaks frankly about being sexually assaulted).\n\n\u201cThe Magicians\u201d covers many dark topics, and I have certainly wept at some episodes, as alas death exists alongside magic. But the show is also a pleasure. I don\u2019t just appreciate it or respect it, I actively enjoy it. If you like poppy magical realism, funky fantasy aesthetics, this bit where Kumail Nanjiana wonders if the kids in \u201cHarry Potter\u201d know what the Holocaust is, or you\u2019ve spent any time on Tumblr, try this.\n\n0\n\nFreak Me Out With Space Horror\n\nA black hole. WGBH\n\n\u2018Black Hole Apocalypse\u2019\n\nWhen to watch: Wednesday, at 9 p.m., on PBS (check local listings).\n\nThis two-hour special sometimes veers into \u201cRadioLab\u201d-style \u201cbut what even is a ham sandwich\u201d performative confusion about basic ideas, but it\u2019s worth sticking with. The science itself is engrossing, and even better is the way the special ticks through the history of scientific discovery \u2014 not only what we know about black holes, but how scientists fought about those discoveries, developed competing theories and sussed out whose was more right. If, like me, you used to work yourself into strange crying fits as a child, wondering too hard about the unfathomable darkness of a black hole, this, uh \u2026 this will not help. But it\u2019s still pretty good.\n\nBring Me My Reliable Reality Shows\n\nAshley Graham, left, and Tyra Banks on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model.\u201d VH1\n\n\u2018America\u2019s Next Top Model\u2019\n\nWhen to watch: Tuesday at 8 p.m., on VH1.\n\nSeason 24 is here, and Tyra Banks has returned as host and mentor. The fundamental formula of the show remains intact, and this season\u2019s \u201ctwist\u201d is that there is no longer an upper age limit for the contestants, and thus this season\u2019s hopefuls include a grandmother.\n\n\u2018Ink Master\u2019\n\nWhen to watch: Tuesday at 10 p.m., on Spike.\n\nI don\u2019t know why \u201cInk Master\u201d thinks it needs constant gimmicks and trash talking, rather than going the route of \u201cGreat British Bake Off\u201d and just letting all the work speak for itself. This is my wish for all reality-contest shows in 2018! But even though I know my wish will never come true, \u201cInk Master\u201d still presents a lot of interesting tattoos and compelling, talented artists. Fast forward the rest, and you, too, can skip over its tiring sexism.", "title": "Five TV Shows to Watch This Week", "authors": ["Margaret Lyons"]}

Barry was even better in a 1974 game with the Warriors, scoring 64 with 10 rebounds, but he came one assist short, in an era when triple doubles were not as readily noted. Barry\u2019s feat also came before the 3-point shot, so he had to shoot 30 for 45 to score all those points.", "title": "Five Things About James Harden\u2019s Triple Double", "authors": ["Victor Mather"]}
