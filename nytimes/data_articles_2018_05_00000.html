The #MeToo movement has had a stunning impact across America, eroding the impunity that allowed powerful men to get away with sexual assault and harassment. But we now need a global effort \u2014 by rich and poor nations alike \u2014 to make the #MeToo principles truly universal.\n\nImage Asifa Bano\n\nA few glimpses of the scale of sexual violence as one of the top human rights challenges of our time:\n\n\u25a0 A United Nations study of 10,000 men in six countries in Asia and the Pacific found that almost one-quarter acknowledged having raped a woman, including 62 percent of men in part of Papua New Guinea. A separate 2011 study found that 37 percent of men in part of South Africa said they had raped a woman.\n\n\u25a0 More than 125 million women and girls in Africa and Asia have suffered female genital mutilation. In Somalia and some other countries, almost all the genital flesh is cut away and the vaginal opening is sewn closed with wild thorns, to remain nearly sealed until the girl is married.\n\n\u25a0 A girl under the age of 18 is married every three seconds somewhere in the world, according to Unicef. (Even in the United States, thousands of underage girls are married each year, a few of them just 12, 13 or 14.) Whether in Bangladesh or in Texas, these child marriages are sometimes coerced and leave girls particularly vulnerable to rape and beating.\n\nSo let\u2019s see #MeToo as a global human rights movement.\n\nWe tend to think of \u201chuman rights\u201d in terms of political dissidents being tortured, but gender violence is not only far more common but also sometimes institutionalized and shaped by legal codes and government policy. Indeed, in Myanmar last year, the government appears to have sponsored a policy of mass rape as part of a strategy to terrorize the Rohingya and drive them away. Those Rohingya women who speak up about this are truly heroic.\n\nBut we should all be speaking up, regardless of gender or geography. These assaults and indignities don\u2019t affect women alone, because these patterns of violence and repression suppress talent and hold back entire societies. When millions of girls and women are brutalized, we\u2019re all diminished.", "title": "Opinion | #MeToo Goes Global", "authors": []}

Additionally, this year\u2019s Whitsun Festival, held May 18 to 21, will celebrate the composer Gioachino Rossini, who died 150 years ago. On the Salzach River, walking distance to the festival district, the 56-room Hotel Stein has just reopened after a two-year renovation, adding a restaurant to its popular rooftop bar.

Now operated as a 38-room hotel set on 376 acres about 30 miles west of London, the estate generates its own intrigue, albeit of the bookish kind, with its Cliveden Literary Festival. Held Sept. 29 to 30, the festival, themed to politics and history, continues the property\u2019s tradition of holding literary salons for visiting writers, including past guests like George Bernard Shaw and Jonathan Swift.

This month alone brings new series based on the novels of Louisa May Alcott, Ray Bradbury, Edward St. Aubyn, Stephanie Danler and Joan Lindsay.\n\nAlso this month, we can look forward to the return of two of Netflix\u2019s best shows, along with the debut of an HBO movie that\u2019s sure to spawn 1,000 think pieces on its way to the Emmys.

The show\u2019s first 10 episodes (aside from the finale) smartly balanced serialized and episodic storytelling, letting individual characters anchor each chapter, each offering distinct perspectives on the larger plot. Season 2 will pick up where last year left off, tracking the public pushback these kids receive after holding a series of tense protests over the institution\u2019s systemic racial insensitivity.\n\n\u2014\n\nHBO\n\n\u20192018 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony\u2019\n\nAirs: May 5, on HBO.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMusic fans can and should quibble indignantly about who gets in and who\u2019s left out of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. But HBO\u2019s annual telecast of the induction ceremony still routinely offers some of the best musical moments of the TV year, with reunited bands and their famous fans jamming through some of rock, pop and R&B\u2019s greatest hits. This year we can look forward to performances by the Cars and the Moody Blues, as well as well as memorial tributes to Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, featuring Lauryn Hill, the Roots and Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nSTARZ\n\n\u2018Sweetbitter\u2019\n\nStarts: May 6, on Starz.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nTwo years ago, the New York literary and culinary worlds were both abuzz over Stephanie Danler\u2019s debut novel, \u201cSweetbitter,\u201d based on her experiences working in an upscale Manhattan restaurant. In the TV version, the young British actress Ella Purnell plays the leading role of Tess, a Middle American na\u00eff who arrives in the city unprepared for the pressures she\u2019s about to face. While struggling to excel at a job many others would kill to have, Tess gets firsthand experience with the debauchery her co-workers enjoy after hours.\n\n\u2014\n\nSTARZ\n\n\u2018Vida\u2019\n\nStarts: May 6, on Starz.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAs a companion piece to \u201cSweetbitter,\u201d Starz is also launching the new series \u201cVida,\u201d based on a short story by Richard Villegas Jr. and starring Melissa Barrera and Mishel Prada as estranged sisters who reconnect when their mother\u2019s death brings them back to their old East Los Angeles neighborhood. As they learn secrets about their family, the siblings also get to know each other and plug back into their Mexican-American roots. Like \u201cSweetbitter,\u201d \u201cVida\u201d is a half-hour drama, set in a major American city, with a focus of the lives of young women. It will be interesting to see how they complement and contrast with each other over the course of their six-episode first seasons.\n\n\u2014\n\nSHOWTIME\n\n\u2018Patrick Melrose\u2019\n\nStarts: May 12, on Showtime.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA passion-project for its star, Benedict Cumberbatch (who is also an executive producer), this five-part mini-series traces the life of the title character, from his childhood with an abusive alcoholic father through his own adult struggles with addiction and family life. At once harrowing and heartening, the show is adapted from a series of autobiographical novels by Edward St. Aubyn, combining dark comedy, personal anguish and some sly satire of the British upper classes.\n\n\u2014\n\nPBS\n\n\u2018Little Women\u2019\n\nStarts: May 13, on PBS.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cPBS Masterpiece\u201d and Heidi Thomas, the creator of \u201cCall the Midwife,\u201d have assembled a top-shelf cast for their three-part adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s American literary classic \u201cLittle Women.\u201d Emily Watson plays the matriarch of the March family, taking care of her four teenage daughters while her pastor husband (played by Dylan Baker) is off at war. Angela Lansbury plays the persnickety aunt, while Michael Gambon plays a helpful neighbor. The mini-series drew ecstatic reviews and big ratings when it aired in Britain in December, and it ought to do well stateside, too, given that it\u2019s the rare prestige drama that the whole family can watch.\n\n\u2014\n\nHBO\n\n\u2018Fahrenheit 451\u2019\n\nStarts: May 19, on HBO.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe writer-director Ramin Bahrani updates Ray Bradbury\u2019s 1953 dystopian novel \u201cFahrenheit 451,\u201d setting it in a near future informed by our own modern world \u2014 where improved technologies and a fresh wave of populist political movements have made the original work\u2019s preoccupation with book burning seem newly relevant. Michael B. Jordan stars as an anti-literature zealot who begins to question the foundations of his society, even as his superior officer (played by Michael Shannon) tries to keep him in line.\n\n\u2014\n\nPrime Video\n\n\u2018Picnic at Hanging Rock\u2019\n\nStarts: May 25, on Amazon.\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nJoan Lindsay\u2019s 1967 novel \u201cPicnic at Hanging Rock\u201d tells the story of a fictional incident (framed as fact) in which a group of Australian boarding-school girls mysteriously disappear, disrupting an entire community. The book was adapted into an acclaimed 1975 feature film by Peter Weir, as well as multiple theatrical productions and a radio play.

Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nGiven that the third season of this Emmy-nominated sitcom from Tina Fey and Robert Carlock tackled everything from contemporary college life to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade\u201d \u2014 and did so with plenty of wit and heart \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to expect that Season 4 will be any less unpredictable, or any less funny. As always, the producers aren\u2019t revealing much about what\u2019s to come, although Carlock did tell \u201cThe Hollywood Reporter\u201d that the new season will be divided into two parts (with only the first six episodes arriving this month).

The Indian tabla player Zakir Hussain and the British-born bassist Dave Holland have been at the top of their respective fields since the 1970s. Mr. Holland is one of the most inventive, broad-ranging bassists in jazz; Mr. Hussain plays with fellow heroes of Indian classical music, as well as a cross section of international stars. Recently the two masters have come together in Crosscurrents, a band devoted to what\u2019s now an old idea \u2014 the fusion of rock, jazz and Indian classical \u2014 but with its own sparkling allure.

Mr. Zeitlin, who turned 80 last month, has always kept his crisp, rich harmonies fastened to crisscrossing cadences. What might first scan as easygoing cocktail jazz is a much headier concoction. The pianist began making this kind of music for Columbia Records in the 1960s, then eventually roved into jazz-rock fusion and electronic experiments (just last year, he released \u201cExpedition,\u201d a remarkable album of synthesizer excursions with the drummer George Marsh). But he\u2019s never given up making bracing original music in an acoustic trio format, and recently he\u2019s done it with two A-list collaborators: Mr. Williams, a bassist, and Mr. Wilson, a drummer. They\u2019re featured on Mr. Zeitlin\u2019s fine new album, \u201cWishing on the Moon,\u201d and they join him here.\n\n646-476-4346, mezzrow.com\n\nGIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\n\nEditor\u2019s Pick\n\nABASEMENT 37 at Max Fish (May 7, 7 p.m.). This installment of the monthly underground revue at the storied Lower East Side bar\u2019s basement might mess with your head in more ways than one. Not only is it happening a week earlier than usual, but it also features the musical-theater-of-the-deliciously-absurd stylings of Sugarlife. Imagine an update of a Weimar Republic cabaret act in which the chanteur takes his makeup cues from \u201cWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?\u201d and his fashion sense from a 1960s housewife on the verge. While Sugarlife\u2019s lead singer Christian Dautresme gives voice to modern angst, his band members \u2014 Stuart Popejoy on keyboard and bass, Takuya Nakamura on synthesizer and trumpet, and Danny Tunick on drums and vibraphone \u2014 back him with a broad palette of modern music, which seems firmly rooted in the pop that prevailed during the formative years of Generation X. No two Sugarlife shows are alike and Mr. Dautresme is not afraid to free-associate in audience members\u2019 faces, so the cozy confines of Max Fish\u2019s basement should add an extra touch of unpredictability. Monday night\u2019s lineup also includes the entrancing, spooky electronica of Decimus, as well as Riki Hidaka and Kitchen.\n\nfacebook.com/abasementsonics\n\nDANIELLE DOWLING", "title": "14 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in NYC This Weekend", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "On a recent afternoon, in an interview at the Ahmanson, Mr. Hwang spoke of his deep love for Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, the play\u2019s themes of cultural appropriation and artistic homage, and why we never hear the word \u201cTrump\u201d in a play about the 2016 election. (\u201cLooking back at this moment 50 years in the future, maybe the Chinese won\u2019t even remember the name of the guy who was president.\u201d)\n\nWork on the play began in 2014, when Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Center Theater Group, gave Mr. Hwang free rein to create a show for the 50th anniversary season of the group\u2019s Mark Taper Forum in 2018.\n\nMr. Hwang knew he wanted to do something about \u201cThe King and I,\u201d a play that had captivated and rankled him for years. But he was equally intrigued by China\u2019s increasing desire for \u201csoft power.\u201d \u201cIf hard power is your economic and military strength, soft power is your cultural and intellectual influence,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Hwang had seen that desire firsthand. As the only Asian-American playwright in history to win a Tony, he had become the target of Chinese producers hoping he could help them stage a play set in China that would become a Broadway hit.\n\n\u201cI happen to be the only nominally Chinese person who\u2019s ever written a Broadway show, so I end up going to a lot of these meetings\u201d with Chinese producers, he said.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Hwang enlisted the help of Ms. Silverman and Ms. Tesori. They met up at Columbia University, where all three of them were teaching, to bounce ideas back and forth. \u201cThe triangular mind meld on this one was very deep,\u201d Ms. Silverman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLater that year, Mr. Hwang pitched his still-evolving play to Mr. Ritchie, along with a heads-up that it might turn out a bit bigger than what he had initially thought, what with all the music and Broadway-style numbers and narrative leaps into the future. Would that be O.K.? \u201cI\u2019ve worked with him before, so yeah, I totally trusted him,\u201d Mr. Ritchie said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nTwo weeks after that meeting, on Nov. 29, 2015, Mr. Hwang was stabbed in the neck as he walked home from the grocery store in his Fort Greene neighborhood, severing his vertebral artery. The crime, part of a rise in attacks on Asian-Americans in New York City at that time, made international news.\n\n\u201cIn typical David fashion, I learned about it on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Jue said. \u201cHe posted this very funny post about: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m in the hospital, I got stabbed.\u2019 And then I started seeing the news reports, and there was a tremendous amount of blood on the sidewalk.\u201d\n\nMr. Hwang found a way to work the stabbing into the show. Within the Ahmanson\u2019s auditorium, Mr. Jue, as DHH, rehearsed that pivotal scene. As he slowly loses consciousness after the attack, DHH imagines \u201ca beloved Chinese musical,\u201d and just like that, dancers appear, and a Chinese jumbo jet descends from the sky.\n\n\u201cI give David a lot of credit for translating that incident into this brilliant idea,\u201d Mr. Jue said, \u201cwhere maybe there\u2019s happy endings, and maybe there\u2019s romance, and maybe there\u2019s a 23-piece orchestra following you around, helping you express your feelings.\u201d\n\nA lot of those transcendent moments come courtesy of Ms. Tesori\u2019s compositions, which range from \u201cIt Just Takes Time,\u201d an ode to budding love in which Mrs. Clinton learns to speak Mandarin, sort of, and \u201cGood Guy With a Gun,\u201d a hootenanny-style paean to concealed carry gun laws and the joys of shooting \u201csex molesters\u201d dead.\n\nIn September 2016, the company had their first reading of the play. By then, the character of Mrs. Clinton, as the newly elected leader of the country and the object of Xue\u2019s affection, was established in the script. And then, Trump won. \u201cAt 3 in the morning, when my daughter was sobbing, I just felt really out of control in a deep way,\u201d Ms. Tesori said. \u201cBut I realized we needed to stay in the conversation, that times like this call for a strong response.\u201d\n\nMr. Hwang saw it in a slightly different light: \u201cI guess I felt like, oh, the election is terrible for the country, but maybe it\u2019ll be good for the show. Because it sort of shows the Chinese point of view is right. Democracy isn\u2019t a good system. It doesn\u2019t always elect competent people. It creates chaos.\u201d\n\nFor the play, Mr. Hwang assembled a cast of 17, nearly all of them Asian-American. Many of them had fallen in love with the stage in productions of \u201cThe King and I,\u201d as well as other problematic Asian-themed standards, including \u201cPacific Overtures\u201d and \u201cMiss Saigon.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOne of the women in the company told me it\u2019s so extraordinary to be in a show where I don\u2019t have to bow to anybody,\u201d Ms. Silverman said.\n\nMs. Louis, who was reading Mrs. Clinton\u2019s memoir \u201cWhat Happened\u201d between rehearsals, is hoping that the former first lady will see the play. \u201cI would love that,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Ricamora, who recalled the \u201cicky feeling\u201d of playing one of the two Asian characters in a summer stock production of the 1934 musical \u201cAnything Goes,\u201d likes being on this side of things for once. \u201cI remember doing \u2018Miss Saigon\u2019 and \u2018The King and I,\u2019 and having that feeling that we\u2019re telling a story through a white person\u2019s lens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now we get to feel empowered through telling our own story through our own lens.\u201d\n\nEven so, Mr. Hwang is quick to defend \u201cThe King and I,\u201d the unwitting sire of his latest play. \u201cRodgers and Hammerstein were incredibly progressive and were being brave and innovative for their time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then society moves on, and certain things start to feel vestigial. But there\u2019s not much in \u2018The King and I\u2019 that I would criticize as a musical. It\u2019s beautifully crafted, and there are many moments that I\u2019m moved by in the show.\u201d", "title": "2 Tony Winners Try to Upend Rodgers and Hammerstein", "authors": ["Robert Ito"]}
{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "The problem is, the newer terminology is not consistent through all German regions. Many producers who belong to certain growers\u2019 associations have adopted the term \u201cgrosses gew\u00e4chs\u201d to indicate dry wines from individual vineyards deemed exceptional. But that phrase is not employed in the Rheingau region, where the preferred term is \u201cerstes gew\u00e4chs.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, erstes gew\u00e4chs should not be confused with \u201cerste lage,\u201d which indicates wines from sites that aspire to grosses gew\u00e4chs status but have yet to earn the designation. Nor should grosses gew\u00e4chs be confused with \u201cgrosse lage,\u201d indicating wines from top sites that are not dry. And definitely don\u2019t confuse grosse lage with grosslage, an old term meaning that a wine comes from several vineyards in a particular town rather than one vineyard, or einzellage.\n\nNot surprisingly, many producers choose to use the simpler trocken designation.\n\nPerhaps it is unfair sport to remark on the confusing nature of German wine labels. But I mention it because the wine panel recently tasted 20 bottles of dry German riesling from the largely excellent 2016 vintage. The tasting was blind, which spared us from the daunting label verbiage. But anybody examining the list of our 10 favorites will require a decoding device.\n\nFor the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Sabra Lewis, beverage director at L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon. We usually aim for two guests, but our second was a casualty of the New York region\u2019s dysfunctional transit system, so we went ahead with just the three of us.\n\nAlthough Germany\u2019s sweet rieslings are singular and among the treasures of the wine world, its dry rieslings can be equally wonderful and are likewise unlike those from anywhere else.\n\nRieslings from Austria generally feel firmer, denser and more penetrating, while those from Alsace are altogether bigger and more voluminous.\n\nIf I can speak generally about dry German rieslings, which can vary considerably depending on which region they come from, they are often far more delicate in texture than the others, precise and jewel-like rather than rich.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy many accounts, difficult weather made the 2016 vintage tough to manage for many growers, but it produced wines of exceptional balance that amplify many of the best traits of dry German rieslings. The wines we liked best were deep and profoundly mineral, while also resonant and refreshing.\n\nWhat do I mean by resonant? These are wines that feel three-dimensional in the mouth. They have length \u2014 their flavors proceed in a linear fashion and last long after you swallow \u2014 and depth, which suggests the sort of complexity that makes you want to taste the wine again and again in an effort to unravel the flavors.\n\nBut these are also young wines, and the more ambitious among them will benefit from aging five to 10 years to allow these complexities to uncoil while mellowing the rippling acidity. Sabra wondered whether some of them would ever relax, and suggested that maybe 20 years would do it. I don\u2019t think it will take that long, but the best of these wines are well worth giving some time.\n\nNot all of the wines were exceptional, however. Balance was sometimes an issue. We rejected some wines that were overbearingly acidic \u2014 punishingly tart and lacking charm. That\u2019s an old complaint about dry German rieslings, and one I was surprised to find might still have legitimacy.\n\nThe good far outweighed the bad, however. Sabra called it a transparent vintage, meaning that the wines were quite expressive of their terroirs. And we found some excellent values, wines that are delicious right now. Top among them was our best value, a trocken from Schloss M\u00fchlenhof in Rheinhessen \u2014 juicy, zesty and, if not complex, immensely satisfying, and just $13 for a liter.\n\nRight behind it was the Blauschiefer trocken from Stein in the Mosel, likewise lively, juicy and stony and just $19, albeit for a 750-milliliter bottle.\n\nWhile lovely bottles, these two predictably lacked the depth and nuance of our top (and more expensive) wines. Our No. 1 bottle was the Forster Ungeheuer grosses gew\u00e4chs from von Winning in the Pfalz. Earthy, lively and multidimensional, the wine is a pleasure to drink now, but will get even better with time.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Our No. 3 bottle was the Dalsheim Hubacker grosses gew\u00e4chs from Keller in Rheinhessen, rich and succulent, with apricot and mineral flavors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJust behind these wines were the stony, tangy Haardter Herrenletten from M\u00fcller-Catoir in the Pfalz, the balanced energetic Maximin Klosterlay erste lage from Carl Loewen in the Mosel and the fresh, floral Dhroner Hofberg from A.J. Adam in the Mosel. Also well worth noting were the Marienburg Fahrlay grosses gew\u00e4chs from Clemens Busch in the Mosel and the \u201cDetonation\u201d from Immich-Batterieberg, also in the Mosel.\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize that this was a fragmentary tasting, simply a cross-section of the 2016 vintage. We did not have many bottles from the Nahe region, where the \u201916s have been especially lauded; and in a land of many small producers, you can look well beyond our top 10 to find wonderful bottles.\n\nJust know that they are well worth seeking out. And, if you are uncertain about which words indicate that a wine is dry beyond the all-purpose trocken, the alcohol level is often a dead giveaway. The sweet wines, in which all the sugar in the juice was not converted to alcohol in fermentation, are usually less than 10 percent alcohol. These dry bottles were 11.5 to 13 percent.\n\nTasting Dry German Rieslings\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Von Winning Pfalz Forster Ungeheuer Riesling Grosses Gew\u00e4chs 2016 $56\n\nLively and multidimensional, with complex aromas and flavors of spices, citrus and earth.

And for me that means discarding dark sauces and turning toward ingredients that are light and green. Here I\u2019m inspired by the French blanquette, a stew, usually veal, in a creamy white sauce. I replaced the veal with plump sea scallops and brightened the whole thing with verdant, seasonal asparagus. Traditionally a blanquette is thickened with egg yolks and has pearl onions and often button mushrooms in the mix. The onion is in my version, but minced. I also omitted the mushrooms and used new potatoes that, unlike the mushrooms, help thicken a sauce made without the egg yolks. The result is a dish that\u2019s fancy enough for guests, yet easy enough for a weeknight. Just be sure to open that refreshing bottle of dry riesling alongside.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "In something of a surprise, \u201cMean Girls,\u201d Tina Fey\u2019s musical adaptation of her 2004 film about high school social dynamics, and the eye-popping \u201cSpongeBob,\u201d based on the animated television series about underwater sea creatures, led the nominations on Tuesday, each earning 12 nods. Both are spearheaded by cultural powerhouses: Ms. Fey is one of the nation\u2019s most well-liked comedic writers and performers, and \u201cSpongeBob,\u201d with a huge cult following, is the first Broadway venture led by Nickelodeon, the children\u2019s cable network.\n\n\u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit,\u201d by contrast, is adapted from a fictional 2007 Israeli film about what happens when an Egyptian police band gets stranded for a night in an Israeli desert town. It is a bit of an oddity on Broadway \u2014 more subtle than showy, long on loneliness and short on spectacle \u2014 with aching performances and unusually artful lyrics. But after a successful start at the Atlantic Theater Company Off Broadway, it moved to Broadway and earned superlative reviews.\n\nThe fourth contender for best musical is Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen,\u201d based on the enormously popular animated film, which was not embraced by critics. The show didn\u2019t get nominations for its performers or much of its creative team, although it did score nods for its book and score.\n\nEven seasoned entertainers said the nominations were a thrill.\n\n\u201cI cannot lie \u2014 I cried a little bit in the middle of Equinox this morning, and not because my workout was too hard,\u201d Ms. Fey said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s such a childhood dream. You go back to when you were a kid and going to see shows \u2014 getting a Playbill, dreaming of being in a Playbill some day.\u201d\n\nA panel of 43 theater experts who saw all 30 eligible shows over the last year voted on the nominations. The voters are not allowed to have any financial relationship with any of the eligible shows.\n\n\u201cSpongeBob,\u201d \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cFrozen\u201d are among numerous big brands that have dominated a season whose new shows have also included \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d \u201cEscape to Margaritaville\u201d and \u201cSummer: The Donna Summer Musical.\u201d There were also solo shows by Bruce Springsteen, Michael Moore, John Lithgow and John Leguizamo, and star turns by Amy Schumer, Denzel Washington, Chris Evans, Uma Thurman, Andrew Garfield and Clive Owen.\n\nPhoto\n\nBig plays get big notice.\n\nThe two most-nominated play productions \u2014 \u201cAngels in America\u201d and \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d \u2014 are long (each is staged in two parts), big (large casts, giant sets) and British (each transferred to Broadway from the West End). And both feature wings (don\u2019t ask).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey are competing in different categories. The 11 nominations for the revival of \u201cAngels\u201d make that the most-nominated production of a play in Broadway history. The seven-and-a-half-hour drama, written by Tony Kushner, is a searing, sometimes surreal tale set in the Reagan era during the onset of the AIDS crisis; the original, staged a quarter century ago as two plays over two seasons, won a Pulitzer and many Tonys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enormously happy, and very moved,\u201d Mr. Kushner said on Tuesday. \u201cBeing on Broadway is always exciting \u2014 there\u2019s a feeling of an immediate and a lively connection to American theater history, and to the extent the Tonys are a celebration of theater in the United States, it\u2019s great to know that the play still has a place and that people are still excited about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngels\u201d is now the leading contender for best play revival, but the category is extraordinarily strong, and includes new productions of \u201cThree Tall Women,\u201d by Edward Albee; \u201cThe Iceman Cometh,\u201d by Eugene O\u2019Neill; \u201cLobby Hero,\u201d by Kenneth Lonergan; and \u201cTravesties,\u201d by Tom Stoppard.\n\nAt nearly four hours long, \u201cIceman\u201d (like \u201cAngels\u201d and \u201cCursed Child\u201d) is not for those with short attention spans, though it is swifter than earlier productions of the play. \u201cThree Tall Women\u201d and \u201cLobby Hero\u201d share a different distinction \u2014 they are on Broadway for the first time, but are considered revivals because they have been widely staged since their Off Broadway debuts decades ago.\n\nAmong new plays, \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d is the overwhelming favorite. A sequel to the seven novels, it depicts a time when Harry and his friends are parents of Hogwarts students, and grappling simultaneously with ominous signs in the wizarding world and the ordinary challenges of raising adolescents.\n\n\u201cCursed Child\u201d is the only one of the nominated new plays still running. The others are \u201cThe Children,\u201d by Lucy Kirkwood; \u201cFarinelli and the King,\u201d by Claire van Kampen; \u201cJunk,\u201d by Ayad Akhtar; and \u201cLatin History for Morons,\u201d by John Leguizamo.\n\nPhoto\n\nA veteran returns, and many new faces.\n\nProbably the surest shot in the whole Tonys derby is Glenda Jackson, who at 81 and after two decades in British Parliament, has returned to the stage and is up for leading actress in a play.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Jackson, a two-time Oscar winner who last appeared on Broadway in 1988, portrays a formidable matriarch in \u201cThree Tall Women.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The writer Steve Martin approached Ms. Schumer at a starry party and asked her to read the script of a play he was working on. She agreed, and that led to the production of \u201cMeteor Shower\u201d on Broadway.\n\nPhoto\n\nHow did women fare in the #MeToo era?\n\nWomen are dramatically underrepresented as decision makers on Broadway \u2014 particularly as producers, directors and writers. But several powerful women scored nods this year.\n\nJ.K. Rowling and Sonia Friedman were nominated as two of the three lead producers of \u201cCursed Child\u201d (the third is Colin Callender). Ms. Rowling is the author of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books, and Ms. Friedman is one of the most successful producers in London.\n\nTwo female directors were nominated and are now strong contenders for awards: Marianne Elliott, who directed the \u201cAngels in America\u201d revival, and Tina Landau, who directed \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants.\u201d\n\nAnd despite some concern that their gender politics were dated, the lush musical revivals of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d scored well in the nominations, and are selling well at the box office.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeveral female writers were also singled out. The leading contender for best book of a musical is Ms. Fey, and Ms. Kirkwood and Ms. van Kampen were nominated their plays. (Ms. Rowling is not credited as the writer of \u201cCursed Child,\u201d although she collaborated with the dramatist, Jack Thorne, and the director, John Tiffany, on creating the story.)\n\nRacial and ethnic diversity is always a big issue on Broadway. Of the 39 performers nominated for Tonys, 13 are black, Hispanic, Asian-American or Arab-American.\n\nPhoto\n\nBruce Springsteen is winning a (special) Tony.\n\nBruce Springsteen can make room for a Tony on his awards shelf.\n\nAwards administrators said Tuesday that they had decided to give the 68-year-old rock idol a special Tony Award in recognition of his ongoing song-and-storytelling show, \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway,\u201d which has been running at the Walter Kerr Theater since October.\n\nThe award, calling Mr. Springsteen\u2019s show \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime theater going experience for the Broadway stage, allowing fans an intimate look at a music idol,\u201d is noncompetitive. Mr. Springsteen opted not to contend for competitive awards, disqualifying his show from consideration by declining to invite Tony voters to see it. Previous recipients of special Tonys have included Bette Midler, Lena Horne, John Cameron Mitchell and Dame Edna.\n\nThe award makes it far more likely that Mr. Springsteen will perform on the Tony Awards, and that could help the show\u2019s ratings.\n\n\u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d has been an enormous hit. It won rave reviews, and it has been consistently sold out; it has already grossed $55 million, and the most recent average ticket price was $508, which is quite high for Broadway. The last show is scheduled to be on Dec. 15.\n\nThe Tony administrators will also give a special Tony to Mr. Leguizamo, citing \u201chis body of work and for his commitment to the theater, bringing diverse stories and audiences to Broadway for three decades.\u201d Mr. Leguizamo\u2019s fourth one-man show on Broadway, \u201cLatin History for Morons,\u201d ran this season and was nominated Tuesday for best play.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nNow it\u2019s up to the voters.\n\nThere are 841 Tony voters \u2014 investors and producers, as well as actors, directors, designers, journalists and others \u2014 who are eligible to cast ballots for most categories. (This year, for the first time, a few categories \u2014 sound design and orchestration \u2014 will be decided by a subset of about half of the voters.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe voters now have about five weeks to finish seeing all the nominated shows, or to revisit shows they saw in the fall and want to see again, and then they have until noon on June 8 to submit ballots. This is the first year that the Tonys, presented by the Broadway League and the American Theater Wing, are using all electronic voting \u2014 each voter is to be tracking his or her show attendance on a website, and then is to submit votes using that site.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the voters will get barraged with goodies from the nominated shows \u2014 cast recordings, souvenir books, trinkets \u2014 and the nominees will pop up at a ceaseless stream of nonprofit benefits, hoping to build good will and remain visible to industry insiders while voting is underway.\n\nA few noncompetitive honors have already been announced. The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber and the performer Chita Rivera will receive lifetime achievement awards at the ceremony, while Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization, will get a volunteerism award for his work as an advocate for gay parents and their children. The annual prize for regional theater will go to La MaMa Etc., the New York-based experimental theater company.\n\nAt a reception on June 4, Tony Honors for Excellence in the Theater will be presented to Sara Krulwich, the longtime theater photographer for The New York Times; Bessie Nelson, a longtime costume beader; and Ernest Winzer Cleaners, a 110-year-old business with a specialty in costume work.", "title": "2018 Tony Nominations: \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 and \u2018SpongeBob\u2019 Lead the Way", "authors": ["Michael Paulson"]}

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America\u2019s most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil\u2019s art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or \u201ccannibalism.\u201d Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila\u2019s three most important paintings, including the classic \u201cAbaporu\u201d (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

An exhibition in the form of a chokehold, the third of the Neue Galerie\u2019s recent shows on art and German politics pushes into the years of dictatorship, with paintings, drawings and photographs by artists deemed \u201cdegenerate\u201d by the Nazis \u2014 as well as by those who joined the party or who thought they could shut out the catastrophe. (You will know the dissidents, like Max Beckmann and Oskar Kokoschka; the fascists and sellouts are less known.) Gazing at macabre still lifes of dolls and dead flowers, or dreamy landscapes in imitation of an earlier German Romanticism, you may ask to what degree artists are responsible for the times in which they work. But then you see \u201cSelf-Portrait in the Camp,\u201d by the Jewish German painter Felix Nussbaum \u2014 made between his escape from a French internment camp and his deportation to Auschwitz \u2014 and you know that there can be no pardon. (Farago)\n\n212-628-6200, neuegalerie.org\n\n\u2018HUMA BHABHA: WE COME IN PEACE\u2019 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 28). This spare and unsettling sculptural installation for the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden Commission includes two figures: one that is somewhat humanoid but with a ferocious mask-face and that visually dwarfs the jagged Manhattan skyline behind it, and another bowing in supplication or prayer, with long cartoonish human hands and a scraggly tail emerging from its shiny, black drapery. The title is a variant on the line an alien uttered to an anxious crowd in the 1951 science-fiction movie \u201cThe Day the Earth Stood Still,\u201d but it ripples with other associations: colonization, invasion, imperialism or missionaries and other foreigners whose intentions were not always innocent. The installation also feels like an extension of the complex, cross-cultural conversation going on downstairs, inside a museum packed with 5,000 years of art history.

Mount Kumgang, or the \u201cDiamond Mountain,\u201d lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang\u2019s Olympic Stadium, but it\u2019s a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries\u2019 worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics.

Take that, streaming video: Andy Warhol\u2019s \u201cThe Chelsea Girls\u201d (1966), almost certainly the apex of the artist\u2019s work in film, makes projection an integral part of the moviegoing experience. The film is traditionally run from two 16-millimeter projectors operating simultaneously, with the sound switching between them and the images appearing side by side. MoMA is screening the movie several times: digitally (which may defeat the purpose, on Friday and May 13), in the regularly presented 16-millimeter version (on Sunday) and \u2014 by far the most unusual offering \u2014 in a 16-millimeter presentation (on Saturday) that replicates what was shown at the film\u2019s world premiere, when the movie was two reels longer.

When her mother passed away and von Trapp inherited her pieces, along with her grandmothers\u2019 and great-grandmothers\u2019, she decided to look for a new direction. She quit law, kept what heirlooms had emotional value, and instead of locking the rest away in a safe, she had them repurposed. With the help of a local goldsmith, she used the metal and stones to create pieces of her own design \u2014 and her namesake jewelry brand was born.\n\nThis idea of recycling is paramount to von Trapp, who crafts her streamlined modern essentials, like stackable rings in mixed yellow, rose and white gold, exclusively from repurposed gold \u2014 found everywhere from pawn shops to the microchips of discarded cellphones. \u201cThere\u2019s so much gold in the market. If everyone just gave back to the cycle there wouldn\u2019t be a need to mine anymore,\u201d she says. She donates 2 percent of the profit from every sale to Earthbeat Foundation, a nonprofit organization which helps gold-mining communities build alternative sources of income, and she avoids using newly mined or recut diamonds, which are often \u201ccut under horrible circumstances,\u201d she explains. Longevity and versatility are also built into the design of each piece. Her signature 14-carat-gold Round Ones hoop earrings, for example, have a small hole through which other earrings can be threaded to create new pieces. \u201cIt\u2019s important with jewelry to create something sustainable in that it\u2019s timeless, fits to any occasion and any situation, and becomes a uniform forever,\u201d von Trapp says. lilianvontrapp.com \u2014 KIKI GEORGIOU\n\nImage A monogrammed tote bag on the runway at Gucci.

And if you\u2019re staying at a hotel, daily parking fees can add up quickly.

The North American Flyball Association was founded in 1984, and from there the rules took shape: A regulation Flyball course is 51 feet long, with two-foot-wide hurdles spaced 10 feet apart; dogs must clear all the hurdles and reach the finish line with their ball still in their mouths. All four dogs will ideally finish the relay in under 24 seconds, collectively; doing so earns them points toward Flyball titles (of which there are many).\n\nFlubs are frequent. At the tournament here, several dogs dropped their balls before reaching the finish line, and some ran outside the hurdles or knocked them down. Part of the training regimen involves teaching the dog to ignore distractions.\n\n\u201cLast Labor Day, we were at a tournament and somebody brought their cat, because the dog loved the cat so much that it helped the dog perform at its best,\u201d said Rose A.

It turns out to be only the latest of Hero\u2019s transformations: She was born to a rich, pedigreed family, descended from Spanish colonial officials and Chinese merchants and chummy with President Ferdinand Marcos. The name of her hometown \u2014 Vigan, in the northwestern province of Ilocos Sur \u2014 strikes fear in her classmates at university in Manila as a \u201cno-go zone, a kingdom of terror\u201d; belatedly, Hero realizes that the warlords who rule the region are her godparents and neighbors.\n\nRadicalized under martial law imposed by Marcos in 1972, she drops out of medical school and joins the New People\u2019s Army, a communist rebel force that continues to resist the government today. For a decade she serves as a cadre doctor in the mountains of Isabela in the northeast, until she\u2019s captured by the military and tortured. When they figure out her lineage, they dump her in a vacant lot in Manila, weighing less than 90 pounds and broken in body and spirit. The government offers her parents financial compensation \u201cfor the oversight\u201d; soon after, her father is elected mayor by a landslide. They refuse to speak to the daughter who dedicated her life to destroying theirs, and she has nowhere to go but America, where her uncle takes her in.\n\nAll this takes place as the novel\u2019s back story, but it refuses to stay in the past, resurfacing in flashbacks as Hero tries to adjust to the disorienting lull of peacetime and \u201ca world in which there was still corny music, lechon kawali, heavy but passing rain, televised sports, yearly holidays, caring families, requited love.\u201d Once she fought alongside comrades who prized \u201cthe ability to put a knife in the chest of a mayor or landlord on a regional bus and walk away with no injuries, minimal witnesses\u201d; now she ferries Roni from school, works the cash register at a strip-mall turo-turo (steam-table restaurant) and wanders through parties at strangers\u2019 houses, picking up one-night stands, mostly men and sometimes women.\n\nHero is difficult and prickly, qualities shared by Roni, who loses a tooth in a scrap at school (to her glee), and Rosalyn, a new friend acquired practically against Hero\u2019s will. A tough-talking makeup artist who feels uneasy with the ideal of beauty that requires lightening the skin and rounding out a flat nose, Rosalyn bluntly propositions Hero, masking her true feelings as mere lust, an act of bravado that fools no one. Hero in turn rejects what she sees as Rosalyn\u2019s simple-minded sentimentality: \u201cA heart was something you could buy on the street, six to a skewer.\u201d Their love story starts in stutters, the risk of exposure all the more real with every touch.", "title": "A Debut Novel Traces the Filipino Experience in the United States", "authors": []}

Who, besides Zane Grey and Louis L\u2019Amour and a forgotten brotherhood of pulp novelists? Who, besides Larry McMurtry and Cormac McCarthy? And if those contemporaries write \u201canti-westerns,\u201d where are the westerns they are writing against?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re writing against John Ford, I suppose,\u201d Mr. Diaz said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d he said. Weird that the western novel was so underachieving, given how tightly the genre embraces America\u2019s most potent myths about itself. Westerns, he said, glamorize \u201cthe worst aspects of the imperial drive of the United States\u201d \u2014 brutality against nature, genocidal racism, \u201cthe whole macho thing, the place of women, the frivolous violence, it goes on.\u201d\n\nMr. Diaz, it should be clear, is a western writer who hates guns. He said it sickened him to think that telling H\u00e5kan\u2019s story would require imagining and describing acts of murderous violence. \u201cI came very close to not writing the book,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew something really bad had to happen to him to make the plot plausible.\u201d\n\nH\u00e5kan is a backwoods boy from Sweden who leaves home with his older brother, Linus, for the American metropolis they call Nuj\u00e5rk. But he loses Linus on a wharf in Portsmouth, England, boards the wrong ship and ends up in San Francisco. He resolves to reunite with his brother by trudging across the continent, shoes against the current of westward migration and continental conquest.\n\nHe knows no English, and for a time the reader is almost as disoriented as H\u00e5kan is. Stray words float by in a river of frontier gibberish: \u201cFrawder thur prueless rare shur per thurst. Mirtler freckling thow.\u201d But H\u00e5kan learns fast. He meets people: a mystery woman in a corset with amber hair and black-red lips, like a hooker with a heart of coal. A demented gold miner. An obsessive naturalist who wades in alkaline pools for imagined proto-organisms. Homesteaders, marauding Civil War veterans and a sinister sheriff.\n\nH\u00e5kan starves and thirsts. He survives and grows, in sorrowful wisdom and, inexplicably, to colossal size. And though he murders and maims and becomes a notorious outlaw, he is disgusted, and ultimately shattered, by his violence.\n\nThe reader, absorbed, has urgent questions. Will the misdirected H\u00e5kan ford the Mississippi and pass Huck Finn lighting out the other way? Will he find Linus in the sooty hubbub of Walt Whitman\u2019s Brooklyn or the immigrant maelstrom of Five Points? How does he end up in Alaska?\n\nMore immediately, how do you pronounce H\u00e5kan?\n\nMake a fish mouth and glide over the vowels: \u201cHu-oh-aahk-kan.\u201d To Mr. Diaz, it sounds like a Long Islander saying \u201cHawk can,\u201d which is pretty close for someone whose roots are from nowhere near Massapequa.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe was born in Buenos Aires in 1973. His mother was a psychoanalyst; his father a filmmaker who became involved in Trotskyist politics, which put the family in danger after Argentina\u2019s military coup, when Hern\u00e1n was 2. They fled to Stockholm. Moving there and then back to Argentina as a boy gave Mr. Diaz double doses of immigrant dislocation; the emotional aftereffect of isolation and bullying seem to echo in his story of lonely H\u00e5kan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnlike his reticent, hulking hero, Mr. Diaz has a slight build and a wide smile and an expression that gains intensity as he listens and weighs his words, which he delivers with rapid precision. He is associate director of the Hispanic Institute at Columbia, where he edits the journal Revista Hisp\u00e1nica Moderna, or RHM. His last book was a study of Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine essayist and poet: \u201cBorges, Between History and Eternity.\u201d\n\nAmong the ideas Mr. Diaz challenges with \u201cIn the Distance\u201d is the one that writing convincingly about a place requires going there at some point.\n\nHe didn\u2019t. No rental car and GPS for him: \u201cThere was something that to me felt corrupt and dishonest about having an air-conditioned experience of the protagonist\u2019s ordeals,\u201d he said. \u201cI defend the idea of reading over researching, which has this whole protocol that I don\u2019t think applies to literature, which has its own relationship to truth.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead he read widely and deeply and wrote the book in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He knew he was working within an old tradition. Many early westerns were written by men for whom \u201cGo West\u201d meant crossing the Rhine. They include Karl May, the German scribbler of sauerbraten westerns, and Franz Kafka (\u201cAmerika\u201d). Arthur Conan Doyle set part of \u201cA Study in Scarlet\u201d in Mormon Utah.\n\nMr. Diaz considered the risks of historical howlers (Kafka imagined the Statue of Liberty holding a sword) and found them tolerable. What he concocted is strange and transporting, a story that approaches but never enters the realm of magical realism. H\u00e5kan is one humongous Swede, but not a biblical giant. On a big-enough horse to match his proportions, he can plod down Main Street without causing panic.\n\nSome characters stray toward anachronism, like the opulent winemaker, a sort of Finnish Francis Ford Coppola, who lives on a groomed estate out of Architectural Digest, or Asa, the good guy in a bad gang who loves to cook. Asa is a frontier foodie, adding sweet sap and blossoms to his dishes. He shares with H\u00e5kan a few ambiguously tender scenes of manly attachment, and his recipe for quail stew.\n\nWeird. But give Mr. Diaz this: It\u2019s a weirdness to which a reader willingly submits, because of the vigorous beauty of his words and his ability to keep H\u00e5kan\u2019s bizarre adventures somewhere within sight of possibility. So when you get to a sentence like this \u2014 \u201cH\u00e5kan tried to milk the lion\u201d \u2014 it passes without a second thought.\n\nAn affecting oddness is the great virtue of \u201cIn the Distance,\u201d along with its wrenching evocations of its main character\u2019s loneliness and grief. And its ability to create lustrous mindscapes from wide-open spaces, from voids that are never empty.\n\n\u201cIt all could plausibly happen,\u201d Mr. Fischbach said. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t.\u201d", "title": "A Debut Novel.

He relied on weather information from a commercial service, unaware that the reports were at least nine hours old. He didn\u2019t know what a \u201cdownflooding angle\u201d was (how far a given ship can list before water pours in through unsecured openings), let alone have at hand that critical angle for his own ship \u2014 one of the main reasons El Faro sank.\n\nOther factors also came into play. The hurricane wandered about, confounding the forecasters. Built in 1974, the vessel was an outdated rust-bucket with many shortcomings that were grandfathered in by the Coast Guard: open lifeboats instead of enclosed ones; a lack of basic electronics and chartplotters that you would find on even the meanest pleasure boat; ventilator openings in the upper hull and other design flaws that would never be allowed by modern marine regulations. El Faro didn\u2019t even have a working anemometer, a wind-speed gauge. As hurricane winds were heeling the vessel past its downflooding angle so that the sea poured in through those same rotting ventilators, the captain had no way to determine wind velocity.\n\nImage\n\nOn top of all that, the company that owned the ship, Tote, was shockingly dysfunctional. According to Slade, it had no port captain supervising the ship while at sea and no rational system for evaluating and promoting (or firing) mates and captains. The company missed the captain\u2019s first emergency phone call ashore because the man responsible for receiving it was out of reach and hadn\u2019t designated a stand-in. No one at the company was tracking any of their vessels at sea \u2014 or the course of the storm.\n\nAll this makes for a powerful and affecting story, beautifully handled by Slade, a journalist who clearly knows ships and the sea. The book tells of the heroic search-and-rescue operations, the hunt for the black box, the investigations and hearings and the nature of hurricanes. It chronicles the despicable reactions of Tote and its upper management to the tragedy. The pusillanimous, corporate-speak testimony of several corporate executives is quoted at length \u2014 perhaps at too great a length. But one can\u2019t help reading it, page after page, in disbelief and disgust.\n\nSeveral days after the sinking, a courageous rescue-swimmer was lowered from a helicopter and came across a single body floating in a red survival suit, its head three times the size of a normal human\u2019s. A GPS locator was dropped, but it malfunctioned and the body was never seen again. This may have been the captain\u2019s remains, as the rest of the crew was mustering below at the time of sinking and the bridge was probably the last part of the ship to slip beneath the waves. In the end, no bodies were recovered.\n\nThe transcript ends with a heart-rending exchange, shouted over the roaring storm between the captain and his helmsman, who was trapped as the boat rolled on its side.\n\n\u201cThe helmsman cried out, \u2018You\u2019re gonna leave me.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m not leaving you.

But people are coming and going faster than they have in recent memory, according to data from TDn2K, a restaurant research firm. Last year, the turnover rate reached 133 percent, meaning that positions often had to be filled more than once.\n\nThat has forced business owners to adjust.\n\nTamra Kennedy, who owns nine Taco John\u2019s franchises in the Midwest, started offering $100 as a bonus to new employees who reached 100 hours. She has started offering merit increases twice a year, and she pays all employees more than the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cHiring has been more challenging in the last two years than probably the previous 10,\u201d Ms. Kennedy said.\n\nAbout half of her stores are understaffed. So she has devised workarounds: Digital probes, not people, now record food temperatures. She has also invested in expensive new registers that can produce reports that employees used to do by hand.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the industry in this kind of situation,\u201d said Robert S. Goldin, a partner at the food consulting firm Pentallect. \u201cIt\u2019s never been like this.\u201d\n\nLabor costs are rising, according to an estimate from Dean Haskell, a partner at National Retail Concept Partners, a restaurant and retail consulting firm in Denver. Mr. Haskell analyzed public financial filings from 15 major chains and determined that those companies spent about $73 million more on labor last year than the year before.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s has announced that it will expand its tuition-reimbursement program, committing $150 million over five years to tuition reimbursement for employees who work at its stores for at least 90 days. Before, the requirement was nine months.\n\nThat $150 million might seem like a lot. But replacing workers is also expensive: It costs about $2,000 to replace the average hourly restaurant worker, according to data from TDn2K.\n\n\u201cThirty years ago, I would not put up with the stuff I put up with today,\u201d said John Motta, a longtime Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchisee in Nashua, N.H.

That message is: \u2018Correct the mess.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn recent months, Iran has had protests over the lagging economy and against compulsory Islamic head scarves. At the same time, President Trump has hinted he wants to revisit the Iran nuclear agreement, which many Iranians had hoped would put the country on a \u201cnormal\u201d path.\n\nInstead, Iranians are caught in a seemingly perpetual limbo. There is nostalgia for the days before the Islamic Revolution, when President Jimmy Carter came to Iran to meet with Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi \u2014 the son of Reza Shah \u2014 instead of weapons experts haggling over nuclear centrifuges. Of course, there is also a bit of amnesia about the shah\u2019s despotic tendencies, and the abuses by his secret police, the Savak, which fueled the uprising that overthrew him in 1979.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile the authorities refused to say whether the recent discovery was, in fact, the mummified remains of Reza Shah, many Iranians took the official reluctance, the location of the find and the virtual absence of mummies in the country as proof positive.\n\n\u201cIt has to be him,\u201d my Iranian mother-in-law cried out during a debate at the kitchen table. \u201cWe Iranians don\u2019t do mummies.\u201d\n\nTheir reasoning went like this: When Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his family hurriedly left Iran on a sunny January day in 1979 as the Islamic Revolution was gathering force, they left behind two long-deceased relatives. One, his brother, Prince Alireza Pahlavi, died in 1954 in a plane crash in the snowy Alborz Mountains of Iran and was buried at an unknown location.\n\nBut the grave site of his father, Reza Shah, who died in 1944, would have been hard to miss: an imposing mausoleum adjacent to the parrot garden where the excavator was digging last month.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReza Shah ruled for nearly two decades. Many here call him the father of modern Iran, for single-handedly carrying a backward, mosquito-infested country into the 20th century. He went into exile in South Africa after being forced by the British and Soviets to abdicate in 1941 in favor of his son.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter his death in Johannesburg in 1944, his body was taken to Egypt, where it was mummified and where it stayed until 1950, when his remains were brought back to Iran.\n\nThe mausoleum where Reza Shah was laid to rest was inspired by Napoleon\u2019s in Paris. Over 80 feet high, it rivals in size the shrine to Abdol Azim. But after the revolution, the firebrand cleric Sadegh Khalkhali, known as \u201cthe hanging judge\u201d for ordering the execution of hundreds, had the mausoleum torn down. Reza Shah\u2019s body was somehow lost.\n\n\u201cI remember when the revolutionaries started demolishing the mausoleum,\u201d said Ali Zakeri, 72, who spends most of his days in the bazaar surrounding the Shah Abdol Azim shrine. \u201cIt was built so strong that after a whole day of hammering, they only managed to take three centimeters off,\u201d he added, referring to a bit more than an inch.\n\nIt was a sunny spring day, and Mr. Zakeri and his friend were discussing the enhanced police presence that had accompanied the crowds swarming the normally peaceful area around the shrine, hoping to catch a glimpse of the mummy.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the mummy, I knew this was Reza Shah,\u201d said the friend, Farman Hemati, of the photograph that had circulated on social media. He was sitting next to a scale like those in old-fashioned arcades, where people could weigh themselves for the equivalent of 5 cents, although very few did.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe then proffered a theory as to why the mummy had generated such excitement.\n\n\u201cI lost most of my money after the revolution,\u201d he said, adding that things in Iran had since gone downhill. \u201cWe need a strong leader, to set things straight here, someone like Reza Shah. The discovery of his body is a sign that change is coming.\u201d\n\nFor Iran\u2019s authorities, one thing was clear: The mummy, regardless of who was wrapped inside, couldn\u2019t be in the public eye.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeasures were taken. Plainclothes officers started roaming the shrine, seeking out Reza Shah aficionados and sending them home. One recent evening, after a large group gathered, several people were arrested. The construction site where the mummy was found has been cordoned off and the excavator driver who took the selfie was questioned, family members have said.\n\nEarly on, Hassan Khalilabadi, the chairman of the cultural heritage committee of the Tehran City Council, floated in an interview with the semiofficial news agency ISNA the idea that the mummy could be Reza Shah\u2019s. But such remarks from officialdom quickly disappeared from local news sites. The mummy was reburied or taken away. Or perhaps, as one official said, the whole thing was Photoshopped. From an official perspective, it never happened.\n\nIn a nearby teahouse, two men, Ali and Arash, were sucking on a water pipe, as state television droned on behind them. Ali said he was a representative for a condom brand, while Arash sold baby clothes. It was 11 a.m., but they were both already tired.\n\n\u201cMany things in the country are wrong,\u201d said Ali, 32.\n\n\u201cOur moods are constantly shifting,\u201d said Arash, 32.\n\nThey fell silent.\n\n\u201cReza Shah will be the example of the strong man to come,\u201d Ali concluded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Arash said. \u201cWe will again forget him, as we forget everything else.\u201d", "title": "A Mummy Turned Up in Iran.

He is the first person of color to lead the Home Office; some cheered him for breaking that barrier. Of course, representation isn\u2019t entirely inconsequential. But for too many, there is a desire to reduce anti-racism and anti-sexism to issues of representation: If we get more women or people of color into positions of power, society will become more equal. You could call this trickle-down equality \u2014 and like its economic counterpart, it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThere are two lessons to learn from Mr. Javid\u2019s appointment: The fight against an unjust immigration system does not change with a new home secretary, and if we remain satisfied with representation as the sole means of progress, diversity becomes a shield for a government\u2019s institutionally racist policies.\n\nHostility to immigration is at the heart of Mrs. May\u2019s government.

In that role, she pledged to get net migration down to the \u201ctens of thousands.\u201d Told it was unworkable, she stubbornly stuck with it.

Jane Prescott, a smart and sensible lady\u2019s maid in service to the nouveau riche Benchley family, has a front-row seat for the mischief that ensues when pretty, vapid Charlotte Benchley rises above her station and becomes romantically entwined with a rich nitwit ne\u2019er-do-well, Robert Norris Newsome Jr.\n\nWhen Norrie is murdered on the night their engagement is to be announced, Charlotte becomes a suspect and only Jane seems inclined to clear the silly girl\u2019s good name. The murder mystery becomes entangled, at times awkwardly, with larger social issues like unionism, anarchism and the women\u2019s suffrage movement. But the scenes that work best feature oblivious upper-crust swells, dancing while the victims of a terrible mine disaster lie moldering in their graves.", "title": "A Politician With Real Killer Instincts", "authors": ["Marilyn Stasio"]}

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "The report analyzed data on federal loans that entered repayment from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, and focused on nine companies that offer default prevention services, out of about four dozen such companies. (The nine served about 1,300 colleges, and accounted for about 1.5 million borrowers who entered repayment in 2013.)\n\nOf the nine, five encouraged forbearance over other options, and four sometimes provided \u201cinaccurate or incomplete\u201d information to borrowers, the G.A.O. found. In one case, a consultant mailed forbearance applications to past-due borrowers, along with a letter incorrectly stating that they could lose federal benefits like food assistance if they defaulted on their student loans.\n\nThe report did not identify the consultants or the colleges that had hired them. Abby Shafroth, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center, said such consultants may often be retained by for-profit colleges, which tend to rely heavily on federal student aid programs for revenue.\n\nSome companies that promote default prevention services on their websites focus on two-year community colleges, although some include testimonials from traditional, four-year colleges.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about forbearances:\n\nDoes a forbearance ever make sense?\n\nForbearance may be a helpful tool for short-term financial setbacks \u2014 say, an unexpected medical bill \u2014 that you can resolve in a few months to perhaps a year, loan experts say. But they are a bad idea if you simply can\u2019t afford your loan payments and you don\u2019t expect the situation to change anytime soon. In that case, flexible plans that tie monthly payment amounts to your income may make more sense, said Diane Cheng, associate research director at the Institute for College Access and Success.\n\nWhat should I do if I\u2019m contacted by a default prevention consultant?\n\nIf a consultant suggests forbearance, it\u2019s wise to call your loan servicer on your own and explore alternatives, including plans that offer affordable payments tied to your income. A servicer is the company that officially manages your loan, handling tasks like sending you statements, collecting payments and processing changes in your repayment plan. (In some cases, the consultant may even be an affiliate of the servicer, Ms. Cheng said, but it\u2019s the servicer that actually makes the changes.) \u201cBorrowers,\u201d she said, \u201cshould know they have options beyond forbearance.\u201d\n\nSeveral plans are available that adjust monthly payments to reflect your income and family size. Depending on how low your monthly payment is, your debt could actually grow over time, in some cases. But any loan balance remaining after 20 or 25 years (depending on the plan) is forgiven, so there is light at the end of the tunnel. Still, there is a downside to consider: You\u2019ll pay income taxes on the amount forgiven.", "title": "A Student Debt Payment Plan That Saves Now, Yet Costs More Later", "authors": []}

He never spoke about it after the war.\n\nIn nine years of high school in the 1950s, Mr. Lethen said, no history class ever touched on the Holocaust.

But she really was ahead of her time.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHurston was first dispatched to Plateau, Ala., in 1927, at the behest of Franz Boas, her mentor and professor at Barnard. Boas, an influential anthropologist, urged her to interview Lewis for The Journal of Negro History. Doing field research in the segregated South was challenging for a single African-American woman, and Hurston, who was then in her mid-30s, occasionally slept in her car when she couldn\u2019t find a hotel that would rent her a room, and traveled with a pistol for protection.\n\nIt was a momentous assignment: \u201cOf all the millions transported from Africa to the Americas, only one man is left,\u201d she wrote in \u201cBarracoon.\u201d \u201cThe only man on earth who has in his heart the memory of his African home; the horrors of a slave raid; the barracoon; the Lenten tones of slavery; and who has 67 years of freedom in a foreign land behind him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHurston returned to Alabama to speak to Lewis again in 1931, and spent several months visiting him, gradually coaxing out his story.\n\n\u201cBarracoon,\u201d which comes out May 8, takes its title from the barracks that enslaved Africans were kept in before they were forced onto slave ships. It tells the story of Lewis\u2019s capture by Dahomey warriors in West Africa, and how he was sold to slavers and taken to Mobile, Ala., in 1859, more than 50 years after the United States Congress had outlawed the slave trade, in what Hurston describes as the \u201clast deal in human flesh.\u201d\n\nHe told Hurston about the roughly five years he spent enslaved, how he gained his freedom when Union soldiers appeared one day and told him he didn\u2019t belong to anyone anymore, and how he joined together with a group of other former slaves and helped to establish Africatown, a community founded and run by Africans.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cBarracoon\u201d unfolds largely as a monologue from Lewis, with an introduction and occasional interjections from Hurston. Some days, he didn\u2019t feel like talking, so she helped him with chores. Other days, he grew exhausted by her questions and told her she wanted to know too much. At times, he was so overcome by painful memories that he couldn\u2019t speak, like when he recalled the day his village was attacked by Dahomey warriors, who beheaded victims they deemed too weak to be sold, and smoked their victims\u2019 heads to preserve them.\n\n\u201cHis agony was so acute that he became inarticulate,\u201d Hurston wrote.\n\nShe would bring him food, a basket of peaches or a Virginia ham, and tell him stories to break the ice. When Lewis was feeling chatty, he could go on for hours, and Hurston cedes the narrative to him for long, meandering stretches.\n\n\u201cShe wanted us to hear his voice and she kept herself out of it as much as possible,\u201d said Alice Walker, who wrote a foreword to \u201cBarracoon.\u201d \u201cShe knew it was important for us to hear from him.\u201d\n\nScholars of Hurston\u2019s work have long known of the manuscript\u2019s existence, but few recognized its significance. Some thought Hurston\u2019s historical research was sloppy, even unethical. Before she wrote \u201cBarracoon,\u201d Hurston detailed her conversations with Lewis in an article published in The Journal of Negro History, titled \u201cCudjo\u2019s Own Story of the Last African Slaver.\u201d Parts of the article borrowed from another scholarly work, Emma Langdon Roche\u2019s \u201cHistoric Sketches of the South,\u201d without proper attribution, and the appearance of plagiarism cast a shadow over \u201cBarracoon.\u201d Robert E. Hemenway, who published a biography of Hurston in 1977, treated \u201cBarracoon\u201d as an extension of the article, and argued that Hurston had taken creative liberties, recreating Lewis\u2019s story \u201cas an artist rather than as a folklorist or historian.\u201d\n\nAfter she failed to publish \u201cBarracoon,\u201d Hurston threw herself into other projects. She wrote \u201cMules and Men,\u201d a collection of African-American folklore. She traveled to Jamaica and Haiti to research voodoo, and wrote about the experience in \u201cTell My Horse.\u201d In Haiti, she wrote her novel \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God\u201d in a feverish seven weeks.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn her final decades, she slipped into obscurity.

His black-on-black \u201cBlack Dada\u201d paintings \u2014 which incorporate letters from the titular phrase \u2014 reference the artistic and literary movement that arose in reaction to what he has referred to as the \u201cstate-sanctioned physical and intellectual brutality\u201d of World War I, as well as LeRoi Jones\u2019s 1964 poem, \u201cBlack Dada Nihilismus.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. Pendleton may qualify as a millennial, he does his reading in hard copy, rising around 5:30 a.m. in his apartment in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn to immerse himself in books or essays before breakfast.\n\nHe typically gravitates toward cultural theorists, poets and critics \u2014 Stuart Hall\u2019s posthumous memoir, \u201cFamiliar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands,\u201d about growing up in Jamaica in the 1930s; Fred Moten\u2019s \u201cIn the Break: The Aesthetics of the Black Radical Tradition,\u201d on the connections between jazz, sexual identity and radical black politics; Judith Butler\u2019s \u201cPrecarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence,\u201d a look at the vulnerability and aggression that followed Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he came into this world as a 50-year-old man,\u201d Ms. Edwards said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sage.\u201d\n\nThe shelves in Mr. Pendleton\u2019s Richmond, Va., childhood home included the poets Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich. His mother, a retired elementary schoolteacher, wanted to be a writer (his father, a contractor, is also a musician). Young Adam started writing poetry and plays at an early age.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cMy mom said, \u2018When you buy a book you\u2019re not really spending money,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI would never buy 100 shirts a year, but I know I buy 100 books a year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPainting for hours a day in his basement as a teenager, Mr. Pendleton finished high school two years early, studied art in northern Italy and then moved to New York.\n\nHe came out to his mother as gay on New Year\u2019s Eve 1999, just before the new millennium. \u201cI think I wanted it to be something I would remember,\u201d he said. (He married Karsten Ch\u2019ien, co-founder of the Yumami Food Company, two years ago.)\n\n\u201cMy parents did this really generous thing,\u201d Mr. Pendleton, said of growing up with his older brother and younger sister. \u201cThey let us be who we are.\u201d\n\nReviewing the artist\u2019s first solo show, \u201cBeing Here,\u201d at Wallspace in 2004, Roberta Smith wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Pendleton\u2019s \u201ctext-based works bring a no-frills simplicity to interactive art.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Race/Related Newsletter Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with a diverse group of New York Times journalists.

Ms. Hoptman asked Mr. Pendleton to participate in the New Museum\u2019s first triennial in 2009.\n\nEventually, Pace got interested (Mr. Pendleton is also represented by Galerie Eva Presenhuber in Zurich, Galerie Max Hetzler in Berlin, and Galeria Pedro Cera in Portugal). \u201cHe is assembling an intuitive poetry out of language, which roots itself in his experience \u2014 the African-American experience,\u201d said Marc Glimcher, Pace\u2019s president. \u201cThe result is what art should be.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAt first, Mr. Pendleton felt out of place at such an established gallery. But after digging into the history of its artists, from Agnes Martin to Robert Ryman, \u201cI realized that in a strange way it did make sense,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I disrupted that space \u2014 a young African-American artist showing alongside these giants.\u201d\n\nWhile the artist\u2019s bright eyes and boyish cheeks convey a callowness, he also has a deliberative way of working that suggests he won\u2019t be pushed into overproducing (he makes about 12 works a year).\n\nWith his work now hanging in institutions like MoMA and the Tate, Mr. Pendleton said the current effort by museums to better incorporate black artists has only just begun. \u201cI hope they realize how deep they have to go, how long it will take,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t just be one show,\u201d he added, citing as an example the survey of little-known sculpture by the American artist Jack Whitten, which opened April 22 at the Baltimore Museum of Art and comes to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in September. \u201cIt has to be many \u2014 many shows, many essays, many conversations. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d\n\nSara Friedlander, the head of Christie\u2019s Post-War & Contemporary Art department in New York, said that Mr. Pendelton\u2019s auction strength is reflecting a transition in art buyers. \u201cWe\u2019re in a moment right now where people are not just about what they\u2019re looking at on their walls, but the intention and the meaning behind it,\u201d she said. Mr. Pendleton, she added, \u201cis making art that is about a specific moment in history that we all have to pay attention to.\u201d\n\nDespite the commercial pressures, the artist insists he has stayed focused on the work. \u201cThe studio is the first place I want to be and the last place I want to leave,\u201d he said.\n\nStill fresh in his memory are the days when he first moved to New York City, found himself \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and moved upstate to Germantown for five years \u2014 in part because it was more affordable. When recalling how a landlord let him live rent-free for the first six months, Mr. Pendleton\u2019s eyes fill with tears.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHowever difficult the road has been at times, Mr. Pendleton said his upbringing kept him feeling rooted and supported. \u201cI knew I could go home \u2014 it allows you to take risks,\u201d he said. \u201cEven now I think to myself: at least I can go home.\u201d", "title": "A Young Artist and Disrupter Plants His Flag for Black Lives", "authors": ["Robin Pogrebin"]}

In El Salvador, a potent power punch of religious conservatives, business interests, and political and social elites continue to uphold this cruel law, which has hurt and killed so many poor women and girls.\n\nCatholics revere the primacy of individual conscience, including the sacred right of each and every individual to make her own ethical decisions over her body. From Chile to Ireland, citizens in traditionally Catholic countries have been given the chance to debate the morality of draconian abortion laws that punish women, especially poor women.\n\nAnd as we saw in Chile, the majority of Catholics ultimately come to the conclusion that we must trust women and put their freedom and dignity first.

In the past several months, the European Union, France and Britain have announced billions of dollars worth of new financing for venture capital firms and start-ups.

The report, likening Renamo to the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, accused Mr. Dhlakama\u2019s troops \u2014 some of them child soldiers \u2014 of a string of massacres, including one at Homoine in which more than 400 civilians died. Mr. Dhlakama denied the charges, insisting that government forces staged atrocities to discredit the dissidents.\n\n\u201cIf we were just a bunch of bandits we would have been caught and been handed over to government forces long ago,\u201d he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1988. \u201cOur aim is not to win the war militarily but to force the Frelimo government to accept our conditions\u201d for establishing democracy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfonso Dhlakama was born on Jan. 1, 1953, in the Sofala Province of central Mozambique, the son of a traditional ruler. He was educated by Roman Catholic seminarians in the Indian Ocean port city of Beira, according to \u201cThe Battle for Mozambique,\u201d a study by an American analyst of African affairs, Stephen A. Emerson.\n\nHe was conscripted into the Portuguese colonial army but deserted to join Frelimo. When he defected to Renamo, the study said, the Frelimo authorities said he had been dismissed for corruption and misconduct \u2014 charges he denied.\n\nMr. Dhlakama rose rapidly through the Renamo ranks, and when its leader, Andr\u00e9 Matsangaissa, was killed in action in 1979, he took over the organization and presided over the expansion of its ragtag army into a force numbering up to 20,000 guerrillas.\n\nIn his 1988 interview, Mr. Dhlakama said the guerrillas\u2019 hit-and-run strikes against towns held by the Mozambican Army were designed \u201cto demoralize and lower the profile of the enemy\u201d rather than hold territory. \u201cIt serves no purpose to hold towns that are empty,\u201d he said. His forces also struck at vital regional transport links.\n\nRenamo was always hostage to events beyond its control. As South Africa\u2019s support for the dissidents slowly dwindled, the Frelimo government drew on backing from Zimbabwean, Tanzanian and Zambian troops and persuaded a key supporter, Malawi, to cease aiding the rebels in 1986. For all that, Renamo\u2019s control of so-called liberated rural areas turned many remote towns into islands of government control, reachable only by air.\n\nIn 1992, Mr. Dhlakama signed a peace treaty with the Mozambican president, Joaquim Chissano; after a blanket amnesty, Renamo became a legal political party but retained its guerrilla force. In successive presidential elections \u2014 Mr. Dhlakama contested all of them \u2014 the government\u2019s candidates won every vote, and in 2013, Renamo said it was abandoning the 1992 peace accord.\n\nMr. Dhlakama left Maputo and returned to his wartime hide-outs in Gorongosa, losing yet another presidential election in 2014 and facing a string of assassination attempts.\n\nHe announced a truce in 2016 and a year later held talks with President Nyusi aiming at a reconciliation with Frelimo, which has held power without interruption since Mozambique\u2019s independence.\n\nFollowing his death, President Nyusi called him \u201ca citizen who always worked for Mozambique,\u201d news reports said. \u201cI hope that we as Mozambicans can continue to do everything so things do not go down.\u201d", "title": "Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique\u2019s Opposition Leader, Dies at 65", "authors": ["Alan Cowell"]}

Because of changes made by Mr. Orban in 2011, she was subsequently made president of the National Judiciary Office.\n\nIn that role, Ms. Hando wields broad control over court finances, senior judicial appointments and disciplinary procedures, though her powers were slightly moderated following pressure from Europe\u2019s leading rights watchdog.\n\nWithin the judiciary, her decisions can only be challenged by the National Judicial Council, a panel of 15 judges elected by their peers.\n\nFor years, the council did little to obstruct Ms. Hando\u2019s activities. But after new members were elected in January, the council began to challenge her authority, announcing an investigation into her hiring practices.\n\nThen Mr. Orban won the election.

Still, the report has limitations: An apartment listed on Airbnb does not always translate into a unit lost in the long-term rental market, because apartments may be rented for a short amount of time a year.\n\nAirbnb officials said the report confused causation with correlation by blaming the company for higher rents that could have been raised by other factors, like rezoning. However, the comptroller\u2019s study included variables like household income, population, and employment rates.\n\n\u201cComptroller Stringer\u2019s report severely misrepresents the impact of our platform on housing and is full of elementary methodological mistakes,\u201d said Andrew Kalloch, a policy manager at Airbnb. \u201cNew Yorkers deserve better from their chief financial officer.\u201d\n\nMr. Stringer said in response, \u201cThe methodology is sound.\u201d\n\nMr. Kalloch said Airbnb\u2019s effect on rents was insignificant because listings represent less than 1 percent of apartments in the city. But he acknowledged that some neighborhoods have a significantly higher share of Airbnb rentals. He also said that using 2009 as a starting point distorts the findings because rents in New York tanked during the Great Recession that year.\n\nMost New Yorkers, Mr. Kalloch said, use Airbnb as a source of extra income to make ends meet and that entire apartments are rented for a median of 60 nights a year. But Airbnb has long been scrutinized by officials because some landlords use Airbnb to effectively run illegal hotels in residential buildings.\n\nAnd some New York tenants use the platform to rent spare bedrooms to travelers year-round, often in violation of housing rules or without the permission of their landlords.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings).\n\nWhich is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) loomed large at the just-completed AT&T-Time Warner trial and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation.\n\nAT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. \u201cThe media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,\u201d he testified. \u201cIt\u2019s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.\u201d\n\nThe Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. \u201cThey have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,\u201d he said, adding that by \u201cthey\u201d he meant the FANGs. \u201cAnd they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.\u201d\n\nIn closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner\u2019s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year.\n\nThe government\u2019s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: \u201cThe fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn\u2019t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,\u201d he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.)\n\nAT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as \u201cthe wolves at the door,\u201d said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s the center of their theory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTime Warner\u2019s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, \u201care just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nOf course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn\u2019t need to buy a company like Time Warner \u2014 it could create a media content company of its own. That\u2019s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming.\n\nBut from a consumer standpoint, it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThe major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,\u201d Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. \u201cIn turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is \u2014 would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?\u201d\n\nWhether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest \u2014 it could well influence Judge Richard Leon\u2019s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal.\n\nMaking a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts.\n\nThe Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger \u2014 a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny.\n\nThe government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services \u2014 exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile.\n\nSo the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn\u2019t harm consumers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn\u2019t have the power to raise prices.\n\nThat may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future.\n\nCourts and antitrust regulators \u201cdon\u2019t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,\u201d said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. \u201cOur crystal balls aren\u2019t that good. We don\u2019t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.\u201d\n\nWhile Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, \u201cthis whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.\u201d\n\nPerhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they\u2019re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition.\n\nThen again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration\u2019s antitrust policies, \u201cthey may feel there\u2019s no reason not to roll the dice now,\u201d Mr. Hovenkamp said.", "title": "Amazon, the Elephant in the Antitrust Room", "authors": ["James B.

Its challenges have been aggravated by the election of President Trump, as he has pushed tougher policies on such issues as immigration and the environment, running up against strong and often bipartisan sentiment in California.\n\nA field of Republican candidates for the United States Senate and governor is struggling against these headwinds as they seek to end a more than 10-year drought and elect a party member to statewide office. Under the California election system, candidates compete in an open, nonpartisan primary on June 5. The two candidates who get the most votes \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 advance to the November general election.", "title": "An Urgent Debate for California Republicans: How to Get Back in the Game", "authors": []}

In the three months through the end of March, Apple bought back $23.5 billion of shares, an unusually large sum by the company\u2019s standards.

And Apple\u2019s C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said on a conference call Tuesday that Apple wanted its buybacks to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201cefficient.\u201d But he also said he wanted them to be \u201cfast.\u201d\n\n- Peter Eavis\n\nWhat will Apple do with all that cash?\n\nInvestors expected Apple to announce a large share repurchase program heading into this quarter\u2019s earnings, and the iPhone maker didn\u2019t disappoint. Apple announced a new $100 billion buyback program.\n\nThe coffers of corporate America are straining under the weight of spare cash. And none more than Apple. Apple was forced to pay taxes on more than $250 billion held overseas as part of the tax overhaul President Trump signed into law late last year.\n\nAnd investors are reaping some of the rewards from the windfall. Apple bought back $32.9 billion in stock during the first six months of its fiscal year, according to just announced results. Last quarter alone, Apple repurchased $22.8 billion in shares, a record for any company in any quarter, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices data.\n\n\n\nApple\u2019s earnings by the numbers\n\nShares of Apple are up 4 percent after the iPhone maker\u2019s results beat expectations and it announced a $100 billion buyback program.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the numbers:\n\n\u2022 Apple reported a net income of $13.82 billion for its fiscal second quarter, up 25 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u2022 Earnings per share came in at $2.73, above analysts expectations of $2.67 per share.\n\n\u2022 Revenue increased 16 percent to $61.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of 60.82 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Revenue from its services business hit a record of $9.2 billion.\n\n\u2022 Apple sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, up 2.9 percent from a year ago.\n\n\u2022 Revenue from iPhone sales increased 14 percent from a year ago to $38.03 billion.\n\n\u2022 The average selling price of an iPhone was $728, up from $655 a year ago but down from $796 last quarter.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s cash pile shrank to $267.2 billion from $285.1 billion at the end of its fiscal first quarter.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn other earnings news, Snap is down 15 percent\n\nSnap\u2019s recent redesign of its Snapchat app didn\u2019t go over well with its users. Now it is impacting its results.\n\nNellie Bowles of the NYT writes:\n\n\u201cFor the first three months of the year, the social media company posted a narrower loss than a year ago and a 54 percent increase in revenue to $231 million, which was below analyst expectations. While Snap\u2019s number of daily users rose to 191 million in the quarter, that figure was also below what Wall Street had anticipated. And the company said its user numbers in March were even lower, though it did not release them.\u201d\n\nEvan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, cited Snapchat\u2019s redesign as a major factor for the disappointing performance.\n\n\u201cA change this big to existing behavior comes with some disruption,\u201d he said, referring later to \u201cheadwinds from the redesign.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Trump administration is discovering the difficulty of fighting a multi-front war.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s decision on Monday to hold off on imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on a number of countries came as the United States is engaged in a separate trade battle with China and is negotiating changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nFrom the time the tariffs on steel and aluminum were announced in late February, they seemed the least promising part of Mr. Trump\u2019s combative trade policy. Not only were the measures directed in part at allies, the European Union and Canada among them, the administration convinced few with their argument that imports of the two metals were threatening national security.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd when announcing the tariffs, the Trump administration immediately granted temporary exemptions to certain countries. The move suggested loopholes and concessions might be available, an impression that will likely persist after Mr. Trump on Monday extended negotiations with Mexico, Canada and the European Union for 30 days.\n\nThe new deadline may help push along Nafta negotiations with Mexico and Canada, but the European Union is becoming a big problem for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda. The bloc has gained another reprieve from the steel and aluminum tariffs and apparently has given up nothing.\n\nThat has likely put the European Union in a stronger position, which it may now use in negotiations with the United States to end the tariffs threat. The bloc could use an opening to try forge a narrower version of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. But such an outcome would take many months to finalize and probably would not look like a win for Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.\n\nAnd the European Union\u2019s stance has hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs strategy in another crucial way. The tariffs were said to be a cudgel to persuade allies to back the United States in its trade actions against China. The European Union, which shares some of the United States\u2019 frustrations with China\u2019s trade practices, may eventually back Mr. Trump against China. But the longer the tensions between the European Union and the United States persist, the less likely it is that they align.\n\nIndeed, the divide the tariffs created between the United States and its allies, and Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to delay them, may be strengthening China\u2019s resolve. The country\u2019s trade negotiators are preparing to reject two major demands of the United States, for instance.\n\nMr. Trump famously said trade wars are easy to win. But, as he is finding out, this is not the case when they are fought on three fronts at once.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nThe E.U., Mexico and Canada got a reprieve. Now what?\n\nWith his administration delaying tariffs on steel and aluminum from those partners by another 30 days, President Trump has so far avoided starting a multinational trade war with key allies. But is there any progress toward a permanent accord with them?\n\nAnd the delay poses a risk, per Ana Swanson of the NYT:\n\nIt could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.\n\nThe E.U. is still demanding a permanent exemption, and said the extension \u201cprolongs market uncertainty.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing said it wouldn\u2019t discuss two key trade demands \u2014 a $100 billion cut in the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit with China and curbs on a $300 billion Chinese plan to invest in advanced tech like A.I. and electric cars \u2014 when a U.S. delegation arrives this week.

Apple earned $2.73 a share, it said, beating Wall Street estimates by 6 cents. Revenue rose 16 percent to $61.1 billion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe three months ending with March were Apple\u2019s first full quarter selling its new flagship phone, the iPhone X. Analysts had pointed to signs, including the financial results of Apple\u2019s suppliers, that the device and its sister iPhone 8 and 8 Plus had not revitalized Apple\u2019s iPhone business as the company had hoped. Many analysts lowered their estimates for Apple in recent weeks as a result.\n\nApple said it sold 52.2 million iPhones in the quarter, or 3 percent more than a year earlier. But an 11 percent increase in their average price \u2014 driven by the $1,000 iPhone X \u2014 helped raise iPhone revenue by 14 percent.\n\nTimothy D.

Apple said revenue in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong had risen 21 percent to $13 billion, the largest increase in 10 quarters.\n\nAnd Apple\u2019s services revenue, which includes iCloud and Apple Music subscriptions and its share of app sales, rose 31 percent to $9.2 billion.

So the perception that this is basically a tax cut for the rich is right.\n\nBut why aren\u2019t the benefits of the tax cut flowing to workers?\n\nOne answer is that even if the pro-tax-cut story were true for the long run, it would take many years of extremely high investment to achieve the kind of capacity expansion that would cause major wage gains. Another is that the global capital market isn\u2019t as global as all that \u2014 the investment world, we might say, is still a long way from being flat. America is a huge economy, and even in the long run it can\u2019t attract the kind of capital inflows tax-cut enthusiasts envision without offering significantly higher rates of return \u2014 which means more for stockholders and less for workers.\n\nAnd at a deeper level, tax-cut enthusiasts may have a fundamentally out-of-date view about where profits come from.\n\nIn the world according to Trump officials, or right-wing think tanks like the Tax Foundation, corporate profits are basically a return on physical capital \u2014 on bricks and mortar and machines. Cut taxes, and companies will add more physical capital, increasing competition for labor, and profits will go down while wages go up.\n\nApple, however, is nothing like that. Its profits come from its market position \u2014 its brand, if you like. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you think it deserves its role as a quasi-monopolist; what matters is that given its position, it can and does charge what the market will bear, pretty much regardless of costs. If Trump cuts its taxes, it gets to keep more of its profits, but it has no real incentive to change its behavior by, say, building more Apple stores. It just takes the extra money and either sits on it or hands it back to stockholders via buybacks.\n\nAnd these days a lot of corporate America is at least a bit like Apple. Not all of it; there are still businesses \u2014 say, trucking companies \u2014 whose value resides largely in the stuff they own. But economic \u201crents,\u201d profits not tied to physical capital, are a big, growing story. And when you cut taxes on rents, there\u2019s no reason at all to expect workers to share the bounty, even in the long run.\n\nThe bottom line \u2014 which will remain true no matter how much the Kochs spend trying to convince you otherwise \u2014 is that what looks like a big giveaway to wealthy investors is, in fact, a big giveaway to wealthy investors.", "title": "Opinion | Apple and the Fruits of Tax Cuts", "authors": []}

What do you think of the game?\n\nIn \u201cParenting the Fortnite Addict,\u201d Lisa Damour writes:\n\nEvery so often a game comes along that conquers the hearts, minds and thumbs of gamers everywhere. Fortnite: Battle Royale is the latest victor in this category. According to a report last week from the market research firm SuperData, the game generated $223 million in March, and it begins a new season \u2014 with a new theme and a few other changes \u2014 on May 1. Like a cross between Minecraft and the Hunger Games, Fortnite drops 100 competitors on an island and requires them to scavenge for weapons and other resources, build defensive structures and vanquish opponents in a quest to become the last player standing. The game itself is free and playable on game systems, computers and mobile phones alike, but players pay for accessories and costumes for their characters. Not surprisingly, middle and high schools are finding themselves at odds with students who surreptitiously play the game throughout the day. The game is also popular with adults, including Major League Baseball players, who compellingly bring an element of the game into real life through victory dances on the field based on dances from the game. For parents bewildered by the sense that the game has swallowed their children, especially since the mobile phone version was released in late March, here\u2019s some information that may help. It\u2019s a Social Experience \u2026 While Fortnite can be played solo, it is often a social experience as friends can team up in pairs or fours. If they\u2019re not together physically, they communicate \u2014 over FaceTime, a headset linked to a game system, or the like \u2014 to coordinate strategy, alert teammates to threats, root for one another and trade banter. \u2026 \u2026 But It Is Built to Be Addictive Fortnite incorporates much of what game designers know about how to ensure a captive audience. Some of what hooks players is obvious: it has quality graphics, a sense of humor and advances rapidly.

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "The rate increase, a day after the Argentine peso fell 8.5 percent against the dollar, was the third in a week. The central bank said it would use \u201call the tools at its disposal\u201d to slow inflation, which in March was up 25 percent from a year earlier, to 15 percent this year, a goal most analysts now see as unrealistic.\n\nIn parallel, officials announced that they would cut government spending, and reduce the primary budget deficit to 2.7 percent, from the earlier goal of 3.2 percent. Their decision was seen as a response to criticism from investors that Mr. Macri\u2019s government had not been cutting spending quickly enough.\n\nMr. Macri was sworn into office in December 2015. Argentina had been closed to international markets for more than a decade amid a long-running legal fight with bondholders that followed a default on its debt.\n\nEarly on, Mr. Macri\u2019s policies were greeted with widespread optimism by financial markets, which gobbled up the country\u2019s newly issued bonds.\n\nIn a show of market confidence, prices for the country\u2019s government bonds rose, pushing interest rates lower. Those lower rates helped to stimulate economic growth.\n\n\u201cThere was overconfidence on the part of policymakers about how much could be done given the constraints they had,\u201d said Alvaro Vivanco, a strategist covering Latin American bond and currency markets for the Spanish bank BBVA.\n\nBut doubts about the government\u2019s ability to quickly push through the changes have emerged in recent months. In January, Argentina\u2019s central bank cut interest rates and increased its inflation target, a decision interpreted by some as weakening the government\u2019s commitment to getting consumer prices under control.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe central bank was cutting, with inflation expectations deteriorating,\u201d said Gabriel Gersztein, head of Latin American strategy at BNP Paribas. \u201cAnd this was a wake-up call for international investors.\u201d\n\nThe global economic backdrop has also been changing. With the United States economy on solid footing, its short-term interest rates have been rising. That has put upward pressure on the United States dollar, and has resulted in a slide for the peso. That decline in the peso has accelerated in recent days, as foreign investors began to see their returns vaporized by the falling currency.\n\nPeople moved to the exits, in part because of a new income tax on foreign investors. As more and more investors pulled out, Argentina was suddenly facing a currency run.\n\nArgentine officials have struggled to shore up the currency. Since March, Argentina has spent more than $7.7 billion of its international reserves, with the pace speeding up late last week.\n\nGovernments have a few tools they can use to stem the outflow of capital. One of them is to sharply raise interest rates. Those higher rates translate into potentially stronger returns for investors. As such, they can attract money into an economy, which helps prop up a currency.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nBut it\u2019s a tricky play to pull off.\n\nBrazil raised interest rates sharply to stop an outflow of capital in the late 1990s, ultimately pushing benchmark interest rates to roughly 40 percent. More recently, in 2014, Turkey suddenly ratcheted up a key central bank rate to 10 percent from 4.5 percent in order to stop a sell-off in the lira.\n\nThat same year, the central bank of Russia pushed interest rates sharply higher \u2014 to 17 percent from 10.5 percent \u2014 to keep the ruble from collapsing in response to sanctions over the annexation of Crimea and a sharp drop in oil prices. Russia also has one of the biggest interest-rate jumps on record, when in 1998 its rates reached 150 percent in an effort to stem another impending collapse of the ruble.\n\nBut high interest rates have economic costs. They make it particularly difficult for businesses and consumer to borrow money. The lack of spending, in turn, can slow growth and ultimately spark a recession.\n\nThe key for Argentina will be to keep rates high just long enough to inspire confidence that policymakers have halted the currency run, but not so long that the increase drains the economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis was done in order to stop the bleeding,\u201d Mr. Gersztein of BNP Paribas said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you have someone in the E.R. You need to take very short-term, bold decisions.\n\n\u201cThen once you stabilize the patient,\u201d he added, \u201cyou need to take different decisions in order to make the patient get better and recover.\u201d\n\nPolitically, it all puts Mr. Macri in a more precarious position.\n\nIn recent months, his popularity has declined. In an April poll of Argentines by Synopsis, a local consultancy, 43 percent said they had a negative view of the government, compared with 34 percent with a positive view. That was a sharp shift from November, when nearly 52 percent said they had a positive image of the government and Mr. Macri\u2019s allies did better than expected in midterm elections.\n\nThe president is now balancing the concerns of a restive population and the needs of international investors \u2014 and they don\u2019t necessarily want the same thing.\n\nInternational investors want assurance that Mr. Macri will continue to cut spending and stick with other parts of his plan. But those same efforts are frustrating certain constituencies at home.\n\nUnions are worried that workers are losing purchasing power amid high inflation and a broad increase in public utility rates, part of the government\u2019s efforts to decrease spending by slashing subsidies. Hundreds gathered on Friday in downtown Buenos Aires outside the National Electricity Regulator for a union protest against recent increases in utility prices. Last month, thousands took to the streets to protest the hikes.\n\nThe higher utility costs are hitting the manufacturing sector hard, particularly companies that compete against imported goods.\n\nAncers, a tableware manufacturer in Buenos Aires, has seen its gas bill soar by 48 percent while electricity costs have doubled since the beginning of last year. During that time, the number of employees has declined by 25 percent, said Angel Vazquez, the company\u2019s founder and president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe may very well have to close soon,\u201d Mr. Vazquez said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can hold out for another year.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next with the economy may translate into whether Mr. Macri\u2019s coalition will win the presidential election next year or whether discontent will give rise to an interventionist government that will undo many of his changes. Although the economy as a whole is growing \u2014 expanding 5.1 percent in February, on the year \u2014 the latest measures are prompting some analysts to revise their forecasts downward.\n\n\u201cThe government so far has not been able to show big victories, and it\u2019s obvious that if it is going to take unpopular measures, its popularity will suffer,\u201d said Fausto Spotorno, the chief economist at Orlando Ferreres & Asociados, a local consultancy. \u201cBut it has rushed many of the measures so that it can avoid bad news next year.\u201d", "title": "Argentina Raises Key Rate to 40%, Bringing Economic Uncertainty", "authors": ["Daniel Politi", "Matt Phillips"]}

Others clearly found galling the idea that he was trying to leverage the threat of further street protests to push them into voting for him as prime minister.\n\nMany members called for further dialogue and negotiation with Mr. Pashinyan, so there were different theories about the strategy behind the stance of the Republican Party, whose members have held a virtual monopoly over political and economic power in Armenia since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nFirst, Mr. Pashinyan most likely worried members of the elite with his vow to dismantle political and economic monopolies, prompting them to seek negotiated guarantees before making him prime minister next week. Rejecting him put them in a better bargaining position.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSecond, party members might reject him again on Tuesday, figuring that even with their prospects damaged by the protests, they might as well take their chances in snap elections while they are still in power and in control of the electoral process.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe party did not put forward Karen Karapetyan, the acting prime minister and a Sargsyan ally, as a candidate for prime minister. Mr. Pashinyan was the only nominee, but anyone who garners support from one-third of lawmakers in Parliament can run next week. That opens the path for all kinds of bargaining and horse-trading among political factions.\n\nMr. Pashinyan vowed to keep up the pressure by taking the showdown to the streets. He has called for demonstrations every day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nOn Wednesday protesters spread across Yerevan, with people blocking not just roads but also the subway, universities, schools and government institutions. A group of lawyers blocked the entrance to the Ministry of Justice with three cars, according to local news reports. Workers at the airport also joined the strike, although Mr. Pashinyan urged them to return to work to avoid inconveniencing international travelers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Yet there is no evidence that the Houthis directly threaten the United States; they are an unsophisticated militant group with no operations outside Yemen and have not been classified by the American government as a terrorist group.\n\nThe Green Berets, the Army\u2019s Special Forces, deployed to the border in December, weeks after a ballistic missile fired from Yemen sailed close to Riyadh, the Saudi capital. The Saudi military said it intercepted the missile over the city\u2019s international airport \u2014 a claim that was cast in doubt by an analysis of photos and videos of the strike. But it was enough for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to renew a longstanding request that the United States send troops to help the kingdom combat the Houthi threat.\n\nA half-dozen officials \u2014 from the United States military, the Trump administration, and European and Arab nations \u2014 said the American commandos are training Saudi ground troops to secure their border. They also are working closely with American intelligence analysts in Najran, a city in southern Saudi Arabia that has been repeatedly attacked with rockets, to help locate Houthi missile sites within Yemen.\n\nAlong the porous border, the Americans are working with surveillance planes that can gather electronic signals to track the Houthi weapons and their launch sites, according to the officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the mission publicly.\n\nDuring a meeting on Capitol Hill in March, senators pressed Pentagon officials about the military\u2019s role in the Saudi-led conflict, demanding to know whether American troops were at risk of entering into hostilities against the Houthis.\n\nPentagon officials told the senators what had already been said publicly: that American forces stationed in Saudi Arabia only advised within the kingdom\u2019s borders and were focused mostly on border defense.\n\n\u201cWe are authorized to help the Saudis defend their border,\u201d Gen.

This one recalled many of the games from the last year\u2019s seven-game A.L.C.S. \u2014 rife with swings of momentum, tense at-bats and bullpen meltdowns.\n\nThe final crumbling came from the Astros, whose manager, A.J. Hinch, did not trust closer Ken Giles \u2014 who gave up a game-winning home run to Gary Sanchez on Tuesday \u2014 to finish the game.\n\nInstead, carrying a 5-3 lead into the top of the ninth, he turned to Will Harris.\n\nIn his postgame news conference, Hinch twice declined to answer questions why he did not turn to Giles, who said he was available. Said Giles: \u201cI\u2019m just there when they need me to win a ballgame.\u201d\n\nIn their comeback, the Yankees got pivotal contributions from two players who were far from the mayhem of last fall\u2019s playoff series: the rookie infielders Miguel Andujar and Gleyber Torres.\n\nAndujar watched the A.L.C.S. with his family in the Dominican Republic, while Torres followed from his apartment in Tampa, Fla., where he was recovering from surgery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter Neil Walker drew a walk from Harris to lead off the ninth, Andujar beat an infield shift by poking a 1-2 cutter into the enormous gap on the right side of the infield. Pinch-hitter Aaron Hicks singled to left to load the bases, and Brad Peacock came in to replace Harris.\n\nPhoto\n\nTorres hooked an 0-1 slider down the left-field line and Andujar, with an aggressive jump, scored easily along with Walker to tie it at 5-5 as the ball dropped in front of left fielder Derek Fisher.\n\nTorres, who had driven in a run earlier with a sacrifice fly, has played sterling defense and provided timely hits since his recall less than two weeks ago, qualities that might be expected from the organization\u2019s top prospect. But he has mostly impressed with how calmly he plays the game.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is to do simple and not try to put too much pressure on myself,\u201d said Torres, 21. \u201cFor example, on that hit, just try to put the ball in play.

The Astros were close to escaping the inning after Peacock had retired Brett Gardner on a fly ball to center that was too shallow to score Hicks from third, and Aaron Judge followed with a slow bouncer to third.\n\nAlex Bregman, who made the defensive play of the A.L.C.S. cutting down Greg Bird at the plate in Game 7, fielded the ball and delivered a perfect throw to Altuve, who in his haste to turn the double play, dropped the ball while taking it out of his glove. The drop allowed Hicks to score the go-ahead run.\n\nSuch drama seemed unlikely with the way Masahiro Tanaka had been in control, carrying a three-hit shutout and a 3-0 lead into the seventh inning and extending the Astros scoreless streak in this series to 28 innings.\n\nBut the unraveling came abruptly.\n\nYuli Gurriel hooked a 1-2 slider just out of the reach of shortstop Didi Gregorius in the hole. Josh Reddick followed by dropping a 2-2 splitter in front of Gardner in center field. On the next pitch, Tanaka\u2019s inside fastball grazed Bregman\u2019s sleeve to load the bases.\n\nBoone then summoned Chad Green.\n\nMarwin Gonzalez dribbled Green\u2019s first pitch toward Gregorius, who had no play by the time he collected the ball. Brian McCann lined the next pitch into right field to score Reddick and bring the Astros within 3-2. Three pitches later, Bregman raced home when Green hooked a 1-1 fastball past catcher Gary Sanchez, who was charged with a passed ball.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSuddenly, the scored was tied at 3-3.\n\nWhen Green couldn\u2019t handle George Springer\u2019s hard comebacker, Gonzalez raced home from third to give the Astros the lead. Carlos Correa extended it to 5-3 in the eighth with a blast off Green, who gave up all three hits on sliders.\n\nWhen the Yankees turned to Chapman, he was able to keep the lead safe \u2014 but it was not without some tension. He struck out Gonzalez and retired McCann on a pop up, but then a low, two-strike, 101 m.p.h. fastball to Evan Gattis ticked off the glove of Sanchez, who could not locate the ball \u2014 which had only bounced a few feet away \u2014 in time to throw out Gattis.\n\nSpringer then followed with a single.\n\nAsked, at that point, if he was thinking along with Chapman from his perch in center field, Gardner laughed.\n\n\u201cAm I thinking along with Chapman?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that? \u2018Throw harder, throw harder?\u2019\u201d\n\nChapman, who began the inning throwing between 96 and 98 m.p.h., found another gear with his fastball by the time Altuve came up. The second baseman swung through a 100 m.p.h. fastball, looked at a 101 m.p.h. heater and then whiffed on the final one.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s as pumped up as anybody when he comes in the game, even though he may not show it,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHe\u2019s always pretty stoic and serious out there.

Real censure is subject to veto, making it difficult for Brussels to challenge democratically elected leaders, even when their practices in office are suspect.\n\nBut the challenge is of fundamental importance, argued Adam LeBor, an analyst of Central Europe. \u201cBeyond Brexit and migration,\u201d he wrote in The Financial Times, \u201cthe new Kulturkampf over national identity may be the biggest threat to the E.U.\u2019s future unity and stability.\u201d\n\nSo the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s bureaucracy, is considering tying new aid to the credibility of the judiciary in member states, on the principle that oversight of European Union spending must depend on the rule of law and independent judges.\n\nSuch a change would attempt to skirt contentious judgments about \u201cvalues\u201d and instead shift the debate to sound financial management. Importantly, the finance rules work on a form of majority voting, eliminating the veto.\n\nFines would be considered approved unless the European Council, made up of the heads of government, votes to repeal them.\n\nAnd even if those fines and aid reductions are passed, governments that are punished would still be liable to fulfill their budget obligations to fund agricultural and investment subsidies out of their own tax receipts.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat all may be too clever to survive the long process of approval. And even if successful, it would not take effect until at least 2021. But it is an effort to hit countries that have flouted European values and norms in the pocketbook.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAll this is cresting because the European Union is beginning to debate its budget framework for 2021 through 2027, a budget that will have to deal with a significant reduction in funds given Britain\u2019s intention to leave the bloc and stop paying into its budget after a transition period that will end in December 2020. Currently, about 10 percent of the European Union\u2019s budget comes from Britain.\n\nCompared with the national budgets of its 28 member states, the European Union budget is small. The last seven-year budget, passed in 2013, amounted to only about one percent of the European Union\u2019s gross national income, about 155 billion euros, or about $186 billion, a year.\n\nBut about 9 percent of the European Union budget goes to Poland alone. Another 2.5 percent goes to much smaller Hungary.\n\nThat money reflects the bloc\u2019s extraordinary commitment to aiding the development of its newer and poorer members, measured by gross domestic product per capita. It is also important to those countries\u2019 growth and the popularity of their governments.\n\nFor instance, Hungary\u2019s healthy growth rate of 3 percent a year would be as low as 1 percent without those regional support funds, known also as cohesion funds.\n\nPhoto\n\nRecipient countries argue that much of that money is spent on buying equipment and services from some net-contributor states, like Germany and France, and returns to them in the form of markets and profits.\n\nThe Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, has called the suggestion to tie political conditions to European Union funds \u201cpolitical blackmail.\u201d He has pointed out that Hungary opened its markets to the bloc in 2004, when the economy was far from competitive.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to suggest that the E.U. cohesion fund is a gift for central and eastern member states,\u201d he said here last year.\n\nThere are expected to be other contentious proposals, too. The distribution of regional support would be based not just on national income per capita but on other indicators like youth unemployment and migration burdens.\n\nThat is a clear effort to help older members like Italy and Greece that have borne the brunt of refugee and migrant flows, and other southern countries like Spain and Portugal, where youth unemployment is high.\n\nCohesion funds for newer member states could be cut by as much as 6 percent to make room for these other kinds of aid.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Wake Up With The Times, Anywhere in the World.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nTo a casual observer, the art world probably looks like nothing more than a corporate monolith producing easy profits for auction houses, galleries and collectors, all attracted to the sale of art for its potential investment opportunities. Christie\u2019s reported art sales totaling $6.6 billion in 2017, anchored by the sale of a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting \u2014 which became the most expensive artwork ever sold \u2014 even though its authenticity was questioned by scholars and critics. In March, at the Art Basel fair in Hong Kong (a trade show featuring 248 galleries from across the globe), a co-founder of Microsoft sold a Willem de Kooning painting for $35 million. Later this month, a $150 million Modigliani will go on sale at Sotheby\u2019s in New York, a highlight of a spring auction season that Bloomberg has already predicted \u201cis poised to be the biggest on record.\u201d The rise of this commercial aristocracy has become something of a philosophical dilemma for many in the art world: People seem more interested in money than art itself.\n\nOne gallery owner, Sean Kelly, is trying to change that. This week, he launches an initiative called Collect Wisely, an advertisement- and event-driven campaign that, he hopes, will reinvigorate the collecting class\u2019s interest in actual art. The campaign includes ads placed in various publications (including The New York Times) featuring phrases like \u201cWill history remember you as an investor or a collector?\u201d And near Kelly\u2019s shop on 10th Avenue is a billboard carrying the slogan \u201cConnoisseurship is not a dirty word.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, collecting is not about whether I\u2019m going to make a lot of money,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether I found something that I can\u2019t live without.\u201d But now, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s only about money.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a complaint many people who work in the art market have made in private, but as dissent grows with the direction of the business, it\u2019s become an increasingly public grievance among even successful galleries, like Kelly\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStill, saying that art has become too much about money is something of an odd position to take when you own a business that only exists if people spend money on art. Kelly is cautious about not calling out anyone in particular: \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to criticize anybody or say that anyone is doing something wrong,\u201d he says. He has ventured further into the belly of the beast by launching this initiative during the week of another major art fair \u2014 Frieze New York, which opens to collectors on Wednesday \u2014 where he will also be exhibiting. But in addition to trying to sell art at the fair, he\u2019ll be recording live conversations with collectors \u2014 which will eventually be published as part of a recurring podcast on the gallery\u2019s website \u2014 about what it means to be a connoisseur of art, rather than merely a shopper. A final tier of Collect Wisely will be a series of invite-only salons held at the gallery, where people from a variety of backgrounds \u2014 collectors, but also, Kelly hopes, writers, musicians and scientists \u2014 will gather for dinner and to discuss art\u2019s emotional, rather than monetary, value.\n\nTo underscore the importance of the project, Kelly mentioned one of the artists he represents, Kehinde Wiley, who recently painted the official presidential portrait of Barack Obama. Wiley\u2019s portrait was covered widely by outlets ranging from Artforum to CNN, and the painting has broken attendance records for the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., where it is now on view.

They get used for only a few minutes, but potentially last for hundreds of years in the ocean, and are among the top 10 pollutants collected during beach cleanups. Plastic straws kill marine life and choke reefs and beaches, never decomposing completely, but instead breaking into bits of microplastics, which eventually enter the food chain. And so the straw \u2014 ubiquitous in most restaurants, bars, cruise ships and luxury resorts \u2014 has become a prime example of how tourism can have a deeply negative effect on the environment.\n\nGlobal momentum has built in recent months to ban plastic straws and replace them with biodegradable ones, in part thanks to numerous social media campaigns using hashtags like #StrawsSuck and #TheLastStraw. In February, Queen Elizabeth II issued a rare royal decree banning plastic straws and bottles from all royal estates (and their cafes and gift shops) and pledged to reduce using other single-use plastics at all royal functions.\n\nIn Britain, the Queen\u2019s announcement was just the beginning. Several British corporations \u2014 including Waitrose, London City Airport, McDonalds UK and Costa Coffee \u2014 banned plastic straws. And in mid-April, Prime Minister Theresa May announced a Britain-wide ban on the sale of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton swabs, and called on the 52 Commonwealth nations to implement similar measures.\n\nElsewhere, cruise companies like P & O, Cunard and Royal Caribbean have announced limits on plastic straws, bottles and packaging aboard its ships, while Carnival will stop placing straws in glasses automatically, but won\u2019t outright ban them. Airlines have been sluggish to enact change, but, Fiji Airways and Thai Airways both pledged to significantly reduce single-use plastic onboard their fleets in 2018, while Ryanair aims to be \u201cplastic free\u201d by 2023.", "title": "Bans on Plastic Straws Are Growing.

Spain also began a process of political decentralization that gave regions their own parliaments and significant powers over areas like education and health. The Basque region and a neighbor, Navarre, also received the important right to collect taxes.\n\nBut ETA rejected such political concessions and instead stepped up its terror campaign demanding an independent state it called Euskal Herria. The group envisioned a nation that would stretch far beyond the modern borders of Spain\u2019s Basque region, to include Navarre and the Basque region of southwest France.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 1987, in its worst single attack, an ETA bomb killed 21 people at a Barcelona supermarket.\n\nBy then, each attack provoked a national outcry. In July 1997, six million people took to the streets to protest the assassination of Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco, a local conservative politician, who was kidnapped and killed by ETA.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, ETA announced several cease-fires and occasionally held talks with the Spanish government, first under the conservative prime minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, and then under the Socialist administration led by Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero. But the negotiations and cease-fires repeatedly broke down, while the Spanish government continued to ban politicians seen as being linked to ETA from running in elections.\n\nPhoto\n\nThen, after the arrests of many ETA leaders and operatives, the violence stopped. ETA last killed someone on Spanish soil in 2009, and its last victim anywhere was a French policeman, shot in 2010 during a botched car theft near Paris.\n\nThe group announced another cease-fire in October 2011, and this one held. Last year, it offered to disarm itself, and disclosed the locations of some of its weapons caches.\n\nEven as the government dealt with the emergency of another secessionist movement, this one in Catalonia, the Spanish authorities, working in close cooperation with French and other police forces, continued to arrest ETA members and seize hidden weapons. Security experts say the group has been so depleted that it can no longer carry out operations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSince the 2011 cease-fire, the conservative government has rejected international mediation efforts, determined not to allow ETA a brokered deal like the one that ended hostilities in Northern Ireland between the British government and the Irish Republican Army. The Spanish government fears that ETA members and sympathizers could score political points with a negotiated surrender.\n\nLast month, Spain\u2019s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, warned that ETA would not win any concessions in return for dissolving itself. One of the outstanding issues is whether the government will transfer imprisoned ETA members, who are scattered across the rest of Spain, to prisons in the Basque region.\n\nETA \u201cdidn\u2019t get anything for stopping to kill and will not get anything for declaring its disappearance,\u201d Mr. Zoido said.\n\nAlfonso Alonso, the leader of Spain\u2019s governing Popular Party in the Basque region, also poured cold water on the significance of ETA\u2019s plan to dissolve itself.\n\n\u201cNeither its history nor its responsibility can be dissolved,\u201d Mr. Alonso said recently. \u201cWe will never forgive ETA.\u201d", "title": "Basque Group ETA Disbands, After Terrorist Campaign Spanning Generations", "authors": ["Raphael Minder"]}

He\u2019s na\u00efve and fairly pure of heart, generally assuming the best in everyone.\n\nHe also happens to live in a pineapple in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom. The town is kind of an aquatic ecosystem unto itself, inhabited as it is by a colorful assortment of anthropomorphic marine animals that you wouldn\u2019t expect to see cohabitating in a tank at your local aquarium.\n\nWho else is there?\n\nAmong the principal characters in \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d are a dimwitted starfish named Patrick who lives under a rock, a surly octopus named Squidward Tentacles who resides in a moai statue, a parsimonious crab who owns a fast-food restaurant, a teenage sperm whale who is somehow the crab\u2019s daughter, a Texan squirrel in scuba gear and a plankton bent on world domination who is married to an apparently waterproof supercomputer.\n\nWow, that\u2019s \u2014\n\nAlso, SpongeBob has a pet sea snail named Gary who meows like a house cat. Despite this, the show\u2019s other characters can generally understand him, and Gary often serves as the voice of reason.\n\nHold on, what?\n\nNow seems like the time to mention that \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d describes itself as \u201cnautical nonsense\u201d in its opening theme song, which ought to give you a sense of the show\u2019s whimsical tone.\n\nAs might be suggested by a cartoon about a humanoid kitchen tool, \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d is replete with visual gags and aquatic puns. For example: When SpongeBob and Patrick go \u201cjellyfishing,\u201d they\u2019re catching jellyfish in butterfly nets and then milking them for their jelly. In another early episode, SpongeBob also plays hooky \u2014 which involves not only ditching work but also having fun with fishing hooks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMuch of the show\u2019s humor also has cross-generational appeal. The show was designed for children, but it\u2019s peppered with in-jokes that wink at teenagers and adults. Take SpongeBob\u2019s squirrel friend, who is named Sandy Cheeks. (In the spirit of \u201cSpongeBob,\u201d we\u2019ll let you work it out for yourself.)\n\nHow did this become a big deal?\n\nLongevity, for starters. \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d made its debut in 1999 on Nickelodeon. It was created and developed by Stephen Hillenburg, an animator who had previously worked as a marine science educator.\n\nNineteen years later, the show is still running. The cartoon is currently in its 11th season and has aired more than 230 episodes, making it Nickelodeon\u2019s longest-running series.\n\n\u201cSpongeBob\u201d has also spawned video games, comic books and two movie adaptations. A third movie is due in 2020. When the musical was set to make its debut on Broadway in 2017, The New York Times reported that the \u201cSpongeBob\u201d franchise had been responsible for more than $13 billion in merchandise sales.\n\nThe other thing that happened: SpongeBob\u2019s quirky underwater world saturated the internet just as it was rapidly expanding.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nMore like \u201cwhat do you meme?\u201d\n\n(Fine, I\u2019ll leave the jokes to the \u201cSpongeBob\u201d writers.)\n\nRemember, \u201cSpongeBob\u201d really took off when many early online meme creators were children. As internet remix culture developed, so did they. At one point in the late 2000s, the show even aired on late-night MTV, surrounded by psychedelic, tie-dye bumpers.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And with its high episode count, the show offers a lot of cultural references. It\u2019s easy meme fodder.\n\nSo what are the memes?\n\nsO wHaT aRe The MeMeS?\n\nWell, that\u2019s just rude.\n\nOh, sorry \u2014 that\u2019s one of them.\n\nThe \u201cSpongeBob mocking\u201d meme takes a screenshot of a \u201cSpongeBob\u201d episode from 2012 (again, staying power) in which he is clucking like a chicken, paired with an alternating-case caption that is meant to imply a mocking tone.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSpongeBob reaction shots are pretty popular. There\u2019s also the \u201cBlurred Mr. Krabs\u201d meme, in which an internet user repurposes a shot of SpongeBob\u2019s crustacean boss, Mr. Krabs, looking confused and a little frightened as the world spins around him. That\u2019s from a second-season episode that first aired in 2001; the meme took off in 2016.\n\nMore recently, the internet meme-ified an image of Patrick Star, SpongeBob\u2019s bestie, looking particularly evil. It comes from an episode in the first season, in which SpongeBob gives up his modern urban life to live among the jellyfish. When Patrick, feeling ditched, tries to catch SpongeBob with a net, he makes a wicked face that internet users adopted.\n\nThere are others that rely on some understanding of the show, like the meme that draws on the contrast between SpongeBob\u2019s place of employment, the Krusty Krab, and the inferior Chum Bucket, run by the villainous Plankton. Internet users replace the restaurant names with two things they\u2019re comparing. They\u2019re counting on viewers to get that one is vastly superior.\n\nSo this show is really popular, remixed a ton and is universally beloved?\n\nWhat are you, new here?\n\nLike most popular things, SpongeBob has drawn his fair share of detractors. But the criticism spreads beyond \u201cSpongeBob\u201d haters and has placed the show at the center of the culture wars.\n\nWhat\u2019s the controversy?\n\nWell, for starters, in 2005, some religious conservatives accused SpongeBob of promoting a gay agenda.\n\nHow?\n\nAt the center of the issue was a music video that used children\u2019s television characters to promote tolerance and diversity. SpongeBob appeared in it, alongside many other cartoon characters. According to The Times in 2005, nothing in the video referenced sexual identity. But at a black-tie dinner, Dr. James C. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, singled out SpongeBob for promoting a \u201cpro-homosexual\u201d agenda, The Times wrote.\n\nEarlier, The Wall Street Journal had explained in 2002 that SpongeBob had become a popular camp figure among adult gay men. The story clarified that \u201cNickelodeon says SpongeBob is aimed at kids two to 11 years old, and isn\u2019t intended to appeal to homosexuals\u201d and quoted Mr. Hillenburg saying SpongeBob and friends were not intended to be gay. He described them as \u201csomewhat asexual.\u201d Nevertheless, The Journal story spawned countless \u201cIs SpongeBob gay?\u201d blog posts, foreshadowing the future of internet journalism.\n\nHow else is SpongeBob controversial?\n\nIn 2011, \u201cFox & Friends\u201d attacked Nickelodeon and SpongeBob for \u201cpushing a global warming agenda.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd after SpongeBob was fired from his job at the Krusty Krab in 2013, liberals and conservatives fought over whether the show was making a statement about labor laws and social programs.\n\nAnd a study of 4-year-olds that was published in the journal Pediatrics in 2011 suggested that SpongeBob\u2019s frenetic energy was making children slower thinkers.\n\nOfficials from Nickelodeon dismissed the findings, saying that preschool children were not the intended audience.\n\nSo am I the show\u2019s audience?\n\nThat\u2019s for you to decide. Stream it!\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for specific episodes, many fans agree that the show\u2019s prime was its first three seasons, before Mr. Hillenburg resigned as showrunner.\n\nAmong the highlights of this period are \u201cRipped Pants,\u201d a meditation on jokes that go too far; \u201cF.U.N.,\u201d a celebration of friendship; \u201cSquidville,\u201d a Squidward-centric exploration of difference; and \u201cPrehibernation Week,\u201d which is particularly notable for its use of a song from the heavy metal band Pantera (it\u2019s called \u201cDeath Rattle\u201d).", "title": "Before the Tonys, SpongeBob Seized the Culture With Memes", "authors": ["Michael Gold"]}

The comment made its way onto Twitter, and soon he got a call from the producers Michael Jackson and Rachael Horovitz, who had acquired the rights to the novels and were working on scripts with the screenwriter and novelist David Nicholls (\u201cOne Day,\u201d \u201cFar From the Madding Crowd\u201d).\n\nThe only other role on Mr. Cumberbatch\u2019s bucket list, he has said, was Hamlet \u2014 a character who shares Patrick\u2019s brilliance, arrogance, wit, cruelty, self-destructiveness and, in his reading, not dissimilar daddy issues.\n\nPhoto\n\nHamlet\u2019s father \u201cwas a cold man, someone very distant and difficult to love,\u201d he said. And as with Patrick, \u201cit\u2019s the undoing of the myth of the father that brings Hamlet into a more loving relationship\u201d with the world.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Cumberbatch played Hamlet in London in 2015, in a production that sold out almost instantly and generated the pitched fan frenzy that has come to surround this 41-year-old star, whose off-kilter Byronic handsomeness has drawn some deeply strange tributes. (Take heart, Cumberbitches: Patrick may be fattened up via prosthetics by Episode 4 and heavily weathered by Episode 5, \u201cbut it\u2019s my hair all the way through,\u201d Mr. Cumberbatch noted.)\n\nWhile that role may have seemed inevitable, the road to \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d was more uncertain. Mr. Jackson said he had been given the first novel by a mutual friend of his and Mr. St. Aubyn\u2019s. Mr. St. Aubyn\u2019s novels may come with sexy plot elements and guillotine-sharp dialogue, but it took the final installment, \u201cAt Last,\u201d which came out in 2011, to convince Mr. Jackson that an adaptation seemed possible.\n\n\u201cOnly then could you really follow the cause and effect of childhood over a sweep of time, which is the classical television format,\u201d he said.\n\nEven then, translating the long passages of interior reflection, sometimes dense philosophical rumination, and quicksilver leaps of memory and association were challenging. \u201cI\u2019ve never written so many drafts of anything in my life,\u201d Mr. Nicholls said.\n\nEach episode, like four of the novels, takes place on a single, pivotal day in Patrick\u2019s life. Early on, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Horovitz hit on the notion of making each of the hourlong episodes a distinct mini-movie, with a different visual style and tone. (They briefly toyed with the idea of hiring five directors but ultimately settled on Edward Berger, a German whose credits include the Stasi drama \u201cDeutschland \u201983.\u201d)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe first episode, the antically comic \u201cBad News\u201d (based on the second novel), in which Patrick visits New York to pick up his father\u2019s ashes and goes on a bender, plays like an upmarket \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d complete with hallucinations and at least one indelible bathroom scene. The second, \u201cNever Mind,\u201d loops back to a particularly nightmarish day in Patrick\u2019s childhood at the Melrose family home in the South of France, capped off with a Pinter-esquedinner party with dialogue so dryly vicious it nearly vaporizes the roast.\n\nThe third episode, \u201cSome Hope,\u201d set at an elaborate country house party where the guests await the arrival of Princess Margaret, is more of a social satire in the \u201cGosford Park\u201d vein.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just this wonderful circus of the very worst behavior of that class, with everything toxic coming to the surface,\u201d Mr. Cumberbatch said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Among them is Mr. St. Aubyn, who can be spotted listening as an unbearably snobbish Melrose family friend talks with the French ambassador.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI felt a terrible impulse to introduce a spontaneous new line of dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\nSome scenes were reworked on the fly, like a sequence in the first episode where Patrick undergoes a drug-fueled dark night of the soul in a hotel suite, unleashing a torrent of differently accented voices before collapsing. Mr. Cumberbatch collaborated with Mr. St. Aubyn and Mr. Nicholls on an on-set \u201cmanic rewrite,\u201d as he put it, switching different lines of from the novel (which unfolds largely as dialogue in Patrick\u2019s head) in and out.\n\n\u201cI was rewriting it and learning it at the same time, and I thought: This is crazy. I feel like I\u2019m doing a one-man show in Edinburgh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like I, as Benedict, was coming undone.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAs Patrick\u2019s father, David, a thwarted pianist whose snobbery is topped only by his cruelty, Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d) manages to be terrifying from the first moment he appears, lying stock still in his coffin in Episode 1.\n\n\u201cBenedict was poking me, trying to get me to raise from the dead,\u201d Mr. Weaving said of the sequence where Patrick touches the corpse\u2019s face (the only seconds in the series where he and Mr. Cumberbatch are onscreen together). \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t giving him anything.\u201d\n\nAs for Eleanor, Patrick\u2019s mother (played by Jennifer Jason Leigh), the novels depict her, unforgivingly, as a monster of neglect and deluded self-pity. But Ms. Leigh, whose own mother died two years ago, said she wanted to draw out her tender, thwarted core, especially in the later scenes, where a stroke has left her struggling to communicate.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to vilify Eleanor,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, it was very crucial to be faithful to the vulnerability and the nakedness of that time in life, when all your defenses are stripped away.\u201d\n\nMr. Cumberbatch said he hoped the humanity of the characters would pull people through the sometimes unbearable darkness of the story.\n\n\u201cWhat Patrick is arcing toward as a character, the ultimate shift is letting go of his father\u2019s ghost,\u201d he said. \u201cHe behaves abominably, but he\u2019s evolving from being a victim to being a survivor.\u201d", "title": "Benedict Cumberbatch Just Crossed the Last Role Off His Bucket List", "authors": ["Jennifer Schuessler"]}
{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "On Monday morning, Middle East watchers awoke to astonishing news from Israel. A headline in The Jerusalem Post read, \u201cNetanyahu to Address Country with \u2018Dramatic News About Iran.\u2019\u201d As the day passed, details remained sparse, but it became clear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was going to unveil secret evidence of Iranian cheating on the nuclear deal. The timing of the announcement, right after the new American secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met with Mr. Netanyahu, accentuated its gravity.\n\nMonday afternoon, just a bit behind schedule, Mr. Netanyahu took to the stage next to an enormous screen. The headlines had suggested he would be in his office at a desk or podium to share news of existential importance. Instead, he presented a minor-league TED Talk \u2014 and in English, no less. Outside the elite, fewer and fewer people in Israel speak English, so the notion of a country\u2019s leader supposedly addressing his compatriots in a foreign language on a matter of national security added to the weirdness of the performance.\n\nThe substance of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s allegedly shattering revelation was correspondingly strange. Of greatest interest was the disclosure of a covert operation that spirited Iran\u2019s nuclear archives out of the country for analysis in Israel. These records, according to Mr. Netanyahu, consisted of 55,000 pages and 183 CDs \u2014 an enormous load \u2014 which nicely demonstrated what can happen when a resourceful and audacious intelligence community in one country meets staggering carelessness and incompetence in another.\n\nThe archive had been stored in what Mr. Netanyahu described as a derelict warehouse in Tehran. The photos he displayed indicated that there did not even appear to be a lock on the door. One wonders how important the Iranians thought these documents were, given the slapdash approach they took to storing them. In any case, the Mossad operation that netted this haul apparently took place in January and President Trump was briefed on it shortly afterward.", "title": "Opinion | Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Nuclear Nothingburger", "authors": []}

At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned $40.7 billion of Apple\u2019s shares, up from $28.2 billion at the end of 2017.\n\nSo what does Warren Buffett think about Apple\u2019s announcement that it plans to buy back $100 billion of its shares?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cWe own 5 percent of it. With the passage of a little time, we may own 6 or 7 percent because they repurchase shares.\u201d\n\nCharles Munger added that he and Mr. Buffett don\u2019t approve of every buyback plan, but he doubted Apple would find an acquisition target at a good price.\n\n\u201cThe reason companies are buying their stocks is that they are smart enough to know it\u2019s better for them than anything else,\u201d Mr. Munger said.\n\nWhat about Microsoft?\n\nGiven Berkshire\u2019s investment in Apple, one shareholder wanted to know why Berkshire never invested in Microsoft. The question came with Bill Gates, Microsoft\u2019s co-founder and a director at Berkshire, sitting in the audience.\n\n\u201cIn the earlier years, the answer is stupidity,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied. But then Mr. Buffett added that his friendship with Mr. Gates has grown over the years, and he has stayed away from investing \u201cbecause of the inference\u201d that could be drawn.\n\nAnd Amazon and Alphabet...\n\nMr. Buffett has famously avoided investing in tech companies because he didn\u2019t understand them. But one investor wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s stance is evolving. Beyond Apple, the questioner pointed out that Amazon and Google parent Alphabet have the characteristics of companies Mr. Buffett typically likes to invest in: strong brand names and little competition.\n\nHere\u2019s the reason Mr. Buffett gave for not investing in Amazon:\n\n\u201cThe truth is that I\u2019ve watched Amazon from the start, and I think what Jeff Bezos has done is something close to a miracle. The problem is if I think something will be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\u201d\n\nAs for Alphabet, Mr. Buffett said that he had \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d He said he was unable to conclude that at Alphabet\u2019s present prices, its \u201cprospects were far better than the prices indicated.\u201d\n\nHe then explained that he didn\u2019t invest in Apple because it was a tech stock. \u201cI went into Apple because I came to certain conclusions about the value with which the capital was being deployed and about the ecosystem,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe discussion did lead to one of the more humorous exchanges of the meeting:\n\nMr. Munger: \u201cI\u2019ve been to Google headquarters. It looks to me like a kindergarten.\u201d Mr. Buffett: \u201cA very rich kindergarten.\u201d\n\nOne thing Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger aren\u2019t fans of? Cryptocurrencies.\n\nWarren Buffett and Charles Munger saved their harshest words for cryptocurrencies.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrencies will come to bad endings.\u201d Mr. Buffett said, responding to an attendee from Ukraine.\n\nMr. Buffett\u2019s main argument against cryptocurrencies is the same one he has made about gold: They are not a \u201cproductive asset.\u201d That means the value of cryptocurrencies is determined solely by what someone is willing to pay for it.\n\n\u201cIf you had bought gold at the time of Christ and you figure the compound rate on it, it\u2019s a couple tenths of a percent,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\n\nBut his criticism didn\u2019t stop there. He said cryptocurrencies attract a lot of \u201ccharlatans\u201d and \u201cpeople of less than stellar character.\u201d\n\nMr. Munger was perhaps harsher. \u201cIt\u2019s just disgusting,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Buffett isn\u2019t backing off his comments about guns\n\nIn February, Warren Buffett was asked on CNBC about some chief executives distancing their businesses from the National Rifle Association. Mr. Buffett responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think that Berkshire should say we\u2019re not going to do business with people who own guns. I think that would be ridiculous.\u201d\n\nThat comment came up at Saturday\u2019s meeting, and one shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett had misspoken.\n\nMr. Buffett answered by largely repeating what he had said earlier this year:\n\n\u201cI do not believe on imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses. \u201cIf you get into which of our companies are pure and which ones aren\u2019t pure, I think it will be very difficult. I don\u2019t think that we should question on the Geico policy form: Are you an N.R.A. member? And if you are, you just aren\u2019t good enough for us.\u201d\n\nMr. Munger then added:\n\n\u201dCertainly we\u2019re not going to ban all guns surrounded by wild turkeys in Omaha.\u201d\n\nWarren Buffett is sticking by Wells Fargo\n\nOver the past two years, regulators and whistle-blowers have revealed Wells Fargo employees were creating fake accounts using customers\u2019 identities, forcing borrowers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, and overcharging on mortgage fees.\n\nThe Federal Reserve earlier this year restricted its growth until it demonstrates it is complying with bank regulations.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBerkshire first invested in Wells Fargo nearly three decades ago and is currently the bank\u2019s biggest holder with a nearly 10 percent stake.\n\nIn response to a question about whether it was time to abandon the bank, which has already seen turnover in its executive suite and boardroom, Mr. Buffett said he thought Wells Fargo\u2019s problems would only make it stronger in the long run.\n\n\u201cAll the big banks have had troubles of one sort or another and I see no reason why Wells Fargo as a company, from both an investment standpoint and a moral standpoint going forward, is in any way inferior to the other big banks with which it competes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe specifically praised the bank\u2019s chief executive, Tim Sloan, a longtime Wells Fargo executive who took over when his predecessor John Stumpf resigned at the height of the fake account scandal. Criticism from Mr. Buffett could have increased pressure on Mr. Sloan. But the 87-year-old praised him.\n\n\u201cI like Tim Sloan as a manager,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cHe is correcting mistakes made by other people.\u201d\n\nMr. Buffett went further: What happened at Wells Fargo could\u2019ve happened anywhere, he said.\n\n\u201cWe know people are doing something wrong as we sit here at Berkshire. You can\u2019t have 370,000 employees and expect that everyone is behaving like Ben Franklin.\u201d On the fake account scandal specifically, which the bank has said resulted from intense pressure on its branch managers to increase sales, Buffett said: \u201cWells Fargo is a company that proved the efficacy of incentives and it\u2019s just that they had the wrong incentives.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

In recent years, Mr. Buffett has handed off some of his investing duties to Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, Berkshire\u2019s two portfolios managers, and in January, Mr. Buffett promoted longtime Berkshire executives, Gregory E. Abel and Ajit Jain, to oversee Berkshire\u2019s businesses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been semiretired for decades,\u201d Mr. Buffett replied with a chuckle, but then he got serious.\n\n\u201cTed and Todd each manage about 12 or 13 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether that\u2019s $25 billion. They\u2019re managing $25 billion and doing a very good job.\u201d\n\nHe then quickly reminded the questioner of the size of the company\u2019s assets: \u201cI still have the responsibility for the other $300 billion.\u201d\n\nCharles T. Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, added: \u201cI watch Warren. He spends most of his time reading and thinking and occasionally he\u2019ll make a phone call or talk to somebody. Not much has changed.\u201d\n\nAnother shareholder asked whether Berkshire will have trouble doing deals once Mr. Buffett is no longer with the company. Companies have regularly approached Berkshire over the years about being bought. That has allowed Berkshire to avoid bidding wars and to make acquisitions at lower prices.\n\nThe shareholder wanted to know if Mr. Buffett\u2019s successor would continue to have access to those deals and whether Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger should aggressively publicize the work of their successors to help pass on thei \u201chometown advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the reputation of Berkshire as being a very good home for companies, particularly a very good private home for a company, I don\u2019t think that reputation is dependent on me or Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cIt may take a little \u2014 there may be a little testing period for whoever takes over.\u201d\n\n\u201dThe truth is that I think some of the other executives are getting better known,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2014 Emily Flitter and Stephen Grocer\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhere does Berkshire\u2019s health care venture with JPMorgan and Amazon stand?\n\nA lot remains unknown about Berkshire\u2019s health care partnership with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase more than three months after the companies announced the venture.\n\nThe three firms said in January that they were teaming up to try to find a better, cheaper way to provide health care to their own workers, a combined one million people. And they said if their idea worked, they would seek to share it with other companies.\n\nWarren Buffett on Saturday again called the cost of health care \u201ca tapeworm in terms of American business.\u201d He lamented the success other countries \u2014 he did not name any \u2014 have had keeping their own health care costs at a lower proportion of their gross domestic product.\n\nBut just how Berkshire\u2019s partnership will address the problem remains a big question.\n\nMr. Buffett had no more details to offer on Saturday. He said the people leading the effort are still searching for a chief executive. They could announce a hire \u201cwithin a couple of months,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWhether we can bring the resources, bring the person, that C.E.O., is terribly important. Bring the person, support that person and somehow figure out a better way for people to continue to receive better medical care in the United States,\u201d he mused \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that will happen.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Buffett seemed uncertain, though hopeful, about the effort as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe are attacking an industry moat,\u201d Mr. Buffett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge moat. We\u2019ll do our best. If we fail, I hope somebody else succeeds.\u201d\n\nCharles Munger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman, weighed in: \u201cI suspect that eventually when the Democrats control both houses of Congress and the White House, I suspect that we will get a single payer system, and I suspect it won\u2019t be very friendly to the existing\u201d pharmacy benefit managers.\n\n\u2014 Emily Flitter\n\nPhoto\n\nTrade \u2018is a win-win situation\u2019\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a more combative stance on trade, particularly with China.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo it comes as little surprise then that one of the first questions put to Warren Buffett and Charles Munger was about trade. Here\u2019s Mr. Buffett\u2019s response:\n\n\u201cThe United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long, long time. We have a lot of common interests, and like any two big economic entities, there are times when there will be tensions. But it is a win-win situation when the world trades, and China and the United States are the two big factors in that.\u201d \u201cIt is a win-win situation. The only problem is when one side or the other wants to win a little bit too much.\u201d\n\nAbout those accounting changes...\n\nWarren Buffett warned in his annual letter that a new accounting rule would \u201cseverely distort Berkshire\u2019s net income figures and very often mislead commentators and investors.\u201d\n\nSaturday morning Berkshire reported a net loss for the first quarter because of those accounting changes. The new rules require Berkshire to include in its earnings the gains and losses on the stocks it holds but has not sold.\n\nIn the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with net income of $4.06 billion a year earlier.\n\nGiven the new accounting rule, Mr. Buffett suggested Saturday that shareholders should look at Berkshire\u2019s operating income, which excludes gains and losses for Berkshire\u2019s investments, for a more accurate picture of the company\u2019s performance.\n\nBerkshire reported its operating income rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion from a year ago.\n\n\u2014 Stephen Grocer\n\nPhoto\n\nQuestions for Mr. Buffett\n\nThe main event every year at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting is the question and answer session. Elisa Mala, a reporter working for The New York Times asked those attending Berkshire events on Friday what they would ask Mr. Buffett.

Friday is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s shopping day, where shareholders can buy products from many Berkshire-owned companies.)\n\nShareholders moseyed around CenturyLink Center, where the annual meeting takes place, perusing dozens of booths displaying goods \u2014 many created specifically for the event \u2014 from brands like Geico, NetJets and Coca-Cola.\n\nWhat was really on sale? All things Warren Buffett.\n\nInvestors could snack on a Dilly Bar, the long-favored Popsicle of the Oracle of Omaha, for $1 or snag \u201cWarren and Charlie\u201d rubber ducks ($5 for the pair at the Oriental Trading Company booth).

In town from Missoula, Mont., he said he wanted a memento of their first trip to the shareholders\u2019 meeting.\n\nOf course, shoppers and vendors were hoping for a sighting and interaction with the man himself. Failing that, they settled for selfies with his many likenesses.

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "Mr. Castorf uses his source materials \u2014 in this case, Goethe\u2019s two-part tome, one of the most important works in German literature, in which the title character makes a bargain with the devil \u2014 as a theoretical scaffolding around which to construct his eclectic and wide-ranging investigations. These often involve a heavy dose of Marxism and post-colonial theory. (For all his postmodern credentials, though, his shockingly crude depiction of women often seems misogynistic, something that German audiences are strangely unconcerned by.)\n\nMr. Castorf is equally unconcerned with the Mephistophelean pact at the center of Goethe\u2019s play, instead concentrating on the arrogance and violence of European conquest (specifically France\u2019s colonial occupation of Algeria) and the world of prostitution in 19th century Paris, as depicted in \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s novel \u201cNana.\u201d\n\nThere are also quotes or ideas from Frantz Fanon and Paul Celan, whose famous poem \u201cDeath Fugue\u201d is militantly declaimed in French by Abdoul Kader Traor\u00e9, an actor and rapper from Burkina Faso. \u201cEuropeans have ceased to be the subjects of history; they have become its objects,\u201d Faust says, quoting Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s analysis of the Algerian war of independence. Mr. Castorf seems to view \u201cFaust\u201d as the product of an impotent and irrelevant civilization that should be overthrown.\n\nMr. Castorf\u2019s method is often described as deconstructive, but here it seems to work more by way of association. He\u2019s far less interested in Goethe\u2019s text than the intellectual, cultural and historical ideas he relates it to. So when Faust seduces and abandons the virginal Margarete, it inspires an extended detour into Zola\u2019s \u201cNana.\u201d When, in part two of the play, Faust becomes a wealthy landowner, Mr. Castorf makes it a pretext for some lengthy scenes in Algeria, which include footage from Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s 1966 film \u201cThe Battle of Algiers.\u201d Throughout the long evening, a loud, zany soundtrack that includes opera, cheesy fantasy film soundtracks, Jacques Brel, Tom Waits and Blood, Sweat & Tears sustains a near-manic level of intensity.\n\nMontage has always been a key concept for Mr. Castorf. In addition to its strikingly cinematic aspects, the production ingeniously crosscuts between both parts of Goethe\u2019s tragedy (which are radically different from each other), with the play often doubling back on itself in what suggests an endless loop.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ending, in which the three main characters quarrel about whether Faust won or lost his wager with Mephisto, is a theatrical masterstroke worth waiting for. Yet it is also one of the precious few places where the production actively engages with the meaning of Goethe\u2019s play, since Mr. Castorf stubbornly refuses to confront the moral and philosophical quandaries of Germany\u2019s most emblematic text.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe fearless Valery Tscheplanowa gives the most consistently exciting performance in a variety of roles, including Margarete and Nana. The dynamic Alexander Scheer (in the role of Lord Byron, whose poem \u201cManfred\u201d is quoted from at length) and the high-strung Daniel Zillmann (playing a Parisian theater director) easily outshine the play\u2019s central duo: Martin Wuttke plays Faust with a thuggish gruffness that quickly gets tiresome; Marc Hosemann\u2019s muscular and mischievous Mephisto was more impressive \u2014 until this endurance test of a production took its toll and he began to lose his voice toward the end of the evening.\n\nAleksandar Denic\u2019s revolving set is brilliant and intricate, incorporating a club, a haunted house and an extremely realistic mock-up of the Stalingrad metro station in Paris, complete with subway platform and train.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

When the Volksb\u00fchne first presented it last year, the theater\u2019s website billed it as a \u201cmammoth project by confident actors and artists who have trained for 25 years to make it possible.\u201d Even if this is a somewhat self-aggrandizing assessment, it\u2019s hard to disagree.\n\nIt is a fitting coda to Mr. Castorf\u2019s furious and challenging quarter-century reign.", "title": "Berlin Festival Celebrates 25-Year Theatrical Reign With 7-Hour \u2018Faust\u2019", "authors": ["A.J.

Not much bothers him, least of all the unfair reputation that he vanishes in big moments. He is not LeBron James (Who is?). But Horford, operating with the wisdom accumulated over 10 trips to the postseason, has his fingerprints all over this series.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always making sure we\u2019re in the right situations,\u201d said Tatum, a first-year forward who is averaging 18.1 points a game in the playoffs. \u201cIt\u2019s tough down there, but he was tougher.\u201d\n\nHere is an abridged list of the ways in which Horford affected Game 3:\n\n\u25a0 He took turns defending the 76ers\u2019 starting point guard (Ben Simmons) and their starting center (Joel Embiid). Few players have that sort of versatility, and it is no coincidence that Simmons and Embiid are struggling. Also worth noting: Horford managed to go all of Game 3 without a foul, a tightrope walk that Embiid, for one, thought was baloney.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible for someone to guard me and have zero fouls,\u201d said Embiid, who shot 10 of 26 from the field. \u201cA couple of plays, it wasn\u2019t fair. But you have to give Al a lot of credit. He competed for his team and got them the win. I\u2019m too big, but I guess it\u2019s the playoffs. I\u2019m learning. But I am too big to not be fouled when I go to the basket.\u201d\n\nThat sort of attitude does not bode well for the 76ers moving forward.\n\n\u25a0 Horford urged his teammates to keep their composure as arena workers scrambled to clear the court of confetti at the end of regulation. Oh, right, the confetti: It came pouring out of a courtside cannon after the 76ers\u2019 Marco Belinelli made a long buzzer-beater at the end of regulation. The problem was that it was a 2-pointer, not a 3-pointer, and only tied the game. Whoops!\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t care about the confetti,\u201d said Horford, adding: \u201cI think we all understood what was at stake.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u25a0 Horford trusted his coach in an important situation. The Celtics were trailing by 1 with less than 10 seconds left when Stevens motioned for a timeout, just as Horford was about to receive an entry pass in the post against the 76ers\u2019 Ersan Ilyasova. Steven wanted to concoct an out-of-bounds play that he thought would be more favorable for his team.\n\n\u201cHe sees certain things and understands them,\u201d Horford said. \u201cIt just seems like he makes the right decision every time.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the Celtics cleared space for Horford on the inbounds, who took a lob over the top of the 76ers\u2019 Robert Covington and scored on a layup to give the Celtics the lead for good.\n\n\u25a0 Finally, Horford made the game\u2019s most crucial defensive play when he stole the 76ers\u2019 ensuing inbounds pass and was fouled. He made both free throws, sealing the win.\n\n\u201cAl just made a heck of a play,\u201d Stevens said.\n\nEven as 76ers Coach Brett Brown continues to express hope that his players are learning from these playoffs, he was careful after the game to avoid blaming his team\u2019s inexperience for their various late-stage catastrophes \u2014 and perhaps for good reason. The Celtics have loads of young players, too.\n\nBut it was Horford\u2019s savvy that made the difference. As Tatum put it, \u201cHe\u2019s been in every situation possible.\u201d", "title": "Boston\u2019s Al Horford Has Enough Experience for His Entire Team", "authors": ["Scott Cacciola", "On Pro Basketball"]}

His command wavered early, when the Braves pounced on him for a 3-0 lead in the first inning.\n\n\u201cThis loss is really just on me,\u201d he said, citing a lack of feel for his pitches and the Braves\u2019 aggressiveness.\n\nThe Mets\u2019 lone run through the first eight innings came on a solo blast by left fielder Yoenis Cespedes, who returned to the lineup sooner than expected. He had exited Sunday\u2019s game early after jamming his left hand sliding into third on a stolen base.\n\nBut after playing catch and hitting off a tee during Monday\u2019s off-day in New York, Cespedes was cleared to play. He did not receive further tests, as first expected, beyond an initial X-ray, which showed no breaks.\n\nPhoto\n\nCespedes showed no ill effects on Tuesday: The sixth-inning home run was one of his three hits on the night. He also threw out the Braves catcher Kurt Suzuki at home in the seventh inning. He was unavailable to speak with reporters after the game because of a family matter, a team spokesman said.\n\nBefore the game, Manager Mickey Callaway said he was thrilled with Cespedes\u2019s overall play despite an early skid. Alderson said he was happy with the team\u2019s play so far, while acknowledging there was room for improvement with slumping hitters and sputtering pitchers.\n\nThe Mets have been without their top two catchers since April 12, when Kevin Plawecki landed on the disabled list with a fracture in his left hand \u2014 the day after they learned that Travis d\u2019Arnaud would need Tommy John surgery.

That level of production is tolerable if their defense is sound and the rest of the Mets lineup is hitting as it should.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlderson said Nido and Lobaton had done a \u201cnice job\u201d defensively. He said he would be cautious about improving the Mets\u2019 catching with an minor outside addition because any new catcher\u2019s familiarity with the pitching staff would be lacking.\n\nAs far as a substantial catching addition, Alderson said he did not think that was available on the market. He made the case that even teams likely out of playoff contention still needed catchers.\n\n\u201cAnd there is a scarcity at that position,\u201d he said.\n\nAny potential Mets\u2019 need will hinge on Plawecki\u2019s return. He will likely need the full four weeks, if not more, to recover. The strength in his hand had not fully returned and some pain persisted, Alderson said.\n\nAs far as other injuries on the team, relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak, who signed a two year $14 million contract with the Mets this winter, was still recovering from a left oblique injury he suffered the first week of the season. The infirmity occurred near a rib, which, according to Alderson, has slowed his return.\n\nEven without Swarzak, the Mets\u2019 bullpen has performed solidly despite a few blown games during the second half of April. But there was little need for stout relief pitching on Tuesday once the Mets fell behind.\n\nWith two men after bloop singles in the bottom of the ninth inning, Amed Rosario failed on two slash bunt attempts before striking out.

Without the support of big business, Mr. Ortega\u2019s position is much weaker. Business leaders should continue to press the government to embrace the rule of law.\n\nThe United States also has an important role to play. The Global Magnitsky Act \u2014 an American law used to punish people around the world for human rights violations and corruption \u2014 was applied in December to Roberto Rivas, the head of the election commission, who is accused of money laundering and conspiring to keep Mr. Ortega in power. The law should now be used to impose sanctions against government officials responsible for the human rights violations in the protests.\n\nAnd because Nicaragua is a major beneficiary of foreign aid, donor countries should demand government transparency and accountability. The bankruptcy of the Social Security Institute, which led to the proposed pension reforms that triggered the protests, reflected mismanagement and lack of transparency by the government.\n\nThough the recent demonstrations revealed the scope of the discontent with Mr. Ortega, the many groups protesting were not unified. The fractured opposition lacks clear leadership and agreement on how the president should be removed from power. Mr. Ortega, a wily politician, is already taking advantage of this lack of unity.\n\nOpposition leaders should agree to focus on redress for the recent violence and a just restoration of the country\u2019s political institutions, rather than demanding the president\u2019s ouster, which is unrealistic.

Winter storms will send some species climbing higher in tree limbs for added protection from cooler temperatures closer to the ground.\n\nIn 2016, a single severe storm in the Mexican wintering ground of the monarch butterfly wiped out as much as 40 percent of the population there. Adding to the mortality was the thinning of forest canopy in a microclimate that had previously offered shelter.\n\nLast year, a study of the storm\u2019s aftermath, published in the journal American Entomologist, reported that the intact microclimate had acted \u201cas a blanket that holds heat beneath the forest canopy\u201d and \u201cas an umbrella that reduces wetting of the butterflies clustering on the tree boughs.\u201d The tree trunks, too, radiated warmth that protected the butterflies from freezing.\n\nThe trees also provided some protection from severe winds.

The report played down the role of a contractor turned whistle-blower, Christopher Wylie, who helped the company acquire Facebook data, calling it \u201cvery modest.\u201d\n\nCambridge Analytica did not reply to requests for comment. The news of Cambridge ceasing operations was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal and Gizmodo.\n\nThe company, bankrolled by Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who invested at least $15 million, offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. Those modeling techniques underpinned Cambridge Analytica\u2019s work for the Trump campaign and for other candidates in 2014 and 2016.\n\nBut Cambridge Analytica came under scrutiny over the past year, first for its purported methods of profiling voters and then over allegations that it improperly harvested private data from Facebook users. Last year, the company was drawn into the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe company was also forced to suspend its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a British television channel released an undercover video. In it, Mr. Nix suggested that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.\n\nFacebook has since announced changes to its policies for collecting and handling user data. Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, testified last month before Congress, where he faced criticism for failing to protect users\u2019 data.\n\nThe controversy dealt a major blow to Cambridge Analytica\u2019s ambitions of expanding its commercial business in the United States, while also bringing unwanted attention to the American government contracts sought by SCL Group, an intelligence contractor.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBesides working for the Trump campaign, Cambridge Analytica was previously hired by the political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, the national security adviser.

Cambridge pitched AB InBev by claiming that it could position Bud Light as the beer for the young party crowd and Budweiser for old-school conservatives, according to the former employee, who asked not to be named because the person was restricted from speaking about the company\u2019s business.\n\nIn recent months, executives at Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, along with the Mercer family, have moved to created a new firm, Emerdata, based in Britain, according to British records. The new company\u2019s directors include Johnson Ko Chun Shun, a Hong Kong financier and business partner of Erik Prince. Mr. Prince founded the private security firm Blackwater, which was renamed Xe Services after Blackwater contractors were convicted of killing Iraqi civilians.\n\nCambridge and SCL officials privately raised the possibility that Emerdata could be used for a Blackwater-style rebranding of Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, according two people with knowledge of the companies, who asked for anonymity to describe confidential conversations. One plan under consideration was to sell off the combined company\u2019s data and intellectual property.\n\nAn executive and a part owner of SCL Group, Nigel Oakes, has publicly described Emerdata as a way of rolling up the two companies under one new banner.

The amount of bail that can be charged is capped at $2,500.\n\nScott Levy, special counsel to the criminal defense practice at the Bronx Defenders, a criminal defense nonprofit, said judges often reject requests from lawyers to use credit cards for bail. \u201cIt is incumbent for us to ask,\u201d he said, adding that the $2,500 cap is also restrictive.\n\n\u201cYou find examples like this in every corner of the criminal justice system,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cNothing ever works quite the right way.\u201d\n\nMr. Lancman and others said the online bail program was far from perfect, citing the 2.5 percent transaction fee, and the inability for people to access the platform over the phone or by using a bank account\u2019s routing number.\n\nMs. Glazer said the city is working with the courts to make it standard that bail can be paid with a credit card, and to raise the $2,500 cap. It is also looking to find more convenient locations for the A.T.M.s in the Bronx and Queens courthouses.\n\nAll of the city\u2019s efforts \u201cdon\u2019t address the central issue of a flawed cash bail system,\u201d Ms. Glazer said. \u201cWe will try to ameliorate the bad things that happen because of cash bail, but legislative change is what is needed.\u201d\n\nThe movement to end the use of cash bail \u2014 which some say discriminates against minorities and the poor \u2014 gained momentum in New York when Gov.

New Jersey has also largely ended the use of cash bail. Bail reform was not included as part of the state budget deal.\n\nMr. Lancman is drafting legislation that will require the city to work with the Office of Court Administration to install A.T.M.s near arraignment courts or bail payment windows at every criminal courthouse.

He lost them both. \u201cNobody has thanked me for taking Liverpool to those finals,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do not hang silver medals at Melwood,\u201d Liverpool\u2019s training facility.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut simply breathing the same air as Real, that relentless winner of this competition, is an achievement worth celebrating. Liverpool did not even make the Champions League automatically; it had to endure a qualifier with Hoffenheim. This campaign is only its second in the Champions League since 2009; it has spent much of the intervening period trying to keep pace with the Premier League\u2019s elite; Europe\u2019s seemed beyond reach.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe matter of what it has done is impressive, but the style in which it has done it is even more so. It has scored, in total, 130 goals this season \u2014 eye-catching enough before two early eliminations in England\u2019s domestic cups are factored in: Liverpool has only played 56 games. No team has ever scored more goals in a Champions League campaign than Liverpool.\n\nNo strike force has registered more than Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Mane: not Barcelona\u2019s Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez, not Real Madrid\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale.\n\nThat all of those records have been set by a team that did not have a single senior midfielder among its substitutes last night, that had an academy graduate at right-back, that deployed a left back who was playing in Scotland\u2019s lower leagues four years ago, and that had to bring on Klavan \u2014 a seasoned pro, but hardly a world-beater \u2014 to see out the game is remarkable. \u201cThese boys are constantly over their limit,\u201d Klopp said. That is testament to the work he has done, as much as the insatiability of his players.\n\nNo wonder, then, that at the end, as Roma\u2019s fans boomed out their club anthem in pride, Liverpool\u2019s fans twirled their scarves in sheer, disbelieving delight; no wonder that Klopp reappeared, 40 minutes after the final whistle, to celebrate again with the fans. The game itself needed some time to sink in; what Klopp and his players have done this season in Europe will require even longer.\n\nThis season might still end without a trophy, of course. Defend like this against Real Madrid and it will most certainly be Real claiming a 13th European Cup in Kiev, not Liverpool lifting its sixth. But that is the thing with Liverpool, this Liverpool: Even Real, those wily old campaigners, will not be entirely sure of what they will have to face \u2014 the team lucky to get away with a 4-2 loss, or the team that has burned through Europe all year.

In the interim, the makeup of the court changed with the retirement of the justice who wrote the majority opinion in the last ruling.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling was a reminder of how, after more than 40 years, the enduring legal struggle had left the Moxleys and the Skakels without any solid resolution. The two families had lived in the same gated community on the Connecticut coast. The morning after Ms. Moxley did not return home, Mr. Skakel answered the door when Ms. Moxley\u2019s mother knocked, searching for her daughter.\n\nJohn Moxley, Martha Moxley\u2019s older brother, called the decision disappointing. Dorthy Moxley, the victim\u2019s mother, said in a brief telephone interview on Friday that she continues to believe that Mr. Skakel killed her daughter. \u201cNo question about it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat do I want to say?\u201d Ms. Moxley said. \u201cWell, I am surprised and not particularly happy about this. But we\u2019ll handle and do what we have to do.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

They also said that his older brother, Thomas Skakel, was the likely culprit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court did the right thing,\u201d Michael A. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Skakel\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement, adding that his client had been \u201cunjustly imprisoned\u201d for more than 11 years. \u201cTo be absolutely clear,\u201d he said, \u201cMichael Skakel is innocent of this crime.\u201d\n\nThomas Skakel did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMs. Moxley, a popular teenager, was killed on Oct. 30, 1975, her body found under a pine tree on her family\u2019s estate. She had been struck with a steel golf club with enough force to break the club, with the head and part of the shaft ending up more than 100 feet away. Another piece of the shaft was used to stab her through the neck.\n\nThe grisly crime led to years of police investigation, Hollywood treatments and books that capitalized on the case\u2019s link to the Kennedy family \u2014 Mr. Skakel\u2019s aunt is Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nAfter Mr. Skakel\u2019s arrest 25 years later, prosecutors faced major hurdles as they brought the case to trial, which was centered largely on circumstantial evidence. The case raised a host of legal issues. He was initially charged as a juvenile, because of his age at the time of the murder, and had he been convicted in juvenile court, he would have faced little jail time. Beyond that, important witnesses died before the trial, and prosecutors did not have direct physical evidence linking Mr. Skakel to the crime.\n\nInvestigators had recovered the golf club used in the attack, a 6-iron from a set that had belonged to Mr. Skakel\u2019s mother. But investigators had not found fingerprints or blood connecting it to a perpetrator. Mr. Skakel also claimed to have an alibi: watching \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus\u201d on television at a cousin\u2019s home miles from the murder scene.\n\nAfter Mr. Skakel\u2019s conviction, several jurors said that they had been convinced of his guilt by his own incriminating words and years of erratic behavior. They said that Mr. Skakel had changed his account of where he was during the killing, and they believed relatives and friends could have been covering up for him. The jury relied on a taped conversation between Mr. Skakel and the ghostwriter of his planned autobiography in which Mr. Skakel placed himself near the murder scene.\n\nWith Mr. Skakel facing a life sentence, his aunt sent the judge a handwritten letter from Hyannis Port, Mass., describing a tumultuous childhood and asking for leniency. She praised Mr. Skakel for his \u201cmental toughness, fortitude, courage and tenacity\u201d in overcoming his difficult upbringing and alcohol addiction, and for his \u201csweetness, kindness, good cheer and love of life.\u201d The letter was signed, \u201cOut of the depths, but with hope, Ethel Kennedy.\u201d\n\nOne of Mr. Skakel\u2019s most vigorous defenders has been his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former prosecutor and environmental lawyer who, in a book published two years ago, explored what he said was a botched police investigation and prosecutorial misbehavior and offered alternative theories about who killed Ms. Moxley.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a strong validation,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said on Friday, \u201cand I\u2019m very happy for Michael.\u201d", "title": "Connecticut Court Reverses Murder Conviction of Michael Skakel", "authors": ["Rick Rojas", "Kristin Hussey"]}

The pizza oven was cranking out in the yard and no-recipe recipes were flying through the Catskills night: pizza with a bed of Parmesan and pillows of mushroom, with little spoonfuls of roasted bone marrow here and there like mozz; lamb chops cooked sous vide for a few hours with rosemary, butter and anchovy paste, then roasted in the oven for 90 seconds and served on a platter as if they were lollipops.

Then a loin of milk-fed piglet, roasted crisp, creamy and sweet, for all.\n\nIt was a lot of food and what tied it all together was neither a cookbook nor a digital guide to kitchen life, but that big, roaring wood-fired oven and the possibilities it suggested to those who had gathered on its hearth.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nAs the rogues\u2019 gallery of fallen world leaders grows, you might be tempted to conclude that ours is the most corrupt era in history. Early last month, the former South Korean president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in prison and fined $17 million for bribery, extortion and abuse of power. That same day, the former South African president Jacob Zuma, forced to resign in February by his own party, appeared in court to face charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal. The next day came an even bigger blow: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Brazil\u2019s former president and current front-runner in polls for October\u2019s presidential election, began serving a 12-year jail term on corruption charges \u2014 in a federal police building he himself inaugurated more than a decade ago.\n\nLula is a casualty of what may be the largest corruption scandal ever. An octopuslike bribery scheme carried out by the Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht has spawned investigations in more than a dozen countries, implicating leaders from Chile to Colombia, Mexico to Mozambique. (The scandal has also led to a $3.5 billion fine levied by the United States Justice Department against Odebrecht and inspired a new Netflix series.) In Peru alone, three former presidents are facing trial or serving jail time on Odebrecht-related charges.\n\nWith the crisis still metastasizing, it was hard not to be cynical when, in mid-April, the region\u2019s presidents gathered in Lima for the Summit of the Americas to deliver high-minded speeches on this year\u2019s theme: \u201cDemocratic Governance Against Corruption.\u201d Donald Trump skipped the meeting, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his stead. It was a measure of the speed of these unfolding scandals that the White House couldn\u2019t keep up. Pence\u2019s official schedule initially included \u201ca banquet hosted by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of Peru.\u201d The only problem: Kuczynski was forced to resign three weeks earlier, one day before he was to face certain impeachment on corruption charges.\n\nBehind all these grim headlines, however, lies a larger and more encouraging truth: Corruption is being exposed, denounced and prosecuted more vigorously, and at higher levels, than ever. In Latin America, at least, these are not just momentary flare-ups at the scandal du jour; they seem to be the rumblings of a historic shift. \u201cJudges, journalists and the public now have the strength to take on high-level corruption,\u201d says Kevin Casas-Zamora, a former vice president of Costa Rica and senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue. \u201cIt\u2019s not that corruption is getting worse or better, but that societies are more willing and able to uncover it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCorruption, of course, is an ancient temptation. Aristotle pondered its significance back in the 4th century B.C.E., around the same time the Indian philosopher Kautiliya enumerated the \u201c40 ways of embezzlement.\u201d Throughout history, there has been a spirited debate about whether corruption acts like \u201cgrease\u201d (smoothing the way past red tape) or \u201csand\u201d (clogging the system with unproductive costs and scaring off investment). In the 18th century, the Anglo-Dutch economist Bernard Mandeville contended, in his \u201cFable of the Bees,\u201d that private vices by the \u201cdextrous management of skilful politicians\u201d could be turned into \u201cpublick benefits.\u201d More recently, some academics have argued that corruption can serve as an economic lubricant in societies that have low levels of trust, weak legal institutions or feckless governments. As the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington wrote: \u201cIn terms of economic growth, the only thing worse than a society with a rigid, overcentralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a rigid, overcentralized, honest bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe \u201csand\u201d argument, however, has gained far more traction in recent years. \u201cAt this point, the evidence is fairly settled that corruption is a drag on long-term growth,\u201d Casas-Zamora says. The World Bank estimates that bribes siphon off around $1.5 trillion from the global economy each year \u2014 about 2 percent of world\u2019s gross domestic product and 10 times the value of overseas development aid. Much of that money, the bank says, goes into the pockets and foreign bank accounts of elites rather than into the public investments \u2014 schools, courts, hospitals, roads \u2014 that are needed to lift economies over the long haul. By degrading social norms and civic virtues, not to mention the rule of law on which investment depends, corruption rots the foundations of a healthy economy.", "title": "Corrupt Leaders Are Falling Around the World.

But the past 18 months have brought unexpected challenges, and leaders across the country are being confronted with an urgent question: How do museums reconceive their missions at a time of great societal reckoning around race and gender, and as more diverse audiences demand a voice and a sense of accountability?\n\nAs director of the Walker Art Center, in Minneapolis, I faced this challenge in 2017 after a controversy over the placement of a public sculpture, \u201cScaffold,\u201d by Sam Durant. The work, first exhibited in Europe in 2012, depicted gallows that represented seven state-sanctioned executions between 1859 and 2006.

What I had hoped would be an opportunity for public education and \u201ctruth to power\u201d in the presentation of \u201cScaffold\u201d was simply not possible because of the continuing historical trauma about an unreckoned-with colonial past. This was a humbling public admission for a person whose career has been devoted to providing a platform for underrepresented histories.\n\nWhile I am no longer a museum director, I believe that museums must embrace this form of dialogue if they are to remain relevant. To do so requires radically different models of leadership than we\u2019ve had until now. Yet it is hard to resist entrenchment, and difficult to take a risk. It is even more difficult to fail.

In polling stations where turnout exceeded 80 percent \u2014 implausibly higher than the national average of 60 percent \u2014 Mr. Sargsyan often received more than 80 percent of the votes, raising \u201cserious problems with voting and counting, and concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.\u201d\n\nApart from grave misgivings about the fairness of the electoral process, Mr. Sargsyan\u2019s failure to stem the decline of the Armenian economy and growing unemployment have rattled the people. In 2008, during his first year as president, Armenia\u2019s debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was 13.5 percent. Near the end of his second term in the autumn of 2017 it had more than quadrupled to 58 percent, or $6.4 billion.\n\nArmenia, a former Soviet republic that won its independence in 1991, depends heavily on investment from Russia. The economic downturn in Russia and a sharp devaluation of the ruble in 2014 resulting from a collapse in world oil prices hit remittances from Armenians working there, though they have picked up this past year. Remittances to Armenia dropped to $1.5 billion in 2016 from $2.3 billion in 2013.\n\nSince independence, one-third of the population has left the country of 3.2 million in search of a better life. Many went to Russia, home to the largest Armenian diaspora. Mr. Sargsyan\u2019s government has largely failed to reverse the exodus, and unemployment is close to 20 percent.\n\nPolitical corruption under Mr. Sargsyan has further added to popular anxieties. Armenia was ranked 35 out of 100 in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index last year, with 100 being very clean.\n\nThe Republican Party, the largest right-wing party in Armenia, officially adheres to a free-market ideology. Over the years, it became a home to oligarchs, apparatchiks and wealthy businessmen who would benefit from tax exemptions, even as the government struggled to plug a growing budget deficit. Its members profited from a patron-client system that privileged party elites.

After much consideration, we decided to charge him not only for actions while he was on the federal bench, but also for a corrupt scheme he entered into with a bail bond company while a state court judge, and for the false statements he made during his Senate confirmation process.\n\nWe determined that because Judge Porteous was accused of taking cash and gifts from lawyers whose cases he presided over in state court, there was little question that such actions were incompatible with his responsibility as a federal judge.

But he did it in a staggeringly clumsy way that implicated Trump himself. \u201cWhat Giuliani did that was so stunning was, in stumbling away from the campaign finance violation, he bumbled into potentially criminal federal nondisclosure by his client,\u201d said Eisen.\n\nThat\u2019s because, Eisen said, if Trump either repaid Cohen or was in the process of repaying him, he would have been legally obligated to include that information on his federal financial disclosure forms. Additionally, he said, Trump could be implicated in a criminal cover-up of Cohen\u2019s campaign contribution. Candidates are allowed to spend unlimited personal funds on their own political campaigns, but that\u2019s not what appears to have happened in this case. \u201cWhat happened here is that somebody else made a $130,000 contribution and Trump later repaid it and covered it up,\u201d Eisen said. \u201cThat is not permitted.\u201d\n\nCohen has insisted that there was no campaign finance issue with Daniels\u2019s payoff because it was made for personal rather than political reasons. \u201cWhat I did defensively for my personal client, and my friend, is what attorneys do for their high-profile clients,\u201d he told Vanity Fair in March.", "title": "Opinion | Does Giuliani Have a Plan, or Is This Just a Freakout?", "authors": []}

Trump seems to have imagined he visited the ruins immediately after the attack. Rudy did go there repeatedly, taking visitors to watch the workers who were laboring to clear the site in the toxic dust without protective gear.\n\nBack then, what would you have said if someone told you that Mayor Giuliani would eventually devote his legal skills to defending President Donald Trump from a porn star scandal?

If this affects you the same way it does me, put away the chocolates and pour yourself a nice beverage \u2014 seriously, whatever floats your boat.\n\nFill in OAR at 11A and inhale deeply as the trick to Ms. Carroll\u2019s puzzle hits you: You now have R ___ LADDER, with one measly square left. That\u2019s where the OPEL goes to make the entry ROPE LADDER complete. The realization that OPEL is also a car make hits you in the back of the head, just above the occipital bone.

Years ago, when I was more of a casual crossword solver, I remember doing this alien abduction themed puzzle where several squares had \u201cET\u201d in the shape of a flying saucer and then there was a bonus \u201cCOW\u201d rebus square underneath it. It completely blew my mind. I think about that puzzle a lot when I\u2019m hitting a writer\u2019s block and want to feel bad about how much more creative and ambitious other constructors can be. So I\u2019ve been trying to come up with a good rebus theme for a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there weren\u2019t any car rebuses in the XWord Info database because it seemed like every \u201cthing in a box\u201d idea that came to me had already been done before. Initially I was trying to do something with \u201cboxcars\u201d as the revealer but I found that the 11-letter \u201ccompact cars\u201d made for a better grid layout, plus I think it is more fun.\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nAlmost finished solving but just need a bit more help? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nWarning: There be spoilers ahead, but now you can take a peek at the answer key.

They assessed their diet using a detailed 217-item food frequency questionnaire that included information on portion size. Over the course of the study, and after excluding women who were pregnant, used hormone replacement therapy or had surgically induced menopause, there were 914 women who went through menopause naturally.\n\nThe study, in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, found that the average age at menopause was 51. After adjusting for body mass index, socioeconomic factors, smoking, alcohol consumption and other variables, they found that for each additional two-and-a-half-ounce portion a day of fresh legumes (like peas or beans), menopause was delayed by about one year, and for each additional three-ounce portion of oily fish, by about three years. Eating refined rice and pasta, on the other hand, was associated with an earlier age of menopause.\n\n\u201cThis is an observational study,\u201d said the lead author, Yashvee Dunneram, a Ph.D. student at the University of Leeds in England, \u201cand we can\u2019t advise women on what to eat or not eat based on our findings.

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "Spared destruction by a sentimental Nazi who couldn\u2019t bear to blow the place up, as Hitler had instructed, Paris recuperated from the war with miraculous speed. In Poirier\u2019s account, the city seems more like a small town where everyone knew everyone and together faced down the enemy, then took on the task of building a new world in the ashes of the old. This, of course, wasn\u2019t the case, and Poirier\u2019s sometimes narrow focus presents a rather elite version of the period. Consider, for example, the 1947 debut of Christian Dior\u2019s New Look, using yards and yards of fabric to create full calf-length skirts \u2014 utterly shocking after the necessary parsimony of wartime. The British historian Andrew Hussey has described a Dior photo shoot in the working-class streets of Montmartre when the local women \u201cflew at the models, ripping the clothes to shreds in anger and disgust.\u201d In contrast, Poirier loftily extols the way Dior \u201creintroduced glamour and luxury,\u201d the way he \u201cinvented a new sexy silhouette,\u201d reminding us that Hollywood stars demanded to be dressed by him. This is typical of the way the breathless mythology of the era, to which none of us are immune, can obscure the way we see it. Poirier buys into the \u201cglamour and luxury\u201d at moments like these, but who can really blame her?\n\nImage\n\nPoirier\u2019s account of the decade explores a crucial moment at which prewar and postwar culture came together. She drops in on Marlon Brando watching Eartha Kitt sing at Cocteau\u2019s old haunt, Le Boeuf sur le Toit (\u201cCh\u00e9ri, je vous aime beaucoup, je ne sais pas what to do\u201d), and accompanies Beauvoir on a visit to an aging Alberto Giacometti, who, 20 years past his peak, is finally having a breakthrough. And she\u2019s particularly attentive to Richard Wright\u2019s association with Sartre and Beauvoir\u2019s journal, Les Temps Modernes, emphasizing the meaningful contributions Wright made to French intellectual life. Far from romanticizing the American expat community, Poirier gives us some unflattering portraits of visiting writers. Arriving in 1948, James Baldwin, although welcomed by Wright, promptly tore him apart in his essay \u201cEverybody\u2019s Protest Novel.\u201d Poirier suggests that Norman Mailer\u2019s prickliness was learned from the French. And in her portrait Saul Bellow, forever dissatisfied, coming and going between his wife and family on the Right Bank and his writer\u2019s studio and bachelor lifestyle on the Left, is just really annoying.\n\nAs group biographies go, \u201cLeft Bank\u201d lacks the weightiness of Sarah Bakewell\u2019s \u201cAt the Existentialist Caf\u00e9.\u201d But Poirier excels on a different level, going just beyond the shallows without venturing into the depths. And it\u2019s here that we can best observe the wonderful material details of history that have accrued beneath the waters. She notes, for instance, that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d was driven away from Paris before the war in \u201can ambulance specially fitted with elastic rubber-sprung suspension.\u201d And on Aug. 24, 1944, when the Radiodiffusion de la Nation Fran\u00e7aise appealed to the priests of Paris to ring their church bells, announcing the beginning of the Liberation, \u201cthe 258-year-old lowest-pitch bourdon of Notre Dame Cathedral, the 13-ton bell known as Emmanuel, Notre Dame\u2019s largest, rang out in F sharp so loudly that it would be heard at least five miles away.\u201d\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s Paris and the pursuit of freedom that unites the people in Poirier\u2019s book. From their homes on the Right and Left Banks, they will have heard the bell that evening and felt the same rush of joy and hope. We experience it too, thanks to a detail like that. As Poirier hops across arrondissements, she manages to create the feeling we\u2019re peeking into the windows of her subjects, looking at buildings that still stand, at inhabitants long gone.", "title": "Eavesdropping on Beauvoir, Sartre and Their Circle of Friends", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "But the possible legalization of a widely abused party drug raises a lot of questions.\n\nHow might MDMA therapy work?\n\nNo one goes home with a bottle of Ecstasy.\n\nIf approved by the F.D.A., MDMA would only be administered by a licensed therapist. First, a patient goes through three sessions of psychotherapy. In the fourth session, the patient takes a pill.\n\nAfter taking the drug, the patient lies on a futon amid candles and fresh flowers, listening to music. Two therapists \u2014 one female, one male \u2014 sit at the patient\u2019s side as guides. That session lasts eight hours.\n\n\u201cWe encourage them to set aside all expectation and agenda and be open. Experiences tend to be very individual,\u201d said Dr. Michael Mithoefer, one of the principal researchers.\n\nThe drug floods the brain with hormones and neurotransmitters that evoke feelings of trust and well-being, users report. Researchers say this allows patients to re-examine traumatic memories.\n\nIn follow-up psychotherapy, patients process emotions and insights brought up during the MDMA session. The current protocol calls for patients to take MDMA two or three times, each a month apart, interspersed with psychotherapy.\n\n\u201cThe MDMA alone or the therapy alone don\u2019t appear to be as effective,\u201d Dr. Mithoefer said. \u201cThe MDMA seems to act as a catalyst that allows the healing to happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat do patients say about it?\n\n\u201cI was actually able to forgive myself,\u201d said Nigel McCourry, 36 a Marine veteran who was deployed in 2004 to Falluja, Iraq, whose experiences mirrored those of three other patients interviewed.\n\nMr. McCourry came home from war unable to escape scenes of an explosion that nearly killed him, and haunted by the memory of two young girls he accidentally killed in a fire fight. He struggled to sleep. He drank to forget. Rage eroded most of his relationships.\n\nHe tried help at a Veterans Affairs hospital, but couldn\u2019t let his guard down enough to benefit from standard psychotherapy. A handful of medications meant to help left him feeling like a zombie, and he gave them up. He was contemplating suicide when he tried MDMA.\n\n\u201cWhen it kicked in, it was like an epiphany,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see all these things from combat I was afraid to look at before, and I had a totally new perspective. I relived the parts of me I had lost. I realized I had viewed myself as a monster, and I was able to start to have some compassion for myself. It was a turning point, and for the next year I continued to get better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are also still some challenges I have to face from time to time related to the PTSD,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now I am able to work through them without getting stuck.\u201d\n\nBut does it actually work?\n\nThat\u2019s an open question.\n\nLarge-scale trials, which will include up to 300 participants at 14 sites, may not be able to replicate the success of previous trials, which were limited to a few dozen patients. But so far, results are encouraging. Nearly all patients saw clinically significant reductions in symptoms, and a majority saw such drastic reductions that they no longer met the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. In the 12 months after MDMA therapy, PTSD symptoms generally continued to decrease.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Isn\u2019t there something better?\n\nNot really, said Dr. John Krystal, who heads the Neurosciences Division at the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. He described the current lack of effective therapy as \u201ca crisis.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe problem is that we don\u2019t have many treatments and what we have doesn\u2019t work that well,\u201d he said.\n\nOnly about one in three combat veterans with PTSD are effectively treated, he said.\n\nDoctors often use a combination of off-label drugs to try to manage patients\u2019 nightmares, flashbacks and depression, but the drugs do nothing to treat the underlying condition, and can have negative side effects.\n\nPsychotherapy also has limitations. Though many patients find it helpful, others find it too traumatizing or ineffective and quit therapy. In some studies, dropout rates were as high as 40 percent.\n\nWho is behind these studies?\n\nNot big pharma. The research is organized by a small nonprofit called the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or M.A.P.S., which was created in 1986 shortly after MDMA was outlawed.\n\n\u201cNo one else would touch this, so we had to do it,\u201d said the founder of M.A.P.S., Rick Doblin, who has a doctorate in public policy from Harvard and has made legalizing MDMA his life\u2019s work.\n\nThe Phase 3 trials are expected to cost $27 million.\n\nWhere does the money come from?\n\nIt\u2019s all donations. And they have come from an odd array of sources. David Bronner, the vegan C.E.O. \u2014 that\u2019s Cosmic Engagement Officer \u2014 of Dr. Bronner\u2019s Magic Soaps and an unapologetic evangelist for psychedelics has given $5 million.\n\nBut also in the mix are the archconservative Mercer family, who typically fund right-leaning institutions including Cambridge Analytica and Breitbart News; the late Richard Rockefeller, a champion of public health; and an anonymous donor known only as Pine, who transferred $5 million in Bitcoin.\n\nDoes this mean people can just self medicate with MDMA?\n\nPeople already are. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that in 2014 more than 17 million Americans reported using MDMA. While many are likely doing it purely for recreation, word of the therapeutic uses has spread, and combat veterans are trying it illegally at home.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut street Ecstasy is dangerous. Doses of the street drug can be an unknown mix of other stimulants and hallucinogens, and an overdose can be fatal. High frequency use of MDMA can also damage the brain.\n\nWho cashes in if MDMA becomes legal?\n\nM.A.P.S. would at first. MDMA was originally patented by pharmaceutical giant Merck in 1912, but it was never marketed and the patent lapsed. The F.D.A. grants temporary \u201cdata exclusivity\u201d to groups that show new uses for drugs with expired patents. That would give M.A.P.S. a five-year monopoly in the U.S. After that, other companies could make it.\n\nM.A.P.S. plans to spin off sales to a for-profit benefit corporation, which would then funnel the money back into clinical research on the use of MDMA with other disorders.\n\nIs MDMA therapy new?\n\nYes and no. MDMA is an illegal drug and has never been approved for any use by the F.D.A. But for about a decade before it was outlawed in 1985, it was used as an aid in psychotherapy, especially on the West Coast.\n\nAt the time, academics were beginning to argue that it and other psychedelic drugs could be a useful ally in psychotherapy. The idea failed to gain traction then, but now a number of prestigious researchers are studying the potential therapeutic uses of LSD, psilocybin and MDMA.", "title": "Ecstasy as a Remedy for PTSD?

Cash on Tesla\u2019s balance sheet at the end of the first quarter fell to $2.7 billion from $3.4 billion in the previous quarter. And the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, on a conference call on Wednesday said the company did not want to raise fresh capital.\n\nAnalysts on the conference call asked what capital expenditures Tesla may reduce in order to meet its lower target. Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company might be able to spend less as it attempts to rationalize its production. But when an analyst then asked Mr. Musk about Tesla\u2019s capital requirements, the chief executive did not answer the question and told the operator to move to another questioner. Around this time, Tesla\u2019s stock slid sharply in the after-market trading.\n\n-- Peter Eavis\n\nTelsa by the numbers\n\nTesla lost nearly $800 million in the first three months of the year, the sixth quarter in a row it has lost money.\n\nBut Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, said the company was on the verge of a decisive upturn and could make money in the second half of the year.

Put another way, investors should not see a 2 percent inflation rate as a level never to be breached. Indeed, on Wednesday, investors appeared to view the Fed\u2019s use of \u201csymmetric\u201d as a signal that the Fed was willing to allow inflation run above the 2 percent level for a period. Ward McCarthy, the chief financial economist at Jeffries, wrote:\n\n\u201cTo the extent there is a surprise in the policy statement, it is that the addition of the description of the 2% inflation objective as being \u2018symmetric.\u2019 This intended to reinforce some of the inflation rhetoric that has indicated that deviation of inflation to the upside will not necessarily elicit a policy response, especially in light of the prolonged period of below-target inflation.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nWhy Apple\u2019s share repurchases have been good for investors\n\nApple\u2019s stock buyback program isn\u2019t just bigger than those of other companies, it\u2019s also better at doing what investors want share repurchases to do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nApple on Tuesday said it was going to buy back another $100 billion of its own stock. The company announced the plan as it is about to complete a $210 billion stock repurchase program. As large as those numbers seem, they don\u2019t reveal the degree to which the repurchases have benefited shareholders. What matters to them is whether Apple has significantly fewer shares outstanding at the end of the program. If that is achieved, Apple\u2019s earnings per share will be higher, which could lead investors to view the stock more positively.\n\nApple\u2019s diluted shares outstanding have fallen nearly 24 percent over the past five years. Here\u2019s how that compares with some companies that are known for their large stock buybacks. Over the past five years, IBM\u2019s shares outstanding have declined by some 18 percent, Cisco\u2019s have decreased just over 8 percent, and Microsoft\u2019s have fallen by 7.5 percent.\n\nApple\u2019s cash flow statements show it has spent nearly $200 billion on stock repurchases over the past five years, which works out at 57 percent of its cash flow from operations for the period. That percentage is also above that of other companies. The cash Cisco spent on stock repurchases over the past five years amounted to 46 percent of its cash flow from operations. At IBM, that number was 44 percent.\n\n\u2014 Peter Eavis\n\nApple\u2019s big tax cut plan: stock buybacks\n\nRepurchasing $100 billion worth of shares should use a lot of Apple\u2019s famous $252 billion cash hoard. But it isn\u2019t an investment in R.&D. or hiring, and it disproportionately affects wealthier stockholders rather than most people.\n\nThe buybacks aren\u2019t coming at the expense of U.S. investment or job-creation, Apple says. (Its C.F.O., Luca Maestri, said Apple was indeed investing, but that didn\u2019t mean it should keep extra cash on its balance sheet.) But there\u2019s a pattern of American companies using their tax windfalls to reward investors rather than to expand.\n\nPeter Eavis\u2019s take: The amount sounds like a lot, but Apple has a huge stock market value, and investors are now used to buybacks.\n\nHow Apple\u2019s business looks: Pretty good. Higher iPhone prices helped. And services revenue is growing strongly.\n\nPhoto\n\nWill the Fed offer clues about future rate increases?\n\nMost everyone expects the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut investors and policymakers will comb over the Fed\u2019s policy statement for clues about whether the central bank plans to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "The type of exercise did not seem to matter. Some happy people walked or jogged. Others practiced yoga-style posing and stretching.\n\nAnd the amount of exercise needed to influence happiness was slight, Dr. Chen says. In several studies, people who worked out only once or twice a week said they felt much happier than those who never exercised. In other studies, 10 minutes a day of physical activity was linked with buoyant moods.\n\nBut more movement generally contributed to greater happiness. If people exercised for at least 30 minutes on most days, which is the standard American and European recommendation for good health, Dr. Chen says, they were about 30 percent more likely to consider themselves happy than people who did not meet the guidelines.\n\n\u201cI think the indications are strong that exercise can contribute to happiness and, while anything helps, a bit more is probably better,\u201d she says.\n\nBut because most of the studies in this review were observational, she says, it is not possible yet to establish whether exercise directly causes changes in happiness or if the two just happen to occur together often. It could be that happy people are more likely to take up exercise and continue with it than people who feel sad. In that case, exercise would not have helped to make people happy; rather, their happiness would have helped to make them exercisers.\n\nHappiness also is an inherently subjective, squishy concept. The studies analyzed in the review asked people how happy they felt. But one person\u2019s happiness could be another\u2019s relative gloom, making it difficult to generalize about how any of us might react, emotionally, to starting an exercise routine.\n\nAnd, of course, the review did not delve into how exercise could be influencing happiness.\n\n\u201cThere are indications that social factors could mediate the effects of exercise on happiness for some people,\u201d Dr. Chen says. In other words, the social interactions that occur during an exercise class or trip to the gym might help to elevate people\u2019s moods.", "title": "Even a Little Exercise Might Make Us Happier", "authors": []}

One catalog, in 1973, offers rich descriptions of old masters paintings and drawings from a huge trove of art donated by Charles and Jayne Wrightsman.\n\nKatharine Baetjer, curator of European paintings at the Met, said in an interview that this monumental catalog established Mr. Fahy as a \u201cfirst-class scholar.\u201d\n\nMr. Fahy\u2019s first tenure with the Met coincided with Thomas Hoving\u2019s tumultuous one as director. A charismatic showman who turned the Met into a more populist institution, Mr. Hoving took a gamble by acquiring Velazquez\u2019s 1650 portrait of his assistant, Juan de Pareja, in 1971 for $5.5 million, an astonishing price at the time (the equivalent of about $34 million today). A year later, The Times reported that the Met, to help defray the cost of buying the Velazquez, had quietly sold Rousseau\u2019s \u201cThe Tropics\u201d for $600,000 and van Gogh\u2019s \u201cThe Olive Pickers\u201d for $250,000 to a private gallery.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Fahy objected to selling the Rousseau, and that disagreement, Ms. Baetjer said, led him to leave the Met for the Frick in 1973.\n\nEverett Philip Fahy Jr. was born on March 29, 1941, in Darby, Pa., about five miles southwest of Philadelphia. His father was a real estate agent and homebuilder; his mother, the former Dorothy Jermaka, was a homemaker.\n\nAs a youngster, Everett shared his parents\u2019 interests in plants and flowers and often explored the gardens in his neighborhood, his brother said. He also acted in school plays.\n\nHe studied English and chemistry at the University of Virginia, but a class in art history during his junior year altered his trajectory. At Harvard, where he earned his master\u2019s degree, he studied with the Italian Renaissance scholar Sydney Freedberg.\n\nFollowing a fellowship at I Tatti, a villa overlooking Florence that had been given to Harvard by the art historian Bernard Berenson, Mr. Fahy received a Ph.D. from Harvard for his thesis on the Florentine painter Domenico Ghirlandaio, whose apprentices included a young Michelangelo. Mr. Fahy turned the dissertation into a book, \u201cSome Followers of Domenico Ghirlandaio\u201d (1975).\n\nHe was hired in 1968 by the Met as a consultant to Mr. Hoving on European paintings, but he left after a year.\n\n\u201cI was like a little golden boy whom nobody knew what to do with,\u201d he told The New Yorker. He taught at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts for a year before accepting Mr. Hoving\u2019s offer to become the Met\u2019s curator in charge of European paintings.\n\nAfter leaving the Met a second time, he spent 13 years at the Frick, the former mansion of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick on the Upper East Side. During his tenure there, the museum expanded with a new reception hall and garden, increased the number of its exhibitions and had nearly all its paintings cleaned by the Met\u2019s head of conservation.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIan Wardropper, the Frick\u2019s director, said in a telephone interview: \u201cHe was an excellent cook. At my one lunch with him at the Frick, he dressed the salad and tossed it himself. He was very particular about how he entertained. He was also a great raconteur.\u201d\n\nWhile at the Frick, Mr. Fahy wrote the catalog for \u201cFrom Leonardo to Titian: Italian Renaissance Paintings From the Hermitage,\u201d a 1979 exhibition of paintings at the National Gallery of Art in Washington from the storied museum in what is now St. Petersburg, Russia. In a review of the show, John Russell of The Times called Mr. Fahy \u201cone of our nimblest needlemen\u201d for ably threading the works of Leonardo, Raphael, Titian, Andrea del Saito, Francesco Primaticcio and Jacopo da Pontormo into a cohesive narrative.\n\nMr. Fahy returned to the Met in 1986 as chairman of the museum\u2019s department of European paintings and built a reputation for letting his curators do their jobs without much interference.\n\n\u201cHe was a great administrator,\u201d Ms. Baetjer said. \u201cHe saved us from a lot of boring work.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, a year after Mr. Fahy\u2019s retirement, he produced a lengthy study of Velazquez\u2019s early-16th-century painting, \u201cSaint John the Baptist Bearing Witness.\u201d He concluded that its attribution \u2014 to a collaboration of the circle around Francesco Granacci, a student of Ghirlandaio\u2019s \u2014 was incorrect. Rather, he said, it had been painted by Michelangelo, a friend of Granacci\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI believe Michelangelo painted it in 1506, two years before he started on the Sistine ceiling,\u201d Mr. Fahy told ARTnews in 2010.\n\nMr. Fahy\u2019s belief has not been universally accepted, but he was \u201cperfectly happy to put it out there,\u201d Mr. Christiansen said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been thinking about it for many years,\u201d she added, \u201cand was absolutely convinced of it.\u201d\n\nThe Met did not change its attribution.\n\nBut skepticism did not bother Mr. Fahy. \u201cWith attributions, it\u2019s not the number of people who agree with you,\u201d he told ARTnews. \u201cIt\u2019s the quality of their judgments.\u201d", "title": "Everett Fahy, Museum Authority on European Painting, Is Dead at 77", "authors": ["Richard Sandomir"]}

He was removed after conducting government business using an email address associated with his consulting firm, Global Impact Inc., which fed the impression that he was using his position with the transition team to drum up business, according to an adviser to the transition.\n\nPhoto\n\nMore recently, Mr. Freedman advised Mr. Trump\u2019s new national security adviser, John R. Bolton, as he prepared to take office, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. They said that he had worked as a special government employee during the Trump administration \u2014 a position that allowed him to maintain his outside consulting business while working for the federal government.\n\nMr. Freedman declined to comment. A statement he provided to The New York Times from the American Australian Council said that the group had authorized him to have discussions with the E.P.A. about the possible trip to Australia, \u201cto further the mission\u201d of the organization.\n\nMr. Pruitt still has the support of Mr. Trump, a top White House official said Tuesday, despite the fact that Mr. Pruitt faces 11 investigations into his spending and management practices at the E.P.A.\n\nJahan Wilcox, a spokesman for Mr. Pruitt, said that the agency\u2019s staff was in charge of planning the Australia trip and that Mr. Freedman\u2019s involvement began in mid-2017.\n\nHowever, emails released recently under the Freedom of Information Act to the Sierra Club, which sued to obtain the documents, appear to contradict that. The emails indicate Mr. Freedman was involved in early March, just weeks after Mr. Pruitt was confirmed as the E.P.A. chief, in coming up with reasons to justify a trip by Mr. Pruitt to Australia.\n\nRepresentative Don Beyer, Democrat of Virginia, who has been critical of Mr. Pruitt\u2019s spending, said the emails help to document allegations raised by Mr. Pruitt\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Kevin Chmielewski, who had questioned Mr. Pruitt\u2019s travel spending before being pushed out of the agency earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cPruitt\u2019s trips began with Pruitt ordering staff to \u2018find me something to do\u2019 to justify his expensive travel,\u201d Mr. Beyer said, quoting Mr. Chmielewski. Mr. Beyer said that the emails \u201calso reveal that lobbyists for energy companies and foreign governments acted as travel agents.\u201d\n\nThe Australian embassy said in a statement that it was unaware that Mr. Freedman had been working to arrange the trip, and that neither Mr. Freedman nor his company \u201chas been engaged to represent Australia.\u201d The embassy added that the American Australian Council, for which Mr. Freedman serves as treasurer, \u201cis an independent organization that does not represent the Australian government.\u201d\n\nMr. Freedman advises global corporations seeking to break into the Australian business market, according to someone familiar with his work.\n\nMr. Freedman frequently discussed the possible Australia trip with another lobbyist, Richard Smotkin, who has longstanding ties to Mr. Pruitt. Mr. Smotkin also helped organize Mr. Pruitt\u2019s December trip to Morocco, and then four months later signed the $40,000-a-month contract to represent an arm of the government of that North African country.\n\nMichael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement, \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder these emails had to be forced out by a court: They expose the fact that corporate lobbyists are orchestrating Pruitt\u2019s taxpayer-funded trips to push their dangerous agendas.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Most were sent to Millan Hupp, a top political aide to Mr. Pruitt. Ms. Hupp also worked with Mr. Pruitt as a political assistant when he was Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general.\n\nMs. Hupp served as a gatekeeper for Mr. Pruitt with companies and organizations interested in getting on his calendar or inviting him to an event, the emails indicate. Those companies have included the coal producer Peabody Energy and Koch Industries, the conglomerate controlled by the billionaire brothers David and Charles Koch, as well as dozens of others, with a particular emphasis on fossil-fuel-related firms and chemical industry and agriculture groups such as the American Farm Bureau.\n\nMr. Freedman is not registered as a lobbyist for the government of Australia, nor is he currently registered to lobby on behalf of any foreign or domestic clients in the United States, according to records on file with Congress and the Department of Justice. They show that a now-inactive firm he had formed with Mr. Manafort was last registered to lobby in the late 1990s, when it represented the government of Nigeria and the Argentine politician Alberto Pierri.\n\nMr. Freedman\u2019s associates say he continues to advise international clients in various capacities that do not trigger lobbying disclosure requirements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the emails, Mr. Freedman offered Ms. Hupp a series of suggestions as to whom Mr. Pruitt could meet with on the trip to Australia. Mr. Freedman said he had already been talking to top government officials there to get the planning started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in direct contact with the Minister in Aus, and we will be speaking with his senior staffer (Cosi) who is the lead from their side on Monday night,\u201d Mr. Freedman wrote to Ms. Hupp in late June, as the planning for the trip got underway. \u201cAlso, Jim Carouso, the Charge at the US Emb in Canberra is a close personal friend and would likely have good inputs, but I want to wait a bit before I contact him.\u201d\n\nIn a separate email, he suggested Mr. Pruitt meet with top Australian officials including Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. And he went on to suggest topics that could be discussed at the meeting, including \u201cthe current US Australian environmental agreements that are currently in place and whether they should be changed or updated or canceled or replaced.\u201d\n\nMr. Freedman placed a condition on the assistance he was providing: His involvement should not be disclosed. \u201cRick and I will be present but not listed as members of the delegation,\u201d Mr. Freedman wrote, referring to Mr. Smotkin.\n\nMs. Hupp\u2019s input in these email exchanges was short, with notes back to Mr. Freedman like \u201cSounds good. We will plan for Monday morning,\u201d in response to a request in July from Mr. Freedman to discuss the Australia trip.\n\nThe exchanges showed an awareness that traveling to Australia would have its complexities, given that Mr. Pruitt is a climate change skeptic.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges to a visit,\u201d Mr. Freedman wrote in one March 2017 memo, as the debate over the trip first started. \u201cIt would highlight the Australian Government aggressive support for policies that may not be in sync with the Trump Administration, and the strong financial role played by the Australian Government in protecting the environment.\u201d\n\nLater, on July 18, Mr. Freedman wrote to Ms. Hupp to say that Mr. Pruitt should be prepared for a \u201cconfused and angry group of Aussies\u201d who were likely to disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn climate change specifically, Mr. Freedman wrote that he had been in touch with the executive director of the Institute of Public Affairs, an Australian think tank that he described as being \u201caligned with the Trump vision on various issues\u201d including coal and deregulation. Mr. Freedman said he planned to suggest more people Mr. Pruitt should meet through that organization.\n\nThe emails released to the Sierra Club also provide further documentation of the role that Mr. Smotkin played in setting up Mr. Pruitt\u2019s December visit to Morocco. Ms. Hupp turned to Mr. Smotkin in September to set up a meeting with the Moroccan ambassador to the United States.\n\n\u201cWould you be so kind as to pass along these three dates as potential for a meeting with the Moroccan Minister?\u201d Ms. Hupp wrote to Mr. Smotkin. He agreed to do so, and wrote back to correct the title: \u201cWill do. It is the ambassador.\u201d\n\nThough the trip to Australia was ultimately canceled, vouchers previously released by the E.P.A. show that two aides and three security officials spent about $45,000 traveling there to set up meetings and prepare for Mr. Pruitt\u2019s arrival.", "title": "Ex-Lobbyist for Foreign Governments Helped Plan Pruitt Trip to Australia", "authors": ["Lisa Friedman", "Eric Lipton", "Kenneth P.

Volkswagen never made the findings public, although it had promised to do so.\n\nAnd the indictments provide ammunition to critics who say Volkswagen continues to rely on managers who held high-ranking positions while the wrongdoing was taking place, and who worked closely with Mr. Winterkorn.

Prosecutors there are conducting their own wide-ranging investigation, which included a raid on offices of the company\u2019s Porsche division last month.\n\nLast year, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to United States charges that included conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act. But the company blamed lower-level managers for the wrongdoing and maintained that no members of its top management had been involved.\n\nIf it is proven that Mr. Winterkorn was a party to the conspiracy, Volkswagen would be significantly more vulnerable to lawsuits brought by shareholders who accuse top managers of shirking their obligation to inform them of the risks the company was taking. The shareholders are seeking some $10 billion in damages, which would be on top of the roughly $26 billion in fines and civil damages that the carmaker has already paid.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr. Winterkorn was informed in early 2014 that regulators in the United States were asking why Volkswagen diesel vehicles had produced low emissions during laboratory tests but drastically higher emissions on the road.\n\nThe indictment said Mr. Winterkorn had approved plans to conceal from regulators the true reason for the discrepancies: The cars were equipped with software, known as a defeat device, that could detect when emissions tests were underway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf the car was being tested, it deployed equipment to keep emissions within legal limits. At other times, the pollution controls were disabled or only partly deployed to protect components from wear.\n\nMr. Winterkorn continued to endorse efforts to cover up the wrongdoing until shortly before a Volkswagen employee disobeyed orders and revealed the defeat device to California regulators in August 2015, the indictment says.\n\nMr. Winterkorn, known as an unforgiving boss who loudly berated subordinates who failed to meet his standards, was Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive for eight years and an influential executive for two decades. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch, the Porsche family scion who dominated the company for two decades.\n\nMr. Winterkorn joins five other defendants, all former managers who worked in engine development, who were charged last year. They are accused of conspiring to defraud the United States government in its enforcement of pollution standards under the Clean Air Act, and conspiring to commit wire fraud and to violate the Clean Air Act itself.\n\nIn pleading guilty to felony charges last year, Volkswagen admitted that it had illegally sold nearly 600,000 vehicles equipped with defeat devices. It paid $4.3 billion in penalties and was put on probation for three years, with a former federal prosecutor, Larry D. Thompson, overseeing its compliance with ethics and regulatory measures.\n\nA former Volkswagen manager in Michigan, Oliver Schmidt, was sentenced in December to seven years in prison for his role in the scheme. A former Volkswagen engineer who worked in California, James Liang, was sentenced last year to three and a half years in prison.\n\nIn addition, United States authorities are seeking extradition of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, 61, a former Audi manager who is in Germany. As an Italian citizen, Mr. Pamio does not enjoy the same immunity from extradition that the German defendants do.\n\nGerman prosecutors have made no formal charges but are expected to do so by the end of the year.

It\u2019s driven by the community dynamics that they don\u2019t want to come to us. They don\u2019t want this exclusive experience.\n\nThey\u2019re very happy to come to us, but they want to see us come to them. So we started going to Palo Alto about almost 15 years ago.\n\nAnd from our lessons \u2014 like our lessons in Beijing and around the world \u2014 you realize that you must become part of that community. You have to have something to offer that community.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt is about connecting with the artists, connecting with historians, and also seeing how the galleries connect with a broader public. Because that\u2019s what in particular in a place like Palo Alto or a place like Shenzhen the interest is in \u2014 how do we touch millions and millions of people, which is something that the art world historically hasn\u2019t put a huge focus on. So that becomes extremely important.\n\nArt in a Populist Age\n\nDr. Tristram Hunt\n\nDirector, Victoria and Albert Museum, London\n\nRight from the beginning, museums like the V&A had this very popular, democratic, civic function. And arguably they slightly lost their way in the mid-20th century, when they became very introverted, scholastic, overly academic in terms of their approach to the public. So we are going back to our founding mission.\n\nBut the tactic we take is that we don\u2019t give an inch on curatorial excellence, that actually what the public comes to museums and pays quite large sums of money to see is the insides of curatorial talent and skill alongside the collections. We will move heaven and earth to make it as accessible as possible.\n\nBut you\u2019ve got to have the balance. We cannot be a theme park. We cannot be a venue-for-hire. Scholarship and curatorial scholarship has to absolutely be at the heart of it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nManaging as a Mega-Dealer\n\nDavid Zwirner\n\nOwner, David Zwirner Gallery\n\nThe primary motivation to grow is to further the artists\u2019 audience. So what we do as a gallery, first and foremost, we are representing artists and artist estates. And our job is to bring that work to not just those places that are already familiar with it, but also the places that are not familiar with the work.\n\nYou need more touchpoints where you can inform people about what the artists are doing that we represent.\n\nAnd of course, ideally, you do that in a gallery setting where you present an exhibition.\n\nBut art fairs are very important, and, you know, it\u2019s a great way to get to know new people and to present one\u2019s program across the world.\n\nThe audience is actually changing. The socioeconomic mix is totally different. It\u2019s much younger than it used to be. And subsequently, different types of people are coming into the gallery, and that\u2019s a beautiful thing.\n\nOf course, the gallery is for free, so people should come.\n\nPreoccupation With Contemporary Art\n\nJorge Coll\n\nChief executive, Colnaghi\n\nI was reading some materials prepared for the panel this morning and noticed that in 2017 the highest-attended exhibition globally was ancient Buddhist sculptures in Tokyo \u2014 nearly 12,000 people a day coming to see ancient Japanese sculptures.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo in a way I think that we don\u2019t have a job to do that is engaged in singling out the old versus the new. We have a job to do in terms of defining access and inclusion across the entire spectrum of our programmatic mission fulfillment.\n\nAnd so our ability to tell expansive stories in the ancient world, in the old master world, and the contemporary world, I think the obligation is exactly the same.\n\nBut I also think that in general times \u2014 and I know that there are certain people here in the audience that have dealt with this \u2014 experience has also become more interesting than possession. That is a challenge \u2014 how do we as, in my case a dealer, find people that actually still want to possess something?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAsia: The Next Market Frontier\n\nLisa Dennison\n\nChairman, Americas, Sotheby\u2019s\n\nForty percent of our new clients in the recent years are under 40 years old, so it\u2019s a very young demographic. About 40 percent of their spend is on Western art. And that\u2019s really interesting to us.\n\nThe billionaires in Asia tend to be about 20 years younger than billionaires in the West, so that\u2019s also another kind of support statistic for a much younger demographic.\n\nThe Promise and Perils of Expansion\n\nSheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani\n\nChairwoman, Qatar Museums board of trustees\n\nI think with the National Museum of Qatar we\u2019ve been always reluctant to announce an opening date just because of the complexity of the museum. It\u2019s finished in terms of building. The construction is complete. The collection is in place.\n\nIf a museum in the West is delayed, nobody really talks about it or cares. The moment a museum in the Middle East is delayed, it\u2019s front page headlines. So for us, we want to make sure that we open it correctly as opposed to opening it on the day that we have previously announced.\n\nSo we\u2019re not challenged by the idea of reflecting on our project and deciding when to really open it. I think, currently, we\u2019re looking at opening the building in March of \u201919 \u2014 so from December to March is not really that much of a delay.\n\nDaniel H. Weiss\n\nPresident and chief executive, Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe Metropolitan went through a process of careful review of our facilities and developed a master plan about five or six years ago and within that plan we identified a lot of deferred maintenance issues that had to be addressed, that had built over the course of five decades. I\u2019m talking about over $800 million dollars\u2019 worth of deferred maintenance.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd we needed a plan to deal with what we already had and the consequence of expansion over the course of the last five decades that was very extensive.\n\nThe modern and contemporary art facilities we have now are not worthy of the rest of the Metropolitan. It\u2019s not substantial enough for our existing collection and it has all kinds of infrastructure problems. So I think one of the lessons in this discussion is, what does it take to actually produce an expansion project?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne has to be as thoughtful and focused about priorities, to be a good client for the architect and for ourselves and I think when we began this project several years ago we had lots of good ideas. That\u2019s great. But if you have too many of them, the project gets increasingly complex, increasingly expensive, increasingly unwieldy. Our budgets are now in order and we have a very good plan.\n\nElizabeth Diller\n\nFounding partner, Diller, Scofidio + Renfro\n\nMy studio took on the MoMA expansion project because we knew that MoMA really, really needed to transform. It needed to expand to show more of its collection because a lot of its collection is behind closed doors.\n\nSecondly, it\u2019s interface with the city was really not very good. How could MoMA be better in its current manifestation and how could it show more work in better ways, in deeper ways? The whole variety of work, things that it was not able to show because of limitations.\n\nSo, you know, I\u2019ve been doing this with all my heart and I have full belief that the project is going to be a big improvement.\n\nArt Through Technology\n\nOlafur Eliasson\n\nArtist\n\nAlmost everything in the studio is influenced by computers nowadays. The artists who work there work with computers; the architects are trained on computers. So it\u2019s hard to imagine running the studio without technology, so to speak.\n\nWe have a number of things going on in the research which are related to technology, such as playing with VR. And we\u2019re very active on the social media. And it turns out that, for instance, the home page, when we finally got around to checking how many people actually visit the home page, there\u2019s more people visiting the home page than going to the exhibitions.\n\nSo some years ago we took the home page much more seriously, realizing, my God, this is our space, this is a way to have a dialogue with people that is otherwise not really appreciated. So gradually we have become incredibly influenced by technology.\n\nPhoto\n\nArt in a World of Disruption\n\nAi WeiWei\n\nArtist\n\nFor me, the art I love is always political. Picasso is very political to me. All those important artists, they always have very political opinions. Duchamps is very political to me. He became very intellectual.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIf you talk about Medieval art or Renaissance, good art always has to have a strong content, giving new definition to aesthetics \u2014 you know, having a strong moral manifesto and always having a strong philosophy behind it.\n\nVirtual Reality as Art Form\n\nEdward Klaris\n\nManaging partner, Klaris Law; chief executive, KlarisIP\n\nThere\u2019s a number of ways that VR can be used. One is, artists adopting a new medium. But what I can imagine is that this world will draw from moviemakers, from photographers, from VR people, young people who grow up in a space. And so as you look at the categories of artists you also have to look at the way the different fields monetize their content, right?\n\nI mean, in the art world traditionally you take an object and you sell it for a given price, and that exchange is it. And then that object gets sold again to another person at another time, and that\u2019s it. The artist gets paid only the first time.\n\nHowever, in the movie business the relationship with your art might change very much. You might get paid every time the thing is sold or distributed. It might be a piece of VR that\u2019s going down on Netflix, and in your home you\u2019re wearing your goggles. So the artist could be getting a royalty as opposed to a single-sale payment.\n\nSandra Nedvetskaia\n\nPartner, Khora Contemporary\n\nI think we are moving in the direction of virtual reality, in general, technology, being part of our everyday life. We see now how museums have embraced VR, we saw the Tate with the Modigliani show, where they reproduced Modigliani\u2019s studio, which was quite talked about and popular, and drew quite a lot of younger crowds, who maybe were not familiar with the artist.\n\nYou have virtual museums where private collectors put their artworks into a virtual world so you can approach the works and see them in a virtual space, without having to actually physically go to the museum.\n\nI always ask myself how would my kids want to experience art. What would draw them to a museum? In our family we all come from the art world, so it forces them to look at art. But they perceive art in a completely different way if it\u2019s done with the aid of technology, whether we like it or not. And I think this is the future, and this is an opportunity for us to draw the younger generations to museums, to art galleries.\n\nThe Future of Art Museums\n\nGlenn D. Lowry\n\nDirector of the Museum of Modern Art, New York\n\nI think the real issue for all of us in the museum world is to learn to think digitally, so that what we\u2019re talking about is not simply the transformation of certain kinds of stories into different formats, or the use of new technologies to deliver those stories, but to fundamentally rethink how we think, to move away from the kind of analogue art history that we were all taught \u2014 hierarchical, sequential, to a more networked reconsidered manner of actually presenting works of art, so that we begin to move into a realm where the way in which we look at art, the way in which we display art, actually is no longer so analogue.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd I think one of the great advents of digital technology is that it has begun to teach us how to imagine different relationships between objects and between viewers and objects.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI think one of the reasons we\u2019ve seen our demographics change dramatically from an average age of a little over 50 to an average age of under 40 has been because we\u2019ve recognized what people who are younger want to do when they go to a museum. They want to be with each other, and talk, and think, and text, and create a kind of continuum of experience.\n\nThe Changing Dynamics of Auction Houses and Dealers\n\nEdward Dolman\n\nChief executive, Phillips\n\nEssentially it is a very collaborative business. I mean, we\u2019re all sitting here in this room, we all know each other. We\u2019re sitting here with museum directors, gallery owners, auction house people. There\u2019s a huge amount of shared resolve I suppose, and shared experience.\n\nAnd all that comes together quite often to create business opportunities in our world. And I\u2019ve always believed that the most successful people in our business are the people who do collaborate \u2014 legally of course, for most \u2014 and there are huge opportunities for dealers to work with auction houses.\n\nCapital and finance and the amounts of money that are now required \u2014 I mean, most dealers find it very difficult to get anywhere near because of the sums of money required. Auction houses are a source of funding for deals, etc., etc.\n\nSo, yeah, we are in a different world, and I think inevitably we\u2019ve been collaborating more and more closely for some time.\n\nMarc Porter\n\nChairman of Christie\u2019s Americas\n\nI think that we\u2019re both competitors and collaborators. I would draw a distinction though between the secondary market and the primary market. I agree that the primary market is no place for auction houses, and that it requires a completely different structure in order to build the careers of artists.\n\nI think when it comes to the secondary market it is very much a place for auction houses in the guise of private sales, and that there should be no distinction, and that the global footprint of either the great galleries or the auction houses provide equally good distribution options for the clients.\n\nDominique L\u00e9vy\n\nCo-founder and partner, L\u00e9vy Gorvy\n\nSometimes we compete, and sometimes we collaborate. But at the end of the line it\u2019s two very different professions.\n\nBeing a gallery, being in auction houses have two different motivations, two different goals. But I think there are places where it\u2019s a very fruitful collaboration.", "title": "Excerpts From the Art Leaders Network Conference", "authors": ["The New York Times"]}

And the world\u2019s largest internet companies, from Google to Microsoft to Baidu, are jockeying for researchers who specialize in these technologies. Many of them are coming from academia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically going where the talent is,\u201d Mr. Schroepfer said.\n\nBut the supply of talent is not keeping up with demand, and salaries have skyrocketed. Well-known researchers are receiving compensation in salary, bonuses and stock worth millions of dollars. Many in the field worry that the talent drain from academia could have a lasting impact in the United States and other countries, simply because schools won\u2019t have the teachers they need to educate the next generation of A.I. experts.\n\nOver the last few months, Facebook approached a number of notable researchers in Seattle. It hired Luke Zettlemoyer, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in technology that aims to understand and use natural human language, the company confirmed. This is an important area of research for Facebook as it struggles to identify and remove false and malicious content on its networks.\n\nIn the fall, Mr. Zettlemoyer told The New York Times that he had turned down an offer from Google that was three times his teaching salary (about $180,000, according to public records) so he could keep his post at the university. Instead, he took a part-time position at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a Seattle lab backed by the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.\n\nMany researchers retain their professorships when moving to the big companies \u2014 that\u2019s Mr. Zettlemoyer\u2019s plan while he works for Facebook \u2014 but they usually cut back on their academic work. At Facebook, academics typically spend 80 percent of their time at the company and 20 percent at their university.\n\nPhoto\n\nLike the other internet giants, Facebook acknowledges the importance of the university system. But at the same time, the companies are eager to land top researchers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Facebook hired two professors from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, Abhinav Gupta and Jessica Hodgins, who specialized in computer vision technology.\n\nThe new Facebook lab will focus on robotics and \u201creinforcement learning,\u201d a way for robots to learn tasks by trial and error. Siddhartha Srinivasa, a robotics professor at the University of Washington, said he was also approached by Facebook in recent months. It was not clear to him why the internet company was interested in robotics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But over the past several months, he has been vocal about the movement of A.I. researchers toward the big internet companies. Google also operates an engineering office near Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not necessarily good for society, but it is rational behavior by these companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe two new Facebook labs are part of wider expansion for the company\u2019s A.I. operation. In December, Facebook announced that it had hired another computer vision expert, Jitendra Malik, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He now oversees the lab at the company\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\n\nEven with its deep pockets, Facebook faces fierce competition for talent. Mr. Allen recently gave the Allen Institute, which he created in 2013, an additional $125 million in funding. After losing Mr. Zettlemoyer to Facebook, the Allen Institute hired Noah Smith and Yejin Choi, two of his colleagues at the University of Washington.\n\nLike Mr. Zettlemoyer, both specialize in natural language processing, and both say they received offers from multiple internet companies.\n\nThe nonprofit is paying Mr. Smith and Ms. Choi a small fraction of what they were offered to join the commercial sector, but the Allen Institute will allow them to spend half their time at the university and collaborate with a wide range of companies, said Oren Etzioni, who oversees the Allen Institute.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe salary numbers are so large that even Paul Allen can\u2019t match them,\u201d Mr. Etzioni said. \u201cBut there are still some people who won\u2019t go corporate.\u201d\n\nOthers researchers believe that companies like Facebook still align with their academic goals. Nonetheless, Ed Lazowska, chairman of the computer science and engineering department at the University of Washington, said he was concerned that the large internet companies were luring too many of the university\u2019s professors into the commercial sector.\n\nCarnegie Mellon and the University of Washington, he said, are working on a set of recommendations for commercial companies meant to provide a way for universities and companies to share talent more equally. Mr. Lazowska added that every university should ensure that it did not become too close to one company.\n\n\u201cThe university must be a Switzerland,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want every company to collaborate with us and to feel like they have an equal opportunity to hire our students and work with our faculty.\u201d", "title": "Facebook Adds A.I.

But far too many of us are not making our vacuums live up to their full potential.\n\nSpring cleaning is a great time to break out of a vacuum rut and save yourself some sweat by making the machine do the work of cleaning furniture like sofas and wing chairs, mattresses, walls, window treatments, windowsills and casings, and even the windows themselves.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe trick is to get cozy with your vacuum\u2019s attachments, and possibly even to invest in an add-on set of specialty attachments. The add-ons are where you will find help cleaning the windows, by using a squeegee attachment with a wet/dry vacuum.\n\nSoft brush attachments, also called upholstery attachments, can be used to dust books, lampshades, window coverings and, of course, upholstered furniture. The soft brush attachment is also great for quickly cleaning window screens. The crevice tool is ideal for window casings, radiators and vents, the area around major kitchen appliances, and dryer vents.\n\nSpecialty attachments for dryer vents are also available. But if your vacuum comes with an extension wand that can be used with other attachments to extend their reach \u2014 it is especially useful for cleaning molding and window treatments \u2014 you can pair it with the crevice tool and skip the extra purchase.\n\nWASH THE WALLS WITHOUT CLIMBING A LADDER\n\nWashing the walls is a bear of a job, and while this tip won\u2019t make it totally painless, it will at least save you from having to get up on a ladder.\n\nTo wash the walls just as you would a floor, use a broom fitted with a rubber band-secured rag over the rushes, or a sponge mop dipped in dish soap diluted in water or an all-purpose cleaner like Fabuloso or Puracy Natural Multi-Surface Cleaner. (Puracy is an all-purpose cleaner recommended by Wirecutter, The New York Times product review site.)\n\nWring it out so that it is damp but not dripping, and be sure that the cleaning solution you are using will not damage the wall\u2019s finish by testing it in a small, inconspicuous area before going all in.\n\nTHE CEILING FAN TRICK\n\nCeiling fan blades pick up an astonishing amount of filth. If you have a ceiling fan in your home and you have never looked up at it, go ahead and do that now. Ghastly, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThere is an easy way to clean ceiling fans, though. And it will not leave your bedroom or living room covered in dust that falls from the fan.\n\nUse an old pillowcase, one that you can relegate to the rag pile after this job, to clean the blades. Spray the inside of the case with a dusting spray like Pledge or Endust, slide the case over a blade and, holding the opening of the case firmly over the top and bottom of the blade, slide it back along the blade to wipe away the dirt that has collected.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe brilliant thing, of course, is that all that grime will stay inside the pillowcase, rather than getting all over you or whatever is beneath the fan.", "title": "Five Ways to Make Spring Cleaning Easier", "authors": ["Jolie Kerr"]}

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cOnce we got on that run, we never looked back,\u201d Rozier said.\n\nHe was referring to a sizable stretch of Game 2\u2019s second quarter when the Celtics, after trailing by as many as 22, bulldozed the 76ers in transition. Rozier wound up finishing with 20 points and 9 assists in the Celtics\u2019 108-103 victory. His performance only amplified the struggles of Simmons, the opposing point guard, who essentially vanished: 1 point and 7 assists in 31 minutes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have bad games,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cIt happens. Obviously, it\u2019s not the perfect timing.\u201d\n\nSimmons is just 21, still playing his first full season in the N.B.A. and still the prohibitive favorite to be named the N.B.A.\u2019s rookie of the year. But for all his gifts, there is no substitute for experience, a lesson that Rozier has reinforced through the first two games of this series.\n\nBy suffocating Simmons with playoff-tested defenders, and by choking off his passing lanes, the Celtics have reminded Simmons that he would benefit from developing some semblance of an outside shot this off-season. He will have time to hone one \u2014 though not soon enough, perhaps, to salvage the series for Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cNot saying he can\u2019t score,\u201d Rozier said, \u201cbut he wants to pass. We take that away, we feel pretty good about it.\u201d\n\nThese are heady times for Rozier, a 2015 first-round draft pick for the Celtics who was a backup not so long ago. But after Kyrie Irving had season-ending knee surgery, Rozier moved into the starting lineup. He was solid if not spectacular in his final 13 appearances of the regular season, averaging 14.7 points and 5 assists a game while shooting 36.5 percent from the field.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Rozier mistakenly referred to the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Eric Bledsoe as \u201cDrew Bledsoe\u201d after Game 1 of their first-round series. By way of response, Bledsoe pretended not to know Rozier\u2019s name. (Drew Bledsoe is a former quarterback for the New England Patriots.)\n\nRozier just happened to be in the process of eviscerating Eric Bledsoe, a feud he punctuated by scoring 26 points in the Celtics\u2019 series-clinching victory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the same time, an unexpected bromance blossomed \u2014 between Rozier and the real Drew Bledsoe. Earlier this week, ahead of Game 1 against the 76ers, Rozier wore a throwback Bledsoe jersey to the arena. Before Game 2, Bledsoe posted a photo of himself wearing a Rozier T-shirt on social media along with words of encouragement.\n\nIn the playoffs, Rozier is averaging 19.1 points, 6.9 assists and 5 rebounds a game while shooting 44.1 percent from the field.\n\n\u201cHe already had a belief,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut you build a consistency in that role so it\u2019s not as new to him anymore. We\u2019ve always believed in him.\u201d\n\nSimmons is not having nearly as much fun. On Thursday, the Celtics threw waves of defenders at him. Al Horford, Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart all took turns, stifling Simmons\u2019s ability to drive toward the basket. The 76ers had much more success in the second half with the reserve T. J. McConnell at point guard \u2014 \u201cMcConnell was ridiculous,\u201d Stevens said \u2014 but Sixers Coach Brett Brown opted to go with Simmons in the final minutes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision, I admit it,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis whole playoff experience is something that I want our young guys and our star players to learn from and grow.\u201d\n\nReferring to Simmons, Brown added: \u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to learn to play in these environments.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Simmons sounded almost dismissive of Boston\u2019s brand of physicality, saying it paled in comparison with how the Miami Heat had tried to manhandle him in the first round. He blamed himself for his struggles. He said he was thinking too much rather than letting his game flow.\n\n\u201cI think it was self-inflicted,\u201d Simmons said.\n\nThe whole trope of bulletin-board material is overstated, especially in the postseason. These are professionals, after all. But it is na\u00efve, maybe, to think that the Celtics will not perceive Simmons\u2019s postgame comments as another challenge, as additional fuel to throw on the fire.

She had been struck with a steel golf club with enough force to break the club, and a piece of the shaft was used to stab her through the neck.\n\nThe Moxley family lived in Belle Haven, a gated community of estates in Greenwich, on the Connecticut coast. Her father, a partner in a large accounting firm, had moved the family to Greenwich only about 18 months before. Martha, a high school sophomore, had just tried out for the cheerleading squad. Her classmates had voted her the girl with the \u201cbest personality.\u201d\n\nThe Skakels were their neighbors. Michael Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F.

He was released in 2013, after spending more than a decade in prison. A judge overturned his conviction after finding that his lawyer during the trial had not provided effective representation. Mr. Skakel\u2019s new legal team has argued that his former lawyer had failed to call a key witness who could have confirmed his alibi, and that his older brother, Thomas Skakel, could have been the culprit.\n\nThe Connecticut Supreme Court reinstated the conviction in 2016.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "Then, like a lot of aspiring chefs of her generation, she heard the call of the bistronomie movement, and went looking for a less cloistered restaurant. What she found was Spring, a new, relaxed, seasonally attentive place where an American named Daniel Rose was doing all the cooking himself. After she turned up, something clicked and the restaurant began to get attention around Paris and abroad. Her sensibilities overlapped with Mr. Rose\u2019s in other ways; the two started dating and later married, opening additional places along the way.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Roses moved to New York about two years ago when Daniel opened Le Coucou, his tribute to the Le and La restaurants of old. La Mercerie, three blocks west, was not in their plans until Le Coucou\u2019s chief owner, Stephen Starr, was brought on to operate a cafe inside a furniture and housewares store being planned by Le Coucou\u2019s design firm, Roman and Williams.\n\nLa Mercerie sits at the junction of two mighty rivers of contemporary eating trends: the redundantly, if catchily, named all-day-cafe movement and the restaurant-as-shopping-catalog approach pursued by Jean-Georges Vongerichten\u2019s places inside ABC Carpet & Home.\n\nWhen you sit down for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner \u2014 see, all day) at La Mercerie, you will get, in addition to a menu, a card printed with small line drawings of every piece of tableware in the cafe, and its price. If you are very taken by the \u201crustic washed linen napkins\u201d you can buy a set for $104. For $275, there is a small teapot from a Danish potter who has supplied Noma. If this is outside your budget, you can still use them at La Mercerie for an hour or two before you have to give them back, like a rented tux of rustic washed linen.\n\nAs borrowed lifestyles go, it\u2019s a pretty nice one. Many of the servers are dressed in high-waisted, loose-legged trousers and flowing white dress shirts, as if they were in costume for a Fred Astaire movie. Meanwhile, the customers never seem to be rushed or out of sorts, and I started to wonder if they were all extras being paid to sit there looking serene. Or maybe eating next to a room full of expensive vases, Swedish sheepskins, enormous woven baskets and antique tables makes everybody feel as if they are one of the exhibits in a small museum.\n\nThe theme of the merchandise is craft \u2014 it\u2019s all handmade \u2014 and Ms. Rose has taken this to heart in her kitchen. La Mercerie\u2019s chicken bouillon is simmered and skimmed just the way it should be. Marked by balance and brightness, it is oolong tea to bone broth\u2019s double espresso. Also in the bowl are an egg with a liquid yolk and, down at the bottom, a flock of herb-pasta butterflies, each one the size of the tip of your pinkie.\n\nMs. Rose\u2019s pastries are already some of the finest in the city. Croissants have crisp whorls on top that you can count like tree rings; the savory ones are filled with ham and Comt\u00e9, or broccoli and cherry tomatoes in custard, which may not sound good but is.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore exotic is the tourteau fromag\u00e9, a palm-size cheesecake with a blackened, domed top. Born in Poitou-Charentes, it looks something like a Boston cream doughnut, but its interior is a moist, fine-crumbed cake that tastes, just barely, of fresh goat cheese. Ms. Rose serves it with a poached apricot in star-anise syrup. If you are a serious pastry watcher, you will want to add it to your life list.\n\nPhoto\n\nHaving recently run up against a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e that seemed to contain no eggs and a plate of profiteroles allowed to get soggy at a purportedly French restaurant nearby, I was relieved to sink into the yolk-rich cr\u00e8me caramel and crisp choux puffs under bittersweet chocolate sauce at La Mercerie. A devout and often disappointed Francophile I ate with eyed the crepes au sucre warily. \u201cThe sugar had better be crunchy,\u201d she said. It was, of course.\n\nThe menu changes once a day, at noon. The soft-cooked egg goes away, replaced by the omelet. Four main courses arrive, including a very nice piece of roasted salmon with red-wine sauce. Salads appear.\n\nIt is almost impossible to rave convincingly about salads, so please trust me that La Mercerie\u2019s are great, particularly the ni\u00e7oise, with tuna preserved in oil on the premises and anchovies cured in oil at the source, the Cantabrian Sea.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

(The butter amplifies the richness of the fish while tamping down its sharpness.) The man who churns La Mercerie\u2019s butter, Jean-Yves Bordier, does not sell his stuff to just anybody, and the fat slices of his buckwheat and lemon-olive oil butters are worth the $7 you pay.\n\nMost things are so precisely as they should be that it is hard to find fault. But I am not sure that a sheet of Calvados-poached apple is of much use to a wedge of Camembert, and I wish that the boeuf bourguignon\u2019s dark and lovely sauce did not slide so easily off the smooth macaroni Ms. Rose sets under the stew. Maybe the buckwheat crepe curled above the creamed chicken reminded me a bit too much of a dosa.

Now at the white-shoe law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, he may have a better understanding than most of the political maelstrom that faces the White House legal team, especially as midterm elections approach.

Emmet T. Flood, a lawyer hired by Mr. Trump on Wednesday, was not involved in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s plans to reveal the payments to Mr. Cohen during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News, one of the people said.\n\nThe abrupt disclosure \u2014 which even caught Mr. Hannity, a confidant of the president\u2019s, by surprise \u2014 set off a flurry of calls between Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers as they sought to determine whether Mr. Giuliani meant to reveal the president\u2019s reimbursement. Witnesses and lawyers around Washington scoured transcripts, watched television clips and called each other in an effort to grasp the consequences of what Mr. Giuliani had said.\n\nThe president\u2019s other lawyers ultimately determined that Mr. Giuliani had consulted with Mr. Trump, people close to them said, but were left speechless about why he decided to make the disclosure in such a high-profile way and without any strategy to handle the fallout.\n\nMr. Giuliani recognized the situation was problematic, two people close to him said, because Mr. Trump had previously said on Air Force One that he was unaware of the hush payments to Stephanie Clifford, the actress who performs as Stormy Daniels. However, Mr. Trump and his aides see lying to or misleading the news media as far less troublesome than lying to investigators, they said.\n\nPhoto\n\nEven some of the president\u2019s advisers said they were skeptical of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s statements that Mr. Cohen entered into a settlement, made payments to a pornographic film actress and was reimbursed by the president all without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowing why.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s disclosure is a sign of how Mr. Trump\u2019s reshuffled legal team \u2014 which now includes a highly paid Washington lawyer, a famous former mayor, a constitutional lawyer who specializes in religious cases and former federal prosecutors \u2014 will function in the coming weeks as they sort out who takes the lead on representing the president.\n\nMr. Giuliani has said he is the lead lawyer dealing with the special counsel\u2019s investigation in Washington. But his statements on Wednesday night related to the continuing investigation in New York that is examining the conduct of Mr. Cohen. People close to the president are concerned that Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani may create more problems for themselves if they consult only with each other and leave out the other lawyers who may know more about the nuances of the cases.\n\nMr. Trump faces a two-front battle with the Justice Department: one investigation in New York into Mr. Cohen and the special counsel investigation in Washington.\n\nWhoever runs the president\u2019s legal defenses will almost certainly adopt a more aggressive strategy than the previous team, which was led by the Washington lawyers John Dowd and Ty Cobb.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s desire to take on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the Justice Department, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb persuaded Mr. Trump to buy into their strategy of cooperation. The more helpful the president was, Mr. Dowd and Mr. Cobb told him last year, the more likely the investigation would conclude by year\u2019s end.\n\nPhoto\n\nInstead, the investigation has intensified, and the president has concluded that approach was a mistake, according to people close to him. Convinced that the investigation is a growing threat to his presidency, he has resorted to his initial inclination to fight.\n\nMr. Trump appears to hope that Mr. Giuliani, a like-minded political street fighter from New York, will aid his combative approach. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments on Wednesday and Thursday were an attempt to do just that.\n\nHis aggression carried risks. Besides revealing that the president had reimbursed Mr. Cohen, Mr. Giuliani appeared to admit that the payment to Ms. Clifford just before Election Day in 2016 was made because of concerns about the coming vote. That could be used to argue that it was an illegal campaign contribution.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Edwards\u2019s trial ended in an acquittal on one count with the jury unable to reach a verdict on five others.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s comments also raised fresh questions about the president\u2019s relationship with Mr. Cohen. As Mr. Giuliani told it, Mr. Cohen entered into a legal agreement with Ms. Clifford and paid her without Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge. Mr. Giuliani described that as commonplace, saying he performed similar services for his own clients. But legal ethics experts said such an arrangement was highly unusual and would only expose Mr. Cohen to new questions.\n\nLawyers are required to keep their clients fully informed of their activities and are generally prohibited from advancing money to or on behalf of their clients, said Deborah L.

Although federal officials who lie on the forms are also typically charged with other, more serious offenses such as bribery or fraud, more than 20 officials or former officials have been charged in the past 12 years with making false statements to federal officials, a felony offense.

Another person familiar with the payment confirmed that that was the mechanism used to repay Mr. Cohen.\n\nMr. Giuliani said that he was \u201cnot clear that\u201d Mr. Trump was aware of the payment to Ms. Clifford at the time it was made, and he said that his understanding was that the president did not learn about the payment to her until recently.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he did\u201d know \u201cuntil now,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.\n\nThe comments on Fox sent a jolt through Washington and New York, including the legal teams working on behalf of the president, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Clifford, who has sued Mr. Cohen in an attempt to be released from the nondisclosure agreement that accompanied the $130,000 payment in October 2016.\n\nMichael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, said Wednesday night on Twitter that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s comments amounted to an admission that the president had lied to the American people about whether he was aware of the hush payment.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied,\u201d Mr. Avenatti wrote. \u201cThis followed the lies told by others close to him, including Mr. Cohen. This should never be acceptable in our America. We will not rest until justice is served.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Avenatti said a key issue going forward would be how Mr. Trump accounted for any such payment and whether it was hidden in a way that could violate anti-money laundering statutes.\n\nMr. Giuliani\u2019s statement to Mr. Hannity was the latest of several contradictory narratives from Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives about the deal to pay Ms. Clifford for her silence during the campaign, each of which have had potential implications for violating campaign finance disclosure laws.\n\nMr. Cohen had previously provided a detailed account of how he had paid Ms. Clifford $130,000 out of his own pocket, drawing down on a home loan to do so.

As was the case during his interviews last week, Mr. Giuliani seemed to speak largely off the cuff. He speculated freely and contradicted himself, sometimes from one statement to the next.\n\nHe said, for example, that Mr. Mueller would be to blame if Mr. Trump refused to testify because his office had leaked a list of questions that the special counsel would like to ask him. But then he admitted he did not know who leaked the questions, which were reported by The New York Times.\n\nMr. Giuliani referred repeatedly to a federal judge\u2019s criticism of the special counsel\u2019s fraud case against Paul Manafort, the former chairman of the Trump campaign.

Tech companies like Square have begun offering Bitcoin services to their customers, and the commodity exchanges in Chicago started allowing customers to trade Bitcoin futures contracts in December.\n\nBut until now, regulated financial institutions have steered clear of Bitcoin, with some going so far as to shut down the accounts of customers who traded Bitcoin. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, famously called it a fraud, and many other bank chief executives have said Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative bubble.\n\nMs. Yared said Goldman had concluded that Bitcoin is not a fraud and does not have the characteristics of a currency. But a number of clients wanted to hold it as a valuable commodity, similar to gold, given the limited quantity of Bitcoin that can ever be \u201cmined\u201d in a complex, virtual system.\n\n\u201cIt resonates with us when a client says, \u2018I want to hold Bitcoin or Bitcoin futures because I think it is an alternate store of value,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nVideo\n\nMs. Yared said the bank had received inquiries from hedge funds, as well as endowments and foundations that received virtual currency donations from newly minted Bitcoin millionaires and didn\u2019t know how to handle them. The ultimate decision to begin trading Bitcoin contracts went through Goldman\u2019s board of directors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe step comes with plenty of uncertainties. Bitcoin prices are primarily set on unregulated exchanges in other countries where there are few measures in place to prevent market manipulation.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the price of Bitcoin has plunged \u2014 and recovered significantly \u2014 as traders have faced uncertainty about how regulators will deal with virtual currencies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In 2017, he left that job to trade virtual currencies on his own.\n\nHe will initially be placed on Goldman\u2019s foreign currency desk because Bitcoin trading has the most similarity to movements in emerging market currencies, Ms. Yared said.\n\nMr. Schmidt is looking at trading actual Bitcoin \u2014 or physical Bitcoin, as it is somewhat ironically called \u2014 if the bank can secure regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve and New York authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe firm also has to find a way to confidently hold Bitcoin for customers without its being stolen by hackers, as has happened to many Bitcoin exchanges. Mr. Schmidt and Ms. Yared said the current options for holding Bitcoin for clients did not yet meet Wall Street standards.\n\nGoldman is known for pushing the envelope in the trading of complicated products. The firm faced significant criticism after the financial crisis for its profitable trading of so-called synthetic derivatives tied to the subprime mortgage markets.\n\nSince the crisis, Goldman has made a big push to position itself as the most technologically sophisticated firm on Wall Street. Among other things, it has started an online lending service, known as Marcus, that has brought the firm into contact with retail customers for the first time. The virtual currency trading, though, will be available only to big institutional investors.\n\nMr. Schmidt said Goldman\u2019s sophistication was a big part of the reason he was open to the job, despite many other opportunities in the virtual currency world.\n\n\u201cIn terms of having a trusted institutional player, it has been something I have been looking for in my own crypto trading \u2014 but it didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.", "title": "Goldman Sachs to Open a Bitcoin Trading Operation", "authors": ["Nathaniel Popper"]}

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "This is the opposite of what has happened in special congressional elections since Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. With two exceptions, the Republican candidate has run between five and nine percentage points behind Mr. Trump\u2019s results. One exception, the special election for Third Congressional District in Utah, also should not give Republicans comfort. While the Republican winner John Curtis ran well ahead of Mr. Trump\u2019s percentage, that number was artificially low because of the candidacy of the conservative Mormon independent Evan McMullin. Mr. Curtis ran 19 percentage points behind Mitt Romney\u2019s percentage in 2012; even when the votes from two conservative minor party candidates are added, the combined Republican-conservative vote was seven percentage points lower than Mr. Romney\u2019s.\n\nThe other exception, however, is in line with what we saw in Virginia. The Republican Karen Handel, in a special election in Georgia\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, had been a local and statewide official for over a decade before her House campaign. She had also twice run for statewide office, carrying the areas in this district in both races. She was not an incumbent, but voters throughout the district knew her and had previously supported her as they would an incumbent. Despite her Democratic opponent, Jon Ossoff, spending a record $31 million against her, she prevailed relatively easily, winning by 52-48 percent. More important, she ran about 3.5 percentage points ahead of President Trump\u2019s showing in that district, in line with what we saw incumbents do in the Virginia elections.\n\nThese observations suggest that the race to control the House is still one that Republicans can win. Republican-held congressional seats that Mrs. Clinton carried where the incumbent is not running, such as Florida\u2019s 27th, are almost certainly lost. So, too, are Republican-held seats with incumbents where Mrs. Clinton carried by five or more percentage points (although some of those incumbents might squeak through). But only 16 seats fall into one of those categories. To win the House, Democrats must take out Republican incumbents or win open seats narrowly leaning to the G.O.P.\n\nThis will be much harder to do if this analysis proves correct. Most Republican incumbents will prevail if they can simply run equal to President Trump\u2019s percentage. There are only an additional 19 Republican-held House seats that Mrs. Clinton carried by less than five points or that Mr. Trump carried with less than 50 percent of the vote. Republican incumbents could do much worse than their Virginia House of Delegates counterparts and still largely retain their seats. That in turn would mean that either Democratic control of the House after the midterms would be very narrow or, shocking as it would be to many now, the Republicans could retain control.\n\nIncumbent officeholders do tend to run equal to or ahead of their party\u2019s presidential candidate even in terrible election years for their party. For example, three of the five Senate Democrats defeated for re-election in 2014 ran ahead of President Obama\u2019s share of the vote two years earlier. They lost mainly because they were representing very Republican states in a highly partisan age. Most Republican-held House seats are not in predominantly Democratic areas. As noted above, there are not enough G.O.P.-held seats in places Mrs. Clinton carried by five percentage points or more \u2014 what we might think of as normally Democratic territory \u2014 to enable the Democrats to retake the House.\n\nIf Republican incumbents don\u2019t retain any personal voter loyalty, however, the fall could be a blood bath for Republicans. Twenty-four incumbents represent seats that Mr. Trump carried with less than 55 percent and with less than a 10 percentage point margin in 2016. Adding those to the 35 seats mentioned above means Republicans could be staring at a 2010-style wipeout with House losses in excess of 50 seats if the special election results are a harbinger of what is to come.", "title": "Opinion | Have Special Elections Warped Our Sense of the Midterms?", "authors": []}

He said recently that he will return the money.\n\nThe Akron Beacon Journal appeared to have little patience with both the primary campaign overall (\u201cbizarre and wacky\u201d) and with Mr. Kucinich in particular. Last week, it dismissively said that he had argued that Mr. Cordray \u201csomehow isn\u2019t progressive enough.\u201d\n\nIt endorsed Mr. Cordray, who it described as \u201ccareful and dullish\u201d and not \u201ca stirring campaigner, to say the least.\u201d But it said he had the sober temperament and skills the state needs in a leader.\n\n\u201cTo gain these and other skills takes experience (and the capacity to learn,)\u201d it wrote in its endorsement. \u201cLook no further than the current White House to see what happens when they are missing or in short supply.\u201d", "title": "Here Are Ohio Newspaper Endorsements for Governor in Tuesday\u2019s Primary", "authors": ["Liam Stack"]}

Paper, $16.95.\n\n\u201cThe whole of anything,\u201d Henry James once wrote, \u201cis never told.\u201d The unnamed narrator of Zachary Lazar\u2019s absorbing and prismatic new novel, \u201cVengeance,\u201d would surely confirm this sentiment. Lazar\u2019s is a literature of working through, \u201ca groping around in the unknowable,\u201d as he calls it. He is at least as interested in how the story is told as in the story itself.\n\nThe story in \u201cVengeance\u201d is superficially straightforward and painfully familiar. In a style that\u2019s clear and plain, the narrator recounts his experiences with Kendrick King, a felon serving a life sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, better known as Angola, named for the slave plantation that once occupied the site and for the African country from which those slaves were taken. Kendrick has a role in Angola\u2019s production of a passion play called \u201cThe Life of Jesus Christ,\u201d which the narrator and his photographer friend, Deborah, have come to document.\n\nThe narrator, drawn to Kendrick, becomes consumed with the question of his innocence or guilt. The novel alternates between his years of interviews with Kendrick and members of his family and friends and imagined day-of-the-crime scenes told from Kendrick\u2019s point of view. Lazar also incorporates transcripts of interrogations as he expertly draws us into his pendulum of belief and doubt, and the reader travels with his narrator as he bends first toward Kendrick\u2019s innocence and then away: \u201cWhat haunted me in particular was that my imagining of Kendrick and Lawrence doing the murder together was at least as vivid as my imagining of Kendrick not being there. In the first scenario, he was active, while in the other he didn\u2019t do anything, and so perhaps it was no wonder that the first scenario, because it was more dramatic, triggered my imagination. But perhaps it simply meant that my imagination was more like Detective Lagarde\u2019s than I wanted to admit. I didn\u2019t believe Kendrick had been there, but I could envision it with clarity.\u201d\n\nWhen the narrator was 6 years old, his father was murdered, an event woven through the book. This unresolved childhood wound is part of what draws him to Kendrick\u2019s plight, resulting in \u201ca story I kept narrating moment by moment to try to get the world to fit back into my idea of it.\u201d He is aware, however, that unlike Kendrick he has \u201cthe privilege of being able to turn away.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nReading \u201cVengeance,\u201d there is an inescapable discomfort as white artists come in and out of the lives of black inmates and their families, a discomfort that brings to mind what Toni Morrison has called \u201cliterary journeys into the forbidden space of blackness,\u201d though here the discomfort seems intended. His narrator is at least intermittently aware of his precarious place and the absurdity of his quest. As he forces on these characters stories about his father, his books, his life, the reader squirms. But so does the narrator: \u201cThe further I went with the story, the less I understood why I was telling it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLazar\u2019s narrator is a complex creation, and his occasionally clueless privilege \u2014 an important part of the story of race in America \u2014 is balanced by painful awareness: \u201cI have a good life now,\u201d he writes to the parole board, \u201ca home, a wife I love, money \u2014 but I know that much of that is luck, redounding to my surface, even to the color of my skin, which in this time and place is called \u2018white.\u2019\u201d In contrast, as Kendrick\u2019s brother tells him, \u201cI knew he was innocent, but I knew what was going to happen anyway.\u201d For Lazar\u2019s black characters, \u201cthe uncertainty of the story would never end, only change.\u201d", "title": "He\u2019s a Lifer at Angola.

This ensures that the agreement does not die with a change of governments and political ideologies in Seoul and Washington, as the 2007 agreement and other past deals did.\n\n\u201cWhen we look back, the most important thing is speed,\u201d Mr. Moon told the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, during their meeting last week in the Demilitarized Zone, the fortified border separating the two Koreas.\n\nDuring that meeting, Mr. Moon urged the North Korean to move quickly to make a deal with President Trump during their talks, expected later this month or next month. \u201cWe have to learn lessons from the past,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim.\n\nPhoto\n\nThat need for speed is apparent in the fast pace of diplomacy that appears to be leading to a first-ever summit meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea, who just a few months ago appeared on the brink of war.\n\nMr. Moon, 65, has played a key role in bringing together Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, who now appear likely to meet at Panmunjom, the same \u201ctruce village\u201d in the Demilitarized Zone where Mr. Moon held his talks with Mr. Kim.\n\nSuch a meeting would be a triumph for Mr. Moon, who has experienced both highs and lows in his country\u2019s relations with North Korea.\n\nMr. Moon was a conscripted member of an elite paratroop unit in 1976, when ax-wielding North Korean troops murdered two American Army officers while they pruned a poplar tree that blocked their view at Panmunjom. In \u201cOperation Paul Bunyan,\u201d Mr. Moon\u2019s unit was sent in to finish chopping down the tree while the North Koreans stood back.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil last week, Mr. Moon\u2019s only visit to North Korea was in 2004, when he accompanied his mother on a government-arranged reunion to see her younger sister for the first time since the Korean War. Mr. Moon himself was born in a refugee camp during the war, after his parents fled their native North Korea on board an American Navy cargo ship.\n\nHis approach to handling the United States is one of Mr. Moon\u2019s biggest departures from his predecessor, Mr. Roh, who committed suicide in 2009 amid corruption allegations surrounding his relatives.\n\nMr. Moon appears to have concluded that Mr. Roh doomed his own peace deal at least in part by failing to get Mr. Bush to back it. Instead, Mr. Roh, fiery and blunt, had vowed not to \u201ckowtow to the Americans.\u201d\n\nSince taking office last year, Mr. Moon has shown himself more sophisticated and accommodating in managing relations with Washington.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe has closely consulted with the White House during the current rush of diplomacy. Mr. Moon has also been careful in public to credit Mr. Trump for making the current breakthroughs possible, saying that he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe need to bring in America also reflects hard-earned domestic political lessons. Mr. Moon saw Mr. Roh and Kim Dae-jung, the two presidents who championed what was called the Sunshine Policy of engagement with North Korea, fail as the North persisted in its weapons programs despite generous aid.\n\nBoth died heartbroken men, with their legacy dismantled by their conservative foes, who ridiculed them as na\u00efve and pro-North Korean.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Otherwise, he said, any deal \u201cwould be like building a house of cards.\u201d\n\nDuring his meeting with Mr. Kim at Panmunjom, Mr. Moon\u2019s highest priority appeared to be convincing the young North Korean dictator that he could create a better future by striking a deal with Washington to rebuild his country\u2019s economy in exchange for giving up his nuclear arsenal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the spectacle of the two Korean leaders leisurely holding hands as they stepped across their nations\u2019 border, Mr. Moon and his aides compared his mission to \u201cwalking on this ice,\u201d and urged Mr. Kim to quickly sign and implement a deal while he and Mr. Trump were in office.\n\n\u201cI am still in the first year of my term,\u201d Mr. Moon told Mr. Kim during their meeting. \u201cI hope we can maintain this speed through my term.\u201d\n\nMr. Moon\u2019s rush for an early deal is rooted in past experiences.\n\nIn 1994, North Korea and the United States reached their first of many agreements on dismantling the North\u2019s nuclear program, then in its very early stages. Washington offered energy aid and promises of normalizing diplomatic and economic relations, but the accord unraveled after the United States dragged its feet because it did not expect the North Korean government to survive long past the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nPhoto\n\nNorth Korea also hedged its bets, secretly keeping a program to enrich uranium so it could one day build its own atomic bombs.\n\nIn 2000, President Kim Dae-jung, the initiator of the Sunshine Policy, flew to Pyongyang to meet with Kim Jong-il, ushering in a period of d\u00e9tente that seemed to promise an end to hostilities on the peninsula. Investment and trade flourished, and families separated by the war were allowed to hold reunions.\n\nKim Jong-il sent his trusted aide, Vice Marshal Jo Myong-rok, to the White House to ask President Bill Clinton to visit Pyongyang. However, Mr. Clinton decided he could not attempt so bold a diplomatic move at the end of his time in office, and instead sent his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright.\n\nThe new opening with Washington closed after Mr. Bush took office in 2001. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in 2006.\n\n\u201cAfter he stepped down, President Clinton visited Seoul and told President Kim Dae-jung how regrettable it was; he said if he had a little bit more time in office, he could have changed the course of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d said Lim Dong-won, a former aide to Mr. Kim, who attended the meeting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Roh, who replaced Kim Dae-jung, tried to keep the d\u00e9tente alive with his 2007 agreement on easing military tensions and increasing economic cooperation. But the deal, signed four months before Mr. Roh\u2019s term ended, was quickly overturned by Mr. Roh\u2019s conservative successor, Lee Myong-bak.\n\nMr. Lee was eager to align himself with Mr. Bush, who sought to isolate the North with sanctions in the hopes it would surrender its nuclear weapons program, a strategy continued by President Barack Obama.\n\nSo far, Mr. Moon\u2019s gambit seems to be winning broad support within South Korea. Opinion polls show his approval ratings surging, with some nine out of 10 South Koreans viewing the DMZ meeting as a success.\n\nNot all South Koreans are convinced, however.\n\nHong Joon-pyo, leader of the main conservative opposition Korean Liberty Party, likened Mr. Moon to former Prime Minister Arthur Neville Chamberlain of Britain, who he said fell into Hitler\u2019s \u201ctrap of false peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter being cheated eight times, did he still think for a ninth time that North Korea would not cheat this time?\u201d Mr. Hong said.", "title": "His Predecessors Failed.

Putting an emphasis on speed over quality, Carrot Top overpowers his audience with a flurry of jokes, never pausing for more than a few seconds before the next one arrives.\n\nThis show is dopey and occasionally offensive. There are lame sexual jokes about Elton John, Ellen DeGeneres and Ricky Martin as if the fact of their homosexuality is itself funny. If you wanted to do a deep dive into the politics of Carrot Top, there\u2019s plenty to work with. After all, he is an orange-haired buffoon who became famous in the 1980s and remains popular despite being sneered at by the elite media.\n\nBut Carrot Top mostly avoids politics, saying \u201cno more\u201d after one Trump joke. If the content of his jokes seems dated, the form is ahead of its time, more in tune with the kinetic Tim and Eric-style of videos than what you find in a club. Stand-up can be tradition-bound, and certain segments of it have long fetishized stationary comics talking into a microphone. This simplicity can be a strength \u2014 keeping the focus on language in a digital age when words are often overshadowed by image \u2014 but can also be limiting.\n\nCertain comics with unorthodox artistic careers like Bo Burnham expanded the range of what stand-up can do. Carrot Top is a less sophisticated and more ruthlessly commercially artist, but he shares some of the same experimental spirit. In staying in his own theater for so many years, he has had time to build up his show and refine it.\n\nBy the time he starts passing out drinks, it\u2019s clear he will do anything to please the crowd (which does appear to be having a great time). His comedy panders shamelessly, but he is hardly the first entertainer in Las Vegas to commit this sin.\n\nThe fact is that Carrot Top has figured out something essential about surviving in show business. To sustain a long career, you\u2019ve got to have more than a gimmick. You need at least two or three.", "title": "How Carrot Top Wins in Vegas (Yes, He Can Be Funny)", "authors": []}

In the span of less than 24 hours, he spoke with Fox News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Hill and ABC News.\n\nIn doing so, he appears to have created two new legal problems for his client, President Trump.\n\nFirst \u2014 although it\u2019s received less attention than the Stormy Daniels payment \u2014 Giuliani added to the already strong evidence that Trump has obstructed justice. Trump has offered conflicting explanations for why he fired James Comey, the former F.B.I. director. The true reason, Giuliani told Sean Hannity, was the Russia investigation. \u201cComey would not, among other things, say that he wasn\u2019t a target of the investigation,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cSo he fired him, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m free of this guy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGreg Sargent of The Washington Post offers a good breakdown of why this is so problematic.

Do you think doing so is important?\n\nIn \u201cTurkish Cartoonist Wins Prize on World Press Freedom Day,\u201d Reuters reports:\n\nA Turkish caricaturist facing more than three years in jail won the International Press Drawing Prize on Thursday, an award given every two years to leading cartoonists, especially those working under authoritarian regimes. Musa Kart of the opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet was one of 14 staff handed sentences last month ranging from 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 years on charges of supporting Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric that Ankara blames for a 2016 attempted coup. They have denied the charges. Kart, 64, was sentenced to three years and nine months and is banned from travel pending his appeal. After the coup attempt, he spent nine months in prison. \u201cMy beloved newspaper is currently surrounded by those who are uncomfortable with its journalism and want to silence it completely by threatening heavy punishments,\u201d Kart said in a message read out by his daughter, Seran Uney, to a ceremony in Geneva on Thursday, marking World Press Freedom Day. The staff of the Istanbul newspaper, long seen as a thorn in the side of President Tayyip Erdogan, is one of the few remaining voices critical of the government. The jury of the Cartooning for Peace Foundation includes cartoonists Jean Plantu of France and Patrick Chappatte of Switzerland, and Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. They make the award based on cartoonists\u2019 \u201capproach and commitment \u2026 especially if their cartoons were published in a political context of repression and censorship.\u201d\n\nIn an Opinion essay from May 6, 2017, Carol Giacomo gives more background on the conflict in Turkey and speaks to its implications for a free press:\n\nWith some 163 of their fellow journalists in jail, the men and women of Turkey\u2019s news media are understandably fearful. Many of those who avoided prison as part of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s sweeping crackdown on alleged enemies after a July coup attempt have lost their jobs at media outlets taken over by Mr. Erdogan\u2019s cronies. Some of those still working censor themselves in self-defense. In such an environment, even getting together to talk about challenges to the fast-fading press freedoms in Turkey\u2019s ever-shrinking democracy is an act of courage. That happened on Wednesday when Platform24, an Istanbul-based nonprofit fighting for journalists\u2019 right to do their jobs, held an event to celebrate World Press Freedom Day with a lecture honoring the late Mehmet Ali Birand, one of the country\u2019s most admired journalists. Given Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tendency for retaliation, the Swedish consul general, Therese Hyden, also deserves credit for hosting the event. The mood this year, however, was anything but celebratory, and for obvious reasons. Under Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian rule, not just an independent press but many rights and freedoms have sharply deteriorated. Instead, the mood was somber as Platform24\u2019s staff performed a kind of dirge, reading the names of imprisoned colleagues one by one. \u201cWe want them to know, we want their families to know, we want their readers and audiences to know, and we want the government to know that they are not alone,\u201d said Yasemin Congar, one of Platform24\u2019s founders. \u201cJournalism is not a crime,\u201d she added.\n\nStudents: Read the entire article, then tell us:\n\n\u2014 In your opinion, what is the purpose of journalism?

A firm believer in training methods that were once far outside convention, like extreme long toss and weighted balls, he has rankled some with his iconoclastic views and has a gift for getting under the skin of even his own teammates on occasion.\n\nBauer may have softened some of his edges in recent years, but not in this instance.\n\n\u201cI like Trevor,\u201d said Astros reliever Joe Smith, a teammate of Bauer during two stints with Cleveland. \u201cHe\u2019s hilarious, he\u2019s a really intelligent guy and he\u2019s very opinionated. This time I think he\u2019s speaking to some things that he\u2019s not even close on.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Astros, coincidentally, may be the organization with a worldview closest to Bauer\u2019s; they have continually challenged baseball convention, from being one of the most prominently tanking teams to culling its scouting staff last fall so it could hire more data analysts.\n\nBaseball, of course, is quick to draw suspicion for spikes in performance, whether it is players suspected of taking performance-enhancing drugs or illicitly stealing signs \u2014 something the Yankees caught the Red Sox doing last year with the use of an Apple watch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd the way the Astros\u2019 starters have pitched this season, it is no surprise that some are wondering how they do it.

They also lead the major leagues in strikeouts, innings pitched and batting average against. Verlander delivered another outstanding outing on Tuesday, striking out 14 and scattering three hits over eight innings, but Ken Giles gave up a three-run homer to Gary Sanchez in the ninth inning of a 4-0 Yankees win.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Verlander and Bregman also declined to talk about anything beside the game on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat I said on my tweet is what I said,\u201d McCullers said.\n\nBut McCullers did say that the Astros\u2019 improvement can be explained simply: they have built a pitching staff that is willing to embrace the data that analysts and pitching coach Brent Strom provide.\n\n\u201cPeople in general search for vindication \u2014 we\u2019re selfish beings in general,\u201d McCullers said. \u201cSometimes people are against analytics because it\u2019s something they don\u2019t want to hear. But I think everyone here is pretty open and the way the front office has approached us, it\u2019s a tool for us to be more successful, not to tear us down. It\u2019s a tool to be used to improve a pitch, improve the way you pitch, the way you attack hitters.\u201d\n\nMcCullers said that he had seen Verlander, one of the best pitchers of his generation, pore over data during a bullpen session from a Rapsodo pitch-tracking device, which provides live feedback on spin rates, spin axis and allows him to try different grips and different arm swings and how they play in different quadrants of the strike zone.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of effort, a lot of hard work that goes into everything you see here,\u201d McCullers said, something that the Bauer will get a live look at in three weeks, when the Astros travel to Cleveland.", "title": "How Is the Astros\u2019 Pitching So Good?

He quickly amassed 30 medallions, each then worth about $250,000, but racked up millions in debt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTogether, the two men managed 260 cabs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some for other owners. Drivers paid them $100 a shift. Millions of dollars in cash flowed in. Mr. Cohen at some point began carrying a licensed pistol in an ankle holster.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Cohen started working for the Trump Organization. While there are varying accounts of how he met his new boss, Mr. Trump said Mr. Cohen appeared on his radar after he began buying up properties in Trump buildings \u2014 by then, Mr. Cohen\u2019s office addresses included tony Fifth Avenue locations. For his part, Mr. Cohen has said that the job came after he helped resolve a board dispute at one of the Trump buildings where his family owned several units.\n\nMr. Cohen became a roving fixer for Mr. Trump. In his first year on the job, he and Ivanka Trump kicked the tires on a potential golf course development project in Fresno, Calif. A year later, he was named chief operating officer of Affliction Entertainment, a mixed martial arts venture that Mr. Trump had started. Mr. Cohen traveled to the former Soviet bloc on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf, visiting Georgia in 2010. He even scouted out Iowa for Mr. Trump ahead of the 2012 presidential campaign and set up a website called ShouldTrumpRun.org.\n\nDuring Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, Mr. Cohen pursued plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow with Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant and friend of Mr. Cohen, who had worked on other real estate development deals with Mr. Trump and had explored possible ventures in Russia. Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen worked with Mr. Sater even after his role in a stock manipulation scheme involving Mafia figures and Russian criminals was revealed. (Mr. Sater pleaded guilty and became an informant for the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies.)\n\nWhile juggling his Trump duties, Mr. Cohen turned over management of his cabs to Mr. Garber in 2006 and received as much as $1 million per year, legal records show. After a falling-out with Mr. Garber, Mr. Cohen became partners with Evgeny Freidman, known as Gene, an immigrant from St. Petersburg, Russia, who had assembled a large taxi fleet.\n\nBoth of Mr. Cohen\u2019s taxi partners had a history of legal run-ins. Each has been made to pay more than $1 million for overcharging their drivers, according to the New York State attorney general. Former business partners also accused each of them of forging signatures, stiffing lawyers and dodging debt collection efforts.\n\nThe Chicago authorities found that Mr. Garber and his taxi businesses used 180 unauthorized cars as taxis in that city; he agreed to pay a fine of nearly $1 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2016, a federal judge found that Mr. Freidman had transferred more than $60 million into offshore trusts to avoid paying debts. Last April, New York City regulators barred him from continuing to manage medallions.

The ascent of ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft decimated the value of medallions. Since 2014, Mr. Cohen\u2019s companies have been falling behind on taxes. Over all, his taxi businesses in New York and Chicago owe more than $375,000 for a variety of tax, insurance and inspection problems, according to records. Fourteen of his 54 cabs were suspended.\n\nBut even as the industry has buckled, Mr. Cohen has continued to use his medallions as collateral to borrow money. In December 2014, with his medallions worth $35 million, he took out loans totaling at least $20 million from Sterling National Bank and Melrose Credit Union, according to a banker who reviewed the transactions. (Documents related to both lenders were among the materials sought by federal prosecutors in their search warrants.)\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Cohen went so far as to dabble in financial engineering. He spoke to investors about pooling distressed loans that financed taxi medallion purchases, repackaging them and selling them to investors, according to a person with direct knowledge of the discussions. He also explored buying up such loans at a bargain price in anticipation that their value would recover, the person said. The outcome of those discussions was not clear.\n\nThe financial maneuvering has continued even after the federal search warrants were executed. On April 24, Mr. Cohen refinanced all 16 of his taxi company medallion loans. The transactions, with Sterling National Bank, appeared to extend the due dates on the loans by four years, according to public filings on the refinanced loans.

Since his return to Twitter last month, the rapper and designer has used 280 characters as his preferred medium to share news of forthcoming albums (and clothes), philosophical musings, polarizing political views (including support for President Trump) and detailed text messages with famous friends concerned about his recent ideological direction. What Mr. West, 40, had not done, until the release of a 105-minute video interview on Tuesday, was speak at length on any of the hot-button topics that have swirled around him since the tumultuous period in late 2016 that ended with his hospitalization \u2014 and a visit to Trump Tower. In his first extended interview since, conducted by the Power 105 morning show host Charlamagne Tha God at Mr. West\u2019s California home on April 18, the musician appeared calm and lucid as he addressed a wide array of controversies, aspirations and regrets. But soon after the video was published, Mr. West made a taped appearance at TMZ headquarters, touching on many of the same points at a higher emotional frequency, including several statements about slavery that inspired outrage on social media.\n\nAmong other things, he commented on racism:\n\nIn reference to Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X, he added: \u201cMan, I know this is going to cause an uproar, but certain icons are just too far in the past and not relatable and that\u2019s what makes them safe.\u201d (In a follow-up appearance Tuesday on TMZ, Mr. West was more scattered on the subject. \u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years \u2014 for 400 years?\u201d he said. \u201cThat sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all? We\u2019re mentally in prison.\u201d)\n\nPresident Trump:\n\n\u201cI love challenging the norm,\u201d Mr. West said. \u201cI love people who don\u2019t love him. I love the fact that they speaking up and everybody\u2019s just giving their opinions. I been waiting for this moment in time. This is like a Ye moment in time.\u201d After Charlamagne described President Trump as hostile to minorities and questioned how Mr. West could genuinely support him, the rapper elaborated. \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers that a celeb is supposed to have,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can tell you that when he was running, it\u2019s like I felt something. The fact that he won proves something. It proves that anything is possible in America.\u201d He added, \u201cWhen I see an outsider infiltrate, I connect with that.\u201d\n\nAnd therapy:\n\nTwitter, he added, was not exactly a form of therapy for him. \u201cI think everything is therapeutic, but I\u2019m not doing it as a form of personal therapy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an innate feeling. I want to express. I decided to use this platform to express some breakthroughs that I\u2019ve had since going to the hospital.\u201d He added: \u201cThere will be mistakes, flaws in the way I communicate today. I\u2019m not media trained. I\u2019m just saying exactly what I feel out of love.\u201d\n\nWhile Mr. West\u2019s tweets and interviews have caused commotion on social media, Liel Leibovitz cautions against unfollowing the artist based on his political views and personal opinions in his Op-Ed, \u201cDon\u2019t Delete Kanye\u201d:\n\nGrowing up in Tel Aviv, I would often grow enamored of a band, a writer or a filmmaker only to discover that my new celebrity crush was, to put it mildly, not a big fan of my country.

I bored roommates at the time with endless rants against a musician for speaking his mind. Even at my most indignant, something nagged. After all, the thing that angered me about Eno was the very same thing that made me love him in the first place, namely his ability to express deep emotions candidly for others to consider. That, by definition, is what a great artist does. Listen to Kanye\u2019s 2010 masterpiece, \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\u201d and you\u2019ll hear an artist not only wrestling with all of his demons \u2014 \u201cNo one man should have all that power / The clock\u2019s ticking, I just count the hours\u201d \u2014 but sharing a flute of bubbly with them once he realizes the wrestling match is one he could never win. Anyone who has marveled at Kanye\u2019s ability to unmoor himself from reality in pursuit of his music should have no trouble understanding the mind-set that unleashed his latest tweetstorm. This insight \u2014 that creative, experimental people might embrace some ideas that you despise because they are creative and experimental \u2014 is one Israelis have long learned to embrace. Lorde remains immensely popular in Tel Aviv, even after canceling her concert there. Massive Attack is still played on the radio, even though the band\u2019s members criticized Israel\u2019s conduct during the 2014 war with Hamas in Gaza.

And so here they are in 1942, Hammerstein weighed down by a string of failures, and Rodgers at the end of his collaboration with the brilliant but dangerously unreliable Lorenz Hart. While most show business biographies traffic in the tale of young geniuses finding their way, here we have the surprising story of middle-aged men wrestling with redefining themselves at a moment of crisis. Sitting in an aisle seat as they bring \u201cOklahoma!\u201d and \u201cCarousel\u201d to life is enormous fun.\n\nImage\n\nPurdum, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is a political writer by trade, and understandably has a much easier time parsing Hammerstein\u2019s lyrics than he does making sense of Rodgers\u2019s music, but to his credit, he gamely offers some astute musical analysis \u2014 I particularly enjoyed the musical director Bruce Pomahac\u2019s observation that Rodgers\u2019s genius lay in \u201chow many ways he could take you away from \u2018do\u2019 and then bring you back to it.\u201d Purdum also unearths an alarming charge by Agnes de Mille that Rodgers stole the Praeludium in \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d from the 16th-century composer Orlando di Lasso. (My own research doesn\u2019t confirm this, but remarks from the arrangers Trude Rittmann and Robert Russell Bennett provide considerable testimony throughout the text that Rodgers had little compunction about taking credit for others\u2019 work.)\n\nCertain preconceptions cling to the Rodgers and Hammerstein mythos, and Purdum doesn\u2019t manage to shake our familiar impression of the two as an emotional odd couple: Hammerstein the warm, nurturing, sincere liberal (despite being a notorious tightwad); Rodgers the cold, controlling, inaccessible (and leering) genius. Indeed, the closest Rodgers gets to our sympathies is during the three months he spends in Payne Whitney being treated for depression after the television broadcast of \u201cCinderella.\u201d\n\nBut Purdum shines when demonstrating Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cmasterly skills as an adapter and editor\u201d \u2014 his understanding of structure and character are on ample display in the chapters detailing the births of \u201cOklahoma!,\u201d \u201cCarousel\u201d and \u201cSouth Pacific\u201d \u2014 and the book is cleareyed about the faults of his later librettos. In an excerpt from his essential essay \u201cNotes on Lyrics,\u201d Hammerstein castigates himself for the \u201cinsincerity\u201d of his early songs, and we see in that moment that his insistence on sincerity above all other values will both bolster his genius and ultimately limit it.\n\nAfter the team has their first failure, the ambitious but clumsy \u201cAllegro\u201d in 1947, Purdum writes, \u201cThe era of innovation was over for them. The era of empire lay ahead,\u201d and the book likewise moves from the thrill of creation to the more quotidian details of deal making and maintenance as Rodgers and Hammerstein grow from songwriters into theatrical titans. From the shadows emerges the partners\u2019 lawyer, Howard Reinheimer, whose tightfisted and farsighted schemes net \u201cthe boys\u201d exceptional wealth and an unprecedented amount of control over their own work.

Together, they made a pan-roasted chicken in cream sauce, with morel mushrooms, that\u2019s on her spring menu.\n\nAt first glance, the dish may seem a little elaborate for the home cook. It calls for cognac, Madeira wine, cream, and morels \u2014 luxuries that most people wouldn\u2019t typically reach for.

M.L.B. teams sometimes pay the players less than $1,500 per month, but only for a six-month period \u2014 less than the federal minimum wage. They were previously allowed to do that because of two exemptions to the minimum wage act, one for seasonal workers and the other for creative professionals.\n\nBut M.L.B. was recently granted its own exemption in an amendment included in the $1.3 trillion federal spending bill, after baseball lobbied Congress for it. President Trump signed the bill on March 23. The amendment exempts minor league players and strips them of certain federal minimum wage protections.\n\nThat essentially nullifies the players\u2019 lawsuit from that date forward. The original suit was filed in 2014 in U.S. District Court in San Francisco by three players who claimed that M.L.B. teams violated the Fair Labor Standards Act, including minimum wage and overtime requirements for a workweek (the plaintiffs are also seeking to be categorized as a class in order to include hundreds of more players).\n\nBoth sides were recently asked by the court how the new federal law would impact their case, and M.L.B. acknowledged that the law was not retroactive. The players are seeking damages from the beginning of their employment until the enactment of the new federal law.\n\nThe players estimate they work 50 to 60 hours per week during the regular season, and they do not get paid at all in spring training or the off-season. Major league teams also pay large signing bonuses to many, though not all, minor leaguers. According to M.L.B.\u2019s 2016 figures, about 1,850 players received bonuses of at least $50,000 (for a total of about $440 million), which are paid out over two seasons.\n\nBaseball, in its recent brief to the court, noted that the new exemption means it doesn\u2019t have to pay players for each hour they are engaged in baseball related activities outside of games \u2014 weight lifting, batting practice, playing catch, etc., throughout the year.\n\n\u201cPayment of this minimum weekly salary during the championship season qualifies a player for the federal exemption regardless of how many hours he spends engaged in baseball related activities at any time during the calendar year,\u201d the brief said.\n\nMinor league players, unlike their major-league brethren, are not unionized and do not have unifying representation to bargain with the M.L.B. teams.", "title": "How a California Court Ruling Might Affect Minor League Players", "authors": []}

It was an observational study, not a randomized trial with a control group. The researchers recruited 316 people, 130 of them children whose parents gave consent, from a Facebook group dedicated to low-carb diets for diabetes, called TypeOneGrit, then reviewed their medical records and contacted their medical providers.\n\nWhile it was not a clinical trial, the study is striking because it highlights a community of patients who have been \u201cextraordinarily successful\u201d at controlling their diabetes with a very low-carb diet, said Dr. David M. Harlan, the co-director of the Diabetes Center of Excellence at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. \u201cPerhaps the surprise is that for this large number of patients it is much safer than many experts would have suggested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to see this paper,\u201d Dr. Harlan added. . \u201cIt should reopen the discussion about whether this is something we should be offering our patients as a therapeutic approach.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the paper cautioned that the findings should not lead patients to alter their diabetes management without consulting their doctors, and that large clinical trials will be necessary to determine whether this approach should be used more widely.\n\n\u201cWe think the findings point the way to a potentially exciting new treatment option,\u201d said Dr. David Ludwig, a co-author of the study and a pediatric endocrinologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital who has written popular books about low-carb diets. \u201cHowever, because our study was observational, the results should not, by themselves, justify a change in diabetes management.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout 1.25 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Managing the condition requires administering insulin throughout the day, especially when consuming meals high in carbs, which raise blood sugar more than other nutrients. Over time, chronically elevated blood sugar can lead to nerve and kidney damage and cardiovascular disease.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the argument for restricting carbs is that it keeps blood sugar more stable and requires less insulin, resulting in fewer highs and lows. The approach has not been widely studied or embraced for Type 1 diabetes, but some patients swear by it.\n\nTypeOneGrit has about 3,000 members on Facebook who ascribe to a program devised by Dr. Richard Bernstein, an 84-year-old physician with Type 1 diabetes. His book, \u201cDr. Bernstein\u2019s Diabetes Solution,\u201d recommends limiting daily carb intake to about 30 grams, the amount in a sweet potato, large apple or two slices of whole wheat bread.\n\nDr. Bernstein argues that the fewer carbs consumed, the easier it is to stabilize blood sugar with insulin. He recommends foods like nonstarchy vegetables, seafood, nuts, meat, yogurt, tofu and recipes made with soybean flour, sugar substitutes and other low-glycemic ingredients. His plan emphasizes protein intake, which he says is especially important for growing children.\n\nDr. Carrie Diulus, an orthopedic surgeon with Type 1 diabetes who follows a low-carb vegan diet, credits the Bernstein approach with helping her keep her blood sugar under control. \u201cIt allows me to perform complex spine surgeries without worrying about my diabetes because my blood sugar stays relatively stable,\u201d said Dr. Diulus, who helped inspire the new study when researchers learned about her participation in the TypeOneGrit community.\n\nThe most striking finding of the new report was that A1C levels, on average, fell from 7.15 percent, in the diabetic range, to 5.67 percent, which is normal. The rate of diabetes-related hospitalizations also fell, from 8 percent before the diet to 2 percent after, including fewer hospitalizations for hypoglycemic seizures.\n\nThose following the diet had increased LDL cholesterol, likely from consuming more saturated fat, which some experts said was potentially concerning and deserved further study. But other heart disease risk factors appeared favorable: They had high HDL cholesterol, the protective kind, and low triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease.\n\nDr. Joyce Lee, a diabetes expert at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the study, said the findings were impressive and merited further follow-up, and that patients who wanted to explore a low-carb approach might do so while being monitored by their health care team. But she also noted that the patients in the new study were a \u201chighly motivated\u201d group, and that it would be difficult for many people to adopt the restrictive regimen they followed.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that it\u2019s really hard to do low-carb, given our cultural norms,\u201d said Dr. Lee, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Bernstein, a co-author on the paper, said it demonstrates what he sees in his practice: That there are diabetics on his regimen \u201cwho are walking around with normal blood sugars and they are happy about it, healthy, and growing if they are kids.\u201d\n\nDerek Raulerson, 46, a human resources manager in Alabama, agrees. Both he and his son, Connor, 13, have Type 1 diabetes. Mr. Raulerson said he struggled for years to control his blood sugar. But six years ago, he gave up juice, bread, potatoes and other simple carbs, and made protein and nonstarchy vegetables the focus of his meals.\n\nSince going low-carb, he said, he has lost weight, cut in half the amount of insulin he uses daily, and watched his A1C fall from the diabetic range to normal levels.\n\n\u201cI have normalized, steady blood sugars now,\u201d he said. \u201cI am no longer on the roller coaster.\u201d", "title": "How a Low-Carb Diet Might Aid People With Type 1 Diabetes", "authors": ["Anahad O Connor"]}

The poisonous aftermath of the Supreme Court\u2019s great decision in Brown v. Board of Education, in 1954, forms the backdrop to Gilbert King\u2019s superb new book, \u201cBeneath a Ruthless Sun.\u201d Rather than accept the justices\u2019 unanimous edict on school integration, much of the South responded with defiance in the courts and violence in the streets, especially in the backwoods. Florida has largely escaped the opprobrium heaped on the other states of the old Confederacy, but it\u2019s to the Sunshine State that King returns with a story of mind-boggling racism and cruelty.\n\n\n\n\u201cRuthless Sun\u201d amounts to a sequel of sorts to King\u2019s \u201cDevil in the Grove,\u201d which won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction in 2013.

The new book also concerns a rape case in Lake County, this one in 1957, the victim this time the wife of one of the region\u2019s rising citrus barons. The connecting thread between the two cases is Sheriff Willis McCall, the chief law enforcement official in the county, and a figure of nearly incomprehensible evil.\n\nOn the night of Dec. 17, 1957, Blanche Knowles called her lawyer to report that a black perpetrator had invaded her gracious home in Okahumpka. The lawyer reported the crime to the police, and McCall promptly put on the police radio his customary instruction in such circumstances: \u201cRound up every nigger you see.\u201d His will was done, and the deputies took special pleasure in corralling Bubba Hawkins, whose chief crime was having an uncle who was trying to integrate the University of Florida College of Law. (Notwithstanding the Brown decision, and thanks to the reactionary Florida Supreme Court, Virgil Hawkins was never allowed to matriculate.) A few days after the crime, events took an unexpected turn. Even though Knowles described her attacker as black, McCall arrested a white man. The suspect was Jesse Daniels, a 19-year-old neighbor who today would be described as having a developmental disability (probably some form of mental retardation). Cornered by McCall\u2019s uniformed thugs, Daniels signed a confession.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe hero of \u201cDevil in the Grove\u201d was a youngish Thurgood Marshall, the cagey grumpus in his days as a crusading lawyer. His counterpart in King\u2019s new book is far less famous but equally compelling. Mabel Norris Reese ran a struggling weekly newspaper in Lake County, and this middle-aged white woman had the courage and fortitude to challenge the authority of Willis McCall. She may have dressed with uncharacteristic fussiness for the flatlands of Central Florida, complete with \u201cher bebopper\u2019s cat-eye glasses,\u201d but not even burning crosses on her lawn (and worse) intimidated her from her pursuit of McCall\u2019s misdeeds. (Watch for a Streep vs. McDormand brawl for the part.) Reese struck up a friendship with Daniels\u2019s beleaguered mother, and the pair did what they could to stop McCall from putting Jesse away.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the surface, King\u2019s choice of this case as an illustration of a racist system of justice might seem peculiar. After all, this is the story of a crooked Southern sheriff railroading a white man. But as the story unfolds, it exposes the sinister complexity of American racism. Joe Knowles, who was off on a tryst with another woman when his wife was attacked, let the authorities know that it wouldn\u2019t do for Blanche to have been raped by an African-American. The shame for her, and for him, would have been too great. So McCall obliged by manufacturing the case against the hapless Jesse Daniels. But then there\u2019s another twist. A black man named Sam Wiley Odom is arrested for a different rape in a nearby town, and the evidence makes clear that Odom also raped Blanche. So, in an especially macabre development, McCall and his allies hustled to have Odom executed for the second rape before he could be implicated in the first. Odom duly became the last person executed for rape in Florida\u2019s history.", "title": "How a Racist Sheriff Railroaded a Disabled Teenager and Got Off", "authors": ["Jeffrey Toobin", "Gilbert King"]}

It\u2019s unusual to see managers support workers who are planning, essentially, to strike, but that was the case in every state I\u2019d covered since the nationwide teacher walkout movement began. Dr. DeBlieux told me that because of low budgets she\u2019d had to turn to private donors to support a whole host of instructional and social priorities for children.\n\nShe also mentioned, almost offhandedly, that she\u2019d hired over 50 foreign teachers, largely from the Philippines. She couldn\u2019t recruit or retain enough Americans with the salaries she was able to offer, around $40,000. I was surprised to hear this, in part because Sunset Ridge Elementary School seemed like a great place to work, with a thriving Spanish-English dual language program and a group of dedicated, passionate colleagues. Care work, like nannying or home health care, has often been done by recent immigrants. But you don\u2019t necessarily expect to see this sort of global labor market in the teaching profession. Many of the teachers I meet on the road attended college in their home states and work in, or very near to, the communities where they grew up.\n\nI\u2019d heard of schools traveling out-of-state to recruit, but not about this: a pipeline of teachers from the Philippines to the American Southwest. I drew a big star in my notebook to remind myself to follow up.\n\nMy editors \u2014 Marc Lacey, Dave Kim and Jia Lynn Yang \u2014 urged me to make foreign teacher recruitment the focus of my reporting. I then asked the Pendergast school district to introduce me to one of their Filipino teachers. I connected with Donato Soberano, who became the subject of my piece. Mr. Soberano left his wife and two daughters behind in Manila to teach science in Arizona. His school district desperately needs him, and he would like nothing more than to stay in his job long-term. After all, he earns 10 times more here than he did back home. But he holds a J-1 visa, which requires him to return to the Philippines within five years.\n\nMr. Soberano is just one of thousands of teachers nationwide who hold temporary cultural exchange visas and are being recruited to work in regions with teacher shortages. I found clusters of J-1 teachers in Nevada, Arizona, the Carolinas and several other states. Many go into debt paying large fees \u2014 $12,500 in Mr. Soberano\u2019s case \u2014 to private agencies that place them in their jobs.", "title": "How a Times Education Reporter Discovered a Pipeline of Foreign Teachers", "authors": []}

The 2019 Army ammunition budget allocates more than $376 million toward the purchase of high-explosive and Excalibur rounds, which have been fired more frequently in the fight against the Islamic State than in the previous 40 years. The move is striking, given how marginalized artillery was in America\u2019s post-9/11 wars.\n\nA decade ago, as a freshly minted Army artillery officer trained in the fundamentals of setting up and firing howitzers, I could compute ballistics by hand and correct the fall of artillery shells using just a pair of binoculars and a radio. Artillery fired often during the invasion of Iraq and the drive toward Baghdad in 2003. Yet when my first unit deployed to Iraq in 2008, we traded in our self-propelled howitzers for armored trucks and spent the next 12 months of that deployment essentially acting as infantry troops. In the years after the invasion, the United States Army viewed artillery as secondary to having as many soldiers as possible running patrols, staffing guard towers and escorting convoys of supplies.\n\nThe same went for Afghanistan, where for years after Sept. 11, many artillery batteries fired few, if any, high-explosive rounds. The rules of engagement were tight, and insurgents typically did not expose themselves in ways that made them easy targets.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe ongoing campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, however, has brought a change.\n\nThe Islamic State often acts more like a conventional military than an insurgent force \u2014 creating conditions that have returned artillery units to traditional roles. With this change, the Army has requested a sharp increase in its annual purchase of high-explosive shells to resupply its Field Artillery Corps. In all, the service is seeking more than eight times the number of artillery shells in 2019 than it has procured in any recent year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis request initially spurred questions among defense observers about whether the new expanded Pentagon budget under President Trump signaled preparations for war on the Korean peninsula \u2014 an understandable form of speculation, but speculation nonetheless.

In Ottawa, the place I have called home for the past four years, news of an attack in Afghanistan always triggers a flurry of text messages to my mother. She assured me that everyone in my family was fine. I woke up an hour later to her texting me about a second blast. A suicide bomber, carrying a camera to blend in, had detonated explosives that killed 25 people, including nine journalists. She wanted to know if I knew any of them. I did.\n\nAmong those killed was the chief photographer for Agence France-Presse in Kabul, my friend Shah Marai. I met him during the presidential campaign of 2009 at Ghazi sports stadium in Kabul. He was known among the Afghan press corps as one of the kohna pekh ha, or the Old Stocks, referring to the group of Afghan journalists who started working for foreign media during the Taliban regime. Newcomers like me looked up to them for professional guidance. Marai began his work as a driver and worked his way up.

You say you wish to set a good example for your brother, and I want to assure you that you\u2019re already doing that. By honestly communicating how you feel in the family your father made with his wife, you modeled something quite important to your brother.\n\nMany of the letters we receive are from people whose problems are caused by their inability to speak truth, so give yourself some credit for having the courage to do that. I suggest you harness that brave truth-telling spirit once again and have another, calmer, but equally frank conversation with your stepmother \u2014 this one motivated not by tensions, but realities: the two of you would prefer to have nothing to do with each other, but since that\u2019s not an option, you\u2019d both benefit from finding a way to get along. The goal of the conversation I\u2019m suggesting isn\u2019t to convince your stepmother to be more loving or welcoming to you; your explosion of a few years ago was an attempt at that, and nothing changed. It\u2019s to negotiate a truce.\n\nSteve Almond: I couldn\u2019t agree more, both with the notion that you\u2019ve modeled for your brother courage and candor (and should be proud of that), and that the time has come to confront the lingering tensions between you and your stepmother.

Your dad got involved with your stepmom \u201cjust months\u201d after your parents\u2019 divorce, a period during which you were no doubt still feeling raw and confused by the split. You were probably also troubled, and rightfully so, that your father would jump into another serious relationship so quickly. Your stepmother made things worse with that astonishingly cruel statement (\u201cyou\u2019re not who I would have chosen as a stepchild\u201d). This comment arose not from your stepmother\u2019s inherent cruelty, but from her insecurity and weakness. That may be cold comfort to you, but I think it\u2019s important to recognize that any parent who would say something so undermining to a child is clearly struggling with their own self-worth. That doesn\u2019t mean that you have to accept her abuse, passive-aggressive or otherwise. On the contrary, the conversation you need to have with her should set a clear boundary, one that forces her to confront how her cruelty makes you feel.

To qualify for asylum, applicants must show they were persecuted or fear persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion in their home country. Applications must be filed within a year of arrival, with narrow exceptions.\n\nBut the plaintiffs said that neither Thomas Hecht nor Leonard Hecht, who speaks Spanish, asked them specific questions about persecution before filing asylum applications without their knowledge.\n\nGenerally, once an applicant is found not to be eligible for asylum, the case is sent to the immigration courts and the deportation process begins. A lawyer can try to get the deportation canceled based on a client\u2019s 10-year residency and U.S. citizen children. In some cases, the applicant could be then eligible for a green card, but the bar is very high: \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to a U.S. citizen spouse, parent or child if he or she is deported. And even then, only 4,000 of these cases can be approved in a year.\n\nAccording to federal statistics requested and compiled by the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law\u2019s immigration clinic, which is a co-counsel in the suit, the Hecht firm had filed 1,039 asylum applications from November 2006 through January 2017. Cardozo said it could only confirm two asylum applications that were approved during that time. The data also shows that the Hechts had subsequently filed 188 applications for \u201ccancellation of removal,\u201d and that only six were listed as granted.\n\nThe 26 individuals who are plaintiffs in the suit, from Staten Island, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, are now at risk of deportation, as the Trump administration has said that any immigrant living in the United States illegally is a target.\n\nMake the Road New York, an immigrant activist group, is representing Mr. Torres, and is also a plaintiff, suing under the federal racketeering and organized crime act known as RICO. So far, the clients have paid $58,506 to the Hecht firm or to new lawyers to reverse deportation proceedings; the plaintiffs are seeking damages up to three times that amount.\n\nThe suit also named a Staten Island tax preparer, Luis Guerrero, who steered clients to the law firm, according to the complaint.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the offices of Thomas T.

He said that he only met Mr. Guerrero once, in his office, and that he did not partner with him.

His father, who he said was an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor, was not in the office.\n\nAmy Taylor, the co-legal director of Make the Road New York said the 10-year myth is pervasive, despite education efforts from her organization and others. \u201cThe No. 1 question we get from clients is, \u2018do I qualify for the 10-year visa?\u2019\u201d Ms. Taylor said.

Because asylum backlogs can last longer than two years, immigrants would not discover the fraud for a while. And under the Obama administration, they were often allowed to stay in the country even though they were subject to deportation.\n\nFor some, applying for asylum and then gambling on a deportation being overturned could be a viable legal strategy, according to Camille Mackler, the legal policy director of the New York Immigration Coalition, an activist group, But she cautioned that was only if a client had a good-faith claim for asylum, a strong fallback case for canceling the removal, and, above all, that the lawyer advised the client of the deportation risk.\n\nE.G.R., 32, a Mexican-born mother of two U.S. citizen children, and one of the plaintiffs, said she did not realize the Hechts had applied for asylum for her until she was told to go to an interview with the government. She asked to be identified only by her initials because she is currently in deportation proceedings.\n\nShe said the asylum officer with United States Citizenship and Immigration services asked her, \u201cWhy are you asking for political asylum when you\u2019ve been here so many years?\u201d\n\nShe was not found eligible for asylum and has a hearing before an immigration court judge on May 18.\n\nE.G.R. said she had been skeptical when her accountant, Mr. Guerrero, first referred her to the Hechts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI did ask him if this person would steal my money because we worked so hard,\u2019\u201d E.G.R. said. \u201cHe said, \u2018why would you think that? I\u2019m Hispanic as well.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Guerrero did not return a call left at his office.\n\nLawyers representing the plaintiffs say they are investigating other ways to protect clients thrust into the deportation pipeline, including whether they would be eligible for a visa as victims of fraud.\n\nIn a statement, U.S.C.I.S. said it could not address this specific case, but that it has participated in prosecuting recent asylum fraud cases around the country.\n\nWhat is different about this lawsuit, said Stephen H. Legomsky, a professor of immigration law at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, is that it \u201cshines a light on the victim,\u201d he said, whereas the focus had mostly been on immigrants committing fraud to obtain a benefit.\n\nAnother of the plaintiffs, who asked to be identified only by her initials, A.M.M., 46, paid the Hecht firm $4,856 and is now in deportation proceedings.\n\nTo others who may be tempted by the easy promise of a green card, she has a message: \u201cIf something sounds too good to be true, keep an eye out on that.\u201d", "title": "Immigrants Claim Lawyers Defrauded Them and They May Be Deported", "authors": ["Liz Robbins"]}

They say it would be too burdensome for institutions on an island that still lacks access to water and electricity, let alone functional technology.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the department\u2019s proposal to require applicants to fill out immense amounts of paperwork for disaster relief funds is yet another example of the Trump administration\u2019s failure to prioritize Puerto Rico,\u201d said the letter, drafted by Representatives Nydia M. Vel\u00e1zquez and Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano, and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, all Democrats of New York.\n\nA New York Times analysis of the $41 million in total aid disbursements made by the department shows that $8.9 million went to institutions in Puerto Rico, $4 million went to Texas, $8 million to Florida and $53,915 to the Virgin Islands.\n\nCongressional leaders and Puerto Rico higher education advocates say that is not nearly enough. Some pointed to a Monday announcement from Ms. DeVos on disaster aid to primary and secondary schools to illustrate this point. The department said it would provide $693 million in disaster aid to K-12 school systems affected by natural disasters, with the vast majority, $589 million, going to Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cYou can see that those are more in line with the need of the areas, so that begs the question, Why is the proportion so different in Puerto Rico when it came to funds for higher education?\u201d said Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez-Toledo, director of the Puerto Rico Relief and Economic Policy Initiative at the Center for American Progress.\n\nIn November, the Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities submitted a request to Ms. DeVos on behalf of 65 of Puerto Rico\u2019s private and public universities to at least double the island\u2019s total allocation of work-study grants to help students work their way through college.

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "\u201cJob losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,\u201d Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email:\n\nIn fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs.\n\nHostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University \u2014 Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen \u2014 was crucial to Trump\u2019s victory.\n\nIn their October 2017 paper, \u201cPolitical Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?\u201d the authors demonstrate that\n\nSupport for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College.\n\nAlong similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper:\n\nAI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (\u2018mid-skilled\u2019) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services.\n\nIn his paper, \u201cComputers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,\u201d Levy writes:\n\nOn balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization\u2019s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs.\n\nTake the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, \u201cthere should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities\u201d by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects.\n\nSurveying the trucking industry recently in \u201cThe Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,\u201d Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles \u201cwould put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.\u201d\n\nAssessing the full range of employment, West observes that\n\nRobots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs.\n\nLevy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace,\n\nthe stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case.\n\nWhere do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy\u2019s answer is: farther down the ladder:\n\nAI\u2019s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage work\n\ninto such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services.\n\nFor many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women\u2019s and reproductive rights movements.)\n\nLevy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers:\n\nJob losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook.\n\nWhat is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill.\n\nLevy writes:\n\nA populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the \"people\u201d and the \u201celite\u201d based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal \u201celites\u201d who make a very good living developing robots to put \u201cthe people\u201d out of work.\n\nWhile Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes:\n\nIT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial.\n\nThe favorable view, according to Kurz, masks the\n\ndark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth.\n\nWhile operating legally \u2014 indeed with the full support of the legal system \u2014 contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz:\n\nOnce an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors \u2014 additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs \u2014 then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms.\n\nAccording to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences:\n\nMonopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion \u2014 equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income \u2014 in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points.\n\nThe result is a cascading effect caused\n\nboth by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular.\n\nJason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, \u201cShould We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?\u201d that\n\nThe history of automation \u2014 and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades \u2014 suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation.\n\nFurman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs:\n\nThe concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience.\n\nInstead, Furman contends that the problem lies in \u201cthe process of turnover,\u201d which \u201ccould lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.\u201d In the short run,\n\nnot all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this \u201cshort run\u201d could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of \u201cshort runs\u201d for even longer.\n\nA short run that lasts for decades \u2014 or a series of short runs that last even longer \u2014 would seem to warrant grave alarm.", "title": "Opinion | Industrial Revolutions Are Political Wrecking Balls", "authors": []}

Experts say such detection is possible at around six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIf the bill becomes law, it could sharply curtail the number of abortions in Iowa, a state of 3.1 million people. According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, of 3,722 abortions performed in the state in 2016, 347 of them occurred before six weeks of pregnancy, the time when many women are newly learning that they are pregnant.\n\nThe Iowa bill, which includes exemptions for victims of rape and incest, quickly drew the condemnation of national abortion rights groups.\n\nErin Davison-Rippey, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, said that most abortions in Iowa would be illegal under the measure.\n\n\u201cThis bill is dangerous, it is unconstitutional and it is just unconscionable,\u201d said Ms. Davison-Rippey, who called on Ms. Reynolds to veto the bill.

In March, legislators in Ohio introduced a bill that would ban all abortions, with no exceptions.\n\nEarlier this year, Mississippi passed a law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for medical emergencies or severe fetal abnormality but not for cases of rape or incest.

Kennedy voted with Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer for the majority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Samuel A.

There was no continuous rail link across Eurasia. There still isn\u2019t, but 125 years later China now envisions financing and building multiple such overland routes (with much faster trains). That\u2019s for the \u201cbelt\u201d portion of what it calls the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d initiative: It is also developing a string of new ports, from the South China Sea through the Indian Ocean to Africa and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe number and scale of the projects proposed are breathtaking, far surpassing even the imagination of a sci-fi writer. They have stimulated awe and, more often, dark suspicions among many foreign observers.\n\nJust after Verne was writing, China\u2019s first main railways were being built by Western companies, financed by Western loans to a nearly bankrupt Qing dynasty. Within two decades, struggles over foreign ownership of Chinese rail had touched off a revolution that brought down the dynasty in 1912.

The department plans to solicit public comment about the \u201cappropriate definition\u201d of service animals, a spokeswoman said.\n\nTwenty-two states already have some kinds of laws addressing the issue and lawmakers in Arizona, Iowa and Minnesota are considering cracking down on service dog fraud.\n\nThe Americans With Disabilities Act defines service animals as either dogs or miniature horses that are specifically trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities, such as guiding people who are blind. The Air Carrier Access Act separately governs airlines in the area of service and support animals \u2014 and that\u2019s one of the places prone to abuse.\n\nPassengers pass off their pets as support or service animals so they can remain in the cabin instead of the cargo hold, officials said. (While unusual pets, such as pigs, have been taken aboard as support animals, airlines are not required to accommodate others, like snakes, reptiles, ferrets, rodents and spiders.)\n\nSenator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, last week introduced legislation to have the definition of a service animal under the Air Carrier Access Act match the one in the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Menus, ornate signs and prominently presented testimonials from fans like Anthony Bourdain (\u201cThis artichoke is terrific\u201d) proclaim carciofo alla giudia excellence.\n\nPhoto\n\nInside his acclaimed restaurant in the ghetto, Nonna Betta, the artichoke aficionado Umberto Pavoncello shook his head over the controversy. He speculated that the Israeli rabbi was perhaps not as \u201cilluminated\u201d as some of Rome\u2019s rabbis, and had had the bad luck of cutting into an infested, and clearly non-Roman, artichoke.\n\nUsing what he called \u201ca Talmudic type of reasoning,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello said that if Jews had been following the ancient kosher rule for centuries, it is unlikely that they would have suddenly made an exception for fried artichokes in the 16th century. Rabbis back then must have determined, he said, that Roman artichokes were impervious to worms, and thus edible.\n\nWatching his waiters carry out plates of gleaming artichokes, Mr. Pavoncello observed that \u201ckosher is a big business\u201d and expressed appreciation that his community\u2019s leadership had rallied for what the Rome daily newspaper Il Messaggero called \u201cthe artichoke war.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nNot all cities have stood strong. A Milan branch of the kosher restaurant chain Ba\u2019Ghetto heeded the orders from Israel and pulled the artichoke. (\u201cTheir rabbi is more rigid,\u201d a waiter at the branch in Rome\u2019s ghetto said with a shrug.) But in the face of a stiff-necked Israeli rabbinate, the city\u2019s Jews reasserted what they say is a basic principle of kosher law: that Jewish communities around the world can decide for themselves whether their fruits and vegetables are cleaned in a way that keeps them kosher.\n\n\u201cThere is no pope,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello said.\n\nSome argued that the hard overlapping petals of their preferred mammole, romanesco and cimaroli artichokes seal out insect eggs and other invasive species. One local rabbi, Umberto Piperno, said in an interview that \u201cJewish Roman women know how to inspect the artichoke, and better than the rabbis.\u201d\n\nBut in order to keep the artichokes clean and kosher the world over, Rabbi Piperno hopes to patent an ultrasound flying-bug repellent he is developing; it works, he said, like a veritable \u201cIron Dome\u201d for artichokes.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther Romans deferred to the higher authority of the city\u2019s chief rabbi, Riccardo Di Segni, who prepared the Jewish-style artichokes in a \u201cHappy Passover\u201d video message, and once said, \u201cWe are the people of the artichoke, not only the people of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nAt the end of artichoke season, in mid-April, Rabbi Piperno sent Ms. Di Porto and other people of the artichoke to promote Jewish-style artichokes (and his ultrasound idea) in the heart of artichoke country.\n\nIn Ladispoli, which in the 1970s and \u201980s became a temporary harbor for thousands of Russian Jewish immigrants escaping persecution in the Soviet Union, Ms. Di Porto, eyeglasses hanging on a string around her neck, methodically prepared for a cooking demonstration.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt starts at 4 Italian time, not German time,\u201d Ms. Di Porto, 64, said when she was asked when things would actually get going. \u201cPass me another one,\u201d she said as she poured a fifth bottle of extra-virgin olive oil into a big pot on a hot plate.\n\nAfter being expertly cleaned with a paring knife in a climbing spiral motion that removes all the peel and external petals (\u201cYou don\u2019t want to eat and spit, as they say in Rome,\u201d Mr. Pavoncello explained) the artichokes are submerged in hot oil for about 10 minutes. Drained, dried and sometimes salted and peppered, they are, just before serving, refried in hotter oil that renders the outside crackling and the inside soft.\n\nStanding between the prep table and a poster of \u201cthe violet artichoke of Sant\u2019Erasmo,\u201d Ms. Di Porto and Claudio Nardocci, the president of an association promoting local Italian foods, deftly peeled artichokes over a black garbage bag. Mr. Nardocci spoke of the volcanic activity 600,000 years ago that gave the local fields, and the artichokes that grew there, lots of iron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for this that it assumes such colors \u2014 look at what a work of art it is,\u201d he said, holding the artichoke up for appreciation like a fine wine. Ms. Di Porto instead emphasized the structural assets of the Roman artichoke; one reason women in the Jewish ghetto had used it for centuries, she said, was that \u201cinsects can\u2019t get in because it\u2019s entirely closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the most, a little ladybug,\u201d Mr. Nardocci added.\n\nPhoto\n\nMinutes later, he officially began the event with more remarks about artichoke history and geology, including the update that recent bad weather had increased iron levels, a fact he said he had verified by walking the fields with a magnet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe introduced Rabbi Piperno, whose forehead appeared on a large screen via a terrible Skype connection, and who attempted to read a statement titled \u201cThe Dilemma of the Jewish-Style Artichoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of the Jewish community,\u201d the rabbi began, before fading out.

That truth has been obvious to many observers; Truman Bewley made a systematic survey to confirm the point. Employers believe that actual wage cuts, as opposed to, say, letting real wages erode via inflation, are demoralizing and perceived as unfair.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "And it comes amid an escalating shadow war with Iran.\n\nAirstrikes on a suspected missile storage site near Hama, Syria, on Sunday which destroyed a cache of missiles and killed at least 16 people, many of them Iranians, were reported to have been carried out by Israel. Israel is believed to have conducted several previous attacks in Syria on assets belonging to Iran and its allies, and is bracing for promised Iranian retaliation for a strike on an air base in Syria last month.\n\nThe new law would not necessarily change the procedure for those airstrikes, which Israel has not acknowledged. What approval may be required for these strikes is not public information.\n\nBut it could give Mr. Netanyahu more latitude to broaden the hostilities into open warfare.\n\nThe law was not written with the current skirmishes with Iran in mind, according to one of the architects of the reform, and applies to any prime minister and defense minister, not just the current ones.\n\nStill, critics note that Mr. Netanyahu is under investigation in multiple corruption cases and is fighting for his political future, and the current defense minister, Avigdor Lieberman, is a political hard-liner with little security experience. Those issues could raise questions about their motivations should they decide to take Israel to war.\n\nThe law reduces the approval required to go to war from the full cabinet to half of the much smaller security cabinet under most circumstances. But a provision was added late in the process to give that authority to the prime minister and defense minister in \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last minute addition giving authority under extreme circumstances to the prime minister and defense minister on their own appears to be out of order,\u201d said Yehuda Ben Meir, the head of the national security and public opinion project at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University. \u201cIt is not appropriate to Israel\u2019s constitutional system of government.\u201d\n\nThe law does not define what constitutes \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Israeli leaders had to seek the approval of the full cabinet to go to war, or even to embark on a military action that was likely to lead to war. But in recent years, governments have swelled to up to 30 ministers. Advocates of the new law say that with the larger cabinets, that system has become unwieldy.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Headed by Yaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser and a major general in the reserves, the committee recommended giving the authority to go to war to the more select security cabinet, which by law numbers at least seven members and not more than half the members of the government.\n\nMr. Amidror said in an interview that Mr. Netanyahu was \u201chappy with our recommendation,\u201d but that the newly amended law went beyond that. Mr. Netanyahu argued that the law\u2019s requirement of a quorum of the security cabinet could lead to paralysis in an emergency, Mr. Amidror said.\n\nHe said that only then did Mr. Netanyahu push for the power to be vested in the prime minister and defense minister.\n\nMr. Amidror insisted that the timing of the new law was coincidental and had nothing to do with the current tensions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was behind it so I know for sure there is no connection,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Israel, any timing is bad timing.\u201d", "title": "Israeli Law Vesting War Power in 2 Top Leaders Faces Criticism", "authors": ["Isabel Kershner"]}

After the game, Frazier lashed out against the umpires behind the plate for their calls not just on Wednesday, but over the past week. He said they incorrectly called some balls and strikes, faced \u201cno accountability\u201d for their mistakes, and he said he wanted to speak with league officials about it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit back anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething has to be said.\u201d\n\nFrazier continued later: \u201cWe lost fair and square. The kid pitched a hell of game but these umpires have got to get better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDeGrom\u2019s injury was certainly more important than a disputed strike zone. It was unclear immediately after the game how much time deGrom, who has a team-best 1.87 earned run average, would miss.\n\nRegardless, it was the most significant injury to befall the Mets this season. DeGrom is a more vital player than relief pitcher Anthony Swarzak (oblique injury), and catchers Travis d\u2019Arnaud (season-ending Tommy John surgery) and Kevin Plawecki (expected to return later this month from a hairline fracture in his left hand). DeGrom, a former All-Star, was the only Mets\u2019 starting pitcher to last their entire injury-marred 2017 season, notching his first 200-inning campaign.\n\nDeGrom\u2019s right elbow, however, had been an issue in the past. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2010, and he had another operation near the end of the 2016 season to move a troublesome ulnar nerve.\n\nCallaway said this injury \u201cwasn\u2019t from his mechanics or an actual pitch so it gives you a glimmer of hope.\u201d\n\nBefore deGrom departed, he had been throwing a vintage start, attacking Braves hitters with his array of biting breaking balls and fastballs. Over the years, he has become one of the best in baseball at pitching to the top of the strike zone to neutralize the growing trend of hitters altering their swings to launch fly balls and home runs.\n\nBut now, deGrom may need some time to rest and heal. The Mets rotation, the backbone of the team, has received uneven performances from Zack Wheeler, Steven Matz, Matt Harvey and Jason Vargas, who made his season debut last weekend. Seth Lugo, Corey Oswalt, Gsellman and Harvey, who was moved to the bullpen because of his struggles, may be among the rotation options if deGrom misses time.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, we can sit here and worry about it or cry about it, but that\u2019s not going to do us any good,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cSomebody is going to have to step up if we get some bad news.\u201d", "title": "Jacob deGrom Is Injured as Mets Lose Division Lead", "authors": ["James Wagner"]}

Beginning in the mid-1980s he taught seminars about how to turn a martial arts school into a successful business, including several in Russia in the late 1980s and early \u201990s. His daughter said that members of his family still own and operate two taekwondo studios in Virginia.\n\nMr. Rhee maintained a grueling training regimen until he contracted shingles in 2010.

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "President Trump crowed about the landmark on Friday, tweeting, \u201c4% is Broken!\u201d\n\nThe steady-as-she-goes economy has produced a record 91 straight months of job growth. That may represent a healthier foundation than the dot-com era, when pride \u2014 or, as it was branded, \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d \u2014 went before a fall.\n\nBut the banner number announced Friday did not resolve any of the broader questions that economists have about this unparalleled run.\n\nThe most prominent is a mystery that has proved impervious to easy explanation: why wage increases haven\u2019t been more robust, when the market continues to edge toward full employment.\n\nFriday\u2019s report showed that hourly earnings went up by 2.6 percent over the past year, not much faster than inflation. The subdued wage gains eased the prospect that the Federal Reserve would accelerate its plans to raise interest rates, helping to send stocks higher. But lagging pay also reflects how the economy of 2018 is fundamentally different from earlier eras.\n\n\u201cA 3.9 percent rate today doesn\u2019t suggest as tight a labor market as 3.9 percent in 2000 or 3.9 percent in the late 1960s,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief United States economist.\n\nA lot has changed since the turn of the century. The share of working-age women in the labor force began to fall in 2000, after increasing for decades. Men have been dropping out for much longer. The upshot is that a smaller share of people are participating in the labor market, and it\u2019s easier to get low levels of unemployment when fewer people are vying for jobs.\n\nIn fact, a shrinking labor force in April is part of why the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent from 4.1 percent even as payrolls grew by a fairly routine 164,000 jobs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe population is also older than they used to be, on balance. The baby-boom generation has moved steadily toward retirement over the last two decades. And those still working have not helped push wages up. Generally, workers climb the economic ladder fastest when they are young, and so an older work force may weigh on average wages, economists say.\n\nIn 2000, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent. Part of the problem now is that some 60 percent of the jobs added since 2010 have been in low-wage, service-sector jobs, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nFifty years ago, there were plenty of factory jobs paying a decent wage, and unions held much greater sway. Manufacturing accounted for one in four jobs; today it\u2019s not even one in 10.\n\nThe tech explosion of the late 1990s gave rise to lucrative roles in companies based on new business models. The share of the economic pie going to workers rose steadily for the first time since the 1970s \u2014 a feat not repeated since.\n\n\u201cNo one is creating an e-commerce group out of nothing anymore,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. Instead, companies are bulking up their warehouses to compete with Amazon, slotting in tens of thousands of relatively low-paid pickers, packers and stockers over the past several years.\n\nMr. Gimbel said he had seen a particular hunger for new bodies in call centers, which offer candidates the minimum wage to deal with consumers\u2019 complaints about the gadgets they ordered online.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the economic picture. The White House has provided little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But there are signs that companies that buy metals are feeling the effects already. The Institute for Supply Management said this week that manufacturing activity grew in April at its slowest pace since July.\n\nUncertainty over the price of raw materials could prompt factories to cut back from their recent hiring spree. Manufacturers added 73,000 jobs in the first quarter, much more than in the same period last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cA faster pace of wage growth would be great for households, but in a way that would create even more difficulty for policymakers,\u201d Ms. Zentner said. An acceleration could force Fed officials to raise rates more aggressively, which would raise the cost of car loans and credit card debt.\n\nHowever mixed the blessing, Ms. Zentner said, the ever-tightening job market could soon force faster growth in paychecks. \u201cWe are getting closer and closer to that flash point, but we don\u2019t know exactly when it is going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nA wave of bigger raises has already reached Chandler Steffy\u2019s roofing company in Clive, Iowa.\n\nThree years ago, Mr. Steffy could pay laborers less than $15 an hour.

Officials responded to that letter in December.\n\nOver the past year, two women have come forward to publicly accuse colleagues of retaliation after they reported sexual harassment. A Times investigation in March found that officials had ignored years of complaints that supervisors in the death penalty unit had engaged in gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The department investigated some of the allegations, one of which was supported by texts and firsthand accounts, but the men are still department employees.\n\nThree days after The Times published its article, Mr. Horowitz met with Justice Department employees to talk about sexual harassment.

It was also Baffert\u2019s fifth Derby victory.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe said it did not bother him that 136 years had gone by without a horse unraced at 2 winning the Derby.

His other Derby triumph came in 2005 when he scored with the 50-1 shot Giacomo, and this time the challenge was to guide his supremely talented, but woefully inexperienced, mount to victory in a jammed 20-horse field.\n\nWhich he did, becoming the second-oldest jockey to win the Derby, behind Bill Shoemaker, who was 54 in 1986 when he won on Ferdinand. \u201cKeep riding horses like this, and you don\u2019t have to work that hard,\u2019\u2019 said a jubilant Smith. \u201cThey take care of all the work for you.\u2019\u2019\n\nPhoto\n\nJustify broke cleanly out of the starting gate \u2014 a necessity according to Baffert \u2014 and quickly headed to the front of the pack. Promises Fulfilled went to the lead, but Justify never let him get away. In the backstretch, Smith let him relax a bit, but once he asked for Justify\u2019s best around the far turn, the horse responded like a freight train. \u201cSupercharged,\u201d is how Baffert described it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChad Brown, trainer of Good Magic, said he was proud of his horse but was unlikely to take another shot at Justify when the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown, is held two weeks from now.\n\nJustify is co-owned by WinStar Farm, Head of Plains Partners, Starlight Racing and the China Horse Club. WinStar, which won its first Derby when Super Saver romped in the slop in 2010, owns the majority of the horse, and its president and chief executive, Elliott Walden, decided to name him Justify at the suggestion of an assistant. There\u2019s no story, he said, just a good name for a good horse.\n\nThe horse\u2019s large ownership group reflects the rise of partnerships across the industry, even among the sport\u2019s most powerful owners. In all, nine of the 20 Derby horses this year were owned by partnerships.\n\nPhoto\n\nAs for the other owners, Head of Plains Partners is run by the hedge fund executive Sol Kumin, who earned his first Kentucky Oaks victory on Friday, when Monomoy Girl netted the first-place check for another of his successful partnerships, Monomoy Stables.\n\nStarlight Racing, a small syndicate run by Jack Wolf and his wife, Laurie, usually invests in unproven yearlings, not 3-year-olds. But the trend to team up, Wolf said, is here to stay.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the fourth owner, China Horse Club, the exclusive and secretive group that has become a major global player in the sport in just five years. It won the Oaks last year with Abel Tasman and then one-upped itself with Justify.\n\n\u201cThe win today is equivalent to a gold medal in the Olympics,\u2019\u2019 said Teo Ah Khing, the Harvard-educated architect who runs the China Horse Club. Sitting beside him at the postrace news conference was the prime minister of the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, where Teo is attempting to develop a horse racing resort in a place where there are no thoroughbreds.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut truly standing out among all the owners was Kumin, who had scored a double, snaring both the Oaks and the Derby in one weekend, the first time any owner had done that in more than 60 years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Kumin won the Oaks on Friday, he maintained that nothing could top it. \u201cThis feels about as good as it gets,\u2019\u2019 he insisted.\n\nBut then came Saturday, and Justify\u2019s triumph. Surely, Kumin now felt differently. After all, his philosophy on teaming with others to buy horses is this: Why buy one when you can buy two? So why win one big race when you can win two?\n\nAnd perhaps the same will also hold true for Baffert in 2018.

Or let the project expire and make good on the Paris commitments.\n\nOn the home front, Mr. Trudeau asserts that pressing forward serves the \u201cnational interest.\u201d He has repeatedly declared the \u201cpipeline will get built\u201d by citing a clause in Canada\u2019s Constitution the government could employ to override provinces for projects of nationwide importance. Yet Canadians largely wouldn\u2019t benefit under this scheme because most oil revenues don\u2019t flow to public coffers, rather, increasingly to foreign companies. Even the supposed Asian demand has been vastly exaggerated. Exporting raw bitumen also would ship away potential refinery jobs. And legal experts argue that so-called national interest doesn\u2019t trump Aboriginal rights that are equally enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nBig-footing British Columbia and its First Nations, even if constitutionally viable, would likely damage Mr. Trudeau politically. Is he willing to tarnish his image and Canada\u2019s peaceful reputation by deploying the military? He\u2019s now in a familiar standoff against some of the country\u2019s most tenacious environmentalists, reared in the birthplace of Greenpeace. In the 1990s, the \u201cWar in the Woods\u201d protests against the logging of old-growth trees in Clayoquot Sound prompted major changes to provincial forestry policy; it was ultimately named a Unesco Biosphere Reserve. Fifteen years later, pitting the army against Indigenous grandmothers and teenagers simply for protecting their waters and the Earth could jeopardize 18 of his party\u2019s parliamentary seats.\n\nMr. Trudeau all the while is keeping up appearances abroad, like recently vowing to \u201credouble\u201d climate efforts with President Emmanuel Macron of France. That smacks of duplicity when a day earlier he offered public money to backstop the pipeline. Should the government guarantee investment, the company could attempt construction with minimized risk, and if that fails, head home while casting Canada\u2019s politicians as an inept scapegoat (and potentially setting up a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit against Canada under Nafta). But it\u2019s a long shot for sureties so soon.\n\nSalvaging the embattled pipeline with tax dollars would be foolish and wasteful. It won\u2019t halt civil disobedience that could stretch construction for years, nor beat mounting legal challenges by seven First Nations, two conservation groups and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby. The lawsuits themselves pose an existential threat, contending Aboriginal groups were not adequately consulted, ecosystems and drinking water could be polluted, and orca and other endangered species will be harmed. (Kinder Morgan has already acknowledged in disclosures to shareholders that its permits could be voided.)\n\nWhether he likes it or not, Mr. Trudeau is left with but one viable option: discard the pipeline and focus on greener pastures. To create jobs, he should ramp up the environmentally sustainable infrastructure program he campaigned on and pivot to the accelerating renewable energy sector.\n\nMr. Trudeau speaks persuasively about Canada\u2019s leadership on climate, but in reality he\u2019s trying for the impossible: to convince every side that he can please them. A pipeline will either go in the ground, or it won\u2019t. The prime minister must show he\u2019s worthy of his job before the 2019 election and act decisively. Rather than choosing between the provinces, or the oil lobby and eco-conscious voters, he should think hard about what best embodies his \u201csunny ways\u201d principles \u2014 justice, science and saving the planet.", "title": "Opinion | Justin Trudeau\u2019s Two-Faced Climate Game", "authors": []}

He speaks as if he sees himself as the lone bulwark against potentially dangerous decisions by the commander in chief, they say. And whether he used the word or not, they added, the story itself could serve to accelerate his departure.\n\nYet Mr. Trump, always averse to confrontation, has continued to keep Mr. Kelly in his role, while increasingly steering around him on matters large and small. One person close to the White House said that it will be up to Mr. Kelly to end his tenure, since Mr. Trump knows how damaging it would be to dismiss a four-star Marine general.\n\nThe result is that Mr. Kelly now finds himself in the position where several others who have worked for Mr. Trump have landed: aware that their jobs have become close to untenable, looking for ways to cauterize the wounds to their reputations and knowing that it is only a matter of when \u2014 not if \u2014 they will have to leave.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly\u2019s deputy, Zachary D. Fuentes, defended his boss and insisted he was the victim of unfounded attacks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never called the president an idiot, he\u2019s never called the president unhinged, and the idea that a Marine would ever tolerate somebody disrespecting the commander in chief like that is unthinkable,\u201d said Mr. Fuentes, who has taken the unusual step of talking to reporters on the record this week to push back against the reports.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been smeared,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said of Mr. Kelly, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people want to see him go.\u201d\n\nAs for the relationship between Mr. Kelly and Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cThey\u2019re on great footing. Their relationship is as strong as ever.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut the White House communications staff, which normally rushes to deny or sidestep rumors that Mr. Trump is angry with or on the brink of firing an underling, has been quiet. It allowed a statement that Mr. Kelly issued on Monday, and the protestations of his closest aide, to serve as the only substantial on-record comment in response to the NBC story.\n\n\u201cI spend more time with the president than anyone else, and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in the statement, circulated to the White House press pool. \u201cHe always knows where I stand, and he and I both know this story is total BS.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe next day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, tried to put the best face on the relationship, telling reporters that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Kelly were \u201cvery happy with his position that he currently holds.\u201d\n\nBut Chris Whipple, the author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers,\u201d a history of White House chiefs of staff, has a different view of the relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s like a really bad marriage, but maybe for now both people have decided they\u2019re just going to try to muddle through,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is just tired of having a chief of staff, and has this delusion that he would somehow be more effective unchained.\u201d\n\nMr. Whipple described Mr. Kelly as suffering from what he called the \u201cDon Regan syndrome,\u201d a reference to Ronald Reagan\u2019s ill-fated chief of staff. Like Mr. Kelly, Mr. Regan would often say things that revealed a disdain for his boss, once famously comparing his job to that of a shovel brigade whose task was to walk behind a herd of elephants cleaning up their mess.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s arrogant, he\u2019s been imperious and he\u2019s politically out of his depth,\u201d Mr. Whipple said of Mr. Kelly. \u201cThat\u2019s all coming back to bite him now.\u201d\n\nSome officials said the NBC story appeared to be part of a calculated effort by Mr. Kelly\u2019s detractors to damage him in Mr. Trump\u2019s eyes, perhaps to prod the president to take the step he has so far resisted of firing his chief of staff.\n\nMr. Kelly\u2019s hold on the White House staff has certainly weakened, tarnishing his reputation and overshadowing his efforts to bring order and discipline to the West Wing.\n\nThe scandal surrounding the departure in February of Rob Porter, the staff secretary who resigned under pressure amid allegations of spousal abuse, left a lingering bitter taste among aides, some of whom felt that Mr. Kelly had botched his response and been dishonest about his own role in the episode. Among those who came away angry with Mr. Kelly were Jared Kushner \u2014 whose high-level security access he revoked as part of tightened security clearance procedures in the scandal\u2019s aftermath \u2014 and Ivanka Trump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore recently, he has left some aides with unclear job descriptions in place while declining to fill key roles. He has targeted some people who were close to Mr. Trump during the campaign as potential problems, and tried to limit their influence. That has included people within the West Wing as well as those on Mr. Trump\u2019s ever-present evening phone call list, such as Corey Lewandowski, the first 2016 campaign manager who was fired before the convention.\n\nMr. Lewandowski and David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager, both traveled with Mr. Trump to Michigan on Saturday. And the looming midterm elections \u2014 for which Mr. Kelly has no instinctive feel \u2014 provide Mr. Trump with added incentive to listen to other voices.\n\nMr. Kelly\u2019s insistence on an identifiable chain of command in the White House \u2014 one of the first things he tried to establish when taking the job last summer \u2014 has given way to the creation of new fiefs.\n\nLarry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s new director of the National Economic Council, has a direct line to the president, as does John R. Bolton, his newly installed national security adviser, who was not Mr. Kelly\u2019s preferred candidate for the role. Mr. Bolton has been seeking to build his own empire, hiring staff members who may have been considered problematic before.\n\nMr. Kelly, for his part, is sanguine about how little control he has over how the president chooses to spend his time. At a breakfast event last week for Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, Mr. Kelly marveled that Mr. Trump had spent a long time the day before on the phone with Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots coach, talking about the status of Tom Brady, the star quarterback, according to two people familiar with his remarks, one of whom was present.\n\n\u201cIt was, to begin with, the most dysfunctional White House in modern history, and now it\u2019s worse,\u201d Mr. Whipple said. \u201cWithout an empowered White House chief of staff, you can\u2019t execute policy.\u201d", "title": "Kelly Finds Himself in a Familiar Place in the Trump White House: Eyeing the Exits", "authors": ["Julie Hirschfeld Davis", "Maggie Haberman"]}

Helly Nahmad has a presentation titled \u201cThe 1920s: A Golden Age\u201d with a Fernand L\u00e9ger still life from 1927 \u2014 an uncharacteristic subject for the mechanically included artist \u2014 as well as a large canvas by Max Ernst, an artist who pops up several times in the fair. In another booth at the entrance, David Zwirner has a sleek presentation of Josef Albers and Giorgio Morandi, two painters you might not normally pair. However, their respectively disciplined-but-soulful approaches to minimalism work well together. Deeper inside the fair, Di Donna has one of the most notable and noticeable booths. Painted a deep blue and entered through a small arcade, the presentation is a continuation of their current gallery show, \u201cMoon Dancers: Yup\u2019ik Masks and the Surrealists.\u201d On display here is a canvas painted by Francis Picabia in 1946 depicting a crude postwar monster, alongside works by Ernst, Yves Tanguy and Mir\u00f3, paired with oddly simpatico masks from the central coast of Alaska.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLatin America\n\nPhoto\n\nMexico and South America are well represented in the fair. Galer\u00eda Sur from Montevideo is showing paintings by H\u00e9lio Oiticica and Alfredo Volpi, mounted on tangerine-colored walls, as well as the marble sculptures of Pablo Atchugarry from Uruguay. The entrance to Sean Kelly\u2019s booth has a sly sculpture: it looks like a cardboard remake of Donald Judd\u2019s vertical boxes, but it was crafted by the Mexican artist Jose D\u00e1vila. Inside is an undated abstraction by Lol\u00f3 Soldevilla, a pioneering Cuban modernist. Marian Goodman has a wonderfully spare display of squat limestone sculptures by Gabriel Orozco that toy with the idea of cubes or dice, but include references to body parts. You might learn the most about Latin American modernism at Le\u00f3n Tovar, whose dark gray walls are hung salon style with bright, geometrically shaped paintings by the Venezuelans Francisco Salazar, Carlos Cruz-Diez and Jes\u00fas Rafael Soto; the Argentines Manuel Espinosa and Rogelio Polesello; the Colombian Jorge Riveros, and Carmelo Arden Quin, an Uruguayan artist.\n\nThe Sixties\n\nPhoto\n\nThe late 1950s, blurring into the \u201960s, are to contemporary art what the 1910s and \u201920s were to modernism: a fertile era that is still being revisited by curators and dealers. In Gmurzynska\u2019s booth, which was designed by Robin Scott-Lawson to include a concrete finish on the walls, Pop Art by Robert Indiana and Tom Wesselmann is displayed alongside body prints (or \u201cAnthropometries\u201d) by Yves Klein. Galerie Vallois specializes in Neorealism, and the works here by Niki de Saint Phalle, one of its participants, are the real draw. Her scruffy 1964 portrait of Marilyn Monroe, crafted out of wood, fabric and found objects, is not to be missed. Fergus McCaffrey has works from another movement that extended into the \u201960s: the Gutai group from Japan, an \u201caction\u201d approach to artmaking. A terrifically bright, almost scary abstract canvas from 1961 by Sadamasa Motonaga hangs at the entrance. Inside are works by Kazuo Shiraga, Fujiko Shiraga and Toshio Yoshida that approach painting as an explosive performance.", "title": "Lessons in Modernism at the Tefaf Fair", "authors": ["Martha Schwendener"]}

The award went to William Wyler\u2019s \u201cFriendly Persuasion.\u201d\n\nMr. Peries made 20 features over 50 years, including \u201cGamperaliya\u201d (\u201cChanges in the Village\u201d) in 1963, which earned him the Golden Peacock for best film at the International Film Festival of India. In an interview for a film about his life, \u201cThe World of Peries\u201d (2001), he described the award as a \u201cmiracle\u201d that had liberated him from a sporadic schedule of filmmaking to a more regular one.\n\nHis recognition by the Indian film festival coincided with a blossoming friendship with Satyajit Ray, one of India\u2019s greatest directors. Their debut films were released within a year of each other, and each is considered a critical figure in his country\u2019s film history.\n\nD. B. S. Jeyaraj, a Sri Lankan journalist who writes about film, wrote of Mr. Peries, \u201cIt was he who created in every sense of the term an indigenous cinema in both substance and style.\u201d\n\nMr. Peries was born on April 5, 1919, in Dehiwala, a suburb of Colombo, to James and Ann Gertrude Winifred (formerly Jayasuriya) Peries. His father was a doctor who had been educated in Scotland.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen he was 11, he received an eight-millimeter film projector from his father. At 17, he dropped out of St. Peter\u2019s College to become a journalist for Ceylonese newspapers. He moved to London in 1947 and wrote an arts column for The Times of Ceylon. While in London he also made short films, which earned him awards.\n\nMr. Peries returned to Sri Lanka in the early 1950s to make documentaries for the government. By 1956, he had moved on and begun to make his own feature films, along with the occasional short documentary.\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York held a retrospective of Mr. Peries\u2019s career in 1970.\n\n\u201cHe has the purity of vision that makes us forget that his locale is exotic, his people foreign,\u201d Donald Richie, who curated the retrospective, said at the time. \u201cHe is making films for the whole world.

Writing in Variety, the critic Derek Elley said that the film\u2019s \u201cslight artificiality is redeemed by Peries\u2019s customary gentleness and serene humanity.\u201d\n\nMr. Peries married Sumitra Gunawardena, a director who edited \u201cGamperaliya\u201d and who was Sri Lanka\u2019s ambassador to France in the 1990s. Her recently released film \u201cVaishnavee\u201d is based on a story by Mr. Peries. She survives him.\n\nOne of Mr. Peries\u2019s most acclaimed films was \u201cNidhanaya\u201d (\u201cThe Treasure\u201d), from 1972, which, a reviewer for The Los Angeles Times wrote, \u201cshows him as a considerable director in the intensity of feeling he can convey to an audience that knows little of the society he portrays.\u201d\n\nThe story of a man obsessed with a buried treasure, \u201cNidhanaya\u201d was all but lost until a restoration was completed in 2013 by a group that included the World Cinema Project. It was subsequently screened at the Venice Film Festival, where it had been shown in 1972.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "Whatever it was, I chose the simplest fix: Over the years, I learned to stop crying, without ever really understanding what the crying meant. This seemed to solve the problem, even if I sometimes suspected, in my late teens and early 20s, that I\u2019d merely shoved it beneath some mental rock. I became the type of young man whom many American boys grow into: one who could perform confidence as if it were a card trick, but who found his actual emotions growing increasingly foreign and puzzling to him. Either they were inaccessible, buried out of reach, or they would come erupting out in wild bursts, surges of anger or sadness or frustration that felt like a geyser pushing against the top of my skull.\n\nIt was only after I graduated from college and moved to New York City that I took, without realizing it, a crucial step back toward the vulnerability of childhood. I started going to movies alone. At first the theater was just an escape from the city, which had begun to make me feel like a penny in an immense jar of loose change. Then I started writing about movies professionally, giving me full license to indulge in the strangely taboo practice of solo moviegoing \u2014 a habit that can be remarkably meditative and fortifying, almost like prayer. I don\u2019t remember exactly which movie it was that did it, but eventually something revelatory happened: I remembered how to cry.\n\nSince then, crying at movies has become, for me, a quasi-ritual act, an opportunity to let a piece of art disarm my defenses and remind me how to, well, feel \u2014 to sit with a moment and be empathetic and vulnerable, to react without an agenda.\n\nThe ability to experience and process feelings rather than shoving them down a deep, dark hole may strike a lot of people as an almost toddlerishly basic one \u2014 which, again, fair \u2014 but there really is something about male adolescence that thwarts this healthy instinct. If women seem better at it, that\u2019s surely because women grow up being explicitly told that they are responsible for the feelings of others, whether it\u2019s their parents, their partners or their eventual children, who will depend on that empathy to live. Men tend not to be burdened with this obligation. We often receive the opposite message: that to be a man is to act in spite of emotions, not because of or in tune with them. This imperative to contain feeling rather then express it creates a pressurized, self-collapsing psychology, devoid of outlets, leading to \u2014 well, you can imagine.\n\nIt seems to me that many men could benefit from some emotional bodybuilding \u2014 and that shedding tears at a movie can serve as the psychic equivalent of situps or bench presses. It forces you to reckon with two important things. First, you have to face, and participate in, the feelings of the men and women on the screen. Second, you have to get comfortable with the undeniable presence of your own tears, the look of your red-rimmed eyes in the bathroom mirror afterward. Both are excellent practice for comprehending your emotions and welcoming them back into your life, maybe for the first time since childhood.", "title": "Letter of Recommendation: Crying at Movies", "authors": []}

While I quote a number of scholars who defend the idea of drafting the House of Representatives by lot, so that a truly representative sample of the population would be created that is given the time and resources to become informed on the subjects on which they will vote, free of electoral pressures and corporate lobbying, I explicitly stressed that these models \u201cdid not advocate doing away with elections altogether.\u201d Indeed, these scholars \u201cfelt it was useful to have a Senate with elected citizens and a House with citizens chosen purely by lot.\u201d My book is a plea to enrich the current electoral model of representative democracy with an element of sortition: the use of random samples of everyday citizens who deliberate and make informed policy proposals.\n\nYour reviewer laments this as \u201cna\u00efve and unfeasible,\u201d but seems unaware of recent developments across the globe. What your reviewer considers \u201cutterly impractical\u201d has helped Ireland resolve marriage equality.

[to] pretty much everyone who didn\u2019t sleep through 10th-grade English.\u201d\n\nSadly, however, remaining awake in their classes would not have made my children (a recent high school graduate and a current senior) any more familiar with \u201cMacbeth\u201d because Shakespeare\u2019s plays were never taught to them as set texts.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "In short, competition has actually worked the way economists say it is supposed to, forcing firms to improve quality or face elimination. But it takes competitors to compete, which is where blocking mergers comes in. That\u2019s a point well demonstrated by the case of the airline industry, where the government let the mergers happen. Over the last decade, Delta was allowed to buy Northwest, United to buy Continental, and American to buy US Airways, leaving behind just three majors. What happened next demonstrates the \u201ccurse of triopoly\u201d in all its terrible glory.\n\nIf the 2010s were good years for mobile customers, they have not been happy years for airline passengers. Instead, the three major airlines spent the same period finding ways to give less for more: fewer flights (more crowded planes), smaller seats, fewer flight attendants, higher baggage and change fees and a stubborn resistance to lowering fares, even as oil prices plummeted. All this was made possible, indeed easy, given limited competition, for there was no \u201cunairline\u201d of national stature to keep the airlines honest. (Southwest came closest.) As a result, the airline industry has become astonishingly profitable \u2014 last year it made more than $5 billion in baggage and change fees alone \u2014 while the mistreatment of consumers has become a regular feature of the evening news.\n\nSo if you want the mobile industry to look more like the airline industry, the proposed merger of Sprint and T-Mobile is the one for you. But the chief executives of Sprint and T-Mobile, Marcelo Claure and John Legere, insist that they will be different, and have both now taken to dressing like aging rock stars to underline their maverick status. They say that they will still challenge Verizon and AT&T with low prices and have promised an enticing, Trump-tailored menu including the spending of billions of dollars on a 5G network, which they link to \u201cthree million new jobs,\u201d while also presumably paying off some of Sprint\u2019s $33 billion in debt.\n\nIt is safe to say that the mathematics don\u2019t quite add up. T-Mobile and Sprint are already doing a good job threatening AT&T and Verizon with their lower prices and better contracts. The real effect of the merger will be to decrease the incentives of anyone in the industry to lower prices further and to provide plenty of new reasons to raise them. The new T-Mobile, without Sprint nipping at its heels, will surely notice that there\u2019s now nothing to stop it from adding new fees \u2014 for where, exactly, are consumers supposed to turn? Perhaps Mr. Legere, who would run the merged company, considers himself a man invulnerable to mere financial pressure, but that is quite a bet on a man who is, after all, only an employee.\n\nThe last and most absurd of the arguments for approving the merger is that it will help America \u201cwin the race to 5G\u201d (that is, to be the first to build an advanced, fifth generation network) against a shadowy Chinese and Korean menace. (The Japanese and Germans, the actual owners of Sprint and T-Mobile, are spared villainous status this time around.) The whole idea of a \u201crace\u201d is a way to lobby Congress and regulators by stoking Strangelovian fears of a \u201c5G gap.\u201d\n\nGranted, spending on infrastructure is important; but killing competitors is an irresponsible way to try and promote it.

He kept the bolts of our life together tightened, until he didn\u2019t anymore.\n\nI was scared beyond belief, and the fact that I didn\u2019t know how to keep up the shelter for myself and my children made me feel as if I had somehow failed at something. It\u2019s easy to think, well, there are a lot of places where you could have learned this stuff, Deb, but trust me when I say that I was overwhelmed. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not an uncommon feeling for women of a certain age who suddenly find themselves on their own.", "title": "Like Monday Crosswords", "authors": []}

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 for what the committee called \u201chis long and nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\u201d Ms. Liu, 57, has been under police watch ever since; like her husband, she was not allowed to go to Oslo to collect the prize.\n\nSince Mr. Liu\u2019s death, German diplomats and other supporters of Ms. Liu have been trying to arrange her move to Germany, and the German ambassador to Beijing publicly raised her case in late April.\n\nThe Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said repeatedly that Ms. Liu is free to move as she pleases. Yet her requests to leave her house have been frustrated, friends of Ms. Liu have said.\n\nIn the first months of this year, Ms. Liu held to the hope that she and her brother, Liu Hui, would be allowed to leave China after a succession of sensitive political events, including a legislative meeting that abolished term limits on China\u2019s presidency, said Hu Jia, a longtime dissident in Beijing who said he has kept in indirect contact with Ms. Liu through friends and relatives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe authorities led her to believe that after the legislative meeting, her problems would be addressed,\u201d Mr. Hu said by telephone.

Why go on writing those things again and again?\u201d Ms. Liu says in the account of the phone call that Ms. Liao issued. \u201cI have nowhere to send things, no mobile phone, no computer.\u201d\n\nThe German Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that German officials would continue talking with the Chinese government about Ms. Liu. The State Department has also repeatedly called for her to be allowed to move freely.\n\n\u201cWe have no information that Liu Xia has been accused of a committing a crime in China, and she should therefore be allowed to travel for humanitarian reasons,\u201d the German ministry said in a statement released Thursday. \u201cShould Liu Xia want to come to Germany, she would always be welcome.\u201d\n\nMs. Liu\u2019s limbo reflects the growing reluctance of Western governments to press for concessions from Beijing on human rights, especially the treatment of Chinese people imprisoned or confined for their political activities or associations, several rights advocates said.\n\nHer confinement violated China\u2019s commitments to a United Nations Convention against Torture, as well as other international and domestic laws, said Ms. Richardson of Human Rights Watch.\n\n\u201cThe German government should now realize that it doesn\u2019t really help by quiet diplomacy,\u201d Patrick Poon, a researcher in Hong Kong with Amnesty International who has followed Ms. Liu\u2019s case, said by email. \u201cOnly public demands and pressure on the Chinese government can help in a sensitive case like Liu Xia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an open letter, the German branch of PEN, the writers group, urged the mayor of Trier, Germany, to delay the dedication of a superhero-size statue of Karl Marx donated to the city by China, until Ms. Liu was released. \u201cI am sure that this would be in the spirit of Karl Marx,\u201d as a symbol of freedom of expression, the letter read.\n\nIn the recording of Ms. Liu\u2019s call, she breaks down in choking sobs.

He sang \u201cHow Deep Is the Ocean,\u201d a romantic jazz standard, with a rascally charm, then took a trumpet solo full of subtle surprises, mixing up his phrasing, using little chromatic cuts and patterns that verged toward bop clich\u00e9 and then turned swiftly away.\n\nLater in the night, he called \u201cJazz Is a Four-Letter Word,\u201d whose title is borrowed from Max Roach\u2019s unfinished memoir. The song, which appears on his latest album, \u201cThe Afro-Caribbean Mixtape,\u201d begins with a low-lying funk undertow, then gives way to a classic swing feel during the solo section.\n\nMr. Payton came to prominence in the 1990s, when jazz\u2019s societal importance was being carefully defined and defended. But he is allergic to the notion that one kind of black music \u2014 with a particular appeal to erudite, well-heeled, often white audiences \u2014 would be more culturally salient than other forms. He\u2019s an advocate of throwing it all together: funk, Cuban grooves, city blues, early hip-hop.

Suddenly, you were on the cover of magazines and topping critics\u2019 lists. What was that like?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s weird, I realized I have a phobia of being pressed into crowds. Like a real, actual, have-to-get-out-of-the-car, have-to-leave-the-situation phobia. And I think that comes from that sudden success where, like, everyone was coming at me and I wasn\u2019t prepared for it. It\u2019s just weird because my whole adult life, then, was framed within the context of that first record.\n\nAnd here you are answering questions about it.\n\nSometimes I feel like I work for Liz Phair.

I have been placed there because there was a sense that I was the girl next door who just picked up a guitar and went onstage and said what everyone was thinking. And it felt empowering to me and it felt empowering to the people that heard it, especially the women. So, the accidental feminist spokesperson. I do get uncomfortable with the label because I feel like there are people that could be far more eloquent about it, historically so.\n\nYou\u2019ve said that album was fueled by defiance: this sense of wanting to prove wrong the people who told you that you couldn\u2019t do it. Do you still think about it that way?\n\nIt was clearly in a tussle with the sort of male-dominated music scene. Using the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d was sort of like using their avatar. I thought that was the quintessential guy rock band, you know?

And when we did run into each other, there was kind of a weird sense \u2014 and maybe this was me, because I was young and insecure \u2014 but it felt like people would pit the girls against each other. It would be like, \u201cDo you like Courtney or do you like PJ?\u201d And the sale forces, the market forces, were gross. It was like, \u201cLook hotter!

I feel like every day on Twitter I find some new female band I\u2019m interested in, and I can have my entire music diet be female songwriters and musicians, and I wouldn\u2019t come to the end of it, and I wouldn\u2019t be bored, and I wouldn\u2019t feel like I was listening to all one genre. It\u2019s so wide and diverse, just in terms of sheer numbers. But the [younger generation of] women, they don\u2019t feel that way. You know, if you ask them, they feel the way I felt, like they\u2019re isolated and pitted against each other and told to be hotter. It\u2019s just interesting. It\u2019s very different from my eyes but to them they feel like they\u2019re going through Guyville.\n\nWhat about being a woman in the music industry who is no longer in her 20s? Do you still feel the pressure to look a certain way?\n\nThat was hard in my late 30s and my early 40s because I was still sort of in that category. But the good and the bad of my age now is like, they\u2019re not even requiring that of you any more. You can do it, and I do because it\u2019s fun. But they don\u2019t really expect it. You\u2019re kind of like a \u201clegacy act.\u201d Which is just as nonsensical as any label they slap on you, but I\u2019ll take whatever breaks I can get.\n\nIn almost every interview I do now it feels like we reach the point where I have to ask about #MeToo. There\u2019s almost no instance where the person, if female, hasn\u2019t faced some type of harassment or mistreatment. What has been your experience?\n\nWell, of course not. Everybody went through it. Every single woman went through it. It\u2019s the way our entire society is structured. Everything is structured around men. We still don\u2019t pay the first lady! That blows my mind.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat do you make of this moment?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you where I\u2019m at with it. I\u2019m at the point where I don\u2019t feel like I have to do anything differently. I think it\u2019s all on men now. Like, they\u2019re just going to have to deal with it. They\u2019re going to have to do their therapy, do their thinking, do whatever they need to do \u2014 cry together, whatever the [expletive] it takes. I just don\u2019t feel that I need to help. And I\u2019m not in any way antagonistic toward men, that\u2019s the weird part. This is old, old news for me. And it just is a matter of, this isn\u2019t ours to explain to you anymore. It\u2019s common sense. Like, let them deal with it. They\u2019re the ones with the problem.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI was reading an interview you did with Elizabeth Wurtzel where she said she basically no longer consumes art created by men. Where do you stand on that?\n\nI\u2019m still interested in knowing what art is being made by men. I think there\u2019s just a natural sense that there is more to enjoy. It\u2019s like anything where we suddenly have a wider choice of options. Like, now we have so many more women to listen to and find out about and, yay. Like, more art! Great! What we really need to do is make everybody aware of what we\u2019ve done to the various parts of society that haven\u2019t had a seat at the table \u2014 and offer them a chair.\n\nMany people probably still think of you primarily as a musician, but you\u2019re working on a book. Is writing in that format different for you?\n\nIt was. Now it feels as natural to me as writing a song, but that took 10 years of writing quietly.\n\nHave you been working on this book for 10 years?\n\nNo, I\u2019ve been writing other things, but when I first decided that I wanted to write I had no clue how. Had I known it would take me 10 years to be able to write the way I want to write \u2014 and to feel like I have mastery over my writing \u2014 I never would have started. [Laughs] Too late, no turning back now.\n\nHave you always had that determination?\n\nYeah. My first words were, \u201cby self.\u201d So there was always a determined little person in there. Like, always. Never not.\n\nWhat do you hope people will take away from \u201cGuyville\u201d this time around?\n\nI want more women to log on to history. I\u2019ve always wanted that. As [expletive] as this moment is in American culture, there\u2019s something that I find very exciting and positive about it. I want, 500 years from now, people to be able to look back and learn what women were thinking, what they were feeling, what they wanted, what their lives were like.

She was warm, sympathetic, smart and direct. I loved her immediately and knew she was the one for me. Based on my earlier ultrasounds and mammogram, she told me that a bilateral mastectomy would probably be the way to go, because I had breast cancer on both sides of my family. When I flinched, she said that if I preferred, I could have a lumpectomy within the week to be certain of what was growing inside me.\n\nWhoa. It was a lot. But I loved her and I was starting to feel better. She ran additional biopsies to see if she could glean more information from the tangle of disease in my right breast. The results confirmed the original diagnosis: Stage 0, D.C.I.S.\n\nI was encouraged that the surgeon told me I probably wouldn\u2019t need chemotherapy or radiation, which in my mind were the boogeymen of cancer.\n\nBut I was about to lose both breasts. Was I supposed to get a second opinion? Do you have to if you trust your doctor and she has an incredible reputation? My surgeon was lauded all over the media and had even treated high-profile celebrities. She was by all accounts exceptional. One of the top doctors in Los Angeles, if not the country.\n\nA few friends and relatives recommended the second opinion. My G.P. said I should do it if it would give me peace of mind and she recommended a second surgeon, who was also said to be an oncology rock star.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a doctor who doesn\u2019t like that you\u2019re getting a second opinion,\u201d said my best friend\u2019s husband, who is a reconstructive plastic surgeon. \u201cShe should encourage it.\u201d\n\nMy husband and I made our way to the second surgeon a few days later. He was brief but not hurried. He took one look at my breast and said he thought there was \u201cskin involvement,\u201d which sounded scary.

He said he did and that a radiologist would do them in a couple of days.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI felt much worse after the meeting. The doctor was not aloof, but cool.

There was a small invasive tumor outside the milk ducts and it was positive for estrogen, progesterone and something called HER2. That last one is the doozy, the ingredient that made the tumor especially aggressive.\n\nThat was the bad news. The \u201cgood\u201d news was that there was a targeted therapy to treat a HER2 positive tumor, but the Food and Drug Administration had approved it only for use before surgery.\n\nI circled back to the first surgeon. \u201cWell, that was a curveball,\u201d she said. But she said the tumor was small enough that I still might not need chemo and that surgery soon would help determine exactly what was happening in there.\n\nGah! What to do. Doctor 1\u2019s proposed path seemed cleaner, easier. Doctor 2\u2019s was a nightmare of chemo, hair loss, all manner of side effects, followed by major surgery and possibly radiation.\n\nI sat with it for a couple of weeks, and visited three medical oncologists to get their opinions. They all agreed that it was best to do chemo before, to avoid a major fight with the insurance company and to see how the tumor responded to the drugs. They all emphasized that the size was irrelevant with HER2 tumors since they are so aggressive.\n\nI chose option 2. There followed many rough months of toxic drug infusions, quelled by acupuncture and (thank you, California!) medical cannabis.\n\nMy choice was validated when the giant tumor reduced significantly with chemo. D.C.I.S. does not typically respond to chemo, so there must have been far more \u201cinvasion,\u201d as they call it, than the biopsies showed.\n\nI still had to have a mastectomy because of how much D.C.I.S. remained after chemo (I chose to remove both breasts because of my family history; I didn\u2019t want to have to wonder when it would occur on the healthy side). I also had to undergo radiation, so it was no cake walk, but I was able to enter each treatment phase secure in the knowledge that I had chosen the path that was right for me and held the fewest surprises.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYes, I had cancer, but I now know how lucky I was. I had good health insurance and, not without some steep costs, could choose whichever doctor I wanted. So many women are hemmed in by policy and financial restrictions that make it difficult to find the very best oncologist for them. It\u2019s heartbreaking to hear their stories. I\u2019ve heard many of them in my cancer support group.\n\nAnd many of those same women had similar misgivings about the second opinion: that they might offend the first doctor, or that they were simply too stunned or depressed to contemplate \u201cshopping around\u201d for doctors. And it was a slog, both exhausting and expensive. Once I got started, I pursued second or third opinions for my medical oncologist, plastic surgeon and radiation oncologist.\n\nAnd I learned that when your life may be at stake, you may appreciate warmth and friendliness, but that is not what you\u2019re shopping for.", "title": "Love Your Cancer Doctor?

They should be accessible to all.\u201d\n\nThe focus on the Harlem River crossings comes as cycling is booming in New York City, with bike routes being expanded and commuters and tourists alike hopping onto a fleet of Citi Bikes to get around. It follows two decades of similar efforts by the city to transform the East River bridges into pedestrian and cycling connections. On the Brooklyn Bridge alone, there are now an average of 13,196 pedestrian and 3,157 cyclist crossings on a weekday.\n\nMs. Trottenberg said that the plan for the Harlem River crossings was developed with input from residents in Manhattan and the Bronx who have long chafed at the difficulties of crossing the river. She said the department has already started making improvements to East 138th Street in the Bronx, which joins with the Madison Avenue Bridge, and streets around other bridges, and would gradually install the new bike lanes on the bridges themselves as they come up for rehabilitation.\n\nThe plan is estimated to cost more than $90 million, which will be covered in part by funding for existing programs, city transportation officials said. The first bike lanes will be completed on the Broadway and 145th Street bridges by 2021.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nNivardo Lopez, 36, the transportation department\u2019s Bronx commissioner, said that when he was growing up in that borough, he used to go to Manhattan every week to visit relatives and friends, and to shop and eat along Dyckman Street. Though he lived near the University Heights and Broadway bridges, back then it never even occurred to him to walk. \u201cThose bridges are what connect these communities, and for years, cars were the only safe way to cross,\u201d he said.\n\nGale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, said that the crossings not only provided a free alternative to subways and buses for those on a tight budget, but were also better for the environment and gave people another chance to squeeze in some exercise. \u201cWe should be walking, we should be bicycling, as opposed to getting in a car or subway,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be healthier. We\u2019ll live longer.\u201d\n\nThe Madison Avenue Bridge, which was built in 1910, takes its name from a Manhattan street synonymous with the city\u2019s advertising industry and tony designer boutiques.

The New York Post reported that Harvey attended the opening of a restaurant in Beverly Hills last Thursday night, squeezing in a party between that afternoon\u2019s game in St. Louis and the next night\u2019s game in San Diego.\n\nHarvey gave up a home run in the San Diego game, his third appearance since the Mets removed him from the rotation. The Mets beat the Padres that night, 5-1, and Harvey pitched another inning on Sunday, without allowing a run.\n\n\u201cHe walked me through the circumstances; it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it definitely didn\u2019t interfere with the way he was going to pitch the next day,\u201d Callaway said on Tuesday. \u201cIf he struggles \u2014 I thought he had a decent outing; he gave up a solo homer, but everybody gives up one of those \u2014 it\u2019s because he\u2019s inexperienced in the bullpen in trying to get loose.\u201d\n\nCallaway is new to the Mets, so he did not have to deal with a more egregious version of this story last spring. That was when Harvey stayed out too late in Manhattan on Cinco de Mayo, a Friday, golfed the next morning and never showed up to the ballpark for Saturday night\u2019s game. The Mets suspended him and essentially forfeited their Sunday game, summoning an overmatched replacement, Adam Wilk, to New York on an overnight flight from Las Vegas. The predictable loss went on Wilk\u2019s record, but it should have been charged to Harvey.\n\nEven so, Harvey\u2019s statistics since the start of the 2016 season have been unsightly enough: a 9-19 record with a 5.78 earned run average in 210 1/3 innings. In fairness, Harvey threw more innings than that in 2015 alone, including the postseason, when he worked into the ninth inning of the last World Series game, risking his health in his first full season after Tommy John surgery to try to lift the Mets to a title.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Harvey has squandered it, and the new regime of Callaway and the no-nonsense pitching coach, Dave Eiland, have no investment in his past.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the best-case scenario, Harvey could be like Carlos Carrasco or Danny Duffy, starters who made a temporary move to the bullpen under Callaway (in Cleveland) and Eiland (in Kansas City), and emerged better for it. But Harvey resisted the move initially, brooding about the decision and snapping at reporters for asking about his first relief appearance.\n\nOn Tuesday \u2014 before deGrom\u2019s injury \u2014 General Manager Sandy Alderson had said that Harvey\u2019s \u201conly way back to the rotation is through the bullpen,\u201d and succeeding in that role. He insisted Harvey knew what he had to do.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more of a meeting of the minds today than there was a week ago,\u201d Alderson added.\n\nHarvey has pitched only once in relief at Citi Field, late last September when the Mets were 20 games under .500. He was still a starter then, basically, working four innings after Noah Syndergaard had pitched the first, two pitching pillars salvaging something from a lost season.\n\nSyndergaard has been strong again this year. Harvey has not. That is understandable; he had thoracic outlet syndrome in 2016 and shoulder trouble last year, and cannot be expected to recapture all of his past glory. But Harvey\u2019s pitch usage is more puzzling. At his best, in 2013 and 2015, Harvey used his fastball and slider 75 percent of the time. Now he uses them even more \u2014 nearly 87 percent of the time \u2014 despite the fact that both are slower than ever.\n\nWe still don\u2019t really know how Harvey will do as a reliever; he has pitched three times from the bullpen, allowing two runs in four innings. After the game in San Diego last Friday, before the Page Six revelation, he pledged to reporters, \u201cIt\u2019s a learning process and I\u2019m just trying to do everything I can.\u201d Fair enough, but Harvey\u2019s words have been empty before.\n\nAttending an event in Beverly Hills, between games in different cities, is obviously no crime. If Harvey were still a star, nobody would care about it. But he is 29 years old, with six years in the majors, and the Mets shouldn\u2019t have to wonder about his priorities anymore.\n\n\u201cIt can be a problem,\u201d Alderson said, referring to incidents like last week\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was in this case. But the other thing is, Matt has to understand that people always notice what he does.\u201d\n\nAlderson said Harvey would probably learn from this, but that is also what the Mets hoped last May, after the suspension \u2014 and here they are again. Someone asked Alderson if he was upset by the Page Six report. His wry response was telling.\n\n\u201cUsually I get upset if a report is unexpected,\u201d Alderson said. \u201cSo, I guess the short answer is no.\u201d", "title": "Matt Harvey Comes to a Crossroads With the Mets", "authors": ["Tyler Kepner", "On Baseball"]}

I don\u2019t think anybody does.\u201d\n\nBoras has never definitively linked the injuries to Harvey\u2019s workload in 2015, and did not do so on Friday. But Harvey was 27-18 with a 2.56 earned run average through the World Series, and 9-19 with a 5.93 E.R.A. thereafter. His strikeouts per nine innings plunged from 9.4 to 6.9.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Mets had hoped Harvey\u2019s stuff would improve in shorter bursts as a reliever.

And I think it became obvious that maybe that wasn\u2019t the case with Matt.\u201d\n\nThat part of this saga is on Harvey. Maybe it was insecurity, or maybe misplaced victimhood. But Harvey never warmed to the assignment, never trusted that what worked for Carlos Carrasco in Cleveland, where Callaway previously coached, could also work for him.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Roy Halladay and Cliff Lee were established major leaguers before tumbling to Class A for a thorough reset. Lee turned 29 the year he did it, in 2007, and won a Cy Young Award the next season. Harvey, who is 29 now, was not moved by the examples.\n\nBoras, in a text message, said Harvey needs to be a starter so he can work on all four pitches, instead of two, as a reliever typically does. Boras said he was pleased Harvey was healthy and throwing hard enough to compete. Some team will surely give him a chance.\n\nAlderson said the Mets saw a demotion as \u201cour only real option to create a change of scenery,\u201d having already tried with the bullpen role and with a new manager and pitching coach, Dave Eiland. But Callaway and Eiland had no investment in Harvey\u2019s past, no reason to enable a would-be superhero who kept wishing for his old tool belt.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we failed Matt Harvey,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cOur job is to help the player, and it\u2019s not a good feeling when you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarvey gave the Mets everything he had when they needed him most.

His sire, Scat Daddy, was a multiple Grade 1 winner on dirt. Beholder, his half sister, staged a brilliant display of stamina as the first female to win the mile-and-a-quarter Pacific Classic with an 8 1/4-length romp in 2015.

Why, or why not?\n\n_________\n\nActivity\n\nPhoto\n\nNow that students are familiar with how The Upshot\u2019s interactive data visualization tool works, they will use it to explore and collect data in response to this single question:\n\nHow likely is it for poor children from different backgrounds to achieve improved economic status as adults?\n\nBefore students begin exploring the data, ask them to record some of their intuitions about the question above. For example, what are students\u2019 estimates about the following:\n\n\u2022 What percentage of poor boys do students believe will escape poverty in adulthood?\n\n\u2022 Do they think that poor boys and poor girls have an equal chance of improving their economic status?\n\n\u2022 How will poor children from different races compare?\n\nEstimating these percentages before the investigation begins helps establish context for later findings. In addition, these estimates create opportunities for potential discussion about the differences between our prior beliefs and what the data suggests.\n\nThe data collection work can be divided up among individuals or small groups. Each group can be assigned one or two specific categories, like \u201cHispanic children\u201d or \u201cAsian-American boys,\u201d and then can use the data visualization tool to find and record the data. Students can compare each group with itself (by selecting the same group twice in the tool) for a simpler visual result, or they can compare two groups at once and collect two sets of data. For consistency in the initial project, have each group select \u201cpoor\u201d households, \u201chousehold\u201d incomes, and \u201call kinds of mothers, including immigrants.\u201d\n\nStudents can then watch the animation as the data on their selected groups is displayed. It takes around a minute for the animation to finish and display the final data, at which point the percentages of children who ended up as poor, lower-middle-class, middle-class, upper-middle class and rich adults will be displayed at the right. Have students record all the data on their selected group or groups.\n\nAfter the data has been collected, have students compute the percentage of poor children in their category who end up improving their economic status as adults. This will be the sum of the percentages of the other categories: lower-middle-class, middle-class, upper-middle-class and rich. (Or equivalently, 100 percent minus the percentage who remain poor as adults.) This percentage is a simple measure of upward economic mobility: It is the likelihood that a child from a given background will be better off economically in adulthood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce students have collected and computed these numbers for each category represented in the study, post the full results for the class to examine. Have students compare and contrast the various data, and have them write down any questions they have. For example:\n\n\u2022 Why are some categories more likely than others to improve their economic status?\n\n\u2022 Why are the percentages different for girls and boys?\n\nHave the students revisit their initial intuitions for further comparisons: In what ways did the data meet, or defy, their expectations? What does the data have to say about America as the land of opportunity?\n\nAfter a class discussion of observations and questions, students can read this follow-up Times Reader Center piece, \u201c\u2018When I See Racial Disparities, I See Racism.\u2019 Discussing Race, Gender and Mobility,\u201d in which experts answer reader questions about the study, the data and the realities of economic mobility in America.\n\nStudents can also read the original, more extensive article, above, or here: \u201cExtensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys,\u201d about some of the most important findings from the study.\n\nThey can also explore further information, if they like, at the Equality of Opportunity Project website.\n\n_________\n\nGoing Further\n\nOnce the introductory activity and readings are completed, students can pose new research questions about economic mobility and use The Upshot\u2019s visualization tool to collect the relevant data. Students could explore questions such as:\n\n\u2022 Do men and women have equal economic mobility?\n\n\u2022 How stable are middle-class Americans across different demographic groups?\n\n\u2022 Which Americans are most likely to get rich?\n\nAlso, by changing the appropriate settings, students can attempt to isolate the specific impact that personal income (as opposed to household income) or first-generation immigrant status (by considering children of native-born mothers exclusively) has on economic outcomes.\n\nA more complex measure of upward economic mobility could be developed using the full set of outcomes for each category. Students could research and assign a representative income to each economic level. For example, a household income for a poor adult could be set to $12,500 based on the mean household income level in 2015 for the lowest quartile. Using the same Tax Policy Center table, a household income for a lower-middle-class adult could be set to $32,500 \u2014 though these figures do not necessarily correspond to the income levels used in the study. From these representative income levels, a resulting income can be computed as a composite weighted average of all the possible outcomes. This would allow for comparisons to be made in dollars, rather than simply as movement up or down rungs of the economic ladder.\n\nFinally, students might also like to explore the geography of economic mobility using the Upshot interactive \u201cThe Best and Worst Places to Grow Up: How Your Area Compares,\u201d which displays income data for every county in the United States.\n\nHave students investigate their own cities and states or explore bigger-picture questions such as:\n\n\u2022 Where do poor Americans have the best opportunity to improve their economic status?\n\n\u2022 Where are the differences in economic mobility between boys and girls the largest?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n_________\n\nAdditional Times Resources\n\nThe Polk Family\u2019s Quest for a Better Life\n\nAn Atlas of Upward Mobility Shows Paths Out of Poverty\n\nWhy the New Research on Mobility Matters: An Economist\u2019s View\n\nThe Learning Network | Economic Inequality in America: Developing a New War on Poverty", "title": "Moving On Up: Teaching With the Data of Economic Mobility", "authors": ["Patrick Honner"]}

Mr. Mueller would like to ask Mr. Trump whether he had any discussions during the campaign about any meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and whether he spoke to others about either American sanctions against Russia or meeting with Mr. Putin.\n\nThrough his questions, Mr. Mueller also tries to tease out Mr. Trump\u2019s views on law enforcement officials and whether he sees them as independent investigators or people who should loyally protect him.\n\nFor example, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was fired, the White House said he broke with Justice Department policy and spoke publicly about the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server. Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions put that statement to the test. He wants to ask why, time and again, Mr. Trump expressed no concerns with whether Mr. Comey had abided by policy. Rather, in statements in private and on national television, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Comey was fired because of the Russia investigation.\n\nMany of the questions surround Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Mr. Sessions, including the attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and whether Mr. Trump told Mr. Sessions he needed him in place for protection.\n\nMr. Mueller appears to be investigating how Mr. Trump took steps last year to fire Mr. Mueller himself. The president relented after the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to resign, an episode that the special counsel wants to ask about.\n\n\u201cWhat consideration and discussions did you have regarding terminating the special counsel in June of 2017?\u201d Mr. Mueller planned to ask, according to the list of questions. \u201cWhat did you think and do in reaction to Jan. 25, 2018, story about the termination of the special counsel and Don McGahn backing you off the termination?\u201d he planned to ask, referring to the Times article that broke the news of the confrontation.\n\nMr. Mueller has sought for months to question the president, who has in turn expressed a desire, at times, to be interviewed, viewing it as an avenue to end the inquiry more quickly. His lawyers have been negotiating terms of an interview out of concern that their client \u2014 whose exaggerations, half-truths and outright falsehoods are well documented \u2014 could provide false statements or easily become distracted.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "On Monday, The Times gave us the first glimpse of 49 questions the special counsel Robert Mueller could ask President Trump, as told to Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team during negotiations for an interview. The questions reveal the topics Mr. Mueller believes could lead to potential liability for the president and help explain why Trump\u2019s team has urged him not to agree to an interview.\n\nLast night, we learned that the specific questions were actually created by a Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow, his interpretation of 16 specific subjects presented by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team. Mr. Sekulow broke down the subjects and subtopics into the separate questions. This explains why Mr. Trump\u2019s team had these questions \u2014 it would be highly unusual for a prosecutor to give a witness questions in advance, but it is fairly common for a prosecutor to preview potential topics for a defense attorney before an interview. For that reason, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that Mr. Sekulow\u2019s questions track what Mr. Mueller\u2019s team wants to cover in an interview.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s team plans to use the questions to attack the special counsel as \u201coverreaching\u201d and going \u201cbeyond his mandate,\u201d but the questions themselves suggest that Mr. Mueller has carefully stayed within his bounds. They contain nothing about obscure business deals or real estate transactions; the questions focus on coordination with Russia, obstruction of justice and topics that have been covered at length in the news media. None of the topics should have come as a surprise to Mr. Trump\u2019s team, aside from an explosive question about efforts by the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to seek aid from the Kremlin, which is squarely about coordination with Russia.\n\nWhat should concern Mr. Trump\u2019s team is how the questions zero in on Mr. Trump\u2019s criminal liability. They leave little doubt that Mr. Trump is in serious jeopardy, particularly regarding obstruction of justice. I concluded months ago that Mr. Mueller would likely determine that the president obstructed justice, but the questions show that Mr. Mueller has already thought about how he would prove his case. The queries ask about Mr. Trump\u2019s state of mind when he fired James Comey, when he erupted in anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and when he considered firing the special counsel. The questions are intended to prove the case against Mr. Trump through his own words.", "title": "Opinion | Mueller\u2019s Questions Point to What Trouble Trump Is In", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "As a matter of politics, the latest contradictions may not matter much, at least not yet. The public to some extent has grown accustomed to the factual deviations or written them off as unimportant. Just this week, Mr. Trump surpassed 3,000 false or misleading claims since taking office, according to a running tally by The Washington Post \u2014 an average of 6.5 per day.\n\nA poll released this week by NBC News and SurveyMonkey found that 61 percent of Americans had already concluded that the president tells the truth only some of the time or less. But even among the Republicans who question Mr. Trump\u2019s honesty, most still support him, according to the survey.\n\nAnd to be sure, not every misleading statement is equally meaningful. In March, The New York Times reported that Mr. Trump was in discussions to hire Emmet T. Flood, a veteran Washington lawyer.\n\nMr. Trump reacted angrily. \u201cThe Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cWrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.\u201d Mr. Dowd resigned 11 days later. Mr. Cobb announced his resignation this week. He will be replaced by Mr. Flood.\n\nUnder the unforgiving glare of federal prosecutors, however, misrepresentations carry far greater jeopardy. In nearly a year on the case, Mr. Mueller has shown that he is more than willing to charge associates of Mr. Trump with lying to investigators; independent lawyers have said it would be reckless for the president\u2019s lawyers to allow him to be interviewed. Even supporters who maintain that Mr. Trump is essentially a truth teller acknowledge that he can be loose with details.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, it is about creating a narrative that suits his desired image, and dictating the terms of his own life \u2014 in media coverage, in his business, in politics, even in his medical care. But he now risks losing his grip on the story line he has long sought to control, in part because of his own treatment of associates like his doctor and the lawyer who paid the porn star.\n\nThis week\u2019s revelation about the true origin of the doctor\u2019s statement may not have surprised many. When Dr. Harold N. Bornstein released a letter in December 2015 saying that Mr. Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,\u201d few believed it was authentic. It contained the exact language about \u201cstrength and stamina\u201d that the candidate often used to describe himself.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Bornstein confirmed this week that Mr. Trump had dictated the letter, a disclosure that stemmed from his own split with the president. After he told The Times last year that Mr. Trump used hair-loss medicine, the president was angry and embarrassed, according to aides. Mr. Trump, who often calculates the risks of angering people who know intimate details about him, did not express his frustration publicly. But he sent aides to seize his medical records from Dr. Bornstein, who felt burned enough by the incident to break his silence.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Trump has to worry about whether his brusque treatment of his longtime lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, might come back to hurt him. Mr. Cohen, now facing an investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, originally said that he made the $130,000 payment to the porn actress, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, from a home equity line of credit and that he was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization or campaign.\n\nMr. Trump, asked by reporters on Air Force One last month whether he knew about the payment to Ms. Clifford, said \u201cno.\u201d He likewise said he did not know where the money came from.\n\nBut in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor now serving as a lawyer for the president, said Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the money.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Sign Up You agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services. Thank you for subscribing. An error has occurred. Please try again later. View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nIn a follow-up interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump did not actually learn the specifics until recently. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know the details of this until we knew the details of this, which was a couple weeks ago,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cMaybe not even a couple \u2014 maybe 10 days ago.\u201d\n\nMr. Giuliani seemed less concerned with explaining Mr. Trump\u2019s previous denial than with emphasizing that it was the candidate\u2019s personal money and therefore could not be a violation of campaign finance law. He said the payment to Ms. Clifford as part of a nondisclosure agreement was made in October 2016 only to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s family from a false allegation, not to influence the election less than two weeks later.\n\nWhile others might think paying $130,000 to someone who was making a false allegation was hard to fathom, for a wealthy man like Mr. Trump it was not quite \u201cpocket change, but it\u2019s pretty close to it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.\n\n\u201cWhen Cohen heard $130,000, he said: \u2018My God, this is cheap \u2014 they come cheap. Let me get the thing signed up and signed off,\u2019\u201d Mr. Giuliani added.\n\nThe disclosure prompted a message of vindication from Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti. \u201cWe predicted months ago that it would be proven that the American people had been lied to as to the $130k payment and what Mr. Trump knew, when he knew it and what he did in connection with it,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cEvery American, regardless of their politics, should be outraged by what we have now learned. Mr. Trump stood on AF1 and blatantly lied.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his Wednesday night interview, Mr. Giuliani also offered a different reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire James B. Comey as F.B.I. director last year. When Mr. Trump first announced the dismissal, he explained it by saying that Mr. Comey was \u201cnot able to effectively lead the bureau\u201d and cited memos criticizing his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. The next day, Mr. Trump told Lester Holt on NBC News that he would have fired Mr. Comey regardless of the memos and that he had the Russia investigation on his mind.\n\nOn Fox News, Mr. Giuliani attributed the decision to Mr. Comey\u2019s refusal to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in the Russia investigation. \u201cHe fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn\u2019t a target of the investigation,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. Since then, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office has told the White House that Mr. Trump is a subject, though not a target, of the investigation.\n\nMr. Giuliani told The Times that he had consulted with Mr. Trump before and after making the revelation about the $130,000 payment on Wednesday night, and the president posted a series of messages on Twitter on Thursday morning that read as if drafted by a lawyer to elaborate.\n\nBut some still wondered whether it was an unscripted comment, especially given that it came up almost casually at the end of a long interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have a long and deep relationship. The former mayor has the president\u2019s ear \u2014 and understands how to communicate with him \u2014 in a way that few others do.\n\nStill, Mr. Giuliani is a former big city mayor accustomed to being an executive, and his ability to simply carry out orders without adding his own flair has always been in question.\n\nEither way, the last few days have shown that Mr. Trump\u2019s narrative is now at least in part in the hands of others \u2014 his lawyers, his friends, his doctor, his accuser\u2019s lawyer, even his investigators. And for a man who prefers to craft his own story line, that is not a comfortable situation.", "title": "New Revelations Suggest a President Losing Control of His Narrative", "authors": ["Peter Baker"]}

When the actor Andre Royo won the part of Bubbles on HBO\u2019s show \u201cThe Wire,\u201d he was at a loss. Bubbles is a heroin addict, and Royo had no idea how to play that level of compulsive need. The actor walked all over Baltimore, speaking with addicts, looking for characteristic behaviors that he might use to signal addiction to TV viewers: twitches, gestures, habits, tells. \u201cI was looking for a gimmick,\u201d Royo admitted. Before long, he realized that this was only a shortcut. There was no universal signifier of addiction. \u201cEverybody was different,\u201d he said.\n\nSo Royo approached things more creatively: \u201cI started studying myself.\u201d\n\nWhat was Andre Royo, the actor, addicted to in his own life? Every day, as soon as he walked in his front door, he automatically turned on the TV. He hadn\u2019t thought of this as an addiction, but there it was. So he cut himself off. For 30 days, he walked in the door and didn\u2019t touch the TV. That\u2019s how he realized what addiction really felt like \u2014 not an abstraction, but a persistent in-your-face need. \u201cI\u2019d be pacing around the living room trying to think about, What if I turned on the TV just once and turn it off real quick?\u201d he told Abrams. Instead of giving in, Royo wrote down his feelings. In the end, it helped lead him to Bubbles.\n\nThis is a nice reminder that the tools we need \u2014 for empathy, creativity, productivity, knowledge, perspective, happiness, inner peace, whatever \u2014 are often much closer than we think.", "title": "New Sentences: From \u2018All the Pieces Matter: The Inside Story of \u201cThe Wire\u201d\u2019", "authors": ["Sam Anderson", "New Sentences"]}

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "By the mid-20th century, however, racial lynching had decreased significantly in large part because of the decline of the cotton-based economy out of which segregation grew, the repeated threat of federal anti-lynching legislation (though of the nearly 200 bills introduced in Congress in the first half of the century not one became law), and the political mobilization by African-Americans again these heinous acts, culminating in the civil rights movement. In turn, lynching transformed from a material reality to a political metaphor.\n\nOne way the metaphor was used was to condemn prosecution and news media coverage of African-American men who were accused of sexual assault. (Of course, there continued to be black men falsely accused of, and unjustly imprisoned for, the rapes of white women, as in the case of the Central Park Five.) But it was also used to dismiss black women who were often the victims of assaults. And it was effective, because it was so hard to challenge.\n\nBy the \u201990s, the metaphor was cemented in the American consciousness. So much so that Clarence Thomas\u2019s declaration that his confirmation hearings had morphed into \u201ca high-tech lynching\u201d because of Anita Hill\u2019s sexual harassment accusations all but guaranteed his appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\nLast week saw the opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala. Against the backdrop of the more than 4,000 victims of racial terror recognized there, the comments by Mr. Kelly and Mr. Cosby\u2019s defenders are particularly offensive. How dare they liken the more than 50 women who have accused Mr. Cosby and the dozens who have accused Mr. Kelly to racist lynch mobs?\n\nTheir use of the lynching metaphor is doubly egregious because it ignores the other part of Wells\u2019s original formulation: When a black woman is raped, she said, \u201cit is different,\u201d a crime \u201cfor which nobody is lynched and no notice is taken.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | No, Bill Cosby and R.

Along Route 25A, in its uptown commercial hub, are supermarkets, banks and restaurants, as well as the Britannia Yachting Center, a collection of marine shops, dining options and a marina on the southern end of Northport Harbor.\n\nBranching off from 25A, Woodbine Avenue and Main Street run steeply downhill to the downtown and harbor. The 11768 Northport ZIP code extends to a potpourri of beachfront houses along the isthmus of Asharoken village, separating Northport Bay from Long Island Sound, and Eatons Neck, a hamlet of sprawling lawns and large homes. East of downtown is the sylvan hamlet of Fort Salonga.\n\nThe Northport VA Medical Center and the nine-hole Northport Golf Course are south of 25A. The private Northport Yacht Club, on Bluff Point Road, has a waiting list.\n\nAccording to census data, Northport village has a population of about 7,300 and a median household income of $115,968.\n\nWhat You\u2019ll Pay\n\nOn April 20, there were 126 houses on the market. The highest priced, at $3,395,000, was a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom waterfront house built in 2009, on 1.6 acres; at the low end was a three-bedroom, one-bathroom 1967 ranch house on a quarter of an acre, listed at $419,000.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor the year ending April 20, sale prices were up 8 percent over the same period a year earlier, said Oksana Foster, an associate broker with Signature Premier Properties, who attributed the increase to a lack of inventory.\n\nThe median sale price was $647,500, compared to $599,999 during the same time period a year earlier, Ms. Foster said, citing Multiple Listing Service data. Some 225 houses were sold \u2014 48 more than in the previous year. They also moved more quickly, she said, with an average of 86 days on the market, or 10 days fewer than a year earlier.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn early April, there were 28 offers on an 1890 Victorian, which eventually sold for $100,000 over the $569,000 asking price, said Dee Donovan, a saleswoman with Daniel Gale Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. \u201cHouses priced properly are getting multiple offers and selling right away.\u201d\n\nReal estate in the village has always had \u201ca premium\u201d of 5 to 15 percent, Ms. Taylor of Douglas Elliman said. But in recent years, more couples from the city have been buying weekend and summer homes in Northport, said Lynda Olita, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman.

Commuters can also pick up the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s Port Jefferson line at the Northport station, in East Northport. The 6:18 a.m. direct peak train pulls into Penn Station an hour and two minutes later; trains that require a transfer in Jamaica take longer. The monthly fare is $350.\n\nThe History\n\nBeginning in the 18th century, coastwise sailing vessels plied the waters of Northport\u2019s sheltered deep harbor to bring farm products and timber to New York City and other destinations, said Steven King, the village historian. In 1798, a public landing was established to boost commerce. Shortly afterward, several shipwrights began working along the eastern shore, and by 1840, shipbuilding had become the community\u2019s dominant activity, prospering for the next three decades.\n\nAs metal hulls and steamships replaced wooden vessels powered by sail, the shipyards faltered. For a while, they built oyster boats and pleasure yachts, but by 1920 the yards were being used for coal and lumber storage. Hoping to revitalize the area, the town fathers bought the land in 1928, and the Northport Village Park, with its community bandstand, was dedicated in 1933.", "title": "Northport, N.Y.: Old-Time Charm in a Waterfront Village", "authors": ["Marcelle Sussman Fischler", "Living In"]}

Ziegler sought a horse for the Derby, the opening leg of the Triple Crown, Panza was seeking one for the Belmont Stakes, the final leg. Both were attempting to tap into the world\u2019s leader in wagering handle.\n\nIn 2015, Japan changed its laws to allow Japanese fans to gamble on 24 internationally significant races, a move that increased wagering there to $22.5 billion. For the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe, Japanese fans bet about $38 million, more on that one race than France\u2019s handle on the entire Arc program.\n\nThe Japanese government does not permit foreign races to be simulcast there without a starter from Japan, leading Ziegler and Panza to pack their bags. Their combined efforts were in vain, for reasons beyond anyone\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cThis year, it just didn\u2019t work out,\u201d Panza said. \u201cTheir 3-year-old dirt horses probably weren\u2019t strong enough to make it happen.\u201d\n\nChurchill Downs created an annual path for a Japan-based horse after Lani became only the second such starter in Derby history in 2016. He qualified by winning the U.A.E. Derby in Dubai, part of the Road to the Kentucky Derby available to all horses in their bid to advance to a field limited to 20. Lani finished ninth. His predecessor, Ski Captain, ran 14th in 1995.\n\n[READ MORE: Here\u2019s What You Need to Know About the Kentucky Derby]\n\nLani\u2019s experience underscored some issues horses can face, although his experience might be extreme because of his high-strung personality. The temperamental colt did not react well to the track\u2019s hustle and bustle in the days preceding the race and sometimes startled onlookers by exhibiting visually studdish behavior.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe Derby week atmosphere was not preferred by Lani,\u201d said Keita Tanaka. \u201cWe should have kept him somewhere else, quieter with fewer horses.\u201d Tanaka serves as racing manager for Koji Maeda, who owned Lani before retiring him. Lani was shipped to New York and housed in a boarded-up stall at Belmont Park after the Derby. He responded to those calmer, if dark, surroundings by running fifth in the 1 3/16-mile Preakness at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore and third in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes.\n\nPhoto\n\nAccording to Tanaka, Lani\u2019s experience was generally encouraging to thoroughbred owners in Japan. \u201cWe may have some possibility to have a winner in either the Preakness or the Belmont, where fields are always smaller than the Derby, in the next few years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the Derby, where the best 20 3-year-old horses gather every year, I must say it is extremely tough.\u201d\n\nThe Derby represents the utmost challenge for any still-maturing thoroughbred, regardless of origin. History underscores, though, how much sterner that challenge can be when it begins with an exhausting trek to entirely unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nThunder Snow won the U.A.E. Derby last year to advance to the Run for the Roses. The biggest race of his young career was over before it started. Perhaps undone by the combination of a raucous crowd, a large field and a sloppy track, he broke poorly and began bucking soon after leaving the starting gate. Jockey Christophe Soumillon received assistance from an outrider to bring his rattled mount under control. Thunder Snow went on to prove his quality when he won the Dubai World Cup on March 31, nearly a year after his monumental Derby failure.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He also pointed to a difference in racing styles.\n\nSmith said of success in the Derby: \u201cYou need a good one who really handles the dirt and, importantly, can break. Europeans break in their own time usually and come through. In the States, it\u2019s all about gate speed on dirt. The worry will always be that a lot of ours will find it all happening too quickly.\u201d\n\nMendelssohn hopes to avoid that fate, not to mention that of Thunder Snow. He qualified as an 18 1/2-length winner of the U.A.E.

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "This week, three reviews document the history and legacy of Broadway. In 1922, Robert Edmond Jones, a leader in American stage design, reviewed \u201cThe Theatre of Tomorrow\u201d by Kenneth Macgowan and considered the role of theater in everyday life. Read an excerpt below:\n\nMr. Macgowan has attempted to combine in one volume a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the so-called \u201cnew stagecraft,\u201d a survey of that theatre of our time and a forecast of its probable development in the future.\n\nThe book considered in retrospect as a whole is an admirably clear, straightforward and authoritative summing up of our present-day attitude toward the theatre and its outward expression. The clarity of statement brings home to us, as we read, the organic defect of the theatre itself; the fundamental lack of what may be called the poetic attitude. The theatre described in this book is a playhouse where we may find easy, elaborate mechanism, great technical skill and resourcefulness, ready invention, charm and vividness and splendor; but the imagination, true poetic vision, the perception with Plato of \u201cthe essential character of each individual thing,\u201d there is precious little.\n\nAnd yet the poetic vision is the one thing needful to release a spiritual power, indescribably great, for the exaltation of multitudes. It is also so simple, too simple to see; just as the subtle changes of light in the rooms where we spend our lives are too simple to see. The theatre is not life; it is our escape from life, the supreme escape. We go to see plays every day, hundreds of thousands of us go every day, to lay aside for a few hours the burden and the tedium and the horrors of every day existence, to rest for a time secure in the shelter of our dreams. We are entertained or amused or diverted, and we forget. But one day there will come to our theatre a poet of excelling simplicity of heart, of infinite pity and kindness, who can lead us out and away, poor dreamers that we are, into a dream of his own creating, so pure, so real, that through the very perfection of its reality it brings us back, exalted and proud, to face the reality of the life we have left behind.", "title": "Notes From the Book Review Archives", "authors": []}

Strauss, who was employed by the university from the mid-1970s to the 1990s. Then the university widened the inquiry on Thursday after more students came forward, Chris Davey, a university spokesman, said in a statement issued Thursday.\n\nDr. Strauss died in 2005 at the age of 67.\n\n\u201cTo date, the investigative team has received confidential reports from former Ohio State varsity men student-athletes affiliated with cheerleading, fencing, football, gymnastics, ice hockey, swimming, volleyball and wrestling,\u201d Mr. Davey said. \u201cWe are sharing this information to encourage our community past and present to come forward.\u201d\n\nMr. Davey said that Dr. Strauss also worked at the medical center and student health center.\n\nThe investigation has been referred to the Columbus Division of Police and the Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office for possible criminal investigation, Mr. Davey said.

Mr. Davey said the university was unable to share the specific number of individuals who have come forward since then. \u201cThe goal of the investigation is to assess and evaluate the allegations raised by members of the Ohio State community regarding Dr. Strauss, and determine whether the university had knowledge of such allegations,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Dr. Strauss conducted several studies on sports medicine that were published in medical journals, including one on the dangerous side effects of anabolic steroids. He was quoted in several newspapers, including The New York Times in 1988, about those dangers.\n\nNews reports from the 1980s about athletes taking steroids identified Dr. Strauss as a member of the drug-screening team at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Some accounts also mentioned he had a role as a doctor for USA Wrestling, but the organization said Friday it had no record of that.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Maria Pasca, 72, the matriarch, invited me to her home to see the room where she keeps the dowry items made by women in the family over the ages. With her granddaughter serving as interpreter, the women told stories about their lives and talked about the significance of the intricately woven rugs, embroidered sheets, shirts, pillowcases and other items that filled the room, floor to ceiling. Many homes in rural areas in Romania have dedicated rooms like this, which are used only on special occasions.\n\nMy last stop of the day was Sapanta, home of the Merry Cemetery, near the Ukrainian border. In 1935, a local artist and painter, Stan Ioan Patras, began a tradition of creating brightly painted grave markers inlaid with unique and often humorous epitaphs he wrote for young and old alike. Hundreds of bright blue markers fill the cemetery, which was packed with sightseers reading the inscriptions \u2014 some humorous, some sad, but all of them to the point.\n\nI spent the night at Guesthouse Ileana ($30 a night, including breakfast) across the street from the cemetery, that the rural tourism website said organizes tours to visit weavers.

{"date": "2018-05-04 00:00:00", "text": "A barbed fable with a grisly ending about a medieval love affair, filled with savage yet powerfully sensual music, \u201cWritten on Skin\u201d provoked similarly passionate reactions in Aix-en-Provence (the French festival where it originated), London, Amsterdam, New York, Moscow, Toronto, Stockholm \u2014 nearly 100 performances in all, remarkable for a contemporary opera.\n\nThe Best of George Benjamin\n\nSix years later, Mr. Benjamin and his collaborators are preparing to do it all over again: His new opera, \u201cLessons in Love and Violence,\u201d will have its premiere at the Royal Opera House here on May 10; it opens in Amsterdam at the end of June. Mr. Benjamin conceded, phrasing things delicately, that there was \u201ca degree of expectation\u201d surrounding the premiere. But he said he was focused on the music: \u201cWhile I\u2019m writing, the precise choice of notes is what consumes me, not how they will be received.\u201d\n\nLike \u201cWritten on Skin,\u201d the new piece has been created with the playwright Martin Crimp and the director Katie Mitchell. Like \u201cWritten on Skin,\u201d it invites us to enter a world that seems, at first glance, distant \u2014 in \u201cLessons,\u201d the 14th-century English court of King Edward II, infamous for being deposed, then perhaps murdered, because of his love for a lowborn male favorite.\n\nYet, also like \u201cSkin,\u201d while the setting may seem remote, the passions are anything but. Mr. Benjamin\u2019s music surges with volatile feeling; in Mr. Crimp\u2019s libretto, the relationship between the king and Gaveston, the favorite in question, is both heady and fraught with risk.\n\nUnlike in their previous opera, which placed a tale from the early Middle Ages within a coolly contemporary frame, this time Ms. Mitchell has set the action in modern dress, in a European court that might perhaps be in session now. \u201cIt\u2019s a modern interpretation of a medieval story,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Benjamin said he had been drawn to the material by the tensions and paradoxes of Edward II\u2019s life. An apparently loving husband, by all accounts close to his children, the king nonetheless found himself drawn into a relationship with a man that, in the words of one medieval chronicler, became a \u201cindissoluble bond of love\u201d.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhether Gaveston felt the same, or was operating out of calculating self-interest, is one of many questions \u201cLessons in Love and Violence\u201d leaves open. Love may be an addictive substance, but it is also shown to be dangerous, and ultimately fatal (another echo, perhaps, of \u201cWritten on Skin,\u201d in which a married woman is forced to eat her dead lover\u2019s heart).\n\n\u201cThe boy loves his father, Queen Isabel loves her husband, and in some ways the king really does love Isabel, too,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \u201cThe big problem is that the king is intoxicated by Gaveston and cannot escape, despite the fact that it\u2019s tearing his family apart and his kingdom apart. The force of attraction, the force of compulsion, is \u2014 as it was in the real story \u2014 almost insane.\u201d\n\nUnlike other treatments of Edward\u2019s life \u2014 notably Derek Jarman\u2019s 1991 film of Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play \u201cEdward II,\u201d which turns the story into an impassioned defense of same-sex relationships \u2014 he and Mr. Crimp had no wish to editorialize. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of poster art,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said.\n\nInstead, he said, he hoped that its psychological depths and complications would come out: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ambiguity and emotional complexity.\u201d\n\nMr. Benjamin has long been regarded as one of the most abundantly talented musicians of his generation. Born in London, in 1960, he began composing at the age of 7 and studied in Paris with Olivier Messiaen and his wife, Yvonne Loriod, while still a teenager. (Messiaen compared him to Mozart.) In 1980, at 20, he became the youngest living composer to have a piece performed at the BBC Proms festival: the astonishingly assured \u201cRinged by the Horizon,\u201d which alternates shimmering textures with primitive stabs of sound.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Critics praised his chamber piece \u201cAt First Light\u201d (1982, inspired by an oil painting by Turner), which conjures the colors of the sunrise with delicate precision \u2014 gauzy clouds of strings slowly burned off by a blazing glare of brass. More recently, the two-part orchestral work \u201cPalimpsests\u201d (2002) glittered with the dazzling sonorities that have become Mr. Benjamin\u2019s hallmark, but also felt consumed by a wild, hungering energy.\n\nThere was just one problem: Good as the music was, there wasn\u2019t nearly enough of it. \u201cFor a long time, it felt almost like a burden,\u201d said Gillian Moore, a friend of Mr. Benjamin\u2019s and the director of music at the Southbank Center in London. \u201cEverything had to go through this extraordinary process of refinement and molding. He spent 25 years working incredibly slowly, trying to get everything absolutely perfect.\u201d\n\nOne breakthrough was Mr. Benjamin\u2019s discovery of electronics in the late 1980s, courtesy of Pierre Boulez\u2019s IRCAM research center in Paris, which brought about his skitteringly brilliant work \u201cAntara\u201d (1987), written for digitally sampled Peruvian panpipes and an improbable ensemble of flutes, trombones, strings and two anvils. Not long afterward, the composer met the Indian flutist Hariprasad Chaurasia, traveled to India and Sri Lanka, and became fascinated by the sonic possibilities of South Asian music.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis collaborations with other artists have seemed to release Mr. Benjamin\u2019s gifts. Since he was a child, he wanted to write operas \u2014 \u201cprobably it was a bit weird,\u201d he said, laughing \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t find the right musical language, still less a like-minded librettist.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter more than two decades interviewing writers of all kinds, he had almost abandoned the art form when a colleague suggested he meet Mr. Crimp, an experimental playwright whose terse and precise dramas had \u2014 so the colleague thought \u2014 an affinity with Mr. Benjamin\u2019s music. The hunch proved right: Just 16 months after an exploratory meeting, their first opera, a miniaturized retelling of the Pied Piper myth called \u201cInto the Little Hill,\u201d was onstage in London.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about his words that brings music for me,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \u201cThere\u2019s torrential emotion and force and violence, but at the same time this crystalline, bejeweled structure.\u201d\n\nMr. Crimp said: \u201cGeorge\u2019s music has a combination of sensuousness and intellectual rigor; those are the two things that go together. George doesn\u2019t like me saying this because he thinks it\u2019s over-flattering, but that\u2019s something I love about Bach, too.\u201d\n\nMr. Benjamin was quick to point out that it wasn\u2019t that he now found composing easy. \u201cIt\u2019s still sort of impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cLessons in Love and Violence\u201d has taken him just over two and a half years \u2014 roughly the same as \u201cWritten on Skin\u201d \u2014 and required him to adopt hermit-like solitude, abandoning teaching and performing commitments and barely leaving his house.\n\nBefore putting pen to paper, he scheduled individual workshops with the singers, making detailed notes before retreating to write. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of meeting of music souls, is the only way I can describe it,\u201d said the soprano Barbara Hannigan, who played the tormented wife in \u201cWritten on Skin\u201d and returns as Queen Isabel in \u201cLessons.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very intimate; not all collaborations are like that.\u201d\n\nMr. Benjamin hasn\u2019t let the demands of composing for the human voice dampen his old enthusiasm for extraordinary sounds: Among other esoteric requirements, the new piece calls for a Hungarian cimbalom (a kind of zither), Iranian tombak drums, a battery of growling contrabass trombones, and a West African talking drum, which creates eerie, speechlike sounds.\n\nHe opened the opera\u2019s score in his kitchen, pointing to dense thickets of chords and interleaved textures, many of which he had marked up in preparation for rehearsals (as with \u201cWritten on Skin,\u201d he will conduct the premiere). He knew exactly how the piece should sound, but he couldn\u2019t wait to hear how his team of performers would transform it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the bit I want to discover,\u201d he said.\n\nA few weeks later, during a short break in rehearsals at the Royal Opera House, Mr. Benjamin seemed tired \u2014 being conductor as well as composer was taking its toll, he admitted \u2014 but also energized by finally putting the whole thing together.\n\n\u201cOpera is a scary medium, but that adds to its beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not prepackaged; it\u2019s not frozen.

He is systematically undermining American institutions and norms that underlie democratic government: courts, law enforcement, journalism, the intelligence community, truth. He is also being investigated for possibly obstructing justice and colluding with a foreign power\u2019s attack on our electoral system. Epic battles will follow.\n\nTwo thousand years from now, historians may be lecturing on Trump the way they now discuss, say, the challenge to Roman institutions from Caligula.\n\nSo I\u2019m not arguing that we avert our eyes from Trump or mute our criticism.

Really?!\n\nDoes it occur to anyone that this appears to be a simple ploy by China and North Korea to get Mr. Trump to scale back America\u2019s presence on the Korean Peninsula?\n\nWould Mr. Trump refuse such a ploy, even if it harms America\u2019s long-term interests, when a quick, high-profile \u201cpeace\u201d deal, broadcast around the world, offers Mr. Trump a potential public relations lifeline to counter the impending conclusions of the Mueller investigation?\n\nBRAD RAFFLE, EUGENE, ORE.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly threatened to unleash \u201cfire and fury\u201d on North Korea and ordered his secretary of state to stop \u201cwasting his time\u201d on diplomacy. North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, extended the olive branch by offering to enter peace talks and diplomatically de-escalated tensions.

Arranged in piles and lanes to form a kind of graveyard, they represent similar boxes housed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which acquired Fryer\u2019s papers upon his death in 2003. There, as part of a project called An Artist Embedded, Mr. Gordon immersed himself in Fryer\u2019s notes, letters, diaries and other documents, eventually extracting three characters from them: three lives lived at tangents to Fryer\u2019s that together triangulated him and his times.\n\nPhoto\n\nFootnotes to a footnote, they nevertheless become, in a series of beautifully shaped 25-minute monologues, avatars of gayness in America during the whole of the 20th century. This even though only the first is gay: Alfred A. Gross, a \u201chigh-swish\u201d pre-Stonewall homosexual (he was born in 1895) who sought Fryer\u2019s professional help in assisting \u201cmen like himself\u201d when they got into trouble with the law.\n\nA self-described warrior for his people (\u201cWell, warrior behind the drapes\u201d), Gross (Derek Lucci) attests to the terrible oppression of the closet but also to its compensations: \u201cMay I be a little understood for reveling in how that oppression did also make me spectacular?\u201d he asks. Mr. Lucci gives Gross immense dignity without shrinking at all from his flamboyance; he italicizes italics and turns sibilance into music.\n\nThe second ghost from the archives is Katherine M. Luder, who, starting at age 67 and continuing until her death 24 years later, was Fryer\u2019s secretary and something more.

In what is perhaps the play\u2019s highlight, Luder, played by Laura Esterman, a New York stage treasure who has never been better, memorializes those patients, whose names she of course can\u2019t divulge, in a way that is no less concrete for being totally abstract.\n\nThat\u2019s the play\u2019s method, too, coming at us with its cool cred thrust out like a business card but still, when you shake its hand, warm to the touch. By the final monologue, in which Ken Marks plays Fryer\u2019s father, Ercel, Mr. Gordon risks even sentimentality. In reality, Ercel died, at home in Kentucky, two years before his son\u2019s momentous speech; it\u2019s the play that gives him posthumous knowledge of it.

Liberation, the play demonstrates, is not just necessary and beneficial to the oppressed but also to society as a whole. \u201cThis is the greatest loss, our honest humanity,\u201d Fryer said on that hot Dallas day in 1972, \u201cand that loss leads all those others around us to lose that little bit of their humanity as well.\u201d\n\nThat he said this while sweating behind a rubber mask does not make it any less true.

When you first meet her character, Marlo, she\u2019s executing the familiar balancing act and juggling a pair of kids \u2014 with another one on the way \u2014 a husband and a two-story house that looks like it would take hours and hours to vacuum. The golden light that settles on her like a celestial mantle suggests that Marlo\u2019s life is heavenly at least in moments, even if her clenched expression and haunted eyes read more like distress signals.\n\nMarlo is doing the contemporary supermom thing and, refreshingly, she isn\u2019t doing it with 1950s clich\u00e9d desperate smiles. Directed by Jason Reitman from a script by Diablo Cody (this is their third movie together), \u201cTully\u201d admits that this figure is a noxious delusion, one that isn\u2019t suitable for real women. Nevertheless they\u2019re made to feel guilty for not doing it all or scolded for trying to live up to impossible standards. And soon enough the golden nimbus surrounding Marlo vanishes, swept away by the reality of hustling two children off to school while waiting for her water to break. (Lia Frankland plays the 8-year-old Sarah; Asher Miles Fallica plays the younger, ambiguously troubled Jonah.)\n\nMr. Reitman, as he does, goes for nice and easy, and everything in \u201cTully\u201d flows when it doesn\u2019t rush, picking up characters like Marlo\u2019s husband, Drew (Ron Livingston), and her conspicuously wealthier brother, Craig (Mark Duplass). The casting of Mr. Livingston and Mr. Duplass \u2014 who look more like brothers than Mr. Duplass and his actual brother, Jay Duplass \u2014 plays like a joke without a punch line. All it really suggests is that Marlo, in marrying a less successful version of her brother, has some provocative psychosexual issues that the movie can\u2019t be bothered with, mostly because it\u2019s one of those character-driven stories that reduce personalities to a set of readily defined traits and quirks.", "title": "Review: In the Comedy \u2018Tully,\u2019 Mom\u2019s Struggle Is Real", "authors": []}

Justice Ginsburg\u2019s career was marked by intense intellectual ambition and also by a determination to use the law as an instrument of change.\n\nThe film also chronicles her marriage to Martin Ginsburg. They met as undergraduates at Cornell, and for the next 63 years, Mr. Ginsburg (who died in 2010) was his wife\u2019s tireless supporter and champion, a man whose commitment to domestic egalitarianism was extraordinary in his time and far from common today. As their friends and children explain \u2014 and as Mr. Ginsburg, a New York tax lawyer, often said himself \u2014 he was responsible for cooking meals and cracking jokes while she was making history.

But \u201cRBG\u201d reasonably chooses to focus on Justice Ginsburg herself, and relishes every moment of her company.

The characters, while they are constrained by customs and expectations that may seem old-fashioned to us, are modern to themselves. They think about the world and their places in it, look to the future with optimism and trepidation, and experience freedom within the constraints of circumstance.\n\nIn spite of the war, the Paridier farm prospers. Hortense hires Francine (Iris Bry), a young woman raised in a nearby orphanage, to help her and Solange. Francine proves to be both a tireless worker and an amiable presence around the farm. (Ms. Bry, in her first film role, is an exceptional presence onscreen, by turns warm and sharp, innocent and wise.) When Georges comes back on leave, an inevitable spark ignites between them, and the elements of romance and family melodrama overtake the historical narrative.\n\nThe history is there of course, not only of World War I but also of the technological and social upheavals that accompanied it. Within a few years, the Paridier women upgrade from a horse-drawn plow to a McCormick combine harvester to a gas-powered tractor. Other, less immediately noticeable changes are underway, having to do with relations between men and women and between citizens and the state.\n\nAt the center is a family crisis involving the three women. Hortense, in particular, is confronted with an ethical dilemma that subtly and powerfully reframes our understanding of her and of the story as a whole. Ms. Baye, one of the great living French screen actresses, is steely and magnificent, even as it is Ms. Bry who finally captures the film\u2019s energy and the sympathy of the audience.

Dane Laffrey\u2019s big white shoe box, or coffin, of a set conveys all too well Alma\u2019s empty prospects but offers nothing to suggest either the suffocating trap of her Victorian circumstances or the richness and romance of her imagination. Her statue of Eternity is not even stone; it\u2019s a framed photograph.\n\nWilliams specified minimalism \u2014 no doors or windows \u2014 but he meant something more poetic by it. In his production notes he refers to de Chirico and Renaissance paintings as a way of suggesting the natural world Alma must finally embrace. Which is not to say \u201cSummer and Smoke\u201d is hopeful; Alma and John convert each other too late, ending up, once again, on opposite sides of love. But it mustn\u2019t play out its bleakness too soon or there\u2019s nothing to lose, and thus no drama.\n\nMs. Ireland\u2019s imagination is so well calibrated that she manages, almost single-handedly, to correct for that distortion. If this \u201cSummer and Smoke\u201d were performed silently you could still understand the story from her physicalization of Alma\u2019s character. More than that, her manic laughter, gulping breaths and drooping shocks are carried off with such authenticity that they reframe hysteria as a natural, even brave, response to deprivation and constant insult.\n\nBut of course a silent performance would not be Williams, and if much of the dialogue has a high butterfat content, Ms. Ireland delivers it naturally. Mr. Darrow, properly dashing and tortured as John, hasn\u2019t quite achieved that facility; his emphasis on the character\u2019s self-loathing and cynicism sometimes makes him seem hollow instead of harrowed.\n\nWilliams is partly to blame. John\u2019s feelings for Alma aren\u2019t as clear as hers are for him, and he often hovers, like the rest of the residents of Glorious Hill \u2014 especially the stereotypically \u201cpassionate\u201d Mexican family that runs the local casino \u2014 on the verge of caricature. Williams tried to solve these problems with massive rewriting; the result was \u201cThe Eccentricities of a Nightingale,\u201d which puts the main characters in a rather different framework.\n\n\u201cEccentricities\u201d is an improvement, but \u201cSummer and Smoke\u201d is nevertheless Williams, with veins of rich pathos to be mined from its melodrama. Surely its central question remains profound: Why do we fall in love with a person\u2019s struggle instead of with the person himself? If this revival doesn\u2019t address that question convincingly except in its central performance, I don\u2019t blame the cast, which also features Tina Johnson as the local busybody, Ryan Spahn as a traveling salesman and Hannah Elless as a pupil of Alma\u2019s who turns out to be a rival.\n\nNo, it\u2019s the parsimony of the production that\u2019s at fault, offering little that\u2019s lovely except Michael John LaChiusa\u2019s original music, in an apt neoclassical mode. Perhaps it\u2019s fitting that music should be the one element that gives you a taste of what this \u201cSummer and Smoke\u201d might have been with such an eloquent Alma if it hadn\u2019t, like her, spent so much energy stifling its passion.", "title": "Review: Marin Ireland, on Fire in \u2018Summer and Smoke\u2019", "authors": []}

Positive thinking isn\u2019t guaranteed to prevail; the state of the world is too unsettled for U2 to make promises. For decades, the band has treated arenas and stadiums as havens of community through shared songs. This time, the singalongs are mixed with warnings and pleas to save an endangered American dream.\n\nCall it ambitious or call it presumptuous, but it\u2019s rock that arrives with a sense of mission \u2014 so much so that U2\u2019s echoing chords and martial beats have long since become shorthand for earnest idealism in what remains of current rock. Becoming a voice of conscience is a job that few of the long-running rock bands who can still command the arena circuit \u2014 Bruce Springsteen excepted \u2014 are willing to shoulder. But on Wednesday night, U2 got its audience loudly chanting \u201cNo more war!\u201d in the middle of \u201cSunday Bloody Sunday.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new tour is the sequel to U2\u2019s 2015 tour based on its 2014 album \u201cSongs of Innocence.\u201d It uses a more technologically advanced version of that tour\u2019s setup, with a large and a small stage at opposite ends of the arena connected by what U2 calls a \u201cbarricage,\u201d a walkway enclosed by transparent video screens that can place the band members inside giant images (now with improved resolution). Dozens of speakers, many of them overhead, create an unobtrusively sensational system that sounds equally clear from every spot in the arena. It exposes and revels in the physical grain of U2\u2019s live arrangements; the candid fervor of Bono\u2019s voice, the resonant drive of the Edge\u2019s guitar riffs and the tensile strength of U2\u2019s rhythm section, Adam Clayton on bass and Larry Mullen Jr. on drums.\n\nOne tech upgrade was underwhelming: an augmented-reality app, \u201cThe U2 Experience,\u201d that turned Bono into a gleaming, spectral figure on phone screens for just one song. Perhaps the app will have more moments as the tour progresses, though monitoring the show on a hand-held screen diminishes it. (The concert heads to NYCB Live in Uniondale, L.I., on June 9; Madison Square Garden June 25-26 and July 1; and Prudential Center in Newark on June 29.)\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

But U2 remains determined to address the present, a much more arduous choice. \u201cSongs of Experience\u201d was delayed not only by the \u201cJoshua Tree\u201d tour but also by rewrites following Brexit and the 2016 American elections. The album repeatedly glorifies love as a force for both redemption and resistance, but also sees obstacles: \u201cDemocracy is flat on its back,\u201d Bono sang in \u201cBlackout,\u201d which also wonders, \u201cIs this an extinction event?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTitles aside, the two albums aren\u2019t a balanced pair. \u201cSongs of Innocence\u201d was focused, with specific names and places, on Bono\u2019s childhood, which was marked by the loss of his mother and by a 1974 terrorist car bombing in Dublin. \u201cSongs of Experience,\u201d meanwhile, is the more generalized reflections of a longtime rock star and do-gooder. Before singing \u201cIris (Hold Me Close),\u201d a \u201cSongs of Innocence\u201d track commemorating his mother, Bono announced, \u201cTonight\u2019s show is a very personal story.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was a story of clashing, contradictory impulses and of a shift from individual to public figure to societal conscience. Songs from across U2\u2019s catalog echoed or rebutted one another, answering righteousness and uplift with doubts and misgivings. At one point, video effects turned Bono into his demonic alter ego from the 1990s, MacPhisto, who cackled, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t believe that I exist, that\u2019s when I do my best work\u201d; it was the lead-in to \u201cAcrobat,\u201d a song about self-deception and hypocrisy from U2\u2019s 1991 masterpiece, \u201cAchtung Baby,\u201d that it hadn\u2019t previously performed in concert. In 2018, it was searing: \u201cDon\u2019t believe what you hear, don\u2019t believe what you see,\u201d it begins.\n\nBono introduced \u201cStaring at the Sun\u201d as a song about \u201cpolitical blindness \u2014 the kind that can tear up a home or a nation\u201d; the accompanying video showed images of white nationalist and neo-Nazi rallies and streetfighting. It was followed by its counterweight, \u201cPride (in the Name of Love),\u201d with images of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and protests for women\u2019s and minority rights. \u201cPray for the regeneration of the American dream,\u201d Bono urged afterward. Slogans about equality and fairness were projected during \u201cGet Out of Your Own Way,\u201d from \u201cSongs of Experience.\u201d", "title": "Review: U2 Is Still Fighting for the American Dream", "authors": ["Jon Pareles"]}

By the time she figures out how to tell him, the ring will be ready.\n\nThe show runs late \u2014 no time for supper on a work night \u2014 but I have made up my mind. As we head for the subway, I scan the neighborhood for a proper setting. Sixth Avenue and 50th Street is a midnight construction zone, but there is a little stand of trees at 49th Street, still wearing their tiny ivory holiday lights. I march her over, put my hands on her shoulders, and tell her she can have the diamond, which conveniently eclipses the question of why I\u2019m not wearing it.\n\nI can summon up the sense memory of a handful of fierce, lingering hugs over time, having to do with various animals who became part of our family, or wildly decorated birthday cakes, or first jobs or books published or whatever we agree matters. The northwest corner of 49th and Sixth becomes part of that family library, the moment when a ghost great-grandmother, a frail grandmother, and Sarah and I share a single embrace. All that history. All that flawed and well-intentioned love.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where this part of the story ends \u2014 not with the proposal, not with the wedding plans, the dress, the food, the invitations, none of it.\n\nThis ends, even as it begins, with a man dashing down the subway stairs, a diamond necklace in his jacket pocket. A woman anticipating a ring that holds then and now together. And a pending mother of the bride who knows flat out what an illusion romance can be \u2014 and yet indulges, despite everything, in a glorious dose of why not.", "title": "Romancing the Stone", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "How has working with audio made you approach reporting differently?\n\nThe big difference for me is that it\u2019s very unusual and somewhat uncomfortable to write in the first person. This is something you do in exceptional circumstances when the reporter\u2019s story is important as a vehicle for telling the larger story. When you\u2019re doing audio, the fact that you\u2019re the vehicle telling the story is built in. That makes it much easier to inform listeners about the reporting process.\n\nFor example, last year, Andy and I were in Iraq for \u201cThe Daily\u201d to report the story of young women who had just been released after three years of ISIS captivity and, in some instances, had been raped almost every day. In the middle of the day, we walked into the tent of two of the women and saw them collapsed, lying on mattresses. There were people wailing and crying over them. As soon as I saw that, I turned to Andy and said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to leave. We have no business being here. These people are really sick.\u201d A lot of listeners commented on how powerful it was to hear that because they probably hadn\u2019t thought about the ethical considerations that go into interviewing rape victims.\n\nIn a text story, I might have described that there were two women who were collapsed, but the fact that I had to leave because it would have been obscene for me to try to interview them would not have gotten in.\n\nMy beat is among the more unusual ones we have at The Times. It\u2019s intense, and you\u2019re dealing with these ethical quandaries all the time. My editors and I have many long discussions about how we do this and how we approach that. With audio you have the ability to be transparent about those considerations and walk listeners through how we struggle with and try to make our way through them.\n\nVideo\n\nWhat do you see as the main advantages of audio over the written word?\n\n\n\nOne of the subjects of the podcast is a young Canadian recruit to ISIS. If I were to pitch a text story based entirely on somebody identified by essentially his made-up name, that would be a hard sell. But with audio, you understand implicitly that this is his story.\n\nI don\u2019t want to give away what happens later in the podcast, but there are some really emotional moments. You can hear the trauma in his voice and the emotion of him recalling what happened. There\u2019s a point where he\u2019s describing something particularly awful and we have the microphone very close to his face. You hear him rubbing his hand on his beard back and forth, and you understand that this is somebody who feels really distressed, really nervous. I could write that \u2014 \u201che rubbed his beard\u201d \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t come across the same way.\n\nI don\u2019t want to diminish text in any way. That will always be my medium. But audio is a different form, so it has power in a different register.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the most popular serialized podcasts revolve around a single host who becomes part of the narrative. What went into the decision to feature both you and Andy?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the beginning we wanted to experiment with new ways of telling stories with this podcast. We got rid of the \u201chost\u201d role to provoke more spontaneity in our dialogue and hopefully more intimacy with our listeners.\n\nI loved working with Andy from the start. He comes from an evangelical background and grew up in a religious family, but later left the faith. He remains very curious about religion, and so much with ISIS involves faith and belief. We hit it off right away. It was really nice to have him as this sort of co-detective and be able to bounce things off him.\n\nShortly after \u201cCaliphate\u201d debuted, it reached the top of the Apple Podcast chart. What elements do you think have made it resonate so strongly with listeners?\n\nOne of the things is that Andy, in a way, gave me permission to really be myself and to be honest about what it\u2019s like to be on this beat. I\u2019ve always been worried about showing my vulnerabilities and telling people when I feel scared because, in the end, I\u2019m a woman covering terrorism, and I just assume that there are people who think I can\u2019t hack it. For example, when I was first telling Andy about the 911 call, I asked him to turn off the recorder. Later, he convinced me to put it on the record in Chapter 1. I really wrestled with it: Do I want people to know this insane thing I did \u2014 that I called 911 in the middle of the night because I thought ISIS might be ringing my doorbell?\n\nBut I think Andy was right. Allowing myself to be human and to explain what it\u2019s really like as a woman on this beat works, and is interesting for listeners.\n\nPhoto\n\nYou frequently correspond with readers on Twitter and have invited listeners of \u201cCaliphate\u201d to direct message you. Based on their responses to the series, do you think you\u2019ve reached a new audience?\n\nI really do, and that\u2019s the exciting thing about audio. In journalism, at a certain point, you get into a lane and you get comments from people who are generally of that universe. I often get comments, for example, from journalism students, women, people who are interested in national security. Suddenly, I\u2019m getting messages from people in Germany and in Finland who listened to the podcast, people whom I don\u2019t normally hear from. That\u2019s really cool.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n[Read this recent Twitter thread to see Ms. Callimachi\u2019s responses to readers\u2019 questions about her work covering ISIS.]\n\nIn \u201cCaliphate\u201d you mention how previous interviews with ISIS members left you frustrated and made you question whether they were being truthful. Have you had similar feelings with Abu Huzayfah?\n\nI would have to spoil a lot of things if I answered that question. In general on this beat, though, that\u2019s the puzzle you\u2019re always dealing with. First of all, you\u2019re spending so much effort just trying to get even one ISIS member to talk to you. It\u2019s so hard to find them. You can somewhat get access to them in prisons in Iraq, but you don\u2019t get much time with them. It\u2019s also very hard to do these interviews in 20 minutes, 30 minutes because you\u2019re just scratching the surface.\n\nAnd then you have a source\u2019s story. Imagine how hard it has been to confirm the reporting on Harvey Weinstein, and that\u2019s happening in Hollywood, a place with a paper trail and American citizens and people who speak the same language we do. It\u2019s so hard with ISIS because you\u2019re dealing with a place I cannot go: the caliphate, when it was around. So half the work is just getting the interview and the other half is figuring out if there\u2019s any way to corroborate it.\n\nHave you been contacted by any law enforcement officials who are concerned that you\u2019re communicating with a former ISIS member in Canada?\n\nA retired Canadian intelligence analyst started tweeting at me, basically asking if I had a moral responsibility to flag this person to authorities. Obviously, as journalists, we can\u2019t act as an extension of law enforcement. That would be the end of me on this beat if I started turning in my sources. At the same time, we are dealing with members of a terrorist group \u2014 a group that has called for attacks in North America. You\u2019ll see later in the podcast that we found a way to keep our journalistic integrity but also answer some of these questions.\n\nWhat are some of the other ethical dilemmas you\u2019ve discussed?\n\nMy goal in telling the story of Abu Huzayfah is to try to explain, in a way, the unexplainable: How does a normal-seeming person, who grew up in a middle-class family, with no abuse that I know of, loving parents and a comfortable lifestyle \u2014 how does that person, because there are so many of them, end up joining this murderous group? There\u2019s a rut in the reporting on ISIS, where it\u2019s so easy to write about the salacious, awful things they do. Very quickly, we go into this boogeyman narrative about these savage, brutal criminals. We forget that human beings are doing this, and 40,000 people have joined from overseas. Yes, you can find the psychopaths among them. But, in my experience, there are a lot more Huzayfahs than the others.\n\nI saw part of my job as trying to explain this story and trying to do so as humanely as I could. The line that we tread there is that we come very close to this big chasm on the other side, of justifying ISIS\u2019 acts, which we don\u2019t want to do, of course. There was a big balancing act on that front.\n\nPhoto\n\nOn the podcast you talk about how ISIS members follow you and your work on social media. Do you know if they\u2019re listening to \u201cCaliphate\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far I have not seen them talking about \u201cCaliphate.\u201d They did message each other about the \u201cISIS Files\u201d story. There was a very long post in Arabic where they said that even The New York Times basically acknowledges their statehood, which was a little funny and a little worrying.\n\nHave you finished all the episodes?\n\nWe\u2019re still working on the back end, and I think we\u2019re going to be working up to the wire.\n\nDo you know how \u201cCaliphate\u201d will end?\n\nI actually don\u2019t, to be perfectly honest. I have an idea, but there are a couple of things that might happen in the middle of the podcast that I still haven\u2019t gotten a handle on.\n\nWill the documents that you collected for \u201cThe ISIS Files\u201d play a role in the series?\n\nThey do. They\u2019re featured heavily in episodes seven and eight.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on the Islamic State and terrorism, have you learned anything unexpected in making \u201cCaliphate\u201d?\n\nI have interviewed many victims who have seen beheadings and have been on the receiving end of the brutality of the Islamic State. To hear it told from the other side \u2014 in a really detailed, naked way \u2014 was revelatory. In the videos that ISIS has put out and in the reporting that we\u2019ve done, you see the group as bloodthirsty and hateful, and that is one reality. But there are also other realities, including people who do these acts and who have enormous remorse.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhat would people be surprised to find out about your reporting process?\n\nWhen Andy was coming with me to Iraq, I was really worried because he thought he was joining this high-flying correspondent doing something really interesting. And I was thinking to myself: \u201cHe has no idea how many hours we\u2019re going to be sitting at a checkpoint. He has no idea how many times we\u2019re going to start the day thinking that we\u2019ll get X, only to get to the destination and be told that the source has left.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of waiting around and trying to have tea with this official to get access to this one thing, trying to schmooze with that one person to see if, even though there\u2019s a media blackout in Mosul, you could be the only journalist who\u2019s let in.\n\nWhat comes next after \u201cCaliphate\u201d?\n\nI adore my little team. We\u2019re already kind of nostalgic thinking about when this is over because we won\u2019t see each other every day anymore. But we need to finish the podcast first, and afterward I think we all need to go on a really long vacation and then come back and think about it.\n\nTo hear more from Rukmini Callimachi and learn about new episodes, sign up here.

And since the fields have been capped and resodded, the chances of recent lead exposure is very low.\n\nMartin Maher, the Brooklyn parks commissioner, said with the levels of lead now on the fields, \u201cyou would have to eat two garbage pails of that dirt\u201d to have any health problems. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with huge margins of safety here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not taking any chances.\u201d\n\nThe department has let the fields grow over, he said, to discourage kids from hopping a fence or using wire cutters to break in and play on them. \u201cI grew up in Brooklyn, I was a teenager once,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you see a nicely mowed field and it\u2019s closed, you\u2019ll find a way in.\u201d\n\nThe parks department has been holding regular public meetings to keep the community abreast of what\u2019s happening with the cleanup \u2014 the latest meeting was held last Monday \u2014 and it has told residents lead testing is not advised but is available.

Knopf. $28.95.\n\nAlan Hollinghurst\u2019s new novel is a portrait of a man who isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s not that David Sparsholt doesn\u2019t appear in the novel that bears his name. On the contrary, we\u2019re continually getting glimpses of him and hearing tantalizing rumors. Over the course of a story that spans 70 years and three generations, we learn about Sparsholt\u2019s heroic career as a pilot during World War II, his successful business \u2014 and then, with a shock, about the political sex scandal, the \u201cSparsholt Affair,\u201d that made him a household name.\n\nYet the man himself always remains at a distance. Indeed, he initially appears as a literal shadow. The year is 1940, and Oxford is largely empty \u2014 most of the male students have been drafted, or are about to be \u2014 when a small group of friends happen to spy David in his room across the quad: \u201cThe source of the shadow moved slowly into view, a figure in a gleaming singlet, steadily lifting and lowering a pair of hand-weights.\u201d At first, no one knows the young Adonis\u2019s name, but his physique alone is enough to make one of the group, Evert Dax, fall madly in love with him. Another, Peter Coyle, manages to persuade Sparsholt to sit for a portrait, a nude chalk sketch. And a third, Freddie Green \u2014 who is the narrator of this section of the novel \u2014 spends a long night during the Blitz on the roof of the college with Sparsholt, watching for enemy bombers.\n\nIn their tiny undergraduate world, these reverberations of feeling constitute a major event \u2014 a \u201cSparsholt affair\u201d of its own, before the later, public one is even imaginable. This is the subject of the novel\u2019s opening section, a self-contained drama rich with seduction, betrayal and exploitation. Peter and Evert maneuver fiercely for David\u2019s affections, regardless of the fact that he has a fianc\u00e9e; and one of them gets what he wants, for a price. Still, Freddie supposes the whole thing will soon be forgotten: \u201cIt had already assumed its true scale, something fleeting, and entirely personal, too hidden to rate even a footnote in the history of its time. I doubt anyone has spoken a word of it till now.\u201d\n\nBut a writer, according to Henry James, should be one of those on whom nothing is lost; and Hollinghurst, a very Jamesian writer, doesn\u2019t allow this \u201caffair\u201d to slip into oblivion. Instead, it turns out to be the overture in a long and complex saga \u2014 five substantial episodes that take us, in long leaps, from the Blitz to the age of smartphones. Structurally, this makes \u201cThe Sparsholt Affair\u201d very similar to Hollinghurst\u2019s previous novel, \u201cThe Stranger\u2019s Child,\u201d which dealt with the life and literary afterlife of an English poet who died in World War I.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nReaders of that book \u2014 or of Hollinghurst\u2019s earlier \u201cThe Line of Beauty,\u201d which won the Man Booker Prize \u2014 will find much that is familiar here, stylistically and thematically. As always, Hollinghurst writes classically beautiful prose, which like James\u2019s is constantly intelligent, alert and mobile. Though he is a wonderful noticer and describer \u2014 of skies, paintings, bodies \u2014 it is his party scenes that are most famous, and justly so. Few writers are so good at capturing the currents of intention and emotion that circulate in a crowded room.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere is something particularly English about this talent, and it can produce a very English comedy of polite noncommunication. In one scene, a group of guests at a party \u2014 actually, at the wake of Freddie Green, who has died half a century after we first met him \u2014 are standing outside as it starts to rain. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly raining at all,\u201d one says, and another agrees, \u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to be out, isn\u2019t it\u201d; and then, \u201cwith a sudden collective coming to their senses everyone in the garden walked, almost ran, back into the house.\u201d To understand what people really want, Hollinghurst suggests, you have to ignore what they say and pay attention to what they do \u2014 especially when it comes to sex.", "title": "Scandal Puts a Gay Father in Prison.

{"date": "2018-05-06 00:00:00", "text": "But while what happened with Mr. Kogan\u2019s Facebook data set is now known, the fate of other information hoards is murkier. In many cases, the data was used for research or scholarly articles. The information was then sometimes left unsecured and stored on open servers that offered access to anyone. Some academics said the data could have been easily copied and sold to marketers or political consulting firms.\n\nThe potential result is more leakage of Facebook users\u2019 information through academic circles, said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, a professor of political communication at the University of Oxford who has studied data collection from Facebook.\n\n\u201cThe academic world is highly decentralized, and each individual, each institution, has a different way of securing their data,\u201d Dr. Nielsen said. \u201cEven if almost everyone in the academic community is careful and protects the data, you still can end up in a situation where someone is careless or acts in bad faith and sells access. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Facebook stops that from happening.\u201d\n\nThe Times reviewed half a dozen Facebook data sets compiled by academics from 2006 to 2017. One, gathered from 2015 to 2017 by researchers in Denmark and New Zealand, examined 1.3 million people in Denmark \u2014 about a quarter of the country\u2019s population \u2014 to determine how liking one political page on Facebook could predict how someone would vote in the future. Another set, from 2013, by a group of Norwegian academics focused on the civic engagement of 21 million Facebook members on four continents.\n\nThe Danish research team did not respond to a request for comment. Petter Bae Brandtzaeg, one of the Norwegian researchers, said he understood concerns about data gathering.\n\n\u201cAs a researcher you get immediate access to people\u2019s behavior, attitudes, feelings and relationships, which are of course tempting for all,\u201d he wrote in an email. He said many researchers lacked the technical expertise to properly secure data.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Facebook data was typically amassed through scraper programs that crawled the social network to document what was posted, or through quiz apps that requested access to people\u2019s profiles. The results included users\u2019 locations, interests, political affiliations, Facebook interactions and even music preferences.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn most cases, researchers assigned numbers to people whose Facebook information they had obtained to maintain anonymity. But the more data there is, the easier it is to overlay one information set with another to identify someone. One 2015 paper published in the journal Science looked at credit card spending data and found that data scientists could pinpoint 90 percent of the shoppers by name with just four random pieces of information from sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n\nOnce people are identified and their interests and interactions known, they can be targeted with advertising and mobilized for political campaigns or other causes.\n\nFor years, Facebook had no specific policies about academics\u2019 access to user data, though it had guidelines on working with third parties. While the company has a rule that forbids the use of scrapers, it has not enforced that policy against scholars. And at times, it has assisted researchers with studies.\n\nIn 2014, though, Facebook began limiting third-party apps, like quizzes, from obtaining users\u2019 information.\n\nSince Mr. Kogan\u2019s actions were revealed, fueling an outcry over data privacy, Facebook has made further changes. The company has given people more control over their privacy settings. It has said it will audit all apps that collected large amounts of Facebook data, and it temporarily stopped allowing new apps to gather information from its members.\n\nLast month, Facebook also narrowed the number of academics it would work with, saying it would collaborate with those who wanted to research the impact of social media on elections through an \u201cindependent election research commission.\u201d Only scholars with election-related projects can apply.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Social media has let them easily find masses of subjects \u2014 as well as information like their date of birth, gender and interests \u2014 and observe some of their online behavior in real time.\n\n\u201cIt was unprecedented,\u201d said Christian Rudder, a founder of OkCupid, a dating and social media site, who published the book \u201cDataclysm\u201d in 2014 on how much people revealed through their online lives.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne of the academic community\u2019s earliest known Facebook data sets was collected in 2006 by Harvard University professors. It covered 1,700 people who agreed to have their Facebook information anonymously analyzed. The data was later easily traced back by other academics to Harvard freshmen.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Britain, researchers were doing similar work through different means. In 2007, Michal Kosinski, then deputy director at the Psychometrics Center at the University of Cambridge, worked with a colleague, David Stillwell, to create My Personality, a quiz app that offered to assess people\u2019s personalities in exchange for data about them. It was one of the first times a quiz app had been used for obtaining Facebook members\u2019 information.\n\nMy Personality has now collected details on more than six million Facebook users, according to the academics who have gathered the data. Many researchers have since copied the quiz app method, including Mr. Kogan.\n\nIn interviews with The Times, Dr. Kosinski and Dr. Stillwell said they took great care to keep the data they procured anonymous. Dr. Stillwell added that the information had been widely shared with other researchers, but any academic who wished to use it was vetted.\n\nDr. Kosinski acknowledged that data is not a physical item that is easy to control. Once a data set is created, it can be copied and shared until its original source is unknown. He said collection of information from Facebook had become widespread over the years, not only by academics but also by developers, marketers, data analytics companies and others.\n\n\u201cWhat Kogan did was wrong. But what Kogan did, many others do on a much larger scale,\u201d Dr. Kosinski said. \u201cThey just don\u2019t get caught.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, after Facebook announced it would restrict third-party apps from gaining access to user data, the reach of quiz apps became limited. But scrapers continued to improve and more speedily compile information from the social network.\n\nA group of German academics used a scraper to harvest the profiles of 60,000 Facebook users in the New Orleans area starting in late 2008. The researchers, whose goal was to study how people\u2019s friendships change online over time, recorded over 800,000 interactions during a two-year period. They did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome scholars said Facebook\u2019s recent privacy changes may have gone too far by also cutting off academics who behaved responsibly.\n\n\u201cAcademics would argue that we need access to primary data,\u201d said Dr. Nielsen of Oxford. He said the changes might lead to an asymmetry, with internal Facebook researchers accumulating mounds of data while outside academics would not.\n\n\u201cIf that happens, only Facebook will really know very much about how Facebook actually operates and how people act on Facebook,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Erlandsson said the paper he and his colleagues published last December initially made little splash. But since the Cambridge Analytica revelations, he has seen renewed interest. He said he had been contacted by companies \u2014 he declined to name them \u2014 interested in buying the data on 368 million Facebook members.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in selling,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the truth is, anyone could easily do this themselves.\u201d", "title": "Scholars Have Data on Millions of Facebook Users.

Not surprisingly, so did evictions \u2014 although his company also renovated the properties.\n\nHe\u2019s a bit of a trendsetter. Housing Secretary Ben Carson suggested tripling the rent of people getting federal subsidies, an interesting anti-poverty solution. This while the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard reports that 11 million renters are still \u201cseverely burdened\u201d by housing costs.\n\nAs the hedge funds and the Hannitys have thrived, many others find themselves unable to afford homes. There has been a pickup in construction and sales recently, but demand still outstrips supply. We\u2019ve only recovered two-thirds of the construction needed to catch up with the increase in new households, according to Robert Dietz, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThe Republican tax overhaul, which cuts taxes for the wealthy, will make it harder to afford a home. It slashed the number of people who can use mortgage interest deductions and limited to $10,000 the deduction for state and local taxes. Tariffs on Canadian softwood have pushed up lumber prices, adding a Trump Tax of $6,000 to the cost of building a new home, according to Mr. Dietz, who notes that \u201cEvery $1,000 increase prices out about 150,000 households.\u201d\n\nThat is, if there are enough workers to even build homes. Despite adding 257,000 jobs over the last 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the industry still needs some 200,000 workers, with some of that shortfall no doubt linked to current immigration policy, or the fear of it. The need is so great that the Home Depot Foundation is putting up $50 million to help train and hire skilled workers.\n\nMr. Hannity may be a sideshow.

{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "Now, enjoy this week\u2019s selection.\n\nPlease note: All student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur most popular prompt, \u201cIs School a Place for Self-Expression?,\u201d asked teenagers how much they reveal about their true selves in their work for teachers. The responses were fascinating.\n\nPolaris Hall from Danvers High School, Mass., argues that school should be a place to learn about yourself:\n\nSchool isn\u2019t the place for self-expression, but it should be. Teachers often tell students that they should show their personality in their work, but then deem it \u201cunprofessional\u201d or \u201cdistracting\u201d - how is that supposed to encourage us? Kids and teenagers alike need to express themselves to their peers, their teachers, and their communities, especially when they aren\u2019t accepted at home. A school is not only a place for learning facts - it\u2019s a place to learn more about yourself and about how you relate to the world around you while being supported by people who care (why else would a teacher choose that job?). Allowing kids to learn these skills and supporting them as they do so yields adults who know how to bring passion into their lives - even if they have a 9-5 job they\u2019d love to quit. Of course there are teachers who love to see kids grow and figure out how to be themselves in a safe, joyful way, but so often our need to meet a certain standard or rubric leads us to abandon our individuality. It\u2019s a sad world if the push for perfection quashes the vibrancy of self-expression. Instead, we should let this drive for self-improvement be enhanced by our individuality to create a richer, happier world.\n\nShelby Johnson from Massachusetts thinks assignments need to be more open-ended:\n\nIn school, many students feel detached from their studies. I hear complaints all around me about how boring assignments are and how much students dislike memorizing facts about distant topics. We are constantly bombarded with work that is not relatable to our interests and is very structured. However, some assignments are more open-ended, and I think that these are the pieces of work that students can learn the most from. Depending on the topic of work, certain classes allow for projects in which students can choose what they would like to study and then apply the information from the class to their own personal interests. When these assignments are given, it is much more common for students to be truly interested and invested in their work. While I rarely hear fellow students gushing excitedly about the assignment that every single person had to complete in the same way, when delving into something that they actually care about, people tend to be more excited about their learning.\n\nBrianna Colangelo from Concord, N.C., says only one kind of class encourages expression:\n\nI feel that school shuts down self-expression, by dress coding people for wearing things they are comfortable or confident in, by making you do everything exactly the way the teacher wants it or else getting a bad grade, judging your intelligence on questions that have one exact answer that the teacher is looking for. At my school i don\u2019t have a chance to ever express my culture, my family, or my personality. The only time at my school that i get to express my experiences and ideas are in my AP classes, in my AP classes i feel as though the teachers care more and they don\u2019t just ask questions with one answer, i feel like those teachers are genuinely trying to help me learn, understand and voice my opinions not just get their paycheck, and leave.\n\nJulia Patrum from Concord says it\u2019s easy to \u201cstart feeling like a number\u201d at school:\n\nPersonally I do not consider school to be a place where I find myself flourishing on a personal level. The person I am is not really how I am at school at all. I feel like this is the case for most high school students as well. Aside from my personal friends at school, my peers don\u2019t really have a true glimpse at how I am as a person.This may be due to the lack of encouragement in bringing your personal lives to the school environment. ...We learn so much throughout the course of our four years in high school, but only a small portion of that will be actually useful in the future. We are not encouraged to find ourselves or express as people while in school. It is easy to start feeling like a number rather than a person sometimes, and thats the sad truth of it all.\n\nLiam Breen from Danvers, Mass., believes clothing, clubs and assignments provide opportunity:\n\nI believe that while the idea of school itself isn\u2019t exactly a place for self-expression, schools often can be a place for self-expression, if students choose to express themselves. I attend Danvers High School, where, like most public high schools, there is not a strict or severe dress code, enabling the students to express themselves through what clothing they choose to wear. Furthermore, students can express themselves in their classes when participating in creative assignments, we are occasionally allowed to relate our work back to a subject we are interested in, as I wrote an argument in my AP English class discussing the pros and cons of Joe Montana and Tom Brady. Additionally, students are allowed to express themselves with the people they choose to spend time with, and the people they are associated with. My school has a large amount of clubs and sports teams that students may participate on, and in choosing what sport they play or what club they are a member of, students are expressing their interests and who they are as a person.\n\nTia Terrian from St. Cloud High School, Fla., feels most expressive at home:\n\nMy home is where I feel best able to express myself. There, I am surrounded by family, I know we have seen all of each other\u2019s sides: the good, the bad, and the ugly. We may tease each other, but we are always accepting of one another no mater how crazy we are. We have grown up together and they have had my back through everything. My family has seen me at two in the morning bouncing all over the walls and seen me at 6 in the morning looking completely dead as i get ready for school. They already know how I act and look in most situations and nothing surprises them anymore. My family has been there for everything and I know that no matter what, they will always be there. I convey my thoughts, questions, ideas, and emotions very loudly at home and chaotic. I know that my family is the same and we may seem crazy and out of control to anyone outsider lolking in, but we get each other and we like it that way.\n\nEliza G\u00f3mez St. Cloud High School, Fla., gives a shout-out to the one teacher who allows her to express herself:\n\nIn my opinion, I do not feel like I have had the freedom to express myself at school as I will want to, due to many factors. First, you as student can easily get judged by others even by teachers when you do not agree with their ideas and opinions. Second, when you try to express your opinions, emotions or feelings, there is always someone against it. Most of the times, I do feel like our ideas are not appreciated in school, they may ask our opinions but we are not going to see changes due to our ideas. We haven\u2019t had freedom to express our personalities, culture, and ideas at school because we are forced to a certain way of writing, and as the article says, \u201csomewhere along the way, these young people were told by teachers that who they are in their writing ought to be divorced from who they are on their phones,\u201d (paragraph 3). Students are not only someone else in their writing, but at some point even prohibited to use the word \u201cI\u201d in essays, lacking the opportunity to express themselves. Although most classes don\u2019t give students the opportunity to express themselves, the only class that have fully given me as a student the opportunity to express not only my ideas and opinions but also my culture has been Freshaman Composition class taught by Mrs. Martin.\n\nNora from Oxford, Miss., credits journalism class with encouraging expression:\n\nI only feel that my personality, culture, family, experiences, and ideas are appreciated in journalism. We have many opportunities to write about things we like and express ourselves in creative formats. Such as, the editorials we are writing and the bellringers we do everyday. In other classes like reading we could instead of having essays with prompts we could write about our family and culture and maybe even have an open discussion about topics and issues going on in our community.\n\nIsabella from Maine says English class gives students a chance to talk about their feelings:\n\nIn English class we sometimes are asked about our feelings in the moment or about a topic and at times we are asked a tricky question and have to give our best answer. This just gives us a chance to write our opinion and feelings. We are also asked to just write about what happened over the weekend or vacation so it emerges in a school work quite enough. I personally like writing about personal and my own life.\n\nMakayla from Oxford, Miss., thinks the people within a school are what make it expressive:\n\nSchool is where the majority of kids spend their days. To me, I feel like school is a place for self-expression. I say this because of the different races, culture, and language thats distributed throughout the school. The overall diversity that a school house contains is what makes it full of expression. After reading the article, I can say that I was somewhat able to question and articulate \u201cdevotions, frustrations, little triumphs, and large peculiarities\u201d because they all deal with self-expression and how I carry myself. I could say that one-fourth of what I care about outside of school does involve inside of school because I tend to lean more on what I know from the outside to learn more about on the inside. All in all, expression and school was rebooted in my mind.\n\nAnd a \u201cnoobie teacher,\u201d Liza M. from Seattle, WA, gives her perspective:\n\nAs a noobie teacher who got picked to teach the other English teachers\u2019 least favorite class, college prep writing, I often feel pressed to quelch creative expression for the sake of formal academic writing. Though my heart is in creative nonfiction, prose, and countless genres of fiction, I am required to create curriculum that teaches all students, from the potential engineer, to nurses, to artists, how to communicate persuasively and effectively in writing. With the common core standards and emphasis on reading nonfiction and writing persuasively, I always get nervous about seeing too many \u201cI\u201d statements in the papers I receive. It\u2019s a hard balance to teach how to put your unique imprint on an academic piece, but I know it can be done. Most of today\u2019s everyday readers aren\u2019t reading heavily structured academic pieces (unless they\u2019re in school studying specialized knowledge), they\u2019re reading the op ed columns, arguments in the comments, and articles about topics they are interested in. Not just that, they\u2019re looking for writing that catches their attention and keeps it. I\u2019m not setting my students up for success to be such writers if I don\u2019t allow them some creative self-expression, so Mr. Kolb\u2019s points are refreshing and affirming. At the same time, I have to teach students how to read and write with a critical eye so we can have smart citizens who don\u2019t believe or reproduce misinformation. It\u2019s a hard balance because \u201ccritical\u201d often feels like the enemy of \u201ccreative.\u201d\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Picture Prompt \u201cChildhood Bedroom,\u201d asked students what the items in their bedroom say about their future, their goals and dreams, and how they spend their time.\n\nMackenzie Boone from Wilmington, N.C., has a room \u201csmothered with books\u201d:\n\nI have a problem with not throwing things away, that stays the same whether it\u2019s scraps of paper and bits of trash, or the random postcards I\u2019ve gathered through the years. My floor is covered in clothes, mostly clean, so I can access them fast and easy when getting ready for school! (This doesn\u2019t happen, it\u2019s still somehow my excuse for the mess.) And everywhere, there are books. In to be read piles, favorite or comfort book piles, new and no home piles, musician biography piles, the classics pile. You name it. Not to mention the two bookshelves, also smothered with books. They are the most consistent items in my room, because when I moved throughout my childhood it was always something to give my new room, the homey feel I wanted in a new place. My books are from my youngest years, all the way up to the three books I bought last week. They are all around the house, because I refuse to let any of them go, but the special ones live in my room. Some have flowers from England, or dandelions from Texas, some have handmade bookmarks, or literal lost puzzle pieces, even poems and thoughts from specific moments of my life to future me. These books bear the scars of my childhood. They are battered, worn, and loved. So I think if I had to pick any item in my room to describe my life and my strengths it would be all of my books collectively. They are genuinely a part of my past, present, and future self, and it\u2019s evident when looking at them.\n\nHaley Moroz from Wilmington, N.C., says holding on to certain items is a way of holding on to personal strengths:\n\nLast month, I thought it was a good idea to go through my room. My findings were very interesting as I found: old clothes, 23 Birthday Cards, and other hoarding materials. The garbage can outside was filled all the way to the top with junk. I started to realize that the stuff I didn\u2019t throw away was important to me. I found a letter I wrote to myself in 6th grade. I also found a Birthday card that my aunt wrote, which she lives in Colorado. That meant a lot because I don\u2019t get to see her a lot. Finding these treasures, made me remember these exact moments. Similar to the author, I didn\u2019t throw these away. I kept them in a box, which is now in my closet. Including my middle school awards, first pair of cleats, and etc. As I head into the future, I will cherish these memories. By doing this I will fix my mistakes, and hold onto my strengths. Holding onto these maintains who I am.\n\nVeronica from Kaplon says certain items are too important to toss:\n\nMy room is a direct reflection of the chaos happening in my mind around the clock. Sometimes, I\u2019ll uncover something intriguing, but typically, it just get shoved into the background without much consideration. Perhaps an old shirt in the corner, representing a more sane time in my life, a sequenced dress representing a time I was less careful and more open to the 12 A.M social scenes... You know... the all too common, annoying teenage problems which I can\u2019t seem to shake quite yet.... Truth be told, looking at the surface of clothes which hang from every orifice in my room, I could dispose of 3/4 of the things.... Oh, but not my cherry red lipstick and the slightly cracked picture of my family... (Don\u2019t ask about the crack... I haven\u2019t quite figured it out just yet).\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., keeps things that will help her reminisce when she grows up:\n\nIf somebody wants to get to know me, all they need to do is to come inside my room. Over the past few months, I have gone through all of my belongings, and have thrown the junk away while keeping all the things that actually matter. Awards from Elementary school for being in the art show, toss; my old dance shoes; into the trash. But other objects that matter, my old American Girl dolls, post cards from a trip to Greece and aged photos, are some of the things that I want to carry into the future. I have crafted my room to paint a complete picture of who I am. That way, when I am older and grown up, I will have a lot of reminiscing to do when I come back to my childhood bedroom.\n\nEmilia Cordon from Wilmington, N.C., keeps things that bring her \u201cto another time\u201d:\n\nRecently I\u2019ve excavated my room finding much of the norm: too many pointe shoes to count, some random clothes I would never consider wearing today, and just a ton of junk. I filled two whole trash bags with junk. Not every thing was junk though. I found a letter I wrote to myself about hating my mom, a birthday card I wrote for someone in third grade but never gave to them, and a violin from my classical music era. These types of items bring me to another time like the author of the essay. I can almost fathom exactly how I felt at that moment just by seeing a remnant from my past. There are things I would never consider throwing away. Things like my first pair of pointe shoes, my middle school graduation awards, or my art and map that covers the walls. These things are part of myself and my past that I would like to remember. While I evolve into a better person, I still want to hold onto the past and either remember my mistakes or my strengths. I don\u2019t know if this hints to my destiny, but I want to retain my identity as I travel into the future.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion question \u201cAre You Intimidated by Classical Music and Art?\u201d asks students how they feel about classical music, modern art, theater and opera.\n\nMeghan Miraglia from Massachusetts has never been afraid, and has suggestions for the intimidated:\n\nI have never been afraid of classical music. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m a flutist, but I\u2019ve never shied away from Tchaikovsky, I\u2019ve never been skittish of the Goldberg Variations.It is a great tragedy when we think of classical music as being haughty, or the sort of music that only plays in art galleries. When we constrict concertos to being things that exist in certain parts of our lives, we miss out on the humanity of music. Let classical music bleed into the modern era. Let your heartbreaks align with the great crescendos of cellos. Let your life fall into a handful of 4/4 measures, and then, and perhaps only then, will you learn to appreciate music the way it was meant to be appreciated.The best way to watch a concert where classical music is being played is to simply not watch at all. Close your eyes. Let your mind wander as the orchestra carries you through major and minor, through tempos you can feel throughout your entire body. Don\u2019t let yourself be intimidated.\n\nCollin from Lawrence dislikes the pretention around classical music, and says it is for everyone:\n\nIt is sad to hear that people are intimidated by classical music.I would like to begin by saying that I have been playing the piano for a while and I can see where people might feel intimidated by a classical piece. In most classical pieces there isn\u2019t a band or a producer, there are 50 or so musicians working together to produce a masterpiece to the ear. This is intimidation in its own right, most people don\u2019t sit down with some friends and throw on The Four Seasons by Vivaldi. It is complex and full of life, to truly enjoy it you must listen to it live. But, where there is live music, there will be people. Here is where I can understand, I can\u2019t tell you how many people will try to put themselves above everyone else by talking about \u201cHow splendid the crescendo was\u201d or \u201cHow the staccato really gives the piece a unique sound\u201d This stuff even annoys me, and I understand what it means. To someone just looking to enjoy some nice music, this can be a major turn off. I think this is the biggest issue for newcomers. There seems to be an obligation to say crescendo instead of, It Gets Louder. This negative stigma makes it seem like you must be well educated to enjoy music, this isn\u2019t true. If you have ears, you can appreciate music, it\u2019s that simple.\n\nKaplan Aktas from North Carolina thinks familiarity adds to the attraction:\n\nI\u2019ve loved classical music since I first listened to it and to put it plainly, I can\u2019t wrap my head around this \u201cClassic music insecurity complex\u201d because classic music in and of itself is a form of art. The symphonies are each like a vivid painting and the composer an artist. As for the second question, I would totally be willing to listen to a performance or piece due to the dedication of the composer or violinist etc, and the beauty that is classic music. There are times when I can\u2019t appreciate music if I know what it was truly about or how it was created, or simply because I\u2019ve listened to it way to many times. But on the contrary, the more I know about a certain song, on the matter of how it was made or it\u2019s meaning, I can like it much more like Overture With Cannons (Yes, he actually had cannons at the performance) which was made by Tchaikovsky to commemorate Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia, or Richard Wagner\u2019s Ride of The Valkyries which reminds me of the iconic opening scene of ride of the Valkyries and many other parallel scenes.\n\nElliott O\u2019Deen from North Carolina hopes classical-style music will continue to be played and enjoyed:\n\nI am a musician and I love and appreciate all music. I appreciate modern day music and symphonic pieces from the 1800\u2019s. I know people seem to have CMI, the insecurity of not being able to fully understand the technical aspects of music but still are moved. I don\u2019t think anyone should feel that way because yes the composer or artist have intentions with the ways they want you to feel but music is for everyone. Whether you are a musician or just a casual listener, it\u2019s okay to have opinions about music in which you don\u2019t know the full meaning.Classical style music will hopefully always be made so there is always time to have a great appreciation for it even if you don\u2019t fully get it.\n\nEleanor Black from Wilmington, N.C., has just begun to appreciate classical music:\n\nI have recently begun to listen to classical music. I think it is a very beautiful experience and I\u2019m ashamed to say that I didn\u2019t realize I had been intimidated by it until I read this article. Everything about classical music is bold and sophisticated: the volume, the tempo, even the words they use to describe their pieces such as \u201cthe work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells.\u201d The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is what causes people to feel uncomfortable listening and or talking about this genre. You don\u2019t have to know a thing about classical music to enjoy listening to it. It\u2019s all about the way the music makes you feel when you listen to it and I hope that more people will one day be willing to branch out of their comfort zone and try listening to it.\n\nJohn Smith from Cherry Hill, N.J., references scientific evidence that music changes the brain, and thinks both music and the brain inspire awe:\n\nMUSICOPHILIA: MUSIC & THE BRAIN Is one of the masterpieces of the late renowned neurologist, Oliver Sacks. To me it is his crowning glory. Sacks wrote that with the brain scans of the 80s and 90s, scientists were able to observe the activity in centers of the brain far more accurately than before. They discovered that music engages more brain activity than any other human area of study. In fact, he mentioned in an interview with Terry Gross in Fresh Air on NPR that if he had Einstein\u2019s brain, it would look no different from any other brain. But if he took the brain of a professional musician, the impact of music on the brain results in highly visible changes in its structure, including the thickening of the corpus collossum that connects the two hemispheres of the brain and growth in the area of the brain where sound is processed, as well as other areas. Music and the brain inspire awe and wonderment. Just relax and enjoy it. Your brain will take care of the rest. Of course, if you wish to study, you can do that too.\n\nJulian Fandino from New York says exposure brings a level of comfort:\n\nI have always been exposed to classical music, art, and theater. Ever since I was in my mother\u2019s womb, classical music has been part of my life. My interest and enjoyment of such art forms comes as a result of my exposure to such. This has allowed me to be more comfortable and interested in seeking an understanding of these mediums. In the end, it was my interactions with classical music, art, and theater that have further enhanced my enjoyment of them. I feel my experience is a great example for the claim made by Mr. Hoffman: \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that the more we know about music, as with cooking or gardening or football, the more levels of enjoyment are available to us.\u201d\n\nRamatoulaye Diallo from New York said relatives and friends have influence:\n\nGrowing up, I would always listen to rap and r&b. If someone were to tell me to listen to classical music I would have probably laughed and wonder if they were serious. The people I was surrounded by influenced me to listen to music aside from classical music. In all I would say that I am intimidated by modern art and classical music but that all is from my roots and how I grew up. Reading this article did not change my opinion on classical music because I am so costumed to a specific type a music. I do not see myself attending a performance because I am simply not interested in it. However, I do agree with Hoffman when he said that the educational system have a part in \u201cClassical Music Insecurity\u201d.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents weigh in on our Picture Prompt \u201cBreakdancing\u201d with their thoughts about whether dance should be an Olympic event.\n\nKayla Renee from Pennsylvania says it should:\n\nI say that if cheerleading and gymnastics are considered a sport, that breakdancing should be too. Breakdancing is more than just dancing it targets your muscles and requires strength, just like every other sport. Breakdancing has it\u2019s own world of battling and competitions which is why I think it shouldn\u2019t be an olympic sport, but if it was that\u2019d be pretty cool.\n\nBrooke Myers from King of Prussia agrees:\n\nBreak dancing should definitely be in the Olympics, it takes tons of practice like everything else, uses a lot of concentration, and takes a lot of work. It would also add a little more \u201cspice\u201d to the Olympics. I\u2019d also like to see rock climbing as an Olympic sport, it\u2019s so different and people don\u2019t even think about it but it takes the same amount of work, pressure, concentration, and practice if not more.\n\nPinappleCake from NC thinks dance is more about artistic expression than competition:\n\nTaking an art like dancing to the Olympics is something I would not watch. To me dancing is a way to express myself when I am happy or eating really good food. Watching people show off their dancing skills might be cool for the next person but for me it\u2019s something that has a deeper meaning than competition.\n\nNick Hargrove from Wilmington, N.C., believes dance does not fit the criteria for an Olympic event:\n\nI personally do not think breakdancing should be an Olympic Sport. There has to be a point where you draw the line. The article went on to talk about some things such as a rubik\u2019s cube competition or hacky sack which just seems plain out absurd to me. While these activities may take a extensive amount of time and dedication I do not perceive the people competing in these competitions as athletes. Honestly I think for the IOC to open up the Olympics to new competitions, it ruins the integrity of the Olympic Games. Breakdancing has no place in the Olympics until it is further established. Serouj Aprahamian (a breakdancer) even petitioned that the IOC who was known for ballroom dancing would have no idea how to run a breakdancing competition. Another thing I feel like that is crucial when determining whether a new sport should be introduced to the Olympic Games is \u201cis there room for it?\u201d. While there are currently 42 summer sports there are only 15 winter sports. One sport that I enjoy playing and watching is baseball. While it is not recognized as an Olympic game I am completely fine with it as there is the World Baseball Classic which is also held every four years. While the article may have jokingly mentioned Donkey Kong as a potential Olympic event I do see gaming being at least questioned as whether it should be a Olympic event or not. I play plenty of video games myself but rather than introducing esports into the Olympics they should instead create an E-Olympics.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHow Alike Are You and Your Friends?\u201d challenged students to think about these relationships through the lens of scientific research on brain activity:\n\nJames Wilt from Wilmington, N.C., thinks friends can have dissimilar personalities:\n\nWhen I finished reading both articles, I was left surprised and skeptical that there might be a scientific correlation to us being friends. Although this might be true, friendships develop over time. You don\u2019t instantly become good friends with someone, it takes a while. Some of my friends I\u2019ve known for years but haven\u2019t started actually being friends with until this year. Friendships are not entirely dependent on sharing extremely similar personalities. I\u2019m a quiet liberal who isn\u2019t the most social person on the planet while a lot of my friends are very talkative conservatives who are incredibly social. It doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re friends because we\u2019re different, because if we were all similar it would be like talking to yourself all of the time and that would become maddening.\n\nAnon from Germantown, Md., prefers friends with different opinions:\n\nI happen to go from friend to friend, not having a permanent group. However, the people I happen to be friends with always have characteristics similar to my own. Humor, for one, is a driving factor in who I look to seek companionship from. I believe it\u2019s important to surround yourself with different opinions, so you won\u2019t shroud yourself in a bubble, and so you can grow as a person. I am not very surprised to see a scientific correlation, because there must be some reason as to why I am drawn to specific people, specifically those of the opposite gender who are around my age and have similar but not exactly the same socioeconomic conditions.\n\nJiwon Lee from CA shares common attributes and background with friends:\n\nMy friends and I are very alike in a way of being indecisive and innocent. Also, we all are Asians, sophomores, and short we have almost same heights. We are interested in Asian food and culture. Since I have friends who are very similar to me in terms of personality, interests, appearance, and educational level, I have expected that a person\u2019s friends would be similar to the person in personality or backgrounds, but I never knew that friends have similar brain activities. I thought that way because we became friends after some time we met for the first time; I don\u2019t think we really had any instant chemistry with my best friends. I don\u2019t remember why, but we started having lunches together at some point. Then, we somehow continued our awkward conversations and found out what we have in common. The advantage of having similar friends is that we could keep talking constantly about many topics because we usually talk about what we are all interested in and knowledgeable about. However, having similar friends does not help very much about extending my knowledge or views because I wouldn\u2019t get to hear different perspectives. On the other hand, I could learn a lot from friends who are not similar to me, but I often feel overwhelmed when they explain so much information to me, and I don\u2019t understand most of their explanation.\n\nRachel Long from Wekiva High School remembers bonding right away:\n\nI tend to see patterns with my closest friends with the way we behave, the way we speak, our facial expressions and mannerisms, but this is all after we have been very close for a while. I have a very large and diverse friend group but one commonality that I know we all share is determination and drive to succeed and similar mentalities when it comes to school and sports alike. The fact that my friends and I are so alike in this way causes us to push each other to be our best selves, instead of allowing each other to just be good. However, sometimes this becomes more of a competition than motivation. While not all of my friends are my best friend, the people that I consider my best friends are the least like me. They were easy to connect with and we didn\u2019t judge each other upon first meeting. We were able to bond right away.\n\nKayla Renee from Pennsylvania likes differences:\n\nMe and my friends are similar, I wouldn\u2019t use the word alike. Being exactly like your friends is boring, because eventually you learn their every move. My friends and I don\u2019t always see eye to eye on everything but for the most part we have the same tastes in music and enjoy the same activities. No two friends should be exactly alike or enjoy EVERYTHING together, friends argue and disagree all the time. Without our differences we\u2019d all be... Ordinary.\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., agrees difference makes friendship interesting:\n\nI share the same core values with all of my friends. What brings us together is our overall trust that we have with each other, and an understanding that goes beyond simple things. We all value honesty, kindness, grades and most of all loyalty. While at the center, we all very much similar, there is little overlap in our personalities and interests. Everybody in my group has different things that they are involved in. That is what makes us interesting. If everybody was the same, the world would be a very boring place. Some of my friends like sports, others art and writing. But no matter how different we are, what really matters is that we all share a mutual understanding, and have similar values above all else.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents responded to the question \u201cAre You Conforming to or Rebelling Against Your Parents\u2019 Wishes for You?\u201d with details of their hopes and dreams.\n\nJessica Lee from Wilmington, N.C., knows her parents have high expectations \u2014 but trusts them:\n\nWhat my parents want is what\u2019s best for me. It\u2019s what they\u2019ve always wanted. I\u2019ve never had to rebel against my parents because we want the same things. I long to be a doctor when I grow up, and they support me (maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re doctors too). Being half-asian, I know the struggles that the author points out, but I do realize that my parents have high expectations not because of my background, but because of me. It sounds like the author had numerous toxic fights with her parents, which is not the case in my family. My parents only push me to do what they know I can do, although I know this is not the case with other families. I talk to my parents about my future knowing that they know more than I do. I want to go into the same field as them, so I ask if they could do it over again, what profession would they go into. I think I am more like my dad, but I can relate to my mom too. Seeing the differences between my family and the author\u2019s family widens my perspective about American expectations. I think that as long as a child knows that their parents want what\u2019s best for them, it\u2019s easier for both sides to understand each other. I love and trust my parents, and we have a great relationship because of their expectations. I am grateful that they are open about my accomplishments and decisions. It\u2019s important to find a balance between expectations and open-mindedness.\n\nAshton H from NC both conforms and rebels:\n\nParents, hopefully, want the best for their child. However, what the parent wants may not be what child wants or even what the child needs. Personally, I fall in between rebelling and conforming. I try not to do anything that would horribly upset them, but I also won\u2019t back down. There are some things about me that are just part of who I am, whether or not parents want to accept it. Most of my choices do upset them, and definitely confuse them, and most of that has to do with the fact that what is more widely accepted today by the world was not what was widely accepted for the majority of their lives. These decisions do affect my relationship quite a bit, and have since caused a lot of stress and strife. But in the end, it is my life. I\u2019m not interested in breaking laws or hurting anyone, I just want to be myself.\n\nThe parents of Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., have one rule:\n\nMy parents want me to do something with my life that is my choice, but there is one contender: I must be able to support myself. After college, I must be able to live on my own and maintain a job. I have to major in something that has great job prospects, so I can go out into the real world. I am confident that whatever career I choose, my parents will support me. Their ultimate wish is that I pursue a career in something that I am passionate about. I am going to follow my parents guidance when it comes time to pick a major, because the last thing I want is to be out of college, and my parents are saying \u201cI told you so.\u201d\n\nVeronica from Kaplon\u2019s parents have become more involved in her plans over the years:\n\nTruth be told, my parents who I love dearly are somewhat paradoxical characters. The younger I was, the more freedom I had when it came to my future. Dentist one day, president of the United States the next. I hate to call it a \u2018phase\u2019 because it only accredits my parents more but sure, I\u2019ll give it to them this time. Despite my diabolical and somewhat ourageous aspirations considering their insurmountable odds, my parents went along with it. Perhaps, even encouraged it. However, upon my graceful induction into what I then called, \u2018twelve-teen\u2019, their unhinged enthusiasm saw an unexpected pullback. And man did I notice. Nowadays, just a year away from college, from the sidelines they lovingly attempt to micromanage all aspects of my life and steer me away from the inevitable horrors which await me. How do we engage in these deep, analytical, thought-provoking conservations about my future? For now, there is nothing a good movie can\u2019t fix.\n\nSome students also make suggestions for how to have difficult conversations with parents. Rosie from Oxford, Miss., thinks young people should stand up for what they want:\n\nSome of my decisions are way off of my parents wishes and decisions. Both of my parents are lawyers and both of my grandfathers are lawyers. My dad, I believe, would like my siblings or I to take over one of the families businesses. I would like to be an ophthalmologist, which is my dream job. My parents agree with me on that, but they sometimes disagree with me on the little things. All in all, my parents love me very much. They respect me and my decisions too, even if my decisions are not what they want for me. Others should confront their parents, and say they are set on this particular thing. If not, you could be forced and pushed into a direction that you wouldn\u2019t want to be or do with your life.\n\nMeghan Miraglia from Massachusetts says she listens to her mom\u2019s valuable advice:\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have loved plans. I like knowing definitively what I\u2019m going to do, when I\u2019m going to do it, and where. The plans changed as I grew up - when I was eleven, I wanted to be a veterinarian, and then I realized I\u2019d have to know everything about every animal. When I was fifteen, I wanted to be a barn manager, and then I realized I\u2019d make next to nothing. Now, I\u2019m seventeen, and I want to be an OT and live in New York City. That\u2019ll probably change, as plans always do. But for now, I\u2019m happy. My mom was the one who pointed out the holes in my plans. Pointed out salaries and the things an average eleven or thirteen-year-old will forget. Pointed out the sharp edge of reality when my head was in the clouds. My mom taught me compassion and empathy, and I took those lessons and ran with them, and now I hope my life revolves around those things. She is hardly ever confused or angry about decisions I make - it was hard for me to relate to kids who panicked over flunking tests because their parents would \u201ckill them\u201d.\n\nAnd Alec Barden from Wilmington, N.C., recommends inviting one\u2019s parents into the conversation:\n\nPersonally, I am conforming to my parents. Your parents are the ones that you live with until you go off to college. They provide a roof over your head and food on the table. Your parents pay for college and teach you valuable life lessons. I am very respectful towards my parents at all times. As for the article, when Ms. Kuo writes \u201cInvite your parents into the conversation. Let them believe they are helping to guide you. Offer information that might persuade them. Mention older people whom you have consulted, spelling out their paths\u201d I fully agree with her. Communicating and interacting with your parents is something that I have always done. I know many teenagers that basically ignore their parents. I believe that is very disrespectful, developing a weak relationship between kids and their parents.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents share the places that act as the \u201cPublic Square\u201d in their communities in response to our Picture Prompt.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., gathers with friends and neighbors downtown:\n\nIn my neighborhood, the downtown area acts as a gathering place for the community. After school, students from both middle schools flock to the center of town. Lines are formed outside of the local drug store where penny candy is sold, starbucks, the arcade and pizza restaurants where slices can be bought for under 2 bucks. The restaurants that line our streets are great for families too, along with the large park situated in the middle of town. It is the downtown area that really makes our community what it is. I am so grateful for it, and although I may take this luxury for granted, I truly am amazed at how wonderful it feels like to live in a neighborhood with an excellent downtown area.\n\nXander Kruvczuk from the United States of America thinks social media has made public gathering places less common:\n\nIt my hometown, the place where all my friends still meet up at is the movie theater. Whenever a movie that we all want to see is playing, we schedule a time and go to see it. Other than that though, we never really hang out outside of school. I feel like online communication has diminished the amount of places such as these. I can easily see how waffle house would be a good meeting place for people to gather. The only bad part about waffle house is that there are none in the Northeast. It\u2019s such a great place to be with family and friends.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nOur Student Opinion prompt \u201cDo You Gamify Your Life?\u201d asks students if they track any numbers related aspect of their lives, like hours slept or steps taken each day.\n\nZech Edwards from Nevada, Texas, says competition is the reason why some people \u201cgamify\u201d:\n\nAs of now, I do not relate to anything that Mr. Yagoda does but do relate to the ideas he addresses. I think the reason people may have these tendencies because in today\u2019s age, everyone is competitive, and, being competitive myself in life, realize it make sense to relate it to a video game. My \u201csmall triumphs\u201d consist of getting better grades than a friend on a test or beating someone in a race or lifting more than someone. I am not surprised at the extent to which Mr. Yagoda \u201cgamifys\u201d his everyday life, because, while I do not relate it to games, I do compete with those around me and set goals in the same way.\n\nLiliana R from Texas thinks it is fun:\n\nI do identify with the habits and behaviors that Yagoda describes. It\u2019s possible people do this to have fun with life, and look at it like a level in a game. Sometimes when I\u2019m in the car I\u2019ll imagine something that happens around me in the buildings or fields I see.\n\nChandler Ross from Texas sees the practical applications:\n\nI see where Mr. Yogoda is coming from in his article. Many people plan to or even carry through with mapping out their days or even weeks so that they stay on track. example is some families make a \u201cWeek Meal Menu\u201d 1.) so they know what each day of the week they are eating and 2.) so they can but just things on their list from the grocery store to make those meals and not buy extra items they don\u2019t need.\n\nJazmine from Texas tracks school grades:\n\nI personally do not identify myself with the habits and behaviors she describes. By \u201cGamify\u201d she means by tracking numbers of any sort. such as your weight gain, your electric bill, and your grades for school. The only thing I really tend to \u201cGamify\u201d is my school grades. Because if I \u2018Gamify\u201d everything else it would become a hassle of time and would become an energy drainer.\n\nJordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., thinks numbers enhance reality:\n\nBy \u201cgamifying life,\u201d once remedial tasks, like going to CVS or taking a shower become adventures. Numbers are a way to enhance reality, adding excitement to places that need them most. I can identify with Mr. Yagoda\u2019s plight, because I do the same on an almost daily basis. When I am in school, I often create a hand writing competition between my right and left hands. Considering that I am a righty, that hand always wins, but nevertheless I still like to keep score. In my head I play geography trivia with myself, thinking of a random country than trying to say the capital. Believe me, it makes those boring moments go by in a heartbeat. If it was for the games that I play with myself, life would be a lot less fun. They are not just a way to pass time, but to enrich it.\n\nMackenzie Boone from Wilmington, N.C., says games fight boredom:\n\nEver since I was little I have hated being bored in the car. Considering my family takes many a road trip, I started pretending my hand was on an obstacle course. I would \u201cjump\u201d and \u2018run\u201d on telephone lines, and have to blink in between every white line on the road. It would keep me occupied for a while, but eventually I\u2019d get bored and want to stop, but I never could! I\u2019d get this strong and really strange feeling that if I didn\u2019t finish the game my character would die. Which manifested itself into a weird game I couldn\u2019t win. Obviously this isn\u2019t the same as making weight loss a game, or turning a CVS into a battleground, but I\u2019m saying I understand the fascination and innate desire for seemingly pointless or boring journeys to have a purpose. Winning and losing are feelings that create drive, to achieve or avoid and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange to live by that even in the most simple tasks.\n\n_________\n\nPhoto\n\nStudents commented on our Picture Prompt \u201cProcrastinating\u201d with their positive and negative work habits.\n\nMackenzie Boone from Wilmington, N.C., is a major procrastinator:\n\nI think every procrastinator believes they are the worst procrastinator, which is exactly how I feel. My procrastination habits were once a thing that left me to complete my work in a spur of creativity, whenever the moment felt right. But it\u2019s gotten to the point where I sit and I wait for some creative idea to hit, it never comes, and me being so determined to do my best, I just don\u2019t do it. Or when it comes to studying which requires no creativity, I feel the need to wait for panic to set in to motivate me. But usually my panic becomes so overwhelming I ignore it like I ignore the looming world war. There have been multiple projects though, that I have done the night before involving some artistic theme that were (not to brag, but I\u2019m going to brag) some of the best in the class. Which doesn\u2019t help me in truth because then I fool myself into believing procrastination will always benefit me. Which I know isn\u2019t true but I still somehow stand by that fact. So maybe my procrastination habits will destroy my academic life and my future to come, but I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I come to it.\n\nBut Betzabeth4D from YC CLIP likes to get things done as soon as possible:\n\nMost of the time I would said I feel myself as a pre-crastinator, I hate when I have to finish any task and I cannot do it for sort of reason, in my personal opinion procrastinate a task is a waste of the time. If I finish something, I believe I can enjoy the free time that I have without any worries, or also i can start a new task without have to think in the other one. However after read this article its make me think in a different way. I never though procrastination could be very helpful when you are planning about to be creative.\n\nGiancarlo4D from YC CLIP falls in between:\n\nI am something in between. Sometimes when I have time, I decide to do the work early, but when my friends call me, I decide to procrastinate a little bit just to have fun. Procrastinating makes us reduce stress. However, procrastination is in theory bad, because we leave our work to the end. Most of the time we do not end doing our duty. I feel so bad with my habits because I do not have too enough time to do my personal things, for example going out with friends, enjoying with my family or exercising. I only think about work and study. I think that I have to change my habits and create a little space for myself. Postpone a project to the last minute does not make a better job because you have less time to research and to correct errors. In my experience, it is better to do our duty in the beginning than procrastinate. If you do not do well and have many errors one project that is evaluated in thousands dollars, may be devalued to only hundreds of dollars.\n\nSome students are frustrated by their procrastination habits, like Rex Hardy from Wilmington, N.C.:\n\nI have always been a procrastinator and it seems a problem I\u2019m never going to solve. It all started back in the 4th grade with Mrs. McCullough. I had been assigned my first big project, the notorious Science Fair Project. Not really knowing how much time it would take, I waited and waited until the night before it was due. I stayed up \u2019til 1 or 2 in the morning, which was far past my 7:30 bedtime. Little did I know that this would be the routine for every project and test for the rest of my school career. I\u2019ve tried many times to break this habit, yet I can\u2019t. The best I\u2019ve done is a temporary fix that lasted for about a couple of weeks. New Years Resolutions, words for the year, and far in advance planning hasn\u2019t done the trick. Now, procrastination doesn\u2019t mean all I\u2019ve gotten is bad grades. In fact, that science fair project was picked 3rd in my school and was chosen to compete at the county level. In reality, I got away with procrastination all through elementary and middle school. This is the first year procrastination has really kicked me in the butt. Like my mom has told me on numerous occasions, \u201cThe work is only going to get harder and harder and this habit isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d I should\u2019ve listened a long time ago and I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting with a \u201cB\u201d average in AP World or staying up tonight to finish multiple assignments. I know something has got to change or my dreams of making it to a big-time college will be gone. Eventually I\u2019ll figure it out, right?\n\nBut others see the benefits of putting things off until the last minute. Jonathon Calkins from St. Cloud, Fla., says it can help with memory:\n\nI am also a procrastinator. Procrastinating is often seen as a negative thing. I, on the other hand, see it very differently. I believe that I perform my best when I work under the pressure of a time constraint. From studying last minute, things tend to stay fresh in my brain allowing me to remember things better. When I study or do my homework without procrastinating I often find myself daydreaming or getting distracted to easily. Procrastinating has gotten me this far in school so I might as well keep it going.\n\nAndrea Hernandez from Saint Cloud, Fla., feels more focused under pressure:\n\nIt could be two in the morning and I\u2019ll still find an excuse to not complete an essay due the next day. In fact, I\u2019ll just put it aside and set an alarm for 5:00a.m. The sound goes off, blaring in my ears and the feeling of regret immediately settles in. I contemplate my life and all the horrible decisions I\u2019ve made leading up to this misery, yet I always seem to be the most focused under pressure. Knowing the job needs to get done under a time constraint allows me to give my undivided attention to the task at hand, disregarding all distractions surrounding me. As much as I hate having to procrastinate, it has served me well all along.\n\nAnd Huberney4D from YC CLIP is more likely to experiment:", "title": "Self-expression, Procrastination, Breakdancing and Childhood Bedrooms: Our Favorite Student Comments of the Week", "authors": ["The Learning Network", "Current Events Conversation"]}

Another woman, the novelist Gabriella Hakansson, says Mr. Arnault assaulted her in 2007.

Along with sexual misconduct, Mr. Arnault has also been accused of leaking information about prize winners on numerous occasions, potentially profiting bookmakers who wage money on who will win.\n\nMs. Danius was not rewarded for her efforts at accountability. Several members of the academy, including some of Ms Danius\u2019s allies, resigned in disgust over the allegations, and Ms. Danius was herself forced out from the top post, although she remains a member of the academy.

{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "Each year, the world\u2019s best time in the women\u2019s marathon is surpassed by hundreds of men. The women\u2019s world records in all of the races on the track from 100 meters to 10,000 meters are also surpassed by many men each year, including by many high school boys. For example, in 2017, 36 boys ran faster than Florence Griffith Joyner\u2019s seemingly unassailable 100-meter record of 10.49.\n\nThere is no characteristic that matters more than testes and testosterone. Pick your body part, your geography, and your socioeconomic status and do your comparative homework. Starting in puberty there will always be boys who can beat the best girls and men who can beat the best women.\n\nBecause of this, without a women\u2019s category based on sex, or at least these sex-linked traits, girls and women would not have the chance they have now to develop their athletic talents and reap the many benefits of participating and winning in sports and competition. Eric Vilain, a geneticist who specializes in differences of sex development, has been blunt about it: removing sex from the eligibility rules would \u201cbe a disaster for women\u2019s sport \u2026 a sad end to what feminists have wanted for so long.\u201d\n\nThis may sound like hyperbole but it isn\u2019t. In competitive sport, winning and room at the top are what ultimately matter, so relative numbers are irrelevant. It doesn\u2019t matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls\u2019 race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males. The unusually high incidence of intersex athletes in the women\u2019s middle distances and their reported 100 percent win share in the women\u2019s 800 meters at the Olympic Games in Rio show their disproportionate power. Indeed, it is because they clustered in the middle distances that these events are the initial focus of the rules. Their supremacy was proof of principle. Testosterone readings outside of the female range were also found in the throws, but these were attributed to doping, not intersex conditions.\n\nThe I.A.A.F. is requiring that affected athletes lower their testosterone levels to within the female range if they want to continue competing in the middle distances in the women\u2019s category. By definition, the required hormone therapy causes medically unnecessary physiological change, and no one should be forced to take drugs they don\u2019t want or need.\n\nBut the I.A.A.F.\u2019s requirement isn\u2019t rogue or reckless. It simply adopts the standard of care in transition medicine, which is very much embraced by those who seek to match their bodies to their gender identity. Intersex athletes who have gone through puberty may not want to drop their testosterone levels to female levels if they don\u2019t identify as female or don\u2019t see the need to feminize their bodies for reasons other than sport. This is especially true for athletes who are in the game to win rather than to express themselves through participation as women. This is properly their choice and it\u2019s a real one.\n\nWhen we\u2019re not focused on intersex athletes we tend to understand the fact of sex differences and their relevance. In the United States those differences are the basis for Title IX and its hugely popular mandate that separate and equal funding be set aside for girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sport. Under Title IX, sex remains the principal and generally uncontroversial basis for classification and legal protections.\n\nGiven this, the compromise reflected in the I.A.A.F.\u2019s rules is significant. Using testosterone as a proxy for sex may seem like subterfuge, but it\u2019s not. If it were really sex that mattered and not testosterone, then athletes who had gone through puberty as biological males would be categorically banned from the women\u2019s category as they used to be. Instead, today, if their legal documents identify them as women they can compete as women in the events they prefer if they transition the single sex trait that determines capacity for the win. They can keep their bodies otherwise intact. The process offers fairness both to the affected athletes and to the field.", "title": "Sex, Sport, and Why Track and Field\u2019s New Rules on Intersex Athletes Are Essential", "authors": []}

Boone said he challenged Romine in spring training to develop as a hitter, and on Saturday he showed both patience and pop.\n\nRomine was 1 for 2 with a walk and is batting .286 on the season. He drew the bases-loaded walk in the fifth that gave the Yankees their first run after Bauer had set down the first 12 batters he faced.

When the company changed the app last year, the goal was to separate chats and stories from friends from the content of media properties, such as celebrities and publications.\n\nIn practice, that meant Snapchat had two sides. The left side of the app featured chats and stories shared with, or by, people\u2019s friends. On the right side was content from publishers, amateur creators and celebrities and stories that Snap curated from user-generated videos and photos.\n\nThe goal was to expand the more lucrative media side of the business and to increase the app\u2019s appeal to an older demographic. But over the past few months, the changes diluted the core chat experience, which became cluttered with user stories. Snapchat\u2019s users, who are mostly young, quickly rebelled.\n\n\u201cSnap has their back against the wall,\u201d said Daniel Ives, the head of technology research for GBH Insights. \u201cThey need to work with their user community.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNow the company is moving stories made by friends back to the side of the app that also has media content.

Mr. Son\u2019s goal: to convince the regulators that AT&T and Verizon were an oligopoly that had a stranglehold on the United States wireless market. The best way to combat that, Mr. Son argued, was by letting Sprint combine with T-Mobile.\n\nMr. Wheeler and Mr. Baer rejected the argument, concluding that effectively reducing the wireless market to three major carriers from four would not be good for consumers. \u201cThe merger made no sense before, and it makes no sense today,\u201d the two wrote in an op-ed on CNBC.com last year, as T-Mobile and Sprint resumed merger talks.\n\nSprint and T-Mobile are now betting that the new F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, feels differently.\n\nA Trump appointee, Mr. Pai has said that he would employ \u201chumility\u201d in determining which mergers should be allowed to go through. Last year, he pushed the F.C.C. to relax rules limiting how many television stations a broadcaster could own. Weeks later, the Sinclair Broadcast Group unveiled a deal to buy Tribune, a transaction that, if completed, would make the company the most powerful television station owner in the country. (The F.C.C.\u2019s internal watchdog has begun an inquiry into that deregulatory push and whether it had been timed to help Sinclair.)\n\nOne question is how the F.C.C. will regard Sprint and T-Mobile\u2019s argument that they need to fend off new players in the market. The carriers have pointed out that Comcast has begun bundling wireless service with cable television offerings, essentially by reselling access to Verizon\u2019s network. Charter Communications is expected to unveil a similar service as well.\n\nCraig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson, said that the commission has not traditionally considered offerings from cable companies when it comes to analyzing concentration in the wireless market.

The works in \u201cStephen Posen, Threads: Paintings from the 1960s and \u201970s,\u201d on view from May 1 to June 23, represent the style that got him noticed in the first place.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn the New York show, the oil \u201cUntitled\u201d (1970) shows a stack of four boxes covered by colorful fabric, each fold lovingly rendered by Mr. Posen, who, as a young student in Italy, studied the pre-Renaissance painter Giotto, a master of rendering robes. In St. Moritz, the irregularly shaped \u201cClean Clothes\u201d (1969) depicts bagged-up dry cleaning, painted on plexiglass with real metal hangers on top.\n\nZac Posen frankly acknowledges the influence of those shapes on his career designing clothing. \u201cI grew up with the remnants of the mock-ups for these paintings,\u201d he said by phone in Japan. \u201cThese textiles were play-tools for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe younger Mr. Posen \u2014 who has his own lines, and is the creative director of women\u2019s wear for Brooks Brothers \u2014 is a staunch supporter of his father\u2019s work, a passion that led directly to the current shows.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe dealer Vito Schnabel, a childhood friend and the son of the painter Julian Schnabel, had noticed three Stephen Posen works in the home Zac shares with his partner, Christopher Niquet, and asked if there were more of those. There were more: dozens tucked away in the artist\u2019s two studios.\n\nAgnes Gund, the president emerita of the Museum of Modern Art, is also an owner of his work. She said she admires the fact that he didn\u2019t \u201cget stuck in one medium.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very artistic family,\u201d Ms. Gund added. \u201cEach has related to each other, and played off each other.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nThat was on display in last year\u2019s documentary \u201cHouse of Z,\u201d which chronicled the rise, fall and return of the younger Mr. Posen. He and his older sister, Alexandra \u2014 an artist who has been involved in his fashion business, as has their mother \u2014 grew up in an environment that fostered creativity.\n\n\u201cTheir first cloth was Play-Doh,\u201d said their father. \u201cThey learned to think with a line. Zac used it to a very specific place.\u201d\n\nFather and son stay in frequent touch about their work, though the elder Mr. Posen said that, as a dad, probably \u201cmy criticism stings more than his does.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not Tiepolo father and son,\u201d he added, using an 18th-century Venetian painting analogy to talk about artistic rivalries (Mr. Posen is an erudite sort who named his dog Beaux-Arts). \u201cWe have great respect for each other and our respective crafts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSeriousness was also a hallmark of the elder Mr. Posen from the beginning. \u201cSerious, but with a smile,\u201d said the painter Brice Marden, a good friend at Yale who has fallen out of touch over the decades.\n\nPhoto\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd that may explain why Mr. Posen evinced little interest in fame and fortune. In the 1970s, he was told, by the noted Pop Art dealer Ivan Karp and others, \u201cJust keep doing what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019ll be rich beyond your wildest dreams,\u201d he recalled. \u201cEvery time I strayed, Ivan would give me an elbow.\u201d\n\nMr. Posen\u2019s style gelled in the art world\u2019s consciousness because of how it blended the color and everyday subjects of Pop with realism. For the works in the current show, he would usually create what he called a \u201cvertical still life\u201d involving cloth and other materials, draw the construction in pencil and then paint the scene on shaped particle board. The results had an affinity with geometric abstraction that gave it another layer of appeal.\n\nBut in Mr. Posen\u2019s mind, he was on a philosophical quest. \u201cI was proposing to find out what a line is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basis of it was drawing.\u201d And so when the style of his artworks changed, it made sense to the artist but left others puzzled.\n\nIn the following decades, Mr. Posen has turned to making more abstract paintings as well as taking photographs and exhibiting them as juxtaposed pairs.\n\n\u201cStephen puts elements out there and defies them to work together,\u201d said the photographer Larry Fink, a friend.\n\nOne piece in the St. Moritz show, \u201cFragments from cut out\u201d (1968), resembles two striped pieces of cloth. Mr. Posen used his foot to wreck the original work so that he wouldn\u2019t have to move it when he changed studios.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI destroyed a lot of them,\u201d Mr. Posen said, with methods that included \u201cbreaking them with a hammer.\u201d But he also kept the leftovers: \u201cI thought, \u2018I painted this pretty well, I\u2019m going to save these pieces.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis son called it \u201cpunk\u201d to change styles so often, but noted that he wanted more recognition for his father.\n\n\u201cI remember very clearly when he stopped showing,\u201d the younger Mr. Posen said. \u201cI did not see the work out there in the world as much as I would like.\u201d\n\nIn the end, perhaps the crucial lessons transmitted from father to son were not only about love of pure form, but also that worldly success is a choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve built my career around the idea that repetition is reputation,\u201d the younger Mr. Posen said, which he acknowledged was something of a reaction to his father\u2019s path. \u201cFashion is a business,\u201d he added.\n\nThe elder Mr. Posen said he had no regrets.\n\n\u201cWhat gives me the greatest pleasure is being alone in the studio, day to day,\u201d he said, \u201cdoing the best work I can.\u201d", "title": "Stephen Posen Knows How to Fashion a Line.

His shooting death garnered national attention after sparking intense unrest and protests in Sacramento, particularly among the city\u2019s black residents, who argue that the local authorities have long mistreated their communities.\n\nA private autopsy conducted by Dr. Bennet Omalu, a private medical examiner, found that most of the bullets that struck Mr. Clark entered from behind. Those findings were announced during a March news conference in Sacramento organized by the family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat report said Mr. Clark was shot three times in his lower back, twice near his right shoulder toward his back, once in his neck, once under an armpit and once in the leg. Dr. Omalu said at the time that one of the shots to Mr. Clark\u2019s side most likely caused Mr. Clark to turn, so that he would be facing away from the police officers as they discharged their guns.\n\nThe Sacramento Police Department declined to comment on that report at the time, citing a continuing investigation of its own. (The California Department of Justice is assisting the Police Department in its investigation of the officers actions.)\n\nMr. Crump, the family\u2019s lawyer, said that the gunshot wounds to the back made it clear that Mr. Clark was not a threat when the officers shot him. Mr. Crump did not immediately respond to a request on Tuesday for comment about the findings in the official autopsy report.\n\nVideo footage and police reports paint an incomplete portrait of Mr. Clark\u2019s final minutes.\n\nMinutes after the two officers responded to the vandalism report \u2014 and guided by a Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department helicopter \u2014 they spotted Mr. Clark outside his grandmother\u2019s home and chased him into the backyard.\n\nIn police cam footage, the officers are heard telling Mr. Clark to \u201cshow\u201d his hands. Seconds later, an officer shouts \u201cgun, gun, gun, gun!\u201d and they shoot at Mr. Clark 20 times.\n\nMany activists have argued that the officers mishandled the routine call, over damage to a vehicle, and unnecessarily escalated the incident.\n\nThe officers have also faced significant criticism for muting their body cameras after the shooting, raising suspicion among Mr. Clark\u2019s family and friends, who have expressed their belief that the department is trying to cover up bad behavior.

The political expression \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d has been traced back to Socialists in the early 1900s, during a time when swamps were drained to reduce the populations of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. For over a century, politicians have used the phrase to go after the perceived bloodsuckers of their day \u2014 lobbyists, corrupt officials, wasteful spenders. But after having killed half the wetlands in our country, we should not want to drain any more swamps.\n\nGranted, the swamp is not well suited for human habitation, but humans depend on it all the same. It filters water, removing the excess nitrogen created by agricultural runoff. It supports hundreds of species, which in turn support hundreds of others. It absorbs floodwaters. The loss of wetlands \u2014 driven by development and rising sea levels \u2014 played a major role in recent flooding on the East and Gulf Coasts.\n\nThe swamp is also the perfection of paradox.

I\u2019m able to take a drone along with me to assignments in remote locations.\n\nThe first drone images I made were on a trip to Greenland\u2019s ice sheet, where I captured images of a meltwater river flowing across the top of the ice. In Llapallapani, Bolivia, I used a drone to show that the second-largest lake in Bolivia had dried up, leaving boats stranded in the sand and a fishing community having to reinvent itself. More recently, I was able to get an aerial angle of the giant moai statues on Easter Island showing their proximity to an eroding coastline, which would not have been possible any other way.\n\nWhat are the main concerns about using drones?\n\nThe main concern with drones is safety. It\u2019s imperative that people understand the laws in their country and in any country where they are considering using a drone. This is one of the most important parts of my job \u2014 applying for permission from international governments to safely use a drone in their airspace.\n\nBeyond the official legal approval, which varies from country to country, many times I\u2019m bringing a drone into a small community and I want to address potential ethical concerns. For example, in Bolivia, our journalists made multiple trips to a remote village to familiarize the community with the idea of what a drone is, and to get permission from the village leaders before bringing this new technology into their community.\n\nPhoto\n\nThere will always be people who abuse new technologies, but I believe that, as a community, journalists are doing a good job self-regulating. There are social media groups where we discuss issues and bring attention to good uses of the technology as well as potential concerns. Professional organizations like the National Press Photographers Association and the Poynter Institute have also come up with an excellent Drone Journalism Code of Ethics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

It is best to talk with anyone whose privacy you have the possibility of violating, before you fly and to think about what you are comfortable doing with your camera on the ground and extending that into the sky. Just because you can peer into someone\u2019s backyard doesn\u2019t mean you should.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOutside work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?\n\nMy wife and I recently purchased the Frame TV from Samsung. When I first saw it, I was fooled into thinking it was a framed photograph surrounded by a mat.\n\nPhoto\n\nWe now have it mounted flush on our wall, part of a gallery wall in our living room alongside art that we\u2019ve collected over the years. When it\u2019s not in use, it blends into the environment. Then there\u2019s the \u201cwow\u201d moment when our friends ask where the TV is and we turn it on, and magically a framed photo turns into a live Warriors basketball game.\n\nOur home and our space are very important to us, and this has allowed us to never feel like the TV is the center of attention.\n\nI also love backpacking, sometimes alone and often to remote areas that in the past would make my family worried. Now, when I get to camp, I press a button on the DeLorme inReach Explorer Satellite Messenger to tell my wife and family that I\u2019m O.K. In addition, I can request the weather forecast for my location. When I\u2019m 20 miles into the backcountry and it begins snowing, it is invaluable to be able to find out if the weather is going to improve or if I need to leave so I can get home safely before they close the roads. It\u2019s an added safety net that lets me be more spontaneous when exploring.\n\nTechnologists predict that text-based storytelling will soon be pass\u00e9, and that videos and photos will be more important in journalism. What do you think?\n\nPhoto\n\nAs a society, we are more visually literate than ever before with the omnipresence of cellphone cameras and social media. Everyone is a photographer, and everyone is documenting his or her life in a way unlike ever before. In addition, Instagram and Snapchat have made us expect an accelerated publishing speed and a deprioritization of text.\n\nHowever, just because we are moving toward a more visual lexicon doesn\u2019t mean that all imagery is created equally. The right way to succeed in journalism is not for something to be more visual \u2014 it\u2019s the quality of the visuals that matters. Since our audience is bombarded with imagery through advertising, social media, texting, emoji, virtual reality and artificial reality, there will be a lot of bad journalism produced in the name of these technologies as publishers make bets on catering to a more visual audience. The journalist behind the camera is still the most important part of this discussion. His or her eye is what will make or break these visually driven projects.\n\nWe still must find smart ways to push visual journalism further and to make sure our readers know the integrity and ethics behind the creation of our photographs. Strong visual content doesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of prose, and I think that some of our best stories at The Times are collaborations between writers and visual journalists. That said, I do think that many photographers and video journalists are now taking on a greater ownership of our storytelling than ever before.", "title": "Taking Visual Journalism Into the Sky With Drones", "authors": ["The New York Times", "Tech We Re Using"]}

Boeing is probably the American company with the most riding on a healthy relationship with Beijing.\n\nChina is projected to buy more than 7,000 planes worth around $1 trillion in the next 20 years, more than Boeing\u2019s current backlog for the entire world. Most commercial aircraft in China are made by Boeing, the company says, but if the trade pressures escalate, China could choose to award more work to Europe\u2019s Airbus.\n\nFor now, Beijing has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on some airplanes, including older 737 models made in the Renton factory where Mr. Cesmat works, which is just outside the district.\n\n\u201cChina knew exactly where to target,\u201d said Kim Schrier, the Democratic candidate who has built the biggest campaign war chest ahead of the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cThey\u2019re targeting districts where this could be problematic for Republicans.\u201d\n\nMs. Schrier is among half a dozen or so Democrats gunning for a seat that became catnip for the party the moment that the seven-term Republican incumbent, Dave Reichert, announced his retirement in September. Despite Mr. Reichert\u2019s success, the district favored Hillary Clinton by three percentage points over Mr. Trump, and it went twice for Barack Obama. Ms. Schrier, a pediatrician and first-time candidate, has been hammering Dino Rossi, the likely Republican nominee, on the tariff issue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThese tariffs are a direct response to the policies of a president you helped elect. Don\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d she tweeted to Mr. Rossi last month.\n\nMr. Rossi, a former state senator, is careful to note that the bluster could be part of Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiating style. But he said he understood why everyone was so worried. \u201cYou really can\u2019t get down to a trade war. In the end it will be very disruptive,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cHopefully this is more posturing than anything.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nBut voters in the district say the escalating trade drama has already begun to complicate their daily lives. Companies that supply construction materials have suspended orders, waiting to see what happens to metal prices. Employees at a builder of truck components say managers have been hastily reassessing supply chains that run through China and Mexico. A local hard-cider brewer is reconsidering an expansion after the steel and aluminum tariffs made new tanks and cans more expensive.\n\nAnd at Boeing, a company that employs grandfathers next to granddaughters and has introduced generations of Washingtonians to their spouses, the unease has been evident from the executive suite to the factory floor.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s hard line on trade didn\u2019t used to inspire so much teeth-grinding among Boeing workers. A lot of union mechanics were happy last year when he pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have reinforced the nation\u2019s embrace of free trade. And the president earned a lot of fans in Washington when he criticized the company on the campaign trail in 2015 for setting up a new plant outside Shanghai, saying it would \u201cend up taking a tremendous number of jobs away from the United States.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. McKenzie pulled back the Bubble Wrap and saw a label that made him feel as if he were sinking into quicksand: Boeing China.\n\n\u201cWe drill it and assemble it, but they ship the parts in from China,\u201d Mr. McKenzie said. \u201cThere are people who have worked here for 25 years making those parts, and they\u2019re proud of that.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. McKenzie, 56, isn\u2019t eager to blow up the Beijing relationship. \u201cChina will just buy all their planes from Airbus,\u201d he said, leaning his chair back against a wall in the machinists\u2019 union hall in Auburn.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have much hope that Mr. Trump will do anything to stop Boeing from setting up shop in China \u2014 he saw how Carrier shipped work from Indianapolis to Mexico even though the president had railed against the move. In Boeing\u2019s case, Mr. McKenzie said, hiring some Chinese workers might be unavoidable. \u201cYou have to provide them jobs to sell them airplanes,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Schrier recently won the endorsement of the machinists\u2019 union, which represents more than 26,000 Boeing workers.

It did donate $8,000 to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is facing a strong Democratic challenge in her quest for re-election in Washington\u2019s Fifth District.\n\nThe fear over trade tensions has spread beyond Boeing\u2019s hulking factories, all the way to Schilling Cider, a hard-cider company founded here five years ago by two friends, Mark Kornei and Colin Schilling. The business grew quickly, thanks in part to the state\u2019s abundant apple orchards, but now it\u2019s staring down an uncomfortable new reality.\n\nThe company that sells Mr. Kornei stainless-steel tanks told him recently that prices for its raw materials might rise by 20 percent. A single tank costs around $50,000. He has also heard from the manufacturer of his aluminum cans that prices could increase by 10 percent. Mr. Kornei will buy 11 million of them this year, so that uptick alone could cost him more than $100,000, he said.\n\n\u201cStirring the pot unnecessarily doesn\u2019t help business whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Kornei said. \u201cGive us a steady set of rules so we can figure out what we are going to do.\u201d\n\nMr. Rossi acknowledged that some of what the president says and does \u201ccan at times\u201d make it harder for him on the campaign trail.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "The district, which covers parts of Glendale, Avondale and north Phoenix, is a hotbed of activism in the teacher walkout movement, known as #RedforEd. Picketing educators say they have had to move in with their parents, apply for food stamps and pay out of pocket for classroom essentials like graph paper and science supplies. They argue that taxes are too low to adequately fund schools, or for teachers to secure a middle-class lifestyle.\n\nIn response to the teacher walkout, Republican lawmakers introduced a budget that provides new funding for salaries and classrooms. But leaders of the #RedForEd movement said the bill fell far short of their demands, and would restore only about a quarter of the $1.1 billion in annual cuts that they say schools have weathered since the last recession.\n\nIn Pendergast, where salaries of around $40,000 are a source of pain and protest for the district\u2019s American educators, Mr. Soberano is thankful for the pay.\n\nMuch like other foreign workers, he went into debt to find a job in the United States. He said he used savings and a bank loan to pay $12,500, about three years\u2019 worth of his salary in the Philippines, to Petro-Fil Manpower Services. That is a Filipino company of Ligaya Avenida, a California-based consultant who recruits and screens teachers for the J-1.\n\nThe payment covered Mr. Soberano\u2019s airfare and rent for his first few months in Arizona, as well as a $2,500 fee for Ms. Avenida and a fee of several thousand dollars to Alliance Abroad Group, a Texas-based company that is an official State Department sponsor for J-1 visa holders. The J-1 lasts three years, with the option for two one-year extensions. For each year he works in the United States, Mr. Soberano will owe Alliance Abroad an additional $1,000 visa renewal fee.\n\n\u201cYou have to make some sacrifices to leave your family way back home,\u201d Mr. Soberano said. Every night, he prepares lessons for his seventh- and eighth-grade science students, and every morning, he wakes up at 4 a.m. to video chat with his wife and two teenage daughters, who are ending their day in Manila. Despite their separation, he said the experience has been rewarding, \u201cteaching in a different culture, but also, financially.\u201d\n\nThe school districts that recruit teachers like Mr. Soberano say that they have few other options, because they can\u2019t find enough American educators willing to work for the pay that\u2019s offered. They say that the foreign teachers are being given valuable opportunities, and that American students are enriched by learning from them. But critics argue the teachers are being taken advantage of in a practice that helps keep wages low and perpetuates yearslong austerity policies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThough J-1 teachers account for only a tiny share of Arizona\u2019s 60,000 public schoolteachers, international recruitment has spread quickly in recent years, as sponsor companies market themselves to districts facing shortages and word spreads among administrators. According to the State Department, 183 Arizona teachers were granted new J-1 visas last year, up from 17 in 2010.\n\n\u201cRather than increase salaries, districts may once again resort to recruiting internationally as a way to solve the teacher shortage,\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, a national teachers\u2019 union, said in a statement. She added that while her union \u201cwill fight for everyone working in our communities and educating our kids to have fair wages, rights and workplace protections regardless of where they\u2019re from, the use of the J-1 visa program to fill long-term shortages is an abuse of an exchange program.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nAdministrators and researchers say experienced foreign educators can be a better option for students than the substitutes who would otherwise fill these positions. But research is clear that teacher churn negatively impacts academic achievement. J-1 teachers are, because of the visa\u2019s limitations, temporary; and without higher pay and regular raises, administrators in these districts say it will be impossible to attract enough American teachers and keep them in the classroom.\n\nRecruiting in Manila\n\nDuring the recession, districts found it easier to hire American workers, since more of them were looking to teach. But as the economy picked back up, hiring became difficult in states like Arizona, which have pursued years of tax cuts that have dampened school budgets and teacher pay. The Pendergast district has lost $1.6 million over the past five years because of state and local cuts, according to administrators.\n\nThe superintendent, Lily Matos DeBlieux, has sought private donations to fund a Spanish-English dual-language program, a monthly lunch discussion to help parents navigate their children\u2019s education and many other efforts. \u201cWith the little we have, we have done an incredible job,\u201d she said.\n\nBut hiring remains a challenge. Even with 48 J-1 visa-holders teaching this year, Pendergast has still had to rely on 20 long-term substitutes, said Ms. Davis-Tussey, the chief of human resources.\n\nIn addition to interviewing international candidates via Skype, district staff members have traveled to Manila several times since 2015 to interview teachers. Mr. Soberano met with the district there in June 2016, and just two months later, arrived in Arizona to teach at Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Glendale. The Philippines was the top sender of J-1 teachers to the United States in 2017, followed by Jamaica and China.\n\nThe 15,000-mile round-trips made sense, Ms. Davis-Tussey said. Many short-staffed schools turn to Teach for America, which recruits recent college graduates and career-changers for two-year stints in the classroom. But to hire a Teach for America recruit, who may have no teaching experience or coursework in education, the district must pay $5,000 per teacher, in addition to salaries.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor a similar amount, a single trip to the Philippines can net dozens of candidates, all of whom, as required by the J-1 program, have degrees in education or the subjects they teach, and at least two years of experience in a Filipino school.\n\nMr. Soberano holds one bachelor\u2019s degree in education, with a focus on physics, and another in philosophy. He has also studied theology. He has over 20 years of classroom experience.\n\nMukul Bakhshi, director of the Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices, in Philadelphia, said the Philippines purposefully trains teachers, nurses and other workers \u201cin a way that it\u2019s easy for them to pass muster from licensing authorities here. They obviously speak English, and they are willing to work.\u201d Remittances from foreign workers account for about 10 percent of the Philippines\u2019 gross domestic product.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nThe Pendergast district did not owe any money to the companies that connected it with recruits in Manila. Those costs were borne by the Filipino teachers.\n\nJames Bell, president of Alliance Abroad, the visa sponsor, said a financial arrangement like Mr. Soberano\u2019s is just one of several models the company uses, and that in some cases, school districts pay visa3,5 renewal fees. Alliance Abroad sponsors several hundred J-1 visa holders each year, according to Mr. Bell, working primarily in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas and Utah. He said the biggest demand was for special-education teachers, though districts also looked to hire in science, math and foreign languages.\n\nIn Gila Bend, a small town 70 miles southwest of Phoenix, 11 Filipino teachers who room together in several shared apartments commute to work by van 100 miles round-trip each day, according to Peggy Perry, a secretary in the district\u2019s central office. In Casa Grande, halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, about 25 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas are teaching science, math, special education and English, said Mary Ann Amerson, head of human resources for the Casa Grande Union High School District.\n\nThe district works with Ms. Avenida, the California-based consultant, to find the teachers and interview them via Skype. \u201cWe don\u2019t pay any money for it,\u201d Ms. Amerson said. The recruits pay the fees.\n\nMs. Avenida said her company, which uses the name Avenida International Consultants in the United States, recruited 250 Filipino teachers with J-1 visas in 2017. According to State Department data, that would account for more than half the total number of J-1 visa holders who arrived from the Philippines last year.\n\nMs. Avenida joined union representatives in a working group, assembled by the Alliance for Ethical International Recruitment Practices, that drafted a 2015 code of conduct for international teacher recruitment. The code calls for districts to bear all recruitment and legal costs, and for foreign educators not to be charged more than a nominal application processing fee, under $150. It has not been widely adopted, and Ms. Avenida said she disagreed with the group\u2019s conclusions.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cSomebody has to foot the bill,\u201d she said \u2014 and in a climate of tight school budgets, that somebody is the teacher.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLessons and Challenges\n\nIn Mr. Soberano\u2019s case, it was not until his second year on the job that he had paid back the money he owed and was able to begin sending some home to his family. He has had to live austerely. In his first year in Arizona, he shared an apartment with five other Filipino teachers, and he now rents a room in the home of a Filipino-American family.\n\nStill, he said he was nothing but grateful for the opportunity. \u201cThe district is very supportive,\u201d he said. Pendergast created a welcome committee to assist the Filipino teachers, and colleagues pitched in by buying groceries and driving the newcomers to work.\n\nIn addition to financial challenges, foreign educators face instructional ones. Administrators across the country who work with J-1 visa holders say the teachers must learn the federal requirement for inclusion, which requires that disabled children be taught alongside nondisabled peers, in the least restrictive environment possible.\n\nAnd classroom management techniques differ across cultures. \u201cIn the Philippines, the teacher there is really an authority figure,\u201d Mr. Soberano said. \u201cOnce I stood in front of the class, everybody kept quiet.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the case in Arizona.\n\n\u201cOne thing I also learned is to be friends with the students,\u201d Mr. Soberano added, \u201cto know more about each one and especially their family. How are they doing? When you understand them, I remove that kind of problem.\u201d\n\nState Department regulations require J-1 teachers to engage in cultural exchange activities with their students. The J-1 program was created by the 1961 Fulbright-Hayes Act, with the purpose of fostering understanding between nations. Mr. Soberano said that once a month, he teaches a lesson on Filipino culture, and that his students have been most interested in discussing the differences between the Filipino and American education systems. In the Philippines, Mr. Soberano tells them, school is stricter and more academically challenging.\n\nNew regulations from the State Department, which went into effect in 2016, require J-1 holders to return to their home countries for at least two years after their visas expire before reapplying. Mr. Soberano said he may do that. But his wish is to reside legally in the United States and work long-term as a teacher. \u201cI would love to bring my family here,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Weingarten, the union president, suggested that the H-1B visa for high-skilled immigrants, which offers a pathway toward permanent residence, would be a more appropriate visa for a teacher like Mr. Soberano. But Pendergast and other school districts say long wait times and high legal costs can make the H-1B prohibitive. The Trump administration has also tightened oversight of that program.\n\nIn Denver public schools, 20 bilingual education teachers hold H-1Bs and about three hold J-1s. But in the future, the district said, it may expand its use of the J-1.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t have enough people to fill the openings,\u201d said Bart Muller, the managing director of employee and labor relations for the system. \u201cThe political environment has been a little challenging over the last year and a half. The bottom line is there are a lot more hoops to jump through with H-1B, while J-1 is fairly simple. You can do it expeditiously.\u201d\n\nLora Bartlett, an education professor who has written a book about migrant teachers, argued that there should be a new visa category that meets the needs of public schools while allowing effective teachers to achieve legal residency. But, she added, \u201cthere are people who have a vested interest in not finding a long-term solution. There is a whole industry that makes money every time a new teacher comes into the country. They don\u2019t make money when a teacher stays.\u201d\n\nAnd in Arizona, where many teachers are expected to improve test scores using aging textbooks inside buildings in need of repair, districts worry that a modest increase in teacher salaries and school funding won\u2019t be enough to persuade more local candidates to enter the profession.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, for a lot of the teachers, some of the fun and creativity has been taken out of it with mandates,\u201d said Ms. Amerson, the head of human resources in Casa Grande. \u201cIt seems like we spend the whole entire second semester testing kids.\u201d\n\nIn Pendergast, Ms. Davis-Tussey agreed that higher pay alone would not be enough to fill the empty jobs that have forced her to look to the Philippines.\n\n\u201cThat respect for the profession is just as important as the money,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for a long time, teachers have felt, not only did they not have money, but what they were doing was being brushed aside and not respected.\u201d", "title": "Teacher Pay Is So Low in Some U.S. School Districts That They\u2019re Recruiting Overseas", "authors": ["Dana Goldstein"]}

Since then, Facebook, Zynga, Snap and a variety of others have followed suit with similar structures. As a result, shareholder meetings for some of the world\u2019s most valuable companies \u2014 including Facebook and Alphabet, the holding company that now owns Google \u2014 are mostly for show. Shareholders propose and vote on resolutions even though the founders have the only votes that matter.\n\nThe vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors.\n\nCharles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite an unusual move, but it\u2019s a welcome move,\u201d Mr. Elson said.\n\nMulticlass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. \u201cIf a C.E.O. does a poor job, he\u2019s not going to fire himself,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.\u201d\n\nSome recent studies, however, have suggested that companies with multiclass structures have outperformed companies with a single stock class. A report last month by the lawyer David Berger and Prof. Laurie Simon Hodrick of Columbia Business School concluded that there are benefits to multiclass structures, including limiting pressure from institutional investors, which own the majority of public shares. The authors said that calls to limit multiclass structures were premature.\n\nIn response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision.\n\nMr. Pincus said Zynga\u2019s multiclass share structure provided his company with \u201cair cover\u201d during several difficult years after it went public at the end of 2011. The company originally made games that people played on Facebook through desktop web browsers, but its business was upended by the surge of mobile gaming on smartphones.", "title": "Tech Founders Embraced Control Over Companies.

JD.com, Alibaba\u2019s main rival in online shopping, is helping China\u2019s military to upgrade its procurement and logistics systems, state media reported recently. (A JD.com spokesman said, however, that its military cooperation was limited to the procurement of goods available to all customers on its site.)\n\nIn scientific research \u2014 a focus for Mr. Xi as economic growth becomes harder to sustain \u2014 tech giants have joined with government institutes to run labs in fields like quantum computing, deep learning and human-computer interaction. Soon, Chinese citizens may even be able to use their accounts on Tencent\u2019s and Alibaba\u2019s apps as digital versions of their national ID cards.\n\nAmerican tech firms also do business with governments, of course. And they, too, are sometimes asked to hand over user data to law enforcement agencies.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut in the United States, disagreements can be hammered out in court. China\u2019s judiciary is controlled by the Communist Party. Making themselves useful to the government is often the price that Chinese firms must pay for regulatory and financial blessings \u2014 even for the very right to exist as a business.\n\n\u201cIf you see the situation clearly and are able to move in sync with the state, you will get great support,\u201d Wang Xiaochuan, chief executive of the internet search company Sogou, said in a recent interview with Phoenix Satellite Television. \u201cBut if it\u2019s in your nature to say, \u2018I want freedom, I want to sing a tune different from the state\u2019s,\u2019 then you might suffer, more so than in the past.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPhoenix subsequently removed that portion of the interview from its website. A Sogou spokesman declined to comment.\n\nChinese tech companies have found a variety of ways of moving in sync with Beijing. Last year, they injected money into a struggling state telecom carrier, precisely the kind of company they had long sought to disrupt.\n\nRegulators picked Tencent and Ant Financial, an Alibaba corporate sibling, to build credit-scoring databases, though their role in those efforts has since been curtailed. Still, their systems and data would be key, analysts say, for China\u2019s ambitions to build a broader \u201csocial credit\u201d system that would track people\u2019s financial activities, police records and other public behavior.\n\nUntil recently, Tencent\u2019s website said its cloud services helped the Communist Party \u201cstandardize and streamline party-building work.\u201d But that page was removed after The New York Times asked Tencent about it. The original web address now points to a page that describes how Tencent can help local governments manage data.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s scared the absolute bejesus out of everyone, which doesn\u2019t normally work in tech,\u201d said Ryan Manuel, a fellow at the University of Hong Kong, referring to Mr. Xi, who has been more willing than past leaders to purge officials and arrest high-profile businessmen. \u201cThat fear is the antithesis of creativity.\u201d\n\nFor many years, as Chinese companies became major players in online services, telecom gear, drones and more, the government neither boosted them nor meddled much in their operations. Now, though, as Beijing aims to make China a world technology leader, it is trying to steer private companies more directly, particularly in research and development.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe government\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, which seeks to upgrade national capabilities in electric cars, robotics, semiconductors and other advanced industries, is a big factor behind the spiraling trade tensions with the United States.\n\nIn areas such as supercomputers, satellite navigation and drones, Mr. Xi has pushed Chinese companies to work alongside the military to chase breakthroughs. At a speech last month in Beijing, Mr. Xi said that the internet and information technology represented the \u201cmost dynamic and promising area for civil-military integration,\u201d according to the state news agency Xinhua.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nChina\u2019s internet titans have already been roped into the government\u2019s plans to lead in artificial intelligence. Alibaba was designated, in November, as the national champion for developing \u201csmart city\u201d infrastructure. Tencent was picked to fill that role in medical imaging; the search giant Baidu is to lead for self-driving cars. A fourth company, iFlyTek, was named to spearhead voice recognition.\n\nDivvying up an industry before it has matured risks stifling competition, though. And shoehorning companies into specific activities could discourage them from exploring others.\n\n\u201cHaving the state define and pick winners and losers is not how long-term sustainable innovation really happens,\u201d said Tai Ming Cheung, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies technological development in China.\n\nCountries that have tried it, from the Soviet Union to Japan, \u201chaven\u2019t really fared well over the long run,\u201d Mr. Cheung said.\n\nChina\u2019s record is mixed. In the 1960s and \u201970s, Mao\u2019s \u201ctwo bombs, one satellite\u201d program helped the government develop a nuclear bomb, a ballistic missile and its first satellite. More recently, state guidance has helped Chinese companies gain ground in high-speed rail and renewable power. In other fields, including flat-panel displays and cars, the country\u2019s industrial policy has flopped repeatedly.\n\nFor China\u2019s tech giants, working with Beijing has become more important for another reason: Mr. Xi has tightened China\u2019s controls on the internet, and moved with remarkable force against companies that step out of line.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Interested in All Things Tech?

In doing so, they addressed a diversity concern in China, where moviegoers are increasingly sensitive to Hollywood\u2019s tendency to cast Chinese actors in bit parts. But after the release of the movie trailer, another diversity issue arose: Several prominent Asian-Americans criticized the filmmakers for casting Matt Damon in the lead role, as one of the leaders of a Chinese army, likening the decision to \u201cwhitewashing.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the debate has resurfaced with the planned American release, in August, of the film adaptation of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d based on a series of novels about the lives of wealthy families in Singapore.\n\nThe casting has generated some controversy, in part over the biracial actor chosen as the male romantic lead.\n\nWhile the film is promoted as having an all-Asian cast, the Singapore journalist and activist Kirsten Han wrote in a 2017 essay, \u201cthe focus is specifically on characters and faces of East Asian descent (as dictated by the book).\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is already a misrepresentation of Singapore at the most basic level, obscuring the Malay, Indian and Eurasian (and more) populations who make the country the culturally rich and unique place that it is,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA continent as massive as Asia can never be as simple as the stereotypes imposed upon us.\u201d\n\nBack in the United States, Ms. Daum, overwhelmed with the sudden wave of both praise and condemnation, was not backing down.\n\n\u201cTo everyone who says I\u2019m ignorant, I fully understand everyone\u2019s concerns and views on my dress,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI mean no harm.

In her new memoir, she writes about the trials of immigration with seriousness but also a disarming humor. Below, she discusses the onstage performances she delivered that inspired her to write the book, her admiration for the creativity of certain revolutionaries and more.\n\nWhen did you first get the idea to write this book?\n\nI\u2019ve always told anecdotes about my childhood, being an immigrant kid in Australia during the Yugoslavia wars and trying to fit in, but I never thought they would appeal to a larger audience. When I moved to New York City about four years ago, I went to a Moth story slam, where you put your name in a hat and if it\u2019s drawn out you tell a story in front of a bunch of strangers. In New York, you can be whoever you want and no one bats an eye, so I thought, what the hell? It went really well, and people were receptive to it. I thought it was cool that people identified with the themes of cultures mixing and nostalgia. I was spurred by that.\n\nI was hoping to write when I moved to New York, but the performance part I hadn\u2019t done before. That was exciting and really rewarding, because despite being introverted I really like being on stage. Being a writer, you\u2019re isolated and alone. When you\u2019re on your computer all day, no one claps for you at the end.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?\n\nAs a child, there were a lot of things I couldn\u2019t control: my parents moving us, English as a second language, the wars back home. I was really obsessed with Disney films and books that had classic narrative arcs \u2014 a beginning, middle and end. In the ones I liked the most, an outsider hero set out to do something amazing. I found, writing this book, that I still have a pretty strong need for narrative and to make sense of the world. I can\u2019t just say, \u201cThis happened, and that\u2019s it.\u201d I have to dwell on it, and come up with the beginning, middle and end, to calm myself down and find some order in chaos.

California\u2019s job-safety watchdog is looking into injuries at the company\u2019s plant in Fremont, where workers have complained about dangerous conditions.\n\nAnd federal safety experts are also investigating the fatal March 23 crash of a Tesla Model X sport-utility vehicle that was operating with its Autopilot driver-assistance system engaged.\n\nIn the conference call, Mr. Musk complained of \u201cfundamentally misleading\u201d news reports about the Autopilot system\u2019s involvement in some serious crashes. \u201cThere should be no question that Autopilot improves safety,\u201d he said.

Not all disruption is the same.\n\nIn two interviews released Tuesday, with Charlamagne and \u201cTMZ,\u201d Mr. West emphasized the importance of \u201cfree thought\u201d and \u201cfree love,\u201d trying to contextualize his acceptance of Mr. Trump as part of a broader philosophy.\n\nBut what really emerged throughout the day were other, more vulnerable notions: \u201cunsettled pain\u201d and \u201cHSP,\u201d which stands for highly sensitive person, a term he returned to several times with Charlamagne. Mr. West was defiant in defending his positions, but he also presented as someone fragile and in need of protection.\n\nThe interviews offered competing versions of lucidity. The conversation with Charlamagne, filmed two weeks ago, was an extended sit-down that showed Mr. West at his most reflective. He began by addressing the difficulties of 2016, including how his music failed to thrive on the radio. He spoke about feeling wounded by two elder figures, Jay-Z and Barack Obama, who he said had let him down.\n\nThe Charlamagne interview was visually tempered, filmed largely in a white room with a later part filmed out in nature, as the sun was setting, draping the pair in darkness. The overall effect was calm, earthen, soothing.\n\nBy contrast, the \u201cTMZ\u201d appearance was jolting, with Mr. West \u2014 unconcerned with camera angles, directing his conversation in multiple directions \u2014 smearing his reality atop the highly structured show\u2019s foundation. In a way, it served as evidence of his argument \u2014 his free thought too liquid for the rigidity of the show. It was a kind of thrilling fourth-wall breaking, the physical manifestation of Mr. West\u2019s trying to operate in an alternate reality of his making.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTime and again, he referred to our society, our world, as a \u201csimulation.\u201d Mr. Lathan pushed back vehemently: \u201cThe life that I live is as a real person, an actual person,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Louder Newsletter Every week, stay on top of the latest in pop and jazz with reviews, interviews, podcasts and more from The New York Times music critics.

One of the most dispiriting moments of his \u201cTMZ\u201d appearance came as Ms. Owens was being given room to espouse her controversial views on police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement. Mr. West sat next to her, head down, fiddling with his phone, seemingly uninterested in the minutiae. (He woke up when Ms. Owens insulted Chrissy Teigen, John Legend\u2019s wife and a close friend, interrupting with, \u201cI appreciate your free thought, but \u2026\u201d)\n\nIt showed him as a vessel, not an agent, and also less interested when not the center of attention. This isn\u2019t free thought so much a disengagement from thought. (Mr. West is planning to release an album in June, he has said \u2014 perhaps it is titled \u201cGotta Hear Both Sides.\u201d)\n\nThis passivity parallels what\u2019s been happening on his Twitter feed, where he has been posting elementary misreadings of American political history, screengrabbing text conversations that rebut the inaccuracies. Watching this play out in real time recalled reports about the early days of the Trump presidency, when competing factions would sneak provocative articles onto his desk in hopes of swaying his opinion and triggering his pugilist instincts.\n\nSeeing Mr. West treated like a pinball, or a carrier pigeon, is uncomfortable. At one point during the \u201cTMZ\u201d conversation, when he was speaking about the importance of class (as opposed to race), Ms. Owens watched him and smiled, like a teacher enamored of a prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nMr. West\u2019s recent commentary, from the absurd notions about slavery to what feels like parroting other people\u2019s talking points (\u201cObama was the opioid to our pain \u2014 he pacified us\u201d), has left fans to parse what difference if any there is between aligning with hateful ideology and merely speaking without much forethought (or sometimes post-thought). In Mr. West\u2019s telling, these provocations demonstrate a willingness to think and say something that others wouldn\u2019t dare. As ever, he finds glee in believing he knows, and can say, a thing no one else does.\n\nBut for Mr. West, that untethered glee is jumbled up with untethered hurt. Earlier on Tuesday, he posted on Twitter, \u201cWe need to have open discussions and ideas on unsettled pain.\u201d Mr. West has always been an artist who deals with pain in primal fashion. It\u2019s not a coincidence that, in the middle of his \u201cTMZ\u201d performance, he announced, \u201cThis is the most confident I\u2019ve been since my mom passed.\u201d (Donda West died in 2007, a day after undergoing multiple plastic surgery procedures. On Twitter, Mr. West announced that his forthcoming album cover would be a photo of the surgeon who performed those surgeries.)\n\nIs this the manifestation of love or something more sinister? Only Mr. West knows. Though his methods may undo him, he is striving to bring people into conversation on terms of his own comfort.\n\nAt the end of Tuesday, he posted a photo on Twitter of several people seated around a table with the caption \u201cenergy meeting. Beings from all different backgrounds.\u201d And he showed Charlamagne a 300-acre plot of land he bought with plans to build a community on it, a place where another reality might supplant the one he\u2019s currently railing against. A place where he is the truth and also the power. A place into which he might disappear, by choice or otherwise.", "title": "The Battle for Kanye West Is Happening in Real Time", "authors": ["Jon Caramanica"]}

Ever since, \u201cArcher\u201d has been pure absurdist playtime, effectively reinventing itself each season. Season 8 is subtitled \u201cDreamland,\u201d and it consists of one long coma-induced fantasy sequence, recasting the characters as the heroes and villains of a 1947 detective film \u2014 albeit one packed with far more sexual double entendres and gory mayhem than anything Humphrey Bogart ever starred in.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cProject Runway\u201d Season 9 (May 15), \u201cProject Runway,\u201d Season 10 (May 15) and \u201cMob Psycho 100\u201d Season 1 (May 22).\n\nNew Netflix Original TV Series\n\n\u2018Dear White People\u2019 Volume 2\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe first season of this semisatirical look at contemporary college life from Justin Simien was described by Netflix as a continuation of his 2014 indie film of the same name. But the TV version really just took a more granular approach to the movie\u2019s premise, shifting between the perspectives of a handful of black students at an Ivy League university rife with racial insensitivity. The second season promises to push beyond the rough outline of the original, intensifying the relationships between the characters, while considering how their campus activism is being received by cable news pundits and social-media trolls.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018A Little Help With Carol Burnett\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe veteran TV comedian Carol Burnett returns to the small screen for her own spin on Art Linkletter\u2019s old \u201ckids say the darndest things\u201d shtick. Working without a script, Burnett will invite celebrity guests to tell a panel of grade-schoolers about some small problem they\u2019re having and then see if the children have any suggestions for how to fix it. The little ones may prove they have some useful advice to offer, but the show\u2019s emphasis will be more on cuteness than on self-improvement.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018The Rain\u2019 Season 1\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nNetflix continues to expand its foreign-language programming with its first original Danish series, set in a post-apocalyptic Scandinavia where a handful of youthful human survivors have banded together and are searching for any remaining signs of civilization. Created by Jannik Tai Mosholt (who was a writer on the international hit \u201cBorgen\u201d), \u201cThe Rain\u201d will mostly be about the emotional weight of being among the last people on Earth and the difficulty in restarting society from scratch with strangers.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Evil Genius: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Diabolical Bank Heist\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 11\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the 21st century\u2019s most bizarre murders is now the subject of a true-crime docu-series. In 2003, a man wearing an explosive collar died in what was initially assumed to be a suicide bombing, until it was later revealed that he\u2019d been roped into an elaborate bank robbery scheme. \u201cEvil Genius\u201d looks back at this complex, stranger-than-fiction case, and offers new details about the fascinating characters involved.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Fauda\u2019 Season 2\n\nStarts streaming: May 24\n\nMay 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\n\u201cThe New York Times\u201d TV critic Mike Hale named this Israeli thriller one of the \u201cBest International Shows\u201d of 2017, crediting its tense and twisty plot involving a retired special agent who returns to his old job in order to track a Hamas operative he thought he\u2019d already killed. Season 1 told a fairly complete story, but new crises pop up all the time in the Middle East, offering plenty of opportunities for the second season to continue its \u201cHomeland\u201d-like exploration of conflicted characters, navigating the intricacies of one of the world\u2019s most complex regions.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019 Season 4\n\nStarts streaming: May 30\n\nMay 30 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAt the end of Season 3 of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d the ever-sunny Kimmy (played by the wonderful Ellie Kemper) got a job working at a promising new start-up. That\u2019s where she\u2019ll be at the beginning of the show\u2019s fourth season: still learning how to act like an adult, after having spent much of her youth imprisoned by a cult leader. The rest of her friends \u2014 including the aspiring entertainer Titus (Tituss Burgess), the crack pot old-school New Yorker Lillian (Carol Kane), and the former trophy wife Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski) \u2014 will continue navigating the sudden turns of fortune that this zippy, addicting sitcom puts its cast through each season.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cBill Nye Saves the World\u2019 Season 3 (May 11), \u201cTerrace House: Opening New Doors\u201d Part 2 (May 22) and \u201cTrollhunters\u201d Part 3 (May 25).\n\nNew Netflix Original Comedy Specials\n\n\u2018John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMuch of what makes John Mulaney one of the most popular comics of this era is that he puts himself in situations where he can react naturally and hilariously to the absurdities of everyday life. That\u2019s especially true in his stand-up sets \u2014 including his latest for Netflix, in which he riffs about growing up, growing older and what it was like to be a writer on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAli Wong went from being a niche-favorite comedian to becoming a sensation after her first Netflix special, \u201cBaby Cobra,\u201d shot in 2015 while she was seven months pregnant. So what did Wong do for an encore? She got pregnant again and performed a fresh stand-up set in Toronto, dealing with the horrors of parenting. Non-prudish parents will appreciate the comic\u2019s profane candor; folks without kids may be scared away from ever having sex again.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Tig Notaro: Happy to Be Here\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 22\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nEarly in her career, Tig Notaro was known for her wry, deadpan, somewhat perverse observational humor, but ever since delivering a spirited and riveting set in 2012 about her breast cancer diagnosis, Notaro has shifted toward more barbed jokes about her own life. Her latest special runs the gamut in subject matter, from common situations like marriage and parenthood to things more specific to the world of openly gay comedians.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 25\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe longtime friends Steve Martin and Martin Short both have a reputation for being among the most personally engaging people in show business, renowned for their generosity of spirit and their eclectic interests. All of that is on display in their comedy special, taped recently on their current national tour. The two sing songs, tell stories, trade self-deprecating quips, perform sketches and generally do their best to make the audience feel as if they\u2019re hanging out with two of America\u2019s favorite entertainers.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cHari Kondabolu: Warn Your Relatives\u201d (May 8).\n\nMovies New to Netflix\n\n\u2018The Simpsons Movie\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 5\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nEven given the popularity of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in syndication, the 2007 movie was a surprise smash, earning over half a billion dollars at the box office worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. That\u2019s not bad for a franchise that fans can watch pretty much every day for free. It helps that the creative team behind \u201cThe Simpsons Movie\u201d made such an effort to produce something more polished and ambitious than just a big-screen version of their television show. The film piles up some especially good gags (including some not safe for TV) in an unusually dense story, in which Homer inadvertently sets off an environmental catastrophe and must enlist his family to save their hometown.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Mulholland Dr.\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 11\n\nMay 11 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOriginally shot as a TV pilot, this Los Angeles noir from the writer-director David Lynch turned into something less slick and more surreal once he decided to add some new scenes and repurpose the old material into a feature film. What starts as an eccentric but fairly straightforward mystery story involving two upbeat aspiring actresses (played by Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring), undergoes a jarring change just past the halfway point, evolving into an elusive, nightmarish vision of Hollywood\u2019s soul-crushing fame factory.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Lost City of Z\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 29\n\nMay 29 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nBased on the nonfiction best-seller by David Grann, \u201cThe Lost City of Z\u201d stars Charlie Hunnam as the explorer Percy Fawcett, who spent much of the first few decades of the 20th century lecturing about \u2014 and mounting expeditions to find \u2014 the remains of a legendary Amazonian civilization. Although the writer-director James Gray includes scenes of peril and survival in the wilderness, this is mostly a mediative film of painterly beauty, a reflection on how freeing it can be to step away from society\u2019s demands.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cLittle Giants\u201d (May 3), \u201cDirty Grandpa\u201d (May 6), \u201cAnnabelle 2\u201d (May 8), \u201cDraft Day\u201d (May 10), \u201cMother\u2019s Day\u201d (May 11), \u201cJason Bourne\u201d (May 23) and \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot\u201d (May 28).\n\nNew Netflix Original Movies\n\n\u2018Anon\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe writer-director Andrew Niccol (\u201cGattaca,\u201d \u201cIn Time\u201d) returns to the science-fiction-thriller genre in which he\u2019s done so well. Niccol\u2019s \u201cAnon\u201d stars Clive Owen as a cop who\u2019s working in a totalitarian futuristic city where crime has been nearly eliminated by also eliminating privacy. Amanda Seyfried plays an anonymous hacker who uncovers a conspiracy, possibly related to a series of unexplained murders. Together, the government lackey and the anarchist rebel look for the truth about their world.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018End Game\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nSeparately and in collaboration, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman have been responsible for the award-winning documentaries \u201cThe Times of Harvey Milk,\u201d \u201cCommon Threads: Stories from the Quilt\u201d and \u201cThe Celluloid Closet.\u201d Their latest nonfiction project is a provocative and intimate look at how doctors, nurses and patients at two San Francisco Bay Area hospitals cope with death. Frank without ever becoming too gloomy, \u201cEnd Game\u201d urges viewers to think about our last days on Earth not as a heartbreaking tragedy but as an opportunity for true closure.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018The Kissing Booth\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 11\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nJoey King stars in this adaptation of the beloved young adult novel by Beth Reekles, which follows a virginal high schooler who finally gets a chance to date the hunky classmate she\u2019s always liked. The trouble? She worries that if she goes through with it, it will mess up her close friendship with the boy\u2019s sister. King has been making movies and TV shows for over 10 years, so it\u2019s easy forget she\u2019s still only 18. That\u2019s probably because she hasn\u2019t actually worked on many projects like this one, the lead of a rom-com aimed at her own generation.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cSometimes\u201d (May 1), \u201cForgive Us Our Debts\u201d (May 4), \u201cIbiza\u201d (May 25) and \u201cSara\u2019s Notebook\u201d (May 26).", "title": "The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix Australia in May", "authors": ["Noel Murray"]}

The ensemble cast is notoriously shaky \u2014 Keanu Reeves takes most of the heat as his surfer-toned Jonathan Harker, but Anthony Hopkins\u2019s bellicose Van Helsing is equally off \u2014 but Oldman embodies the feverish romantic spirit that animates the film, which frames vampire mythology as a love that crosses \u201coceans of time.\u201d It is also a feast for the eyes, with beautiful in-camera effects by the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and Oscar-winning costumes by Eiko Ishioka.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Duck Butter\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn this semi-improvisational lesbian romance from Miguel Arteta, a struggling actress (Alia Shawkat) and a free-spirited singer (Laia Costa) attempt an experiment in relationship acceleration. After only one date, they agree to spend 24 straight hours together, having sex every hour. Though only a touch over 90 minutes, \u201cDuck Butter\u201d starts to feel as exhausting as the day becomes for them, but Shawkat, who wrote the script with Arteta, is determined to squeeze honest, uncomfortable insights out of a situation that brings out the best and worst from both women involved.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Erin Brockovich\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAfter spending much of the \u201990s in the wilderness, trying with mixed success to capitalize on his game-changing debut feature, \u201cSex, Lies and Videotape,\u201d Steven Soderbergh reinvented himself as a Hollywood craftsman \u2014 first with \u201cOut of Sight\u201d in 1998, then with \u201cTraffic\u201d and \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d in 2000. \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d is pure movie-of-the-week docudrama material, based on the true story of a single mother (Julia Roberts) who becomes a legal assistant and helps make the case against a California power company that is polluting the groundwater. In Soderbergh\u2019s hands, however, the film is transformed into a deft, brassy vehicle for its star, more like a modern-day \u201cAlice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore\u201d than inspirational fluff.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Friends With Money\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of two Nicole Holofcener comedy-dramas released to Netflix this month, \u201cFriends With Money\u201d exemplifies the virtues of Holofcener\u2019s work, which resists catchy plot hooks in favor of carefully wrought female characters who coalesce, none-too-tidily, around down-to-earth situations. As in \u201cThe Good Girl,\u201d Jennifer Aniston departs from her glamorous public image to play a cash-poor character, this time a former teacher who\u2019s taken work as a housemaid in order to pay the bills. Her humble lifestyle introduces an awkward tension into her circle of well-to-do friends (Catherine Keener, Joan Cusack and Frances McDormand), but their lives are not as put-together as they seem.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018How High\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn the pantheon of stoner comedies, \u201cHow High\u201d tends to get less respect than staples like Cheech & Chong\u2019s \u201cUp in Smoke,\u201d \u201cDazed and Confused,\u201d \u201cHarold and Kumar Go to White Castle\u201d or \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d But there are moments of whacked-out inspiration in this Method Man-Redman collaboration, which has them discovering a magical strain of weed that increases their mental capacity and lands them in the Ivy League.

Holofcener\u2019s favorite actress, Catherine Keener, stars as the co-proprietor of a Manhattan furniture store stocked with items bought off the children of the recently deceased, usually at well below their actual value. She and her husband (Oliver Platt), who also runs the store, are attempting the same strategy in waiting for a 91-year-old woman next door to die so they can double the size of their apartment.

Through the experiences of black students at a predominantly white school, Simien and his writers have been able to identify racial injustice and micro aggressions without losing the rowdiness and small moments of self-discovery that are part of the college experience.

Beyond the personal stories, \u201cEnd Game\u201d is most concerned with changing the way people think and talk about death, in hopes that it can be approached from a healthier, more life-affirming perspective.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Hello, My Name Is Doris\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 14\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nIn this agreeably daffy comedy from Michael Showalter, Sally Field cuts loose as a shambling, eccentric, sixtysomething professional who starts to entertain romantic fantasies about a handsome, much younger co-worker (Max Greenfield) at the office. Their would-be May-December relationship, fueled by her addiction to self-help bromides, sends her on a quest to rediscover her lost youth and understand how urban millennials operate. Some of the fish-out-of-water situations are handled too broadly, but Field\u2019s energetic performance keeps it from flagging, and Showalter, who went on to direct \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d is careful not to undercut her dignity or her humanity.\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2018Cargo\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 18\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nA month after collecting mostly kind reviews at Tribeca Film Festival, this horror-drama from Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke emerges on Netflix as a compassionate twist on the zombie film, equally concerned with jump scares and matters of the heart. The \u201ccargo\u201d of the title is an infant whose zombie-infected father (Martin Freeman) is attempting to usher to safety in the Outback before he stops being her protector and transforms into a threat. As more about the zombie apocalypse is revealed, \u201cCargo\u201d turns into an allegory for the mistreatment of Aborigines, alongside a story of parental love and perseverance.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\n\u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019 Season 5\n\nStarts streaming: May 21\n\nMay 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nDan Goor and Michael Schur\u2019s Fox sitcom about the high jinks at a Brooklyn police precinct has been winning from the start, but it has also gotten funnier every season. The fifth season starts with the goof-off detective Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his hard-nosed colleague Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) in jail, where Jake survives by smuggling ramen for a gang leader. At the same time, the experience solidifies Jake\u2019s romantic relationship with straight-arrow Amy (Melissa Fumero), who\u2019s settling into to a new promotion. The standout episode is \u201cThe Box,\u201d which riffs on the interrogation scenes in \u201cHomicide: Life on the Streets,\u201d the series that inspired Andre Braugher\u2019s casting here as the super-intense precinct captain.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life\n\nStarts streaming: May 25\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe comedy legends Steve Martin and Martin Short have been touring together all year with a show that combines new sketch material with musical performances and stories about their careers in show business. \u201cAn Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life\u201d was taped during an appearance in Greenville, S.C., and it appears poised to capture their sillier side.

It\u2019s possible to leave \u201cMother!\u201d with two or three credible theories on what it\u2019s really about: Is it a biblical allegory? A statement about the birthing of an artistic idea? A comment on celebrity coupledom?

Our heroine (Audrey Tautou) seems to live in a France of long ago \u2014 allegedly 1997, but it feels more like the 1950s, with Bruno Delbonnel\u2019s evocative cinematography spinning around a glowing Montmartre.

But the TV version really just took a more granular approach to the movie\u2019s premise, shifting between the perspectives of a handful of black students at an Ivy League university rife with racial insensitivity. The second season promises to push beyond the rough outline of the original, intensifying the relationships between the characters, while considering how their campus activism is being received by cable news pundits and social-media trolls.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nFrom left, Carol Burnett and Candace Cameron Bure in \u201cA Little Help With Carol Burnett.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018A Little Help With Carol Burnett\u2019 (Season 1)\n\nStarts streaming: May 4\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe veteran TV comedian Carol Burnett returns to the small screen for her own spin on Art Linkletter\u2019s old \u201ckids say the darnedest things\u201d shtick.

Created by Jannik Tai Mosholt (who was a writer on the international hit \u201cBorgen\u201d), \u201cThe Rain\u201d will mostly be about the emotional weight of being among the last people on Earth and the difficulty in restarting society from scratch with strangers.\n\n\u2014\n\nA scene from \u201cEvil Genius: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Diabolical Bank Heist.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Evil Genius: The True Story of America\u2019s Most Diabolical Bank Heist\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 11\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nOne of the 21st century\u2019s most bizarre murders is now the subject of a true-crime docu-series.

Season 1 told a fairly complete story, but new crises pop up all the time in the Middle East, offering plenty of opportunities for the second season to continue its \u201cHomeland\u201d-like exploration of conflicted characters, navigating the intricacies of one of the world\u2019s most complex regions.\n\n\u2014\n\nEllie Kemper in \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d Eric Liebowitz/Netflix\n\n\u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019 (Season 4)\n\nStarts streaming: May 30\n\nMay 30 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAt the end of Season 3 of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d the ever-sunny Kimmy (played by the wonderful Ellie Kemper) got a job working at a promising new start-up.

The rest of her friends \u2014 including the aspiring entertainer Titus (Tituss Burgess), the crackpot old-school New Yorker Lillian (Carol Kane), and the former trophy wife Jacqueline (Jane Krakowski) \u2014 will continue navigating the sudden turns of fortune that this zippy, addicting sitcom puts its cast through each season.\u2014\n\nNetflix Original Comedy Specials\n\nJohn Mulaney in \u201cJohn Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nMuch of what makes John Mulaney one of the most popular comics of this era is that he puts himself in situations where he can react naturally and hilariously to the absurdities of everyday life. That\u2019s especially true in his stand-up sets \u2014 including his latest for Netflix, in which he riffs about growing up, growing older and what it was like to be a writer on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nAli Wong in \u201cAli Wong: Hard Knock Wife.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Ali Wong: Hard Knock Wife\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 13\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nAli Wong went from being a niche-favorite comedian to becoming a sensation after her first Netflix special, \u201cBaby Cobra,\u201d shot in 2015 while she was seven months pregnant. So what did Wong do for an encore? She got pregnant again and performed a fresh stand-up set in Toronto, dealing with the horrors of parenting. Non-prudish parents will appreciate the comic\u2019s profane candor; folks without kids may be scared away from ever having sex again.\n\n\u2014\n\n0\n\nTig Notaro in \u201cTig Notaro Happy To Be Here.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Tig Notaro: Happy To Be Here\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 22\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nEarly in her career, Tig Notaro was known for her wry, deadpan, somewhat perverse observational humor, but ever since delivering a spirited and riveting set in 2012 about her breast cancer diagnosis, Notaro has shifted toward more barbed jokes about her own life. Her latest special runs the gamut in subject matter, from common situations like marriage and parenthood to things more specific to the world of openly gay comedians.\n\n\u2014\n\nSteve Martin, left, and Marin Short in \u201cSteve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.\u201d Netflix\n\n\u2018Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 25\n\nSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nThe longtime friends Steve Martin and Martin Short both have a reputation for being among the most personally engaging people in show business, renowned for their generosity of spirit and their eclectic interests. All of that is on display in their comedy special, taped recently on their current national tour. The two sing songs, tell stories, trade self-deprecating quips, perform sketches and generally do their best to make the audience feel as if they\u2019re hanging out in person with two of America\u2019s favorite entertainers.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlso of interest: \u201cHari Kondabolu: Warn Your Relatives\u201d (May 8).\n\nNew to Amazon Prime Video\n\nHaley Joel Osment, left, and Frances O\u2019Connor in \u201cA.I.

Also memorable is Jude Law, who is eerily exhilarating as the cyber love man Gigolo Joe. The unsung hero of the story, however, is the long-suffering super-toy Teddy. Together, these robots raise some deep philosophical issues that can also break your heart.\n\n\u2014\n\nJohn Hurt in \u201cThe Elephant Man.\u201d Paramount Pictures\n\n\u2018The Elephant Man\u2019\n\nStarts streaming: May 1\n\nMay 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like\n\nJohn Hurt gives one of his most deeply moving performances, playing a gentle man with profound facial disfigurement who is trapped in the hellish life of a Victorian sideshow freak. The man is rescued by a kindly physician (Anthony Hopkins) who puts him on display for two new kinds of audiences, first his fellow doctors, then the curious snobs of London high society.

A worm will not raise its alert little head \u2014 with its strangely sentient aspect \u2014 to meet its finder\u2019s gaze.\n\nRed-backed salamanders are the perfect size for this mistaken identity. An adult may measure anywhere from two to almost five inches long, but observant children often discover far smaller young measuring just a fraction of that length. This is because of an interesting quirk in their life history. Unlike many amphibians, red-backs do not return to water to lay eggs. Instead, they find a suitable spot among the damp leaves under rotting woodland logs. The young hatch as tiny, well-formed red-backed salamanders \u2014 miniatures of their parents \u2014 and live under the same logs and debris until they finally crawl off to colonize other areas of the local woods. Around the city they can be found in many woodlands on Staten Island, as well as in the Bronx and Queens. There are even small populations in Brooklyn.\n\nTwo forms of Plethodon cinereus can be found in our area. One is a steely dark gray with tiny white specks peppered all over its body; this is the lead-back phase. The other form, the red-back phase, has a broad red or orangy stripe from its snout to the tip of its tail. Both varieties have a white and gray speckled belly and the same elongate dimensions.\n\nRemarkably, red-backed salamanders lack lungs; they breathe through their thin skins. This is far more than just a metabolic oddity; it is a factor which delineates the salamander\u2019s life. Red-backs must always remain moist to breathe. This is less of a problem during the wet spring months, when these salamanders can be found crawling through the leaf litter and even climbing the roots of mossy tree trunks in search of tiny insects, worms and other prey. A salamander\u2019s life becomes increasingly proscribed during the drier summer months, leaving them to forage under logs or in small burrows.\n\nThough lunglessness may seem strange, or even primitive, these animals have obviously been successful. Red-backed salamanders are one of the most abundant species in our northeastern woodlands, and can be found from southern Canada to North Carolina and west to Missouri. By some estimates, populations of these salamanders can reach densities of nearly a thousand individuals per acre. It is possible that another physical oddity has helped the salamander persevere. A red-back salamander has the ability to shed its tail if it is grabbed or it feels threatened. The tail then continues to wriggle for several minutes. This is thought to keep a predator\u2019s attention while the real meal escapes. Though it\u2019s not quite the same, the tail regenerates, leaving the salamander almost as good as new.\n\nSadly, because of habitat fragmentation and a host of other environmental factors, the species is not entirely thriving in New York City woodlands, where finding a red-back, staring back sagely from under a freshly rolled log with its protruding ebony eyes, is worth noting.", "title": "The Creepy Magic of the Red-Backed Salamander", "authors": ["Dave Taft"]}

Then he saw an interview the friend gave to a Turkish newspaper, complimenting the government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI just talked to him the other night,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cHe said, \u2018What else can we say here?\u2019 He even said, \u2018If you keep silent, maybe you can return and they will not do anything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat is not possible, Sukur said.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands and thousands of people living in this situation,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so selfish to just defend my own rights, to just keep my benefits over everything else. I would lose all respect to myself.\u201d\n\nThe Long-Term Plan\n\nSukur and his family regularly speak to his parents through FaceTime. His father, 77, is out of jail but fighting cancer. His mother thanks God for the people who invented her phone so that she can see her son\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cLast Friday my father says to my son, \u2018I miss you,\u2019 \u201d Sukur said in English, before turning to Turkish to finish the story. \u201c \u2018I want to hug you.\u2019 And then my son started to cry, and my father was crying, and we were all crying. I know there are millions of people living in these conditions in the U.S. for a very long time, unable to go home and hug their loved ones.\u201d\n\nSukur sees himself as an immigrant, trying to build his own American dream for his family. His visa expires in 2020, he said, and he has applied for green cards for his family and himself. He is anxious about getting them. His long-term plan in the United States is not to run a cafe, but to coach and build a sports academy, like he thought he would do in Turkey. Turkish friends have considered supporting him but are nervous because of the politics a world away.\n\n\u201cAt the moment there are a couple of investors,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cBut now people are afraid to be seen with me. But I\u2019m also open to work with American investors and sportsmen. I feel like I can contribute. I have a lot of networks, in Europe and in the world. I think I can contribute a lot.\u201d\n\nLike most of Sukur\u2019s customers, not all the neighbors know who he is \u2014 or was. They see him and his family as people from Turkey, making a go of it here.\n\n\u201cOne of my neighbors came here to my bakery, and people were taking pictures with me,\u201d Sukur said. \u201cHe asked me: \u2018Why do they take pictures with you?

This would involve raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, providing universal basic income and having the federal government provide a paying job to all who want one.\n\nI would disagree with this agenda on pragmatic policy grounds, but at least it would be humane. It\u2019s a positive, universalist agenda that aims at social solidarity and national cohesion \u2014 we\u2019re all in this together. It would be, as Sheri Berman writes in Dissent, enchanted with a radical idealism.\n\nNonetheless, I don\u2019t think this is the leftism we will wind up with. Tribalism is in the air, on the left as well as on the right. It is based on a scarcity mentality, the idea that life is a zero-sum war between us and them. It emphasizes division and conflict, not solidarity and cohesion. It draws out the authoritarian tendencies in any movement. On the right, tribalism brings us the ethnic authoritarianism of Donald Trump. On the left, it seems likely to bring us the economic authoritarianism of a North American version of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nYou can see authoritarianism entering the left through two avenues. The first is nationalism. Not long ago, most of the American left tended to think transnationally \u2014 partly because problems like climate change are global, partly because it\u2019s hard to regulate a global economy nation by nation, partly because progressives used to be psychologically averse to nationalism.\n\nBut national sovereignty is not withering away. Left-wing hostility toward European Union-type multilateral organizations is at record highs. Now a lot of progressive economic thinking is nakedly nationalistic. Bernie Sanders in 2015 derided a more open immigration policy as a \u201cKoch brothers proposal.\u201d It\u2019s the old xenophobia \u2014 us or them, screw or be screwed. On trade, the left-wing populists sound like Trump.\n\nThe second stream fueling economic authoritarianism is identity politics. It used to be that big political divides were defined by economic interests; now, the cultural dog wags the economic tail. Identity politics defines the core political divides. When many progressives talk about economics these days, they take the habits of mind they developed when talking about identity groups and apply them to economic groups.\n\nIt\u2019s the same Manichaeism: oppressor versus oppressed, privileged versus underprivileged, hegemon versus victim. Conflict is inevitable. The apocalypse is near. Preserve the purity of the group. Shut down the other side. It\u2019s sectarian politics to the nth degree.\n\nIn Venezuela we saw how a politician used demagogic sectarian rhetoric to establish an authoritarian regime and then destroy a people. I\u2019m sure many of my left-wing friends believe that that sort of tribal us/them mentality won\u2019t hijack and corrupt their own movement. But as someone who lived through the last 30 years of conservatism, I\u2019m here to tell you, it can. Politicians these days have decided they don\u2019t need the thinkers anymore.", "title": "Opinion | The Future of the American Left", "authors": []}

Phillips found evidence in plantation records and Southern travelogues that bolstered the book\u2019s benign interpretation of slavery, while downplaying evidence that did not. In his hands, plantations became idyllic sites where white families had modeled the habits of civilized life for their childlike black charges. \u201cThe plantations,\u201d Phillips wrote, \u201cwere the best schools yet invented for the mass training of that sort of inert and backward people which the bulk of the American negroes represented.\u201d\n\nAccording to Phillips, slaveholders provided the enslaved with comfortable living quarters and plentiful rations and eschewed physical discipline. They rarely sold slaves, especially if it meant breaking up families. Slave owners\u2019 rule \u201cwas benevolent in intent\u201d and \u201cbeneficial in effect.\u201d\n\nPhillips\u2019s use of the passive voice \u2014 \u201cin March the corn fields were commonly planted\u201d \u2014 further distanced the reader from slaves\u2019 coerced labor. Enslaved African-Americans, in turn, displayed gratitude and loyalty to their masters. Phillips concluded that, while slavery may have been economically inefficient, \u201cthe relations on both sides were felt to be based on pleasurable responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Negro Slavery\u201d won widespread acclaim in the North and the South. Reviewers praised Phillips for his thorough research, charming style and lack of bias. In the words of the historian John David Smith, an expert on Phillips, the book served as \u201cthe definitive account of the peculiar institution\u201d from World War I into the 1950s.\n\nThe book set the tone for the treatment of slavery in classrooms and textbooks across the country. \u201cThere was much to be said for slavery as a transition status between barbarism and civilization,\u201d maintained a 1930 best seller, echoing Phillips almost verbatim. \u201cThe majority of slaves were \u2026 apparently happy.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, however, Phillips had his critics, who insisted on telling a more truthful, unvarnished history of slavery. W.E.B. Du Bois wrote a scathing review of \u201cAmerican Negro Slavery,\u201d observing, \u201cIt is a defense of American slavery, a defense of an institution which was at best a mistake and at worst a crime.\u201d Drawing on interviews with ex-slaves, sources Phillips rejected, the historian Frederic Bancroft published a 1931 book that exploded Phillips\u2019s misrepresentations of the domestic slave trade.\n\nPhillips\u2019s critics grew more vocal in the 1950s and 1960s, as a new generation of scholars challenged his benign reading of slavery and the racism that stained almost every page of \u201cAmerican Negro Slavery.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Historian Behind Slavery Apologists Like Kanye West", "authors": []}

He said Mr. Cohen was trying to help Mr. Trump\u2019s family \u201cto save their marriage \u2014 not their marriage so much as their reputation.\u201d But then, muddying that message, Mr. Giuliani said, \u201cImagine if that came out on Oct. 15, 2016, in the middle of the last debate with Hillary Clinton.\u201d Separately, in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Giuliani acknowledged that \u201cit could overlap as a campaign problem,\u201d but reiterated that Mr. Trump was not thinking of the payment as a campaign expense.\n\nIt could work in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor that he and his lawyers had a long history of using legal avenues to try to fight off damaging claims. That history could form the basis of an argument that Mr. Cohen\u2019s payment to Ms. Clifford \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s reimbursement of it \u2014 would have happened whether or not he was running for president.\n\n\u201cIf this was a first-time candidate without a public reputation, then it would be harder to argue that it wasn\u2019t an expenditure to influence an election,\u201d said Charles Spies, a Republican election lawyer who worked in support of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, the former Florida governor Jeb Bush, in the 2016 Republican primary. \u201cBut Donald Trump has a long record of aggressively defending his reputation from attacks.\u201d\n\nThat track record could prove less compelling if the authorities obtain evidence that Mr. Cohen privately discussed the payment in the context of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Last month, federal law enforcement officials in New York raided Mr. Cohen\u2019s office and hotel room, carting away numerous documents and electronic devices that are now the subject of a fight over attorney-client privilege. One of the things they are apparently investigating is the payment to Ms. Clifford.\n\nIf the payment was a loan, is Cohen out of trouble?\n\nNot if the loan was intended to influence the election. Campaigns routinely take out large loans from banks when they\u2019re running short of cash ahead of elections. But federal election laws require that those loans come from banks as routine business transactions. Personal loans count as contributions that are still legally capped at the individual contribution limit \u2014 even if they are later repaid in full, according to the Federal Election Commission website.\n\nWhen would this have had to be reported, and by whom?\n\nIf the payment were to be deemed campaign-related, the Trump campaign should have disclosed it in its periodic filings with the F.E.C., as soon as Mr. Trump or his campaign learned that Mr. Cohen had made it. If Mr. Trump or his campaign only discovered the payment after the fact, they should have amended their previous filings to reflect the expenditure, and any reimbursements to Mr. Cohen. The Wall Street Journal first reported the $130,000 payment to Ms. Clifford in January, and Mr. Trump has not moved to amend his disclosures.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

His 2017 form \u2014 which he signed in June, certifying it was \u201ctrue, complete and correct\u201d \u2014 does not list any outstanding loan from Mr. Cohen, campaign-related or otherwise. When he spoke with The Times on Thursday, Mr. Giuliani did not answer why the money was not listed on the president\u2019s financial disclosure form.\n\nWhat could the penalties be?\n\nWhen campaign finance violations are punished, they typically result in fines by the Federal Election Commission that are pegged to the size of the unlawful contribution or expenditure. The Justice Department can also prosecute willful violations of election laws, or willful false statements on the federal personal financial disclosure forms, which are felonies and can result in up to five years in prison.\n\nThere is little chance that the department would file charges against Mr. Trump, regardless of what the evidence shows, because its Office of Legal Counsel has opined that the Constitution makes sitting presidents immune from prosecution.\n\nBut Mr. Cohen, after the raid last month, is under intense legal pressure.", "title": "The Legal Issues Raised by the Stormy Daniels Payment, Explained", "authors": ["Charlie Savage", "Kenneth P.

So did switching to Nashville, the team closest to Atlanta. The Predators capitalized on the void by offering weekend ticket packages to abandoned Thrashers fans.

Angry at the league and at Commissioner Gary Bettman, who he felt did not do enough to keep the Thrashers in Atlanta, McReynolds tried cheering for Nashville. It felt strange, artificial.\n\nIn 2012, about halfway through the Jets\u2019 first season back in Winnipeg, McReynolds had his left shoulder tattooed with the Thrashers\u2019 logo.

When he wears his Thrashers hat, with a bird gripping a hockey stick, people ask whether it\u2019s a skateboarding company.\n\nWithout that kinship, Kitchens said, rooting for the Jets feels like a private endeavor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not about to go to work and say, \u2018How about those Jets last night?\u2019\u201d said Kitchens, a union pipe fitter from Stockbridge, Ga. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018Who?\u2019\u201d\n\nLipman had long wanted to visit Winnipeg.

For the occasion, Lipman wore a navy Jets jersey \u2014 his dress blues, he said \u2014 and, in a show of gratitude, was presented with a trove of Jets paraphernalia.\n\n\u201cI got all kinds of nice Winnipeg booty,\u201d Lipman said.\n\nAn unopened Jacob Trouba bobblehead sat behind the bar in his basement, where Lipman watched Game 3 on Tuesday on a television topped by another bobblehead, that of Jets center Mark Scheifele. From his seat in the arena, Hardy called Lipman on FaceTime, letting him absorb the pregame atmosphere.\n\nHis blazer long discarded, draped over an easy chair, Lipman agonized as Nashville scored the first three goals (you\u2019ve gotta have that!), rejoiced as Winnipeg scored the next four (that\u2019s more like it!) and kicked the coffee table when the Predators equalized in the third period.\n\nWith six minutes remaining, he rose from the couch to wave his \u201cWe Are Winnipeg\u201d rally towel and rub the Scheifele bobblehead for good luck.

At 15 she\u2019s deemed old enough to get herself to and from school on her own, and this is when she encounters the parking lot attendant. Ayale is in his 30s or 40s, and seems to be the unofficial mayor of a tightknit Ethiopian-American community in Boston. She finds him magnetic, and she\u2019s hardly alone; he seems to have attracted a group of parking lot attendant disciples. She begins dropping by the lot after school. He\u2019s a mysterious figure. She and the other acolytes harbor a mild obsession with his origins. (\u201cWe knew that Ayale was not an only child because there had once been a sister: The barber at Egleston Square had some friends who sold injera out of the 7-Eleven in Jamaica Plain, who feuded with a man named Jerry, who had done her tax returns.\u201d) Before long, she\u2019s delivering packages for him, and a trap begins to close around her.\n\nTamirat has an excellent eye for the minor detail that becomes important in retrospect. Of Ayale, the narrator notes, \u201cI was given to understand that he had a closet full of unworn elegance, all of it awaiting the day sartorial splendor would be required,\u201d which isn\u2019t chilling until much later, when the extent of his ambitions becomes clear. Tamirat is equally gifted at a strain of absurdism that\u2019s delightfully reminiscent of both Kafka and Jonathan Lethem, as when the narrator finds herself being followed simultaneously by the Boston police and an informal force of informants who work for Ayale: \u201cEthiopians seemed to circle Americans, who seemed to circle Ethiopians, who seemed to circle Americans, ad infinitum, on my walks back and forth, to and from the bus stop, the convenience store, the laundromat. I wondered if it seemed to anyone else like our usually quiet street was now teeming with silent people, rigidly checking the time, window-shopping, craning their necks for the streetcar, debating between spicy wings and Subway.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nTamirat is an extremely talented writer. Her prose is sharp, incisive and often very funny. There are dazzling passages. But as a novel, \u201cThe Parking Lot Attendant\u201d suffers from an oddly under-edited quality. There are distracting incongruities throughout, sentences that work perfectly well on their own but serve to undermine aspects of character development or plot, and thus the overall cohesion of the novel.\n\nThis is the narrator at 16: \u201cAround the same time, my father and I started getting used to each other and I joined a summer theater company, where I learned stage fighting.\u201d Wait, the reader might be forgiven for thinking, you and your father started getting used to each other? Just now, when you\u2019re 16? But you\u2019ve been living with him since you were 6, and we\u2019ve already established the friendly weekly brunch routine. Elsewhere, the narrator tells us that her father is set in his ways: \u201cAny potential new tendency, foodstuff or pair of pants is deliberated over for weeks,\u201d because he\u2019s \u201ca man of habit.\u201d Is he, though? Because it seems as if he replaced church with brunch more or less on a whim. Before meeting Ayale, the narrator tells us, \u201cI might have actually believed my parents and myself to be the only Ethiopians in the world.\u201d It\u2019s a poignant expression of isolation. It would make more sense if those church services \u2014 even though the narrator attended them infrequently \u2014 hadn\u2019t been Ethiopian Orthodox.\n\nWe are reminded every so often that the Boston segments are in the past. In her uneasy exile on the island of B\u2014, the narrator tells us that Ayale \u201cremains the greatest man I\u2019ll ever know, and unlike some, I\u2019m not ashamed to say it.\u201d But this future narration is coming from a point after the narrator\u2019s interviews with the Boston Police Department reveal the strong possibility that her hero committed unspeakable crimes, and the near certainty that he plans to commit more in the future. \u201cSometimes,\u201d the narrator concludes, \u201cthe best people are the worst for us to love.\u201d The problem isn\u2019t the sentiment, which rings perfectly true. (Who among us hasn\u2019t fallen in love with the wrong person, at least once?) The problem is that by the time she\u2019s looking back at Boston from the vantage point of the island of B\u2014, the notion of Ayale being ranked among the \u201cbest people,\u201d let alone the \u201cgreatest man,\u201d is so disorienting that the sentence reads like a holdover from an earlier draft of the book.", "title": "The Mysterious \u2018Parking Lot Attendant\u2019 at the Center of a Web of Intrigue", "authors": []}

There is no good evidence that abstinence-only education prevents or delays young people from having sex, leads them to have fewer sexual partners or reduces rates of teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. And given that almost all Americans engage in premarital sex, this vision of an abstinent-outside-of-marriage world is simply at odds with reality.\n\nAbstinence-only education also spreads misinformation.

The report makes clear that the resurgence of religion since the end of Communism has played out differently in the predominantly Orthodox countries of Eastern Europe than among the Catholic states of Central Europe. In the Orthodox countries like Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, there has been an upsurge of religious identity, but levels of religious practice are comparatively low. People define themselves as Orthodox Christians though they rarely go to church or read the Bible. For them, Orthodox identity is bound up with national identity, feelings of pride and cultural superiority. Sociologists call it \u201cbelonging without believing.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Pope vs. the Populists", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "The problem is that most orders in the securities and commodities markets go unfilled, so canceling orders cannot be criminal just by itself. A 2013 study by the Securities and Exchange Commission found that fewer than 5 percent of orders placed on stock exchanges were filled. So simply showing that an investor canceled trades on a regular basis may not be enough to prove the intent necessary for a spoofing violation.\n\nThe first spoofing conviction involved Michael Coscia, who was charged with creating an algorithm to enter and cancel large orders in milliseconds. Mr. Coscia would simultaneously put in small orders that would be profitable once other traders reacted to the artificial ones. In that case, the government focused on the large number of orders his algorithm generated, making his testimony that he wanted every order filled questionable. The jury returned its guilty verdict after only one hour of deliberation, showing that it found the statistical evidence of large-scale order cancellations persuasive.\n\nThe prosecution of Mr. Flotron, though, started badly for the government. Jeffrey Alker Meyer, a federal district judge in New Haven, dismissed six of the seven charges in February. The judge found that the trades identified in those charges occurred only in Chicago, where the commodities exchanges operate, so under the constitutional venue requirement no crime was committed in Connecticut. That left just the conspiracy charge.\n\nTo prove spoofing, the Justice Department relied on two traders who worked for Mr. Flotron to explain how he taught them to enter and then cancel orders to influence the direction of the commodity prices. Both testified after receiving non-prosecution agreements from the government, which meant their claims were open to question about whether they got a deal to point the finger at Mr. Flotron.\n\nIn Mr. Flotron\u2019s case, there was no algorithm or automated trading for the government to point to. Instead, his orders were placed manually, and some were kept open for up to a minute. That made it more difficult for prosecutors to show that his goal was to manipulate other traders, when there was at least a chance the order would be filled.", "title": "The Problem With Prosecuting \u2018Spoofing\u2019", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "text": "What was your opinion of Mr. Comey during the transition?\n\nThe questions about Mr. Comey relate to whether Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last year to shield Mr. Flynn, or anyone else, from prosecution. Mr. Trump has denied that, saying he fired Mr. Comey because of his mishandling of the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server.\n\nThis question is important because, if Mr. Trump truly was upset about the Clinton investigation, he would have shown an early distaste for Mr. Comey.\n\nWhat did you think about Mr. Comey\u2019s intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, 2017, about Russian election interference?\n\nThe briefing revealed that American intelligence agencies had concluded that Russian operatives meddled in the election to hurt Mrs. Clinton and to boost Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast doubt on these conclusions and said he believes the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who denies any interference.\n\nWhat was your reaction to Mr. Comey\u2019s briefing that day about other intelligence matters?\n\nThis question addresses documents written by a retired British spy, Christopher Steele, who said that Russia had gathered compromising information on Mr. Trump. The documents, which became known as the Steele Dossier, also claim that the Trump campaign had ties to the Russian government. Mr. Comey privately briefed Mr. Trump about these documents.\n\nWhat was the purpose of your Jan. 27, 2017, dinner with Mr. Comey, and what was said?\n\nA few weeks after his briefing, Mr. Comey was called to the White House for a private dinner. Mr. Comey\u2019s notes say that Mr. Trump raised concerns about the Steele Dossier and said he needed loyalty from his F.B.I. director. This question touches on Mr. Trump\u2019s true motivation for firing Mr. Comey: Was he dismissed because he was not loyal and would not shut down an F.B.I. investigation?\n\nWhat was the purpose of your Feb. 14, 2017, meeting with Mr. Comey, and what was said?\n\nThat was a key moment. Mr. Comey testified that the president told him, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u201d Mr. Trump has denied this.\n\nWhat did you know about the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation into Mr. Flynn and Russia in the days leading up to Mr. Comey\u2019s testimony on March 20, 2017?\n\nMr. Comey\u2019s testimony publicly confirmed that the F.B.I. was investigating members of the Trump campaign for possible coordination with Russia. Mr. Mueller wants to know what role that revelation played in Mr. Comey\u2019s firing.\n\nWhat did you do in reaction to the March 20 testimony? Describe your contacts with intelligence officials.\n\nIn the aftermath, The Post reported, Mr. Trump asked the United States\u2019 top intelligence official, Daniel Coats, to pressure Mr. Comey to back off his investigation. Mr. Mueller wants to ask Mr. Trump about his contacts with Mr. Coats as well as the C.I.A.\u2019s director at the time, Mike Pompeo, and the National Security Agency\u2019s director, Michael S. Rogers. The conversations could reflect Mr. Trump\u2019s growing frustration with Mr. Comey \u2014 not about the Clinton case, but about his refusal to shut down the Russia inquiry.\n\nWhat did you think and do in reaction to the news that the special counsel was speaking to Mr. Rogers, Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Coats?\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Mueller knows something specific about Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction to these interviews, but the question shows that Mr. Mueller is keenly interested in how Mr. Trump responded to each step of his investigation.\n\nWhat was the purpose of your calls to Mr. Comey on March 30 and April 11, 2017?\n\nMr. Comey said that Mr. Trump called twice to ask him to say publicly that he was not under F.B.I. investigation. In the second call, Mr. Comey said, the president added: \u201cI have been very loyal to you, very loyal. We had that thing, you know.\u201d\n\nWhat was the purpose of your April 11, 2017, statement to Maria Bartiromo?\n\nWhile the White House ultimately said Mr. Comey was fired for breaking with Justice Department policy and discussing the Clinton investigation, Mr. Trump expressed no such qualms in an interview with Ms. Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. \u201cDirector Comey was very, very good to Hillary Clinton, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he weren\u2019t, she would be, right now, going to trial.\u201d\n\nWhat did you think and do about Mr. Comey\u2019s May 3, 2017, testimony?\n\nIn this Senate appearance, Mr. Comey described his handling of the Clinton investigation in detail. Mr. Comey was fired soon after. Mr. Mueller\u2019s question suggests he wants to know why Mr. Trump soured.\n\nRegarding the decision to fire Mr. Comey: When was it made? Why? Who played a role?\n\nOver the past several months, Mr. Mueller has asked White House officials for the back story, and whether the public justification was accurate. He will be able to compare Mr. Trump\u2019s answers to what he has learned elsewhere.\n\nWhat did you mean when you told Russian diplomats on May 10, 2017, that firing Mr. Comey had taken the pressure off?\n\nThe day after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, Mr. Trump met with Russian officials in the Oval Office. There, The Times revealed, Mr. Trump suggested he had fired Mr. Comey because of the pressure from the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d\n\nWhat did you mean in your interview with Lester Holt about Mr. Comey and Russia?\n\nShortly after firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump undercut his own argument when he told NBC News that he had been thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired Mr. Comey.", "title": "The Questions Mueller Wants to Ask Trump About Obstruction, and What They Mean", "authors": []}

Yet again, antitrust enforcers have not stopped these new robber barons from buying up their nascent competitors. Facebook swallowed Instagram and WhatsApp; Google swallowed DoubleClick and Waze. This has allowed these firms to achieve near-monopolies over new services based on user data, such as training machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. As a result, antitrust authorities allowed the creation of the world\u2019s most powerful oligopoly and the rampant exploitation of user data.\n\nAccording to one study, the power of firms to raise prices above the competitive level or cut wages below it increased more than threefold from 1980 to 2014.\n\nTo revive economic growth and restore equality, we need to update the solutions first developed a century ago. Then, the focus was on breaking up monopolies, prohibiting cartels and blocking mergers. These laws helped advance broadly shared prosperity, but owners of capital devised strategies to evade them. These strategies must be addressed with new regulatory approaches.\n\nInstitutional investors need to be blocked from further expansion and forced to restructure.

But to me, reading Hanson and Srinivasan together offers a good case study in how intellectual eccentrics \u2014 like socialists and populists in politics \u2014 can surface issues and problems that lurk beneath the surface of more mainstream debates.\n\nBy this I mean that as offensive or utopian the redistribution of sex might sound, the idea is entirely responsive to the logic of late-modern sexual life, and its pursuit would be entirely characteristic of a recurring pattern in liberal societies.\n\nFirst, because like other forms of neoliberal deregulation the sexual revolution created new winners and losers, new hierarchies to replace the old ones, privileging the beautiful and rich and socially adept in new ways and relegating others to new forms of loneliness and frustration.\n\nSecond, because in this new landscape, and amid other economic and technological transformations, the sexes seem to be struggling generally to relate to one another, with social and political chasms opening between them and not only marriage and family but also sexual activity itself in recent decline.\n\nThird, because the culture\u2019s dominant message about sex is still essentially Hefnerian, despite certain revisions attempted by feminists since the heyday of the Playboy philosophy \u2014 a message that frequency and variety in sexual experience is as close to a summum bonum as the human condition has to offer, that the greatest possible diversity in sexual desires and tastes and identities should be not only accepted but cultivated, and that virginity and celibacy are at best strange and at worst pitiable states. And this master narrative, inevitably, makes both the new inequalities and the decline of actual relationships that much more difficult to bear \u2026\n\n\u2026 which in turn encourages people, as ever under modernity, to place their hope for escape from the costs of one revolution in a further one yet to come, be it political, social or technological, which will supply if not the promised utopia at least some form of redress for the many people that progress has obviously left behind.\n\nThere is an alternative, conservative response, of course \u2014 namely, that our widespread isolation and unhappiness and sterility might be dealt with by reviving or adapting older ideas about the virtues of monogamy and chastity and permanence and the special respect owed to the celibate.\n\nBut this is not the natural response for a society like ours.

He arrives at the nameless town\u2019s inn with \u201ca roast chicken wrapped in blue paper,\u201d which a servant carries in after him like a bridal train. Cabbage, brains, pickles and puff pastry follow in the dining room, dished out by a timid floor boy who also furnishes a menu of marks: local grandees with large estates and many serfs. The next morning, he rouses his coachman and embarks.\n\nA disaster capitalist avant la lettre, Chichikov circles the province like a hungry buzzard. He scours the papers for news of fire, famine or epidemic \u2014 anything that might yield a bumper crop of souls in legal limbo. His spree has an almost gustatory zest; as one gentleman exclaims amid tense negotiations, \u201cReally, for you a human soul is the same as a stewed turnip.\u201d\n\nIf the archetypal trickster is an operator, his game a stylish arithmetic of self-multiplication, Chichikov is more like a human zero. Depending on the situation, he can act as flatterer, sober man of business, pious patriot, bon vivant or bully. A man without qualities, he congeals on the first page from a fog of narratorial ambivalence: \u201cIn the britzka [carriage] sat a gentleman, not handsome, but also not bad-looking, neither too fat nor too thin; you could not have said he was old, yet neither was he all that young.\u201d Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s book on Gogol describes the character more pithily: He is \u201ca soap bubble blown by the devil.\u201d\n\nThe brilliance of Gogol\u2019s humor is the way it seizes not on excess but on emptiness. There are, to be sure, the usual \u201ctypes\u201d of social satire. Chichikov does business with a frightened widow; a miserly hoarder who picks through his own serfs\u2019 garbage; a violent, egotistic gambling addict; a kissy young couple who read English Romantic poetry while their estate goes to ruin. Wrath, sloth, cowardice and pride all have seats at \u201cDead Souls\u201d\u2019s picaresque buffet. But animating them is a force that often eludes the caricaturist\u2019s pen: quiet, patient, determined and \u201cdecent\u201d greed.\n\nChichikov does have one definitive feature: He is \u201can acquirer.\u201d The most cherished item in his possession is a writing box where he keeps the ledger of his spectral peasants. Opening it in what is perhaps his only moment of passion, he rhapsodically daydreams about their lives and deaths, revealing a narrative impulse that also colors his back story. Chichikov was once an official in the customs department, so thorough that his superiors considered him \u201ca devil, not a man: He found things in wheels, shafts, horses\u2019 ears and all sorts of other places where no author would even dream of going, and where no one but customs officials are allowed to go.\u201d\n\nOr at least no author but Gogol. He cleverly implies that his own sensibility \u2014 playful, minutely observant, ticklishly alert to life\u2019s \u201cterrible, stupendous mire of trivia\u201d \u2014 is exactly what\u2019s needed to detect a swindler like Chichikov. His macabre enterprise, so dependent on the landowners\u2019 self-interested incuriosity, disintegrates under Gogol\u2019s exuberant scrutiny. His metaphors evolve so ceaselessly as to beget miniature scenes: If the face of a passer-by resembles a Moldavian gourd, then before the sentence is out, that gourd has been cut and strung into a balalaika, played by a \u201csnappy 20-year-old lad\u201d for an audience of \u201cwhitenecked lasses.\u201d Or, at a party of provincial bigwigs, men in black tie bustle about \u201cas flies dart about a gleaming white sugar loaf in the hot summertime of July.\u201d Humor, like a fly\u2019s multifaceted eye, grants second sight.\n\nThe townspeople, in contrast, are blinded by melodrama. When they discover Chichikov\u2019s doings, they cannot believe the pettiness of his motivation, and decide there must be some more profound reason for his activities. They speculate that he might be a kidnapper after the governor\u2019s daughter, or even the escaped Napoleon in disguise \u2014 anything but an inconspicuous crook with nothing but money in mind. Like the millions of Americans who prefer lurid conspiracy theories to the boring details of corruption and greed, they fail to imagine his lack of imagination; or, as Gogol admonishes his readers, \u201cYou would prefer not to see human poverty revealed!\u201d", "title": "The Russian Comic Writer Who\u2019s an Antidote to Mad Times", "authors": []}

He just wanted to be a hockey player. It was a role bestowed on him.\u201d\n\nThe grainy highlights of his pro career are filled mostly with big hits and bare-knuckle fights. Hopes to come back after being knocked down for the last time did not last long.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cOnce he started to work out a little bit, he told me, \u2018Something\u2019s wrong, I don\u2019t think I can play,\u2019 \u201d John Parker said. \u201cHe went from being, \u2018I\u2019m willing to fight, I\u2019m willing to hit someone,\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t want to get hit.\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t him.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s brothers said he permanently lost his sense of smell and taste \u2014 everything tasted like burned toast, he would say. Trying to explain the persistent fog in his mind, he often said his head felt \u201coblong.\u201d\n\nParker soon exhibited many of the symptoms now associated with C.T.E., such as memory loss and impulsivity. He struggled with bright light and spent countless hours in the dark, trying to soothe his brain. He tried to finish college, Scott Parker said, \u201cbut his brain couldn\u2019t function like that anymore.\u201d He could not read without headaches or keep a steady schedule. He would miss appointments or show up at the wrong place. He once came to a meeting without shoes.\n\nHe lost a lawsuit filed against the N.H.L., the Whalers and the Capitals, and the arena where the last injury took place.\n\n\u201cBy deciding to participate as a player in the hockey game, Parker voluntarily chose to accept the risk,\u201d a judge wrote in a 1995 ruling.\n\nParker lost his savings and spent several years homeless around St. Paul. The family lost track of him in the late 1990s before he emerged again. He spent most of the final 15 years working odd jobs, mostly as a bartender.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nScott Parker said he spoke to Jeff on the phone about three times a week, and the conversations were mostly playbacks of stories that Jeff did not remember that he had told before.\n\nPhoto\n\nOne symptom associated with C.T.E. that he did not display, his family said, was wild mood swings or violent behavior. He did not ask for help or attention. He would always say that he was fine, and family and friends considered him affable and easygoing, to the end.\n\nParker was one of the more than 100 former N.H.L. players named as plaintiffs in a continuing class-action suit against the league, arguing that the N.H.L. concealed information from players about the risks and long-term effects of concussions. The family said Parker had no acrimony toward the N.H.L., but hoped awareness might aid future players.\n\nThat lawsuit has churned through United States District Court in Minneapolis for years. The sides now await a judge\u2019s decision on whether it can continue as a class-action suit \u2014 which would automatically add about 5,000 plaintiffs to the case. A similar situation in the N.F.L. case in 2015 pressured the sides to reach a settlement.\n\nIn the lawsuit recently, the N.H.L. asked for records from the CTE Center\u2019s brain research, including the names of all the athletes who donated or agreed to donate their brains. The judge denied the request last month.\n\nThe N.H.L. has long argued that it is impossible to directly link hockey and C.T.E., though an email chain from 2011 seemed to contradict that public stance. As recently as last month, Bettman reiterated his belief on a New York radio show that there is no medical evidence linking hockey and C.T.E.\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times, Bettman said that \u201cthe game is safer now than it ever has been,\u201d citing evolution in things such as medical care and rule changes.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot that people have to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cI get concerned when people scare players for no reason. And there have been instances of that, some of them tragic. I think people have to be very careful before jumping to conclusions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn an essay for The Players\u2019 Tribune in April, the Hall of Fame hockey player and author Ken Dryden pleaded with Bettman to put an end to hits to the head in hockey. Dryden said his 2017 biography of Montador, a 10-year N.H.L. veteran who died in 2015 at age 35 and was found to have had C.T.E., was meant for an audience of one: Bettman.\n\nThe growing pressure has not moved the N.H.L. yet. Perhaps each new finding of C.T.E. nudges it closer to changing its mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awful responsibility that the N.H.L. has,\u201d said Scott Parker, who has coached high school hockey for 30 years. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to let them bare-knuckle fight, then take care of them.

It is a group of desperate people fleeing, in accordance with internationally accepted rules, the very real horrors of the \u201cnorthern triangle\u201d of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, one of the most violent regions in the world.\n\nUnder international treaties and its own laws, the United States is obliged to allow foreigners inside the country or at its ports of entry to apply for asylum. It\u2019s a daunting process, beginning with a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview to determine if there\u2019s evidence that the applicant faces persecution or death back home. If the applicant passes that, the next step is plunging into an immigration court system that can take years to reach a decision. More than three-quarters of asylum-seekers from the northern triangle who came before the court were rejected from 2011 to 2017, according to TRAC, a research institute at Syracuse University.\n\nThose in the caravans know this, since they are generally accompanied on their trek by organizers who lay out their options. This spring, about 700 people left the Mexican town of Tapachula, on the Guatemalan border, on March 25. Their ranks eventually swelled to about 1,200, from infants to the elderly. Most chose to remain in Mexico, which, despite a flawed asylum program, has become a favored destination for migrants. About 300 continued to Tijuana. Organizers and lawyers told about 200, mostly children, that they had a chance to gain asylum after applying at the San Ysidro crossing into San Diego.\n\nOrganizations that monitor immigration say American officials have come up with a variety of tactics to discourage asylum-seekers. One is to separate family members; another, attempted with the current caravan, is to claim that the port of entry has \u201creached capacity.\u201d (Attorney General Jeff Sessions began to address that on Wednesday by sending more Justice Department lawyers and judges to process cases at the border.)\n\nFinally, 24 hours after they arrived, the first group of eight migrants \u2014 three mothers with four children and an 18-year-old man \u2014 were allowed to apply for asylum on Monday evening. There was no telling how many would be allowed to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, as this trickle began, the president roared on Twitter: \u201cThe migrant \u2018caravan\u2019 that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | The Truth Trump Doesn\u2019t Want You to Know About the Caravan", "authors": []}

But they believed at the time the rest would be exempt.\n\nMr. Lopes said the quotas being offered by the United States in lieu of tariffs would mean a 7.4 percent reduction in the exports of semi-finished steel products and a drop of between 20 percent and 60 percent in exports of finished goods, depending on the product.\n\nIn its statement, Brazil said the United States would be solely responsible for putting the measures in place.

Other moves were more subtle: When China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, it was allowed in as a \u201cdeveloping nation,\u201d subject to very low tariffs on its exports to our country but permitted to impose high tariffs to protect its own rising industries from U.S. and European competition.\n\nThe assumption was that as China grew, and the W.T.O. moved to a new regime, China would quickly cut its tariffs \u2014 like its 25 percent tax on car imports, compared with the 2.5 percent tariff imposed by the U.S. But the W.T.O. still has not completed a new trade round and China has refused to voluntarily lower its tariffs.\n\nMoreover, China developed an industrial policy that often bent W.T.O. rules. The government gave away cheap land, and state-guided banks granted cheap loans for new industries, but foreign companies that wanted access to China\u2019s market were forced to pay to play \u2014 to have a Chinese partner and be willing to transfer their advanced technology to them.\n\nAs a result, over time, Beijing was able to force multinationals to shift more and more of their supply chains to China, and grow Chinese competitors to Western companies in its protected market, and then, once they were big enough, unleash them on the world as giants.\n\nEven when the U.S. protested to the W.T.O. \u2014 as in the case of how China unfairly kept U.S. credit card companies out, then lost the arbitration case at the W.T.O. \u2014 China still dragged its feet before following through on promises made 17 years earlier to open up. By then, Chinese companies, like UnionPay, so dominated China\u2019s credit card market that U.S. companies, like Visa, were left with the crumbs.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese government-guided companies and investment funds went abroad and began to buy up strategic industries to bring their technology back to China \u2014 like Germany\u2019s biggest and best robotics company, Kuka.\n\nU.S. and European businesses tolerated all of this because they were still making money in China or were afraid to be frozen out of its massive, growing market \u2014 until a couple years ago, when more and more told their governments: This is not working anymore.

Holland, a zoologist at the University of Oxford, began by drawing an animal family tree.\n\nOur own species belongs to one branch, the vertebrates (animals with spines), along with birds, reptiles and fish. Genetic studies have shown that our closest invertebrate relatives include creatures like starfish, while jellyfish and sponges are among our most distant cousins.\n\nResearchers also have identified the single-celled species that are the closest relatives to the animal kingdom \u2014 tiny aquatic protozoans that prey on bacteria.\n\nFrom all these tree branches, the scientists picked 62 species, including our own, to study closely. They searched the DNA of the organisms, cataloging all the genes that encode proteins, the molecules that carry out countless chemical reactions in our bodies and give it structure. (Humans have about 20,000 protein-coding genes.)\n\nDr. Paps and Dr. Holland toted up nearly 1.5 million genes in all, and then estimated when they first evolved. It makes for a wide-ranging genetic history.\n\nHumans and sharks, for example, make hemoglobin using nearly identical genes. That means hemoglobin genes were already present in their common ancestor.\n\nBut hemoglobin genes can\u2019t be found in more distantly related animal species, such as sponges. So the gene evolved in early vertebrates \u2014 long after the origin of the animal kingdom.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The researchers found 6,331 genes that were present in the common ancestor of all living animals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany of those genes appeared long before animals themselves. Some are essential to the basic workings of all living things \u2014 such as copying DNA \u2014 and first evolved billions of years ago. Other genes arose more recently and can be found today in our close single-celled relatives.\n\nThese findings confirmed earlier studies, which had been carried out on fewer species. When animals arose, evolution gave old genes new jobs.\n\nSingle-celled protozoans, for example, use some genes to make proteins that let them cling together in tiny colonies. In animals, these genes helped cells to glue themselves permanently together \u2014 a requirement for building a body.\n\nBut 1,189 of the genes in the ancestral animal can\u2019t be found in our closest known single-celled relatives. These new genes must have evolved in proto-animals.\n\nDr. Paps said there were at least two ways for that to have happened. Sometimes a random string of DNA with no function mutates and begins producing a protein.\n\nAlternatively, an existing gene may be accidentally duplicated. One of the copies may accumulate mutations until it produces a new kind of protein, even as the other copy keeps doing the original gene\u2019s original job.\n\nThe newly acquired DNA turns out not to be involved in a random assortment of jobs. Instead, many of these genes play crucial roles in building and running animal bodies \u2014 for example, making proteins that cells use to send signals to other cells.\n\nDr. Paps and Dr. Holland also found that a number of the genes developed by proto-animals are implicated in cancer. Many of these genes keep cells working together harmoniously, and when they mutate, cells may multiply out of control.\n\nI\u00f1aki Ruiz-Trillo, a biologist at Instituto de Biolog\u00eda Evolutiva in Barcelona who was not involved in the new study, said that the flowering of new genes might represent a fundamental characteristic of the animal kingdom.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey \u201ccould be used to define what an animal is,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Paps speculated that the burst of new genes might have appeared in early animals because the environment somehow triggered lots of mutations.

So Burrell Hardaway was preaching, calling out Norman Hadley by name. \u201cThey all looked suspicious, but guess what, they were not. Later, we found out that a white man had killed Norman Hadley.

She refused, she refused, so she was a martyr.\u201d\n\nMs. Branan also learned of a surprising racial back story. Mr. Moore, the youngest of the victims, was a distant cousin of hers because one of her white ancestors had children with a black woman. Her white family members knew they were killing a black family member.\n\n\u201cWhat I discovered was that the racially mixed Moore family was very much involved with the so-called white Moore family up to the time of this lynching. This lynching was, in and of itself, a message lynching to say to black and white people: \u2018Segregate. We are changing, the South is changing. You must separate now.\u2019 It was a very violent laying down of a line in the sand to keep us apart from one another.\u201d\n\nMs. Irvine said she was eager to meet Ms. Branan.

I was very grateful that Karen had given me a gift. She had given me a gift of connecting me to some of my ancestors that I didn\u2019t know much about. I\u2019m angry about racism. I\u2019m angry about racial terror.

It\u2019s still with us. It\u2019s with us in different forms. Some of those forms are even more pernicious than the old forms. We are living in the past because we have not addressed the past.

The first film\u2019s director, Tim Miller, exited, reportedly after Mr. Reynolds, who was a producer on both films and a writer on the second, fought against making the sequel a megabudget project. Last summer, a stuntwoman died during production, and in April one of its cast members, T.J. Miller, was charged with falsely calling in a bomb threat. There had previously been calls to replace Mr. Miller when past allegations of sexual assault surfaced last year.

We\u2019re not teaching her to read.\u201d\n\nMuch of this humor, he said, is rooted in self-defense mechanisms he learned as a kid.\n\nHe grew up the youngest of four boys in Vancouver, British Columbia, in a home that was made volatile by his father, Jim Reynolds, a former police officer-turned-food wholesaler whom Mr. Reynolds calls \u201cthe stress dispensary in our house.\u201d To head off screaming matches or any tumult, Mr. Reynolds tried to fix anything that might set his father off, be it by keeping the house immaculately clean or mowing the lawn. \u201cI became this young skin-covered micro manager,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you stress out kids, there\u2019s a weird paradox that happens because they\u2019re suddenly taking on things that aren\u2019t theirs to take on.\u201d\n\nYet Mr. Reynolds said he didn\u2019t view his childhood with sorrow. Jim Reynolds was difficult but also quite the character, a man who had a welter of scars on one arm from an old tattoo he had burned off. He made homemade red wine in a garbage pail in the basement, terrible, noxious stuff that Mr. Reynolds still has a bottle of despite worries that someone will one day mistakenly drink it and die.\n\nPhoto\n\nHis father also introduced him to comedy greats like Buster Keaton and Jack Benny, and could perfectly imitate Robert Goulet and Bill Cosby, or recite any episode of \u201cFawlty Towers.\u201d Out of all this, Mr. Reynolds learned to be watchful, listen closely and to plumb tragedy for the absurd, traits he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d have if he had come from an idyllic, placid home.

Although the members will go their separate ways as soloists and teachers, they will continue to reunite as a group for specific projects.\n\nThe Chiara players have consistently embraced adventurous initiatives that push beyond the conventions of chamber music, including two recent \u201cby heart\u201d projects that involved performing and recording the complete quartets of Brahms and Bart\u00f3k from memory.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat exploratory streak will be on display for this last program, which includes Nico Muhly\u2019s 2011 quartet \u201cDiacritical Marks\u201d \u2014 a Chiara commission \u2014 and the local premiere of Philip Glass\u2019s chant-infused Piano Quintet \u201cAnnunciation,\u201d with the pianist Paul Barnes, along with Beethoven\u2019s monumental String Quartet in A minor, op. 132.

On their lips, that word can sound like a caress \u2014 or like a petulant appeal from a toddler whose tantrums should have subsided long ago.\n\nIn Lily Thorne\u2019s debut drama, \u201cPeace for Mary Frances,\u201d directed by Lila Neugebauer for the New Group, the reliably magnificent Lois Smith plays the title role. Mary Frances is 90 and dying, which is fine with her. She is less O.K. with the messy state of her family. It\u2019s this fractured, fractious female circle that gathers around to take care of her, and to stake claims to her affection in her final weeks: Fanny (Johanna Day), her most beloved child and a volatile former heroin addict; Alice (J. Smith-Cameron), Fanny\u2019s dutiful, dependable, resentful sister; and Alice\u2019s grown daughters, Helen (Heather Burns) and Rosie (Natalie Gold), whose love for their grandmother is tender and deep. Mary Frances\u2019s son (Paul Lazar) is largely absent, and willfully useless.\n\nStarting previews on Tuesday, May 8, in a world-premiere production at the Pershing Square Signature Center, it\u2019s a play about mothers and their children, and the painful, jagged course that families can take.

His wife, Jennifer DeVita, said the cause was complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nIn New York City, Mr. DeVita\u2019s apartment near Eighth Street and Avenue C was one of the earliest custom tattoo shops, where clients could paint their bodies with original artwork. He was also arguably the first American artist to create tribal tattoos, abstract graphic designs, which he borrowed from designs he found in National Geographic magazine and an image he saw on a New York City manhole cover.\n\n\u201cThom was absolutely unique because he had a vision of what tattooing could be,\u201d said Don Ed Hardy, a former tattoo artist who also owns a clothing and accessories brand. \u201cHis work was original and expressionist, full of this kind of crazy vitality that was very different from the contained and careful look of tattoos.\u201d\n\nIf a customer asked for a simple black panther, Mr. DeVita might add bright red scratch marks around the claws, or embellish an image of a rose with dark radiating spider webs. His tattoos were bold, stylishly crude, abstract. They are often replicated by tattoo artists today.\n\n\u201cI was so blown away by the fact that he had his own distinctive hand-drawn flash,\u201d Mr. Hardy said, referring to the stencils that tattoo artists display for clients. \u201cIt opened my eyes to the fact that you could broaden the idea of what people wanted in tattoos.\u201d\n\nIf Mr. DeVita\u2019s illustrations were revolutionary, so was his placement of designs on the body, said Scott Harrison, a tattoo artist and one of Mr. DeVita\u2019s customers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe standard for tattooing was that you placed the stencil in the center of the body part,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cBut Thom would place it with compositional attention and follow the lines of the body where it would have the most attention and power.\u201d\n\nMr. DeVita was also known for layering tattoos \u2014 an effect that mimicked the ripped posters and overlaid graffiti common on buildings in the East Village. His flash was displayed not on sheets of white paper, but on fruit crates and milk crates and pieces of plywood he found in the street.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHis shop was a folk art environment, and was totally unique from other shops,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cIt was like walking into an art museum.\u201d\n\nThomas Paul DeVita was born in Manhattan on May 20, 1932, and grew up in East Harlem. His father, Thomas DeVita, an immigrant from Sicily, worked in a butcher shop at a hospital. His mother was Anna Traub.\n\nThom dropped out of elementary school and never attended high school. He worked for a short time in a scrap metal yard but spent his late teens and early 20s in jail for armed-robbery in the Bronx in 1950.\n\nBy the late 1960s, he had moved to Alphabet City in the East Village, where he worked as a live model for art schools. He began creating art to impress a potential girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI had to be something, so I told her I was an artist,\u201d he told The New York Times in 2014. \u201cI had to show her I was an artist, so I started doing some artwork.\u201d\n\nHe wound up selling his work in Washington Square Park.\n\nMr. DeVita never received formal training in tattooing. He learned the craft by observing tattoo artists who inked his body and through trial and error. He got his first tattoo around the age of 17, he said, from William Moskowitz in the Bowery. Later, he got a large tattoo of a dragon on his back from Huck Spaulding, who founded Spaulding & Rogers, a large manufacturer and distributor of tattooing machines and equipment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his early years Mr. DeVita drew his clientele from the Puerto Rican and Chinese enclaves near the Lower East Side and included jailbirds, artists, and working men and women.\n\nWhen asked in a 2012 documentary if it was his designs that drew his customers in, he was blunt.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI was known for $30 tattoos. I was doing blue-collar workers, and guys who didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nHe never tattooed legally in New York, and while his eccentric shop could feel cluttered at times, his needles were known to be clean \u2014 sterilized in an autoclave he kept in his apartment.\n\nA sign that hung on his wall read, \u201cWash your hands as neat as a pin, circus clowns are marching in.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though tattooing is illegal in New York, I treat it like it\u2019s legal,\u201d he said in 1991.\n\nOpinionated, contrarian and at times withdrawn, Mr. DeVita struggled with a lifelong tremor, which could cause him to flinch. He learned he had Parkinson\u2019s disease, which caused his hands to shake, in his later years.\n\n\u201cHe developed all these techniques to mitigate or enhance the shaking,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cHe could use it as an expressionistic tool. It\u2019s like a Coltrane solo that gets too dissonant, but then you bring it back to the melody. Those are the best ones.\u201d\n\nA lover of dogs, Mr. DeVita entered one of his Staffordshire bull terriers, named Champion Reetuns Iron Duke, at the Westminster Kennel Club show from 1981 to 1984.\n\nHe moved to Newburgh in 1990. His wife is his only immediate survivor. His younger brother, Ronald, died in 2012.\n\nMr. DeVita stopped producing large-scale tattoos around 2001, but continued to tattoo his signature on clients at conventions \u2014 still for $30 \u2014 and continued to draw, paint and sketch until shortly before his death.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe kept chipping away at it,\u201d said Nick Bubash, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and friend of Mr. DeVita\u2019s. \u201cHe never stopped.\u201d", "title": "Thom DeVita, 85, Dies; Revolutionized the Art of Tattooing", "authors": ["Jonathan Wolfe"]}

Petitioners blamed the dog\u2019s surroundings, not the animal itself, for the deaths. The city put down the dog, but faced protests and media scrutiny partly resulting from the petition.\n\nLast year, a dispute about another English exam, in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, led to a revision after an online petition.

When she finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand, Laura decides to keep the baby. Though she disdains much about her own social class and hopes to instill in her daughter, Emma, more ethical values than the ones with which she herself was raised, Laura remains tethered to her family both financially and emotionally.\n\nThe years unfold in a series of vignettes, with Emma moving through the stages of a typical, if fatherless, privileged urban childhood, and Laura remaining single and celibate and seemingly O.K. with that.

Local agencies \u201care our first line of defense,\u201d said Dr. Robert Redfield, the new director at the agency, which is facing its own deep budget cuts. \u201cWe must enhance our investment in their ability to fight these diseases.\u201d\n\nAlthough state and local health departments get brief infusions of cash during health scares like the Zika epidemic in 2016, they are chronically underfunded. A recent survey of mosquito control agencies found that 84 percent needed help with such basics as surveillance and testing for resistance to pesticides, Dr. Petersen said.\n\n[READ: Tips for Protecting Yourself Against Mosquitoes and Ticks]\n\nBetween 2004 and 2016, about 643,000 cases of 16 insect-borne illnesses were reported to the C.D.C. \u2014 27,000 a year in 2004, rising to 96,000 by 2016. (The year 2004 was chosen as a baseline because the agency began requiring more detailed reporting then.)\n\nThe real case numbers were undoubtedly far larger, Dr. Petersen said. For example, the C.D.C. estimates that about 300,000 Americans get Lyme disease each year, but only about 35,000 diagnoses are reported.\n\nThe study did not delve into the reasons for the increase, but Dr. Petersen said it was probably caused by many factors, including two related to weather: ticks thriving in regions previously too cold for them, and hot spells triggering outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases.\n\nOther factors, he said, include expanded human travel, suburban reforestation and a dearth of new vaccines to stop outbreaks.\n\nMore jet travel from the tropics means that previously obscure viruses like dengue and Zika are moving long distances rapidly in human blood. (By contrast, malaria and yellow fever are thought to have reached the Americas on slave ships three centuries ago.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA good example, Dr. Petersen said, was chikungunya, which causes joint pain so severe that it is called \u201cbending-up disease.\u201d\n\nIn late 2013, a Southeast Asian strain arrived on the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Maarten, its first appearance in this hemisphere. Within one year, local transmission had occurred everywhere in the Americas except Canada, Chile, Peru and Bolivia.\n\nTickborne diseases, the report found, are rising steadily in the Northeast, the Upper Midwest and California. Ticks spread Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, rabbit fever, Powassan virus and other ills, some of them only recently discovered.\n\nTicks need deer or rodents as their main blood hosts, and those have increased as forests in suburbs have gotten thicker, deer hunting has waned, and rodent predators like foxes have disappeared.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It Might Be Foxes]\n\n(A century ago, the Northeast had fewer trees than it now does; forests made a comeback as farming shifted west and firewood for heating was replaced by coal, oil and gas.)\n\nMost disease outbreaks related to mosquitoes since 2004 have been in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. But West Nile virus, which arrived in 1999, now appears unpredictably across the country; Dallas, for example, saw a big outbreak in 2012.\n\nFor most of these diseases, there are no vaccines and no treatment, so the only way to fight back is through mosquito control, which is expensive and rarely stops outbreaks. Miami, for instance, was the only city in the Western Hemisphere to halt a Zika outbreak with pesticides.\n\nThe only flea-borne disease mentioned in the C.D.C. report is plague, the bacterium responsible for the medieval Black Death. It remains rare but persistent: Between two and 17 cases were reported from 2004 to 2016, mostly in the Southwest. The infection can be cured with antibiotics.\n\nDr. Nicholas Watts, a global health specialist at University College London and co-author of a major 2017 report on climate change and health, said warmer weather is spreading disease in many wealthy countries, not just the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Britain, he said, tick diseases are expanding as summers lengthen, and malaria is becoming more common in the northern reaches of Australia.\n\nBut Paul Reiter, a medical entomologist at the Pasteur Institute, has argued that some environmentalists exaggerate the disease threats posed by climate change.\n\nThe 2003-2014 period fell during what he described as \u201ca pause\u201d in global warming, although the notion is disputed by other experts.\n\nStill, the dynamics of disease transmission are complicated, and driven by more than temperature. For example, transmission of West Nile virus requires that certain birds be present, too.\n\nIn the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, St. Louis encephalitis, a related virus, surged, \u201cand it looked like climate issues were involved,\u201d Dr. Reiter said. But the increase turned out to depend more on varying hot-cold and wet-dry spells and the interplay of two different mosquito species. St. Louis encephalitis virtually disappeared, weather notwithstanding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated, multidimensional system,\u201d Dr. Reiter said.\n\nA. Marm Kilpatrick, a disease ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said many factors beside hot weather were at work in the United States, including \u201ca hump-shaped relationship between temperature and transmission potential.\u201d\n\nWarm weather helps mosquitoes and ticks breed and transmit disease faster, he explained. But after a certain point, the hotter and drier it gets, the more quickly the pests die. So disease transmission to humans peaks somewhere between mildly warm and hellishly hot weather.\n\nExperts also pointed out that the increase in reports of spreading disease may have resulted partially from more testing.\n\nLyme disease made family doctors begin to suspect tick bites in patients with fevers. Laboratories began looking for different pathogens in blood samples, especially in patients who did not have Lyme.

What was the breakthrough?\n\nFEY I think it was the two months between our out-of-town tryout at the National Theater in Washington and rehearsal. All four of us got in a room and just were really bold about cutting and moving things around. We replaced five songs and added all of these book elements and tried to hone the story better.\n\nI think the main thing we learned was that we weren\u2019t feeling for our heroine as much. Even though she\u2019s singing from front to back, we needed to adjust some scene work and lyrics and some songs to really get into her heart more.\n\nTina, this is your first experience on Broadway. On a scale of 1-10, how interested are you in returning right now?\n\nFEY Oh, 10.

In opera, her powerful voice is expected to fill cavernous theaters without amplification, but the runs are short and there are usually days off between performances. On Broadway, she gets to use a microphone \u2014 but must sing in eight shows a week, and talk. She needn\u2019t have worried: She was nominated for a Tony for best featured actress in a musical, part of the juggernaut of \u201cCarousel\u201d nominations. MICHAEL COOPER\n\nCongratulations!\n\nThank you! Gosh, I\u2019m really grateful, and surprised, to be honest \u2014 very surprised.\n\nNow that you have some time under your belt as a Broadway trouper after all this time on the opera stage, how is it going?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWell, I was worried about the eight shows a week \u2014 because our training is so completely different, we\u2019re so much about power and projecting. But I\u2019ve managed to adjust, I think, pretty well. It helps that I\u2019m surrounded by such extraordinary musical values. It\u2019s made it really fun. And frankly, being home for the first time in my life is pretty special.\n\nYou\u2019ve never had such a long run anywhere, I\u2019d imagine.\n\nNo, not even close!\n\nAwards are exciting. Would you like to see awards for opera, or a category in the Tonys?\n\nYes! I don\u2019t know if it would be appropriate within the Tonys, per se, but the Classical Brits [a British awards show for classical music that has been on hiatus] is coming back this year, for instance. And I know Lang Lang is very keen that classical music should have an award ceremony as well \u2014 so that we could drum up excitement in young people for the art form itself. That\u2019s the beauty of our show, \u201cCarousel\u201d \u2014 to have the classical arts so highly represented between Justin Peck [the choreographer] and ballet and me. It\u2019s very exciting to have it noticed in that way.\n\nHave you spoken to some of the other nominees from the show?\n\nThe texts are flying.\n\nAri\u2019el Stachel\n\nPhoto\n\nAri\u2019el Stachel received his first Tony nomination for his performance in the heavily nominated musical \u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit.\u201d Mr. Stachel, a Yemeni Israeli who grew up in the Bay Area, plays an Egyptian trumpeter with a libidinous swagger stranded with his bandmates in a sleepy Israeli town. REGGIE UGWU\n\nYou\u2019ve been nominated for your debut performance on Broadway. What\u2019s going through your head right now?\n\nOh my goodness. A mixture of exhaustion, elation, happiness. I\u2019m most excited that it\u2019s in a role that celebrates a heritage that I\u2019ve really sort of been ashamed of for many years. The fact that our show is being recognized really shines a positive spotlight on Middle Eastern people, so it\u2019s sort of like a twofold win for me.\n\nHow are you processing that shift from the shame you once felt to the pride you feel now?\n\nYou know, even three years ago, I wasn\u2019t comfortable telling people that I was Middle Eastern. I was scared it would limit my career prospects. In college, I was told not to prepare monologues of my own race. So it\u2019s a seismic shift for me. It\u2019s really gratifying from an internal place, from a soulful place, in addition to the career part of it, which is extremely exciting.\n\nYou auditioned seven times for this role. What did it mean to you?\n\nI saw the casting call and knew that I needed to be a part of the show. It felt like my option, my shot. It was a character that happened to be Middle Eastern but had an entire arc that had nothing to do with his culture, which is sort of the meat and potatoes. That was exciting. To get your shot in this business, particularly your first one, it feels almost impossible. I felt so much pressure before each audition that I almost had panic attacks each time. By the seventh one, I actually said to everyone in the room, \u201cWe\u2019re family now, right?\u201d That sort of took the pressure off.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDid you ever think during that process that the result would be you hearing your name this morning?\n\nA hundred million percent no. This is truly beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nDo you think this nomination might help create more roles for Middle Eastern actors on Broadway? What do you hope the effect will be?\n\nWhat I really hope is that kids are going to say, \u201cOh, this might be a career path that I can pursue that otherwise might not have seemed like a possibility.\u201d I think it\u2019s really important to see yourself in mainstream media, whether that be theater or TV or movies. So to be recognized in a role that celebrates this heritage, hopefully that allows kids, maybe living in the Bronx or Queens or wherever they are, to say: \u201cOh, this is a viable path. I can do this.\u201d\n\nNoma Dumezweni\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Noma Dumezweni was cast as Hermione Granger in the West End production of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d it was another success that she did not see for herself after a childhood spent on the run from South African apartheid.\n\nBut she also had to deal with critics from the deepest corner of Potter fandom, much to the frustration of the author J.K. Rowling: How could a person of color be cast as Hermione? Ms. Dumezweni, a veteran actress, commandingly drowned those voices out, proving to be a standout performer on both continents, culminating with a Tony nomination. SOPAN DEB\n\nCongratulations!

O.K.\u201d It was lovely.\n\nDo you feel some sort of vindication given some of what you had to deal with when your casting was announced?\n\nNo. Why I say that is because I never gave that too much power, if that makes sense. My big thing is that I get to work with amazing people. Me as an actor, I do what I do, and I am a black woman and this is just a thing and I get to play Hermione, which is wonderful. But it\u2019s always about the work. But then what I\u2019m more vindicated by is for the creators.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBeing in the room, watching people at the top of their game: Gareth Fry, Christine Jones [set design], Steven Hoggett [choreographer], John Tiffany [director], Jamie Harrison on magic, Carole Hancock [hair, wigs and makeup], just an amazing group of people to be working with. As actors, we get the shiny stuff. The vindication is that it still works, and it\u2019s still growing, and it still makes sense. Yes, it still may be the world of Harry Potter, but theatrically, it\u2019s one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve been involved with.\n\nMy big saying is a word called \u201cUbuntu,\u201d a South African word that means \u201cI am because they are,\u201d and that\u2019s what, for me, is the most thrilling thing. It\u2019s all joyous.\n\nYou gave an emotional interview recently in which you expressed amazement that someone who looks like you could make it to Broadway. You also said your expectations of life are limited because of your refugee upbringing. Well, you\u2019ve made it, and now you\u2019re up for a Tony. Are you getting used to this attention? Are you seeing new heights for yourself?\n\nI am seeing new heights for myself in terms of possibilities. Because that\u2019s what it is. We have these limitations. Every individual has them in certain parts of our lives. Now the dreams are clearer, if that makes sense because the possibilities are there.\n\nI\u2019m not taking anything for granted. Let\u2019s just be a day at a time, a moment at a time. This is all lovely, shiny stuff. I\u2019m going to enjoy the next few weeks leading up to the awards ceremony.\n\nWhat characteristics of Hermione Granger do you feel you share?\n\nOh gosh. I\u2019ve haven\u2019t actually been asked that question on a personal level. I hope compassion, wishing the best out of everybody when we\u2019re collaborating with people. I hope I have that part of her in me.\n\nAndrew Garfield\n\nPhoto\n\nAndrew Garfield first discovered \u201cAngels in America\u201d when he watched the 2003 HBO mini-series. In a phone interview, Mr. Garfield said he was intimidated when he first dove into the grueling role of Prior Walter, for which he was Tony nominated on Tuesday: \u201cI think I\u2019d be a lunatic and arrogant if I wasn\u2019t healthily reverent to the play itself and the history of productions and people playing the character.\u201d SOPAN DEB\n\nWhere were you when you found out you were nominated?\n\nProbably like most people I was in bed. It\u2019s our day off from the show so I was trying and failing to sleep inasmuch as possible. But I was, of course, excited just knowing that the nominations were coming out today. I\u2019m usually very good at turning my phone off and getting myself enough sleep. I was just too excited.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThis is your second Tony nomination. How has this experience compared to \u201cDeath of a Salesman?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s about five hours longer. That\u2019s the simplest thing.\n\nOh wow, sorry, I\u2019m driving past a sculpture that looks like it\u2019s directly inspired by \u201cAngels in America.\u201d How bizarre. And I know what the sculpture is. Is it always here? It\u2019s by 30 Rock, I think. It\u2019s winged and a book in the middle of it, with a serpent crawling up a plate. Do you know the sculpture?\n\nI think I do. I don\u2019t 100 percent know if it\u2019s inspired by \u201cAngels.\u201d\n\nI actually don\u2019t think it is at all. But it\u2019s just so weird. It\u2019s exactly certain imagery from the play. How bizarre. How wonderful. So what was the question?\n\nI was just asking how this was different from \u201cDeath of a Salesman.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalesman\u201d is one of the great American plays since the founding of America. I think the difference is obviously the length. Even though the themes that both plays are dealing with are as deep as it gets in terms of the human experience, and as painful as it gets, I would say that doing \u201cAngels\u201d is somehow harder, somehow more costly and even more rewarding in a way. It\u2019s hard to compare. I would rather not compare because Arthur Miller and his plays are so important to me, as are Tony\u2019s.\n\nAre you exhausted?\n\nThat\u2019s the question always. How do you sustain telling the story on a nightly basis? How do you do that without it killing you? Without it burning you out? I\u2019m asking that question of myself every day. I think it has a lot to do with trusting, actually. Letting go, getting of the way, trusting Tony\u2019s work, trusting Tony\u2019s writing, and trusting the brilliance of the other actors on stage and the work that you\u2019ve done in rehearsals and allowing it to be different every night. Allowing it to be alive every night and dangerous every night and not managing or controlling it too much.\n\nLaChanze\n\nPhoto\n\nLaChanze scored her third Tony nomination as one of three performers who play the title role of \u201cSummer: The Donna Summer Musical.\u201d She was first nominated for \u201cOnce on This Island\u201d in 1991, and won the prize for \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d in 2006. SOPAN DEB\n\nWere you a Donna Summer fan growing up?\n\nOf course. I mean, who wasn\u2019t? I was an eighties kid, so yeah, definitely. I wasn\u2019t old enough to go to the clubs but I still loved her music. It was always about making me feel good and dance and have a good time. What I was more intrigued about in telling her life story was that her journey wasn\u2019t as easy as so many of us think. She came from humble beginnings. She worked her butt off to be this amazing musical icon.\n\nThe reviews for the show have not been great, but it\u2019s selling well and audiences seem to enjoy it. What do you think accounts for that difference?\n\nI think that the theatrical critical community has not found its way appreciation of the jukebox musical yet. It\u2019s like characterizing everything in the same way. There\u2019s a category for revivals. There\u2019s a reason there\u2019s a category for revivals; the original has already been done. There is no category for music that uses the catalog of an artist. I think something like that should be created, so that we can be critiqued for that and not be compared to a musical that was written with an original score.

It is likely to weaken sanctions enforcement, with China and even South Korea looking to ease up on their neighbor. It buys time for Mr. Kim to keep tinkering with his bombs and missiles, albeit without the testing necessary to perfect them.

Nina Turner, an African-American former state senator from Ohio who was endorsed by Emily\u2019s List when she ran for secretary of state in 2014, said minorities may face higher hurdles than white women in raising money, because they are less likely to come from wealthy circles.\n\n\u201cI got the money late when I needed it early, because they were judging my ability to fund-raise more than where I stood on the issues,\u201d Ms. Turner said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think they take into consideration the hurdles that black and Hispanic women have to jump when you judge viability.\u201d\n\nMs. Schriock said Emily\u2019s List does recognize \u201cthe obstacles that are particularly in front of women of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to do more?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbsolutely, as does the party.\u201d\n\nIn the Georgia governor\u2019s primary, race \u2014 and a chance to make history \u2014 was \u201ca big piece,\u201d but not the only consideration, in Emily\u2019s List\u2019s decision to endorse Ms. Abrams, who is African-American, Ms. Schriock said.

Here\u2019s a look at a few:\n\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein:\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s Q1 earnings call was a unique experience, to say the least. For those who missed it \u2013 halfway through the call, CEO Elon Musk abruptly declared that our questions were \u2018boring\u2019 and \u2018not cool,\u2019 and pivoted to a 20-minute back-and-forth with a retail investor from YouTube. Beneath the bizarre theatrics, however, we see Tesla\u2019s Q1 as in-line with expectations on most metrics, including revenues, gross margins, and free cash flow.\u201d\n\nAdam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:\n\n\u201cTo be clear. Tonight\u2019s conference call didn\u2019t go very well. Feedback we have received from investors during and following the call support this view. Irrespective of the Tesla CEO\u2019s annoyance with the genre of questions he was receiving from the analyst community, we note that an important part of Tesla\u2019s success has been its relationship with the capital markets in funding its ambitious plans.\u201d\n\nRyan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:\n\n\u201cGiven that the market has seemed somewhat less focused on cash burn than we have been, initially we believed that the 1Q performance \u2014 combined with forceful management guidance for a strong 2H inflection in revenue, margin, and cash flow \u2014 would be enough to elicit a modestly positive reaction in the shares Thursday. Instead, we expect TSLA to fall today after CEO Elon Musk dismissed multiple analyst questions as \u2018dry\u2019 and \u2018boring\u2019 (including questions probing what we feel are key topics, such as profitability of the Model 3 and the company\u2019s capital requirements).\u201d\n\nAlexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:\n\n\u201cManagement strongly rejected the need for new equity, while trimming its capex forecast and guiding for profitability in 2H. Model 3 choppiness notwithstanding, these results initially looked like a modest positive vs. bearish expectations. But then Elon Musk began dismissing analysts\u2019 questions and decided instead to field TWELVE questions from a YouTuber because it was \u2018way more interesting.\u2019 The unorthodox behavior sparked an after-hours sell-off.

{"date": "2018-05-06 00:00:00", "text": "The piping plover, a shorebird with a wingspan of only about 15 inches, has light brown and white feathers that allow it to blend in with the sand. The birds usually return to the Atlantic Coast in March and make nests that are little more than scrapes in the sand lined with pebbles and shells.\n\nBut a changing coast, in many places consumed by development, has eaten away at their habitat and made it more difficult for them to nest. Some states have made progress in restoring their plover population, but it continues to dwindle in New Jersey and New York. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really any safe havens left for them to nest, or not many,\u201d said Todd Pover, a senior wildlife biologist at the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey.\n\nThe plover has figured in debates in recent years over projects to bolster shores washed away by Hurricane Sandy, like the federal government\u2019s effort to replenish dunes on Fire Island. Conservation groups argued that the project would disturb the bird\u2019s nesting area. And in 2015, there was a fight in some ways similar to the one in Brigantine as conservationists urged state officials in New York to remove feral cats that had long lived on Jones Beach, on Long Island.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResearchers say that the bird\u2019s survival, at least in New Jersey, is largely dependent upon wildlife officials stepping in. Dave Jenkins, the bureau chief for the fish and wildlife division\u2019s Endangered and Nongame Species Program, described the piping plover as \u201cone of the most intensively monitored and managed species.\u201d He said the state has a biologist and six other employees and a team of volunteers dedicated to the plover and other endangered shorebirds.\n\nSome in Brigantine believe that the intervention has upset the natural balance of the island. Residents complained that foxes were becoming harder and harder to find and that rats and other pests were thriving because the foxes were not there to hunt them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an overreach and overreaction,\u201d Philip J. Guenther, Brigantine\u2019s longtime mayor, said of the fox trapping. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense from a protection standpoint.\u201d\n\nIt takes a bumpy ride in a four-wheel-drive vehicle to reach the part of the shore reserved for plovers. Longtime residents can tell how the coast has evolved, as wooden piers and the foundation of an old Coast Guard station rise higher out of the sand than they remember.\n\nThis spring, plovers have made their way back to the island, but their nesting has been delayed by a stubborn winter. An employee with the Division of Fish and Wildlife patrolled the beach on a recent day in a pickup truck, keeping those who did not belong from entering. Waves crashed onto the shore in the wind, and the beach was largely empty.

But lawyers discussed with a judge a Monday whether that may be the venue where Aaron Sorkin\u2019s anticipated new production of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d is first performed.\n\nThe executor of the estate of Harper Lee, who wrote the beloved novel, has complained that Mr. Sorkin\u2019s adaptation is not faithful to the spirit of the book, as the producers of the upcoming Broadway show had promised it would be. One part of the legal dispute was before Judge Analisa Torres of Federal District Court in Manhattan who on Monday set a date of June 4 for a trial that could determine whether the producers have broken their pledge.\n\nAfterward, lawyers for both sides discussed with a magistrate judge, Stewart Aaron, whether a performance for a jury might be employed in the proceedings over the dispute, which is being waged simultaneously in New York and Alabama.\n\nThe executor of Ms. Lee\u2019s estate filed a suit in Alabama in March, seeking a finding that the script has strayed too far from the novel. But the play\u2019s producers asked for that suit to be dismissed, then sued the executor and the estate in New York this month, saying the Alabama suit had threatened the future of the production. The only way to avert a catastrophic loss, they said, and rescue the play would be for a trial in New York to quickly resolve the dispute.", "title": "Trial Date Set for Dispute Over Broadway \u2018Mockingbird\u2019", "authors": []}

But Mr. Trifonov found a way to place this composer\u2019s achievements in a fresh context. He began in October with a recital featuring pieces by Tchaikovsky, Mompou, Grieg, Barber and Rachmaninoff that had been written in homage to Chopin. He built, piece by piece, to the final offering, Chopin\u2019s own \u201cFuneral March\u201d Sonata, giving an impetuous yet searching performance.\n\nLate last month, joined by the musicians of the string chamber orchestra Kremerata Baltica, Mr. Trifonov presented the most intriguing programs imaginable. In Chopin\u2019s day, every emerging pianist was expected to show himself off in his own concertos. The young composer, under pressure, wrote two of them.\n\nMusically, for me, they are two of Chopin\u2019s most personal and sublime works. Though there is plenty of dazzling piano writing in the scores, the real challenges come from the subtle intricacies folded into the piano part. His handling of the orchestra is generally considered no better than effective.\n\nMr. Trifonov performed these works with the orchestral music arranged for strings by the composer Yevgeniy Sharlat. The warmth and richness of the strings placed a mellow cast on the orchestra\u2019s contribution, turning it almost into chamber music, albeit for a large contingent of players.\n\nMr. Trifonov embraced this chamber-style approach. I\u2019ve never heard the piano parts played with such intimacy and tenderness. Sometimes, I wanted just a little more definition, especially in the left-hand accompaniments. I wouldn\u2019t have minded some bursts of assertiveness now and then. Still, I was moved, and mightily impressed, that Mr. Trifonov would attempt such a mature and revealing experiment.", "title": "Trifonov and Andsnes: Different Generations, Same Curiosity", "authors": []}

He has expressed concerns about the scope of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation in particular, a view that resonates with the president. Mr. Cobb, by contrast, has expressed admiration for Mr. Mueller and has never adopted the president\u2019s \u201cwitch hunt\u201d language.\n\nMr. Cobb, 67, was not a supporter of the Trump campaign, and though he expressed fondness for Mr. Trump, he repeatedly reminded people that he represented the White House as an institution, not the president himself. \u201cIt has been an honor to serve the country in this capacity at the White House,\u201d Mr. Cobb said in a telephone interview. \u201cI wish everybody well moving forward.\u201d\n\nMr. Flood is expected to take a more adversarial approach than Mr. Cobb, who voluntarily turned over White House documents to Mr. Mueller. He has credited that cooperation with preventing a protracted \u2014 and losing \u2014 subpoena fight that would have hobbled the administration. But the strategy frustrated the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, and some in the West Wing who said Mr. Cobb was too willing to accede to Mr. Mueller\u2019s requests.\n\n\u201cCobb\u2019s radical theory of the case, to waive executive privilege from the very beginning, was not simply wrong. It was reckless,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, the former White House strategist. He said that Mr. Cobb had been fired, rather than left, after repeatedly predicting the end of an investigation that never came. \u201cUnfortunately, you cannot undo the serious damage he has caused the president and the presidency.\u201d\n\nMr. Cobb responded: \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to Steve Bannon. I\u2019ve seen all his documents.\u201d\n\nMr. Flood is joining a legal team that has faced upheaval at a critical moment. Mr. Mueller wants to interview Mr. Trump about his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia during the 2016 election and what he knew about Moscow\u2019s efforts to meddle in the election. Mr. Trump has said he is eager to meet with prosecutors, but many of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers believe that is a perilous decision. It is not clear whether Mr. Flood agrees, and if he is willing to fight in court to keep Mr. Trump from answering questions.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to hire Mr. Flood has been in the works for months. After The New York Times reported in March that he had interviewed for the job, Mr. Trump issued an angry denial, attacking the article and one of the reporters who wrote it. And he offered support for the three lawyers on his team, John Dowd, Jay Sekulow and Mr. Cobb.\n\nMr. Dowd quit shortly after and Mr. Cobb has now been replaced \u2014 a level of turnover that is but one measure of the challenges of representing a client who is supremely confident and willing to disregard advice. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who is a longtime confidant of the president\u2019s, has come on board, pledging to negotiate an interview for Mr. Trump with the special counsel.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn a telephone interview, Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Mueller had no authority to subpoena the president \u2014 an argument that appeared to signal a combative approach. But he also did not foreclose the idea of an interview, as long as the topics were limited and the discussion did not last more than two-and-a-half hours. He objected to some of Mr. Mueller\u2019s proposed questions as \u201camateur psychiatry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow the hell can someone remember what they were feeling two years ago?\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. He added that he did not force Mr. Cobb from office.\n\n\u201cIt was time to make a change,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cAnd the new guy, Emmet, will add a tremendous amount of experience, having been involved in representing President Clinton.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump signaled his own impatience with the inquiry on Wednesday evening, saying on Twitter that he was too occupied with the demands of the office to devote \u201cmuch time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian \u2018Collusion.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe addition of Mr. Flood was spearheaded by Mr. McGahn. He and his personal lawyer, William A. Burck, have good relationships with Mr. Flood and persuaded him over the past several weeks to join the administration. Mr. Flood is seen as a possible eventual replacement for Mr. McGahn, who has clashed privately with Mr. Trump and whose departure has long been rumored.\n\nMr. Flood is arriving from the Washington law firm Williams & Connolly, which specializes in trial work, particularly in high-profile cases. Among its clients are Hillary Clinton, who relied on the firm during the F.B.I. investigation into her use of a private email server. Mr. Trump campaigned to cheers of \u201clock her up!\u201d and has said that Mrs. Clinton should have been charged in that case.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed to lose him to the White House, but we fully appreciate Emmet\u2019s strong commitment to public service,\u201d the firm\u2019s chairman, Dane Butswinkas, said in a statement. \u201cThe White House will be fortunate to have his experienced counsel.\u201d\n\nThere is one area where Mr. Flood\u2019s views are unclear: whether the president can or should fire Mr. Mueller. Mr. Cobb adamantly opposed such a move. \u201cThere is not and will not be any consideration of terminating the special counsel,\u201d he said in October.\n\nMr. Cobb\u2019s promises of a swift end to the investigation initially soothed Mr. Trump.

Hondurans working in the United States under protected status account for 12 to 15 percent of remittances sent to the country, money typically sent to help relatives.\n\nDon Emilio Valle, 73, who lives in the Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, said he receives $400 monthly from his son Emilio in Dallas to support his wife and three grandchildren.\n\n\u201cWith that money we can survive and feed ourselves,\u201d Mr. Valle said.

Some experts argue that watching American soldiers depart is far less important to him than winning relief from economic sanctions.\n\nFor years, the American presence has been more important as a symbol of deterrence than as a fighting force.

Most American troops have pulled back to well south of Seoul.\n\nSince President George Bush removed tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in the early 1990s, the nuclear deterrent against the North has been based far away, in missile silos on the continental United States, submarines in the Pacific or bombers based on Guam.\n\nMr. Trump is not the first president to push for troop reductions. Jimmy Carter ran for office on a promise to withdraw all ground combat forces, in part to protest South Korea\u2019s autocratic government at the time.

Rumsfeld, shifted nearly 10,000 troops from South Korea to the Iraq war.\n\nDuring the Obama administration, former officials said, the Pentagon was always reluctant to consider troop reductions or the suspension of joint military exercises when the White House talked about potential pathways to ridding North Korea of its weapons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt would be foolish to give any of that away early in discussions, given the long North Korean track record of breaking agreements,\u201d said Christine Wormuth, a former top Defense Department policy official in the Obama administration.\n\nMr. Trump, however, has long argued that America\u2019s military presence is not an asset but a liability \u2014 not just in South Korea but in Japan as well. As both countries became wealthy, he said, they should have taken on more of the burden for their defense. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he even suggested that the two nations acquire their own nuclear weapons so they did not have to depend on the American nuclear umbrella.\n\nGrudgingly, Mr. Trump admitted that the troops had kept the peace on the peninsula.

They also appear willing to follow through with the tariffs President Trump has threatened, despite the pain it could inflict on many American businesses and workers, if they view it as necessary to increase their leverage with the Chinese.\n\nOther members of the delegation, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council, appear more inclined to strike deals that would accomplish the president\u2019s goal of reducing the gap between what America imports from China and what it sells to the country, and thus head off the risk of an escalating trade war. Also going on the trip are Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, who has previously seemed receptive to striking deals; Everett Eissenstat, an experienced trade adviser; and Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China.\n\nYukon Huang, a China scholar at the Carnegie Institute, called the group an \u201cideologically hybrid team\u201d with competing views about what is really plaguing the U.S.-China relationship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixture between two camps: one focused on trade issues, one focused on technology wars,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThe reason it is such, and we don\u2019t have a game plan, is the issues aren\u2019t well understood.\u201d\n\nAmong the concerns are a range of practices, including barriers to entry, subsidies and regulations that pressure American companies to hand over sensitive trade secrets, which China uses to make national champions of its homegrown firms.

That estimate has been revised downward by more than 10 percent.\n\n\u201cThere might be some places where solar would have won for new generation that now might revert back to wind or natural gas,\u201d Mr. Shiao said. \u201cIn some cases nothing is going to fill that void.\u201d\n\nMs. Hopper of the industry group said she hoped that Congress would repeal the tariffs with a bill now before lawmakers. Representative Jacky Rosen, a Nevada Democrat, introduced the bill out of concern over the loss of jobs in her state. Two South Carolina Republicans, Representatives Mark Sanford and Ralph Norman, backed the legislation, citing not only jobs but also the added cost the tariffs imposed on business. The bipartisan nature of the effort gives the industry hope that it might find support.\n\nSolar power, which now generates almost 2 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity, has become popular among Democrats and Republicans alike, as people consider ways to have more control over their energy use and to reduce pollution as well as create jobs.\n\n\u201cWe think that the industry will continue to grow,\u201d Ms. Hopper said. \u201cI think that the outlook is still positive but not quite as positive as it could be.\u201d", "title": "Trump\u2019s Solar Tariffs Cause a Scramble in the Industry", "authors": ["Ivan Penn"]}

In Turkey, they were taken as a signal that Mr. Erdogan intends to continue a campaign to oppress the news media even, or especially, as the country prepares to vote in one of the most important elections in its history.\n\nMr. Erdogan has called presidential and parliamentary elections for June 24, more than a year ahead of schedule, in a vote that is part of Turkey\u2019s transition to a presidential system that would, if Mr. Erdogan wins, give him virtually unchecked new powers.\n\nCumhuriyet represents one of the few remaining independent voices in Turkey, where the majority of the news media has been gathered into pro-government hands, and it carries considerable political influence, in particular among the secularist opposition.\n\nThe state news media follows Mr. Erdogan\u2019s every speech, while giving little time to the opposition and entirely blocking out the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party, whose presidential candidate is campaigning from jail.\n\nFounded in 1924, Cumhuriyet is almost as old as the Turkish Republic itself, and has survived military coups, explosions and assassinations over the years. Police barriers surround its offices in downtown Istanbul, protection against Islamist extremists since the newspaper published an issue of Charlie Hebdo in solidarity after the terrorist attack against the French satirical magazine in January 2015.\n\nPhoto\n\nYet for many at the newspaper, the mass jailing and terrorism convictions of its staff \u2014 actions that the newspaper\u2019s lawyer, Tora Pekin, described as \u201cirrational\u201d and \u201cso wrong\u201d \u2014 surpasses all previous ordeals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI have been through both military and civilian coups,\u201d said Orhan Erinc, 82, a veteran journalist and chairman of the Cumhuriyet Foundation board that manages the newspaper, who received one of the stiffest sentences, six years and three months. \u201cThis has nothing in common with what we have seen in the past. I don\u2019t know what to call it. There is no law.\u201d\n\nThe sentences were just the latest attempt by the government to subdue the newspaper, Mr. Atalay said. It had tried an economic embargo, crippling the newspaper by warning companies off advertising in it, and then tried to get pro-government businessmen to buy out the newspaper, he said. But Cumhuriyet was able to resist their offers.\n\n\u201cWhen they could not succeed, they put us in jail,\u201d Mr. Atalay said.\n\nYet the government had also encountered obstacles in its campaign against Cumhuriyet, he said. \u201cThey did not silence us,\u201d he added. \u201cThey tried to intimidate us, but they saw we were not intimidated.\u201d\n\nThe staff managed to keep publishing in their absence \u2014 even if barely managing to pay salaries \u2014 and international pressure against the government increased.\n\n\u201cIn the view of the international community, this newspaper is trustworthy and reliable,\u201d Mr. Atalay said. \u201cAnd inside it, there are very stubborn, very determined, very resilient people, and they do perform the battle of journalism with joy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nA senior columnist, Aydin Engin, 76, stepped in to run the paper, and the journalists kept reporting. \u201cWe did not know if the newspaper would be closed down,\u201d said Bulent Ozdogan, the newsroom manager. \u201cWe just did what we knew to do.\u201d\n\nOpponents accuse Mr. Erdogan of trying to instigate one-man rule, an accusation that has been angrily denounced by Mr. Erdogan and his supporters.\n\n\u201cThis election comes at a very important juncture,\u201d the editor in chief, Mr. Sabuncu, said. \u201cEither we are going to go for democracy or we end up a different country.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Yet close to a million people read the online edition, editors say.\n\nMr. Sabuncu said his chief concern was for the many others still in jail, and for the country he loves. \u201cFrom the very beginning, we have been saying that it is more than Cumhuriyet,\u201d he said.\n\nIn jail he realized that Turkey had become a divided and joyless place, but he said he believed Turks would change that.

It\u2019s an easy, fun hook for readers, who will likely see themselves in either the nervous and pale new kid at school, Elliot, or edgy Uchenna, a black girl with twists who first strikes Elliot as a \u201cpunk rock Beethoven.\u201d\n\nImage\n\nOn a field trip into the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the two stumble on a tiny blue dragonlike creature tangled in a pink ribbon.

L. Kennedy, UNCLE SHAWN AND BILL AND THE ALMOST ENTIRELY UNPLANNED ADVENTURE (Kane Miller, 191 pp., $5.99; ages 7 to 10). Kennedy lets loose a zany adventure in which a handsome badger is kidnapped by the miserable McGloone family, which keeps a cupboard of knives for every wretched occasion from \u201cpeeling penguins\u201d to \u201cdicing goldfish.\u201d Also on the McGloone chopping block are four depressed llamas who are soon to be turned into llama puddings and dumplings and possibly even a handbag for the meaty matriarch Myrtle McGloone.\n\nImage\n\nEveryone\u2019s rescue depends on a crazy-haired, kindhearted uncle (whose uncle he is isn\u2019t revealed, because Kennedy delights in wordplay and wit, and appreciates the absurdity of unanswered questions) who has a faithful mole in one pocket of his tweed jacket and some cheese crackers in the other. Uncle Shawn has a half-baked plan to save the day, and hopes in the process to find himself the pleasure of new friends.\n\nThe climax of escape is indeed a triumph, with the McGloones meeting an end befitting their outrageous terribleness.

In his second term, Mr. Bush started trying to close it because, as he wrote in his memoir, \u201cthe detention facility had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama, who inherited 242 detainees from Mr. Bush, shared that view and significantly winnowed the inmate population without adding new detainees. But Congress blocked him from bringing several dozen detainees deemed untransferable to a different prison on domestic soil.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Trump boasted during the campaign that he would not only keep the prison open, but also \u201cload it up with some bad dudes.\u201d But defying the expectations created by that rhetoric, his administration, too, has brought no new captives to Guant\u00e1namo \u2014 and now the population has instead shrunk.\n\nA White House Push\n\nIn January, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing Mr. Mattis to recommend within 90 days a policy about how to handle future detainees, including whether or when to take them to Guant\u00e1namo. Announcing that order in his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump also ad-libbed a line that \u201cin many cases,\u201d future detainees will be sent to the prison.\n\nThe Pentagon said on Wednesday that Mr. Mattis had provided updated policy guidance about when to propose transferring detainees to Guant\u00e1namo \u201cshould that person present a continuing, significant threat to the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department gave few details about the document. But people familiar with it said it was several pages long and consisted of screening criteria about what could make a terrorism suspect eligible for Guant\u00e1namo detention, without plainly specifying when that option should be preferred over alternative dispositions. One person portrayed the document as vague, and another said it made no major changes from existing policy.\n\nIn recent years, the government has tried to leave lower-level detainees in the hands of allies, while interrogating important captives at an overseas military base or on a naval ship. After the questioning, American officials have preferred to have an ally take or maintain custody of a suspect, with a fallback option of prosecution in civilian court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTransfer to Guant\u00e1namo has been a theoretical last resort; no new captive has arrived there since 2008, when the Supreme Court ruled that prisoners there have a constitutional right to file habeas corpus lawsuits challenging the basis for their detention.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen Mr. Obama pursued that approach, it was repeatedly criticized by Republicans as weak. But those voices have largely grown quiet as it continued under Mr. Trump, although Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has continued to argue that the United States needs a place where it can interrogate terrorism suspects without defense lawyers for a much longer period.\n\nBut many national security professionals see taking new detainees to Guant\u00e1namo as unattractive for several reasons. It is extremely expensive. Moreover, in practice, the combination of an interrogation followed by a civilian-court prosecution has successfully garnered critical intelligence while also resulting in convictions and harsh sentences.\n\nBy contrast, the military commissions system has struggled to get contested cases to trial, and a statute bars the authorities from bringing detainees onto domestic soil, even for prosecution, once they have reached Guant\u00e1namo.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He had expressed fear that he would be killed if repatriated.\n\nMr. Kassem also asked a judge last month to order an independent psychological examination of another one of his clients, Mohammed al-Qahtani.\n\nMr. Qahtani, a Saudi, is believed to have been the intended 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks, but was denied entry into the United States in August 2001 by a suspicious customs agent at the Orlando airport.\n\nMr. Qahtani was tortured at Guant\u00e1namo during a more than 50-day interrogation in late 2002 and early 2003.

Yanukovych, the Russian-leaning Ukrainian president who was ousted by street protesters and fled the country in 2014. Mr. Manafort was a longtime adviser to Mr. Yanukovych, working with him to revamp his public image and acquire a pro-Western patina that helped him win the presidency in 2010.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe new government established a special prosecutor to pursue corruption in the former administration. By late last year, the prosecutor, Serhiy Horbatyuk, had opened about 3,000 cases, including four related to Mr. Manafort\u2019s consulting for the former president and his political party.\n\nThe order issued in April isolated these four investigations. The cases were not closed, the prosecutor general\u2019s office said in a statement, but the order blocked Mr. Horbatyuk from issuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses.\n\n\u201cWe have no authority to continue our investigation,\u201d Mr. Horbatyuk said in an interview.\n\nOne inquiry dealt with possible money laundering in a single $750,000 payment to Mr. Manafort from a Ukrainian shell company. The payment formed one part of the multimillion dollar transfers to Mr. Manafort from politicians in Ukraine that underpin indictments filed by Mr. Mueller in federal court in Washington and Virginia. Before the case was frozen, prosecutors had subpoenaed records from Ukrainian banks.\n\nAnother concerned a former chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s foreign relations committee, Vitaly Kalyuzhny, who had signed nine of 22 entries designated for Mr. Manafort in a secret ledger of political payoffs uncovered after the 2014 revolution.

Mr. Manafort denied receiving under-the-table payments from the party and his spokesman said the ledger might be a forgery.\n\nThe other two cases looked at Skadden Arps, which wrote a report with Mr. Manafort\u2019s participation that was widely seen as whitewashing the politically motivated arrest and imprisonment of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s principal rival, Yulia V. Tymoshenko.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Mr. Horbatyuk said that he sent a letter in January and did not receive a reply, but that the offer was now moot, since he has lost the authority to investigate.\n\nBut entries in the ledger appear to bolster Mr. Mueller\u2019s money laundering and tax evasion case against Mr. Manafort, said Serhiy Leshchenko, a lawmaker who has closely followed the investigation. They indicate, for example, payments from Ukraine to a Cypriot company, Global Highway Limited, that was also named in an indictment Mr. Mueller filed in federal court in Virginia this year. The company covered hundreds of thousands of dollars of Mr. Manafort\u2019s bills at a high-end men\u2019s clothing store and antique shop in New York.\n\nIn another move seeming to hinder Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, Ukrainian law enforcement allowed a potential witness to possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to leave for Russia, putting him out of reach for questioning.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office has identified the man, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, Mr. Manafort\u2019s former office manager in Kiev, as tied to a Russian intelligence agency. Mr. Kilimnik was also under investigation in Ukraine over espionage, but no charges were filed before he left the country, sometime after June. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Kilimnik met twice with Mr. Manafort. In December, a court filing in the United States said Mr. Kilimnik was \u201ccurrently based in Russia.\u201d\n\nBut in the United States, Mr. Mueller\u2019s office appears still keenly interested in Mr. Manafort\u2019s ties to Russia. Among the questions Mr. Mueller would like to ask Mr. Trump, according to a list provided to the president\u2019s lawyers, was: \u201cWhat knowledge did you have of any outreach by your campaign, including by Paul Manafort, to Russia about potential assistance to the campaign?\u201d\n\nIn Kiev, the missile sale was seen as a political victory for Mr. Poroshenko, indicating American backing for his government in the war in eastern Ukraine against Russia-backed separatists and against the threat of a wider Russian intervention in the country. After Ukraine announced on April 30 that it had received the missiles, Mr. Poroshenko posted on Facebook that \u201cthe long-awaited weapon arrived in the Ukrainian Army.\u201d\n\nApart from the missiles, the Ukrainian government is propped up with about $600 million in bilateral aid from the United States annually.

Still, the jobless rate is reaching historically low levels. In the last 60 years, there has been only one sustained period where unemployment stayed below 4 percent: the late 1960s.\n\nMs. Barrera said it was too early to worry about whether the economy is overheating. When the jobless rate hit these levels right before the dot-com bubble burst, the labor-force participation rate was significantly higher than it is today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to try to analogize and say that\u2019s what we should be preparing ourselves for right now,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. That kind of thinking might prompt some employers to cut back on investments or hiring, which could begin to slow growth.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s flirtation with a trade war has thrust uncertainty into the overall economic picture. The White House has offered little clarity about whether its newly imposed steel and aluminum tariffs will extend to allies like Mexico, Canada and the European Union, and it seems no closer to smoothing over economic tensions with China.\n\nPhoto\n\nEconomists say it is too soon to tell how employers may change their staffing or expansion plans in response to the tariffs on Chinese goods, or to Beijing\u2019s retaliation.

That modest uptick probably would not prompt the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate more aggressively than it has signaled, economists said.

As a result, he said, the Fed will be able \u201cto continue moving gradually.\u201d\n\nOne mystery of the American economy is this: How can employers can continue to raise pay so gradually, when the labor market keeps getting tighter? In the 1990s and early 2000s, the last time the job market looked like this, wages for rank-and-file workers rose at an annual rate of around 4 percent.\n\nA host of explanations \u2014 ranging from globalization to slow gains in productivity \u2014 have been offered to explain the disconnect. Ms. Barrera says businesses may just be stuck in their ways.\n\n\u201cPeople are creatures of habit,\u201d Ms. Barrera said. \u201cIf you have been using a strategy that has been working for you for a number of years, you aren\u2019t going to suddenly change it.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s Been Left Out\n\nEven though the labor force shrank over all, the report offered signs that the strong economy is coaxing some people back into the working world. A measure of unemployment that includes people who had given up looking for work hit 7.8 percent, a level not seen since 2001.\n\n\u201cWe have realized that there were even more workers on the sidelines than we previously thought,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Indeed.com, a job-search site. Ms. Gimbel said that her site had seen an increase in people searching for things like \u201cbackground check\u201d and \u201cfull time,\u201d which could indicate that the bustling job market has become irresistible for workers who might have been discouraged by a particularly bruising recession a decade ago.\n\nFor some groups, the market has been tougher. The unemployment rate for black workers, for example, has consistently hovered well above the rate for white workers, even as employers complain loudly about a labor shortage in sectors like construction and trucking. The job market has improved for black workers in recent years \u2014 they still faced a jobless rate of 6.6 percent in April, the lowest level on record. But it was still much higher than the 3.6 percent for whites.\n\nIf the numbers were reversed, \u201cthe country would be up in arms,\u201d said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution, whose research focuses on race and structural inequality.

Probably.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s until just the other day, the overwhelming view in macroeconomics was that there is no long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, that any attempt to hold unemployment below some level determined by structural factors would lead to ever-accelerating inflation. But the data haven\u2019t supported that view for a while; and the latest US employment report, with its combination of a low reported unemployment rate and continuing weak wage growth, seems to have brought skepticism about the natural rate to critical mass.\n\nBut what does it mean to question or reject the concept of a natural rate? Reading Mike Konczal\u2019s explanation for the layperson, or Olivier Blanchard\u2019s exposition for the pros, I wonder whether the point is coming across clearly enough. That\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s anything wrong with either Konczal or Blanchard \u2013 I completely agree with what both are saying, except that I would take a stronger stand than Olivier against the old orthodoxy (which probably says more about our personalities than about our take on the evidence, which appears to be identical.) But I thought it might be useful to restate the case and the implications.\n\nThe bottom line here is that the case for aggressive monetary and, when necessary, fiscal policies to sustain demand is much stronger than we used to think. Errors like the turn to austerity and the ECB\u2019s 2011 rate hike were much bigger mistakes than the previous doctrine allowed for; premature Fed rate hikes would be a bigger sin than even the Fed seems to realize now. For given what we now seem to know, output lost to weak demand is lost forever; there is no chance to make up for it later.\n\nDuring the 1970s almost the whole macroeconomics profession was persuaded by the experience of stagflation that Milton Friedman (and Edmund Phelps) were right: there is no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Current inflation does depend on inflation, but it also depends one-for-one on expected inflation:\n\nInflation = f(U) + expected inflation\n\nwhere f(U) means some function of the unemployment rate.

Though she didn\u2019t win the competition \u2014 she finished in a tie for second place \u2014 the piece became one of her signatures, and she performed and recorded Szymanowski\u2019s works throughout her life.\n\nAnother high point, she said, was playing in 1955 at the first concert in the newly rebuilt Warsaw Philharmonic concert hall, the original building having been destroyed during World War II.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the early 1960s the American impresario Sol Hurok brought her to the United States and Canada, and she made an immediate impression.

Job growth remains above breakeven levels and the unemployment rate edged down further, which should support the Fed\u2019s expectation for wage growth to trend higher, albeit gradually. Strong inflation data had been worrying both the stock and bond markets, but today\u2019s somewhat tepid wage growth number should ease those concerns, keeping the FOMC on its current plans to adjust the path of policy in a measured manner.\u201d\n\nIan Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics: Mr. Shepherdson points out that the fall in the unemployment rate was because of a decline in the labor force, but \u201cthis won\u2019t last, and as household employment catches up, unemployment will fall further. April\u2019s 3.9% rate was the lowest since Dec 2000, and unemployment hasn\u2019t been below 3.8 percent since 1969.\u201d Mr. Sherpherdson adds that the wage growth still looks \u201cbenign,\u201d but all the risks to wage growth are to the \u201cupside\u201d in the second half of 2018.\n\nJoseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US: \u201cThe U.S. labor market has tightened to the point where firms are simply having tremendous difficulty finding qualified and available workers which is why the American unemployment rate has declined to 3.9 percent and likely on its way to 3.7 percent later this year. Once the late cycle fiscal boost that is in train into the economy in the second half of 2018, there is a significant risk that the unemployment rate will decline at a much faster pace which will present a problem for the Federal Reserve that will likely want to tighten rates a modestly quicker pace even as the US yield curve flattens.\u201d\n\nTendayi Kapfidze, LendingTree: Mr. Kapfidze writes that disappointing wage growth suggests that \u201cinflation pressures are not building up in the economy.

Lantern became involved with the Weinstein Company this year, when it agreed to help finance an attempt to help the troubled studio avert bankruptcy. That effort, led in part by the billionaire Ron Burkle, fell apart in March.\n\nThe Weinstein Company imploded in October after dozens of women publicly accused its former chief executive, Harvey Weinstein, of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. It announced on March 19 that it would file for bankruptcy. The movie and television studio, once known for Oscar-winning films like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Artist,\u201d had less than $500,000 in cash. It was facing a mountain of debt and a swelling number of lawsuits, including one by New York\u2019s attorney general.\n\nLawyers for the studio had bragged that its assets \u2014 a library of old films, a small television production business and a handful of unreleased new films \u2014 had drawn interest from as many as 60 potential bidders. But in the end there appeared to be only Lantern, with its bid to keep the studio whole; Sonar Entertainment, with a nibble on the television division; and Inclusion Media, led by Mr. Kagan, a former partner at the hedge fund Harbinger Capital who has reinvented himself as a Tony Award-winning producer of Broadway shows like \u201cPippin.\u201d\n\nInclusion\u2019s $315 million proposal, which the Weinstein Company said was submitted after the deadline and did not meet other requirements for a qualified bid, was notable for including a settlement fund for Mr. Weinstein\u2019s victims of at least $25 million.\n\nOn Tuesday, five of the named plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits pending against Mr. Weinstein said in a news release that they \u201cstrongly opposed\u201d the Lantern purchase, which did not include a specific fund for victims, and that they supported Mr. Kagan\u2019s effort.", "title": "Weinstein Company Declares a Winner in Its Bankruptcy Sale", "authors": []}

There are 312 more positions available in the developmental league.\n\nNot only are there fewer players in the W.N.B.A., the odds of being drafted are worse than in other sports. According to the N.C.A.A.\u2019s 2018 report, which uses data from the 2016-17 season, 0.9 percent of draft-eligible players were chosen by W.N.B.A. teams, less than the N.B.A. (1.2 percent), the N.F.L. (1.6 percent), M.L.S. (1.4 percent), the N.H.L. (6.4 percent) and M.L.B. (9.5 percent). Including those who joined teams overseas, only 4.9 percent of eligible women\u2019s basketball players played professionally last season, compared with 19.3 percent for men\u2019s basketball.\n\nNot all of the 36 players selected each season in the three-round W.N.B.A. draft will even make a team. Unlike the N.B.A., which guarantees all first-round picks a two-year contract, nothing is certain for W.N.B.A. draft picks. Last season, Tori Jankoska, the No. 9 pick, was waived after the Chicago Sky\u2019s first game.\n\nPhoto\n\nFor Thomas, the task is even harder. The Sparks have two former league most valuable players in Parker and Nneka Ogwumike and several other locks to make the roster, potentially leaving only one or two open spots.\n\nCenter Kaylee Jensen, just weeks removed from playing a starring role for Oklahoma State in the N.C.A.A. tournament, was not drafted, but she said she received a text message from the Sparks after the draft inviting her to camp.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of weird going from one of the higher-up players who gets a lot more attention to coming in here and maybe not being as highly recruited,\u201d Jensen said.\n\nJensen is from Genoa, Neb., a town with fewer than 1,000 residents.

If a new C.B.A. added more players to the rosters, each player would, on average, make less money, unless the salary cap went up. The league\u2019s maximum salary in 2018 is $115,500, and the minimum is $41,202. With many teams in the league struggling to make a profit in a given year, it is unclear if owners are willing to raise the cap and risk further financial instability.\n\nPhoto\n\nPenny Toler, the Sparks\u2019 general manager, said she wished the league could expand the rosters and develop more talent.\n\n\u201cIf I can develop a player, then we don\u2019t have to go into the market trying to sign free agents for more money than they\u2019re worth,\u201d Toler said.\n\nShe noted that there was a talent gap between college and W.N.B.A. players.\n\n\u201cWhen you get up here, everybody is either all-American, all-world or all-universe,\u201d Toler said. \u201cIn college, you can be one of few, but up here you\u2019re one of many.\u201d\n\nThomas and Jensen are hoping they are among that tiny percentage of women who play professionally, whether it be for the Sparks or abroad.

For Thomas, the fact that she was drafted could be her edge. Jensen, who is 6-foot-4, has a chance because of her size. Both are just trying not to make mistakes.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely a whole other level,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cThis is the big show; every little thing has to be perfect here.

Emails disclosed by the university show that Federalist Society officials were also involved in hiring discussions and had suggested a student for admission. In turn, a professor at the law school wrote the society asking for help securing recommendations for prestigious federal judicial clerkships for students active in the society.\n\nFollowing a period of deep cuts in public funding, the documents and related emails raised broad questions about whether universities that rely heavily on private donors can remain free from the influences of contributors who may be pursuing commercial, political or philosophical agendas.\n\nIn academia, such influence is viewed as inappropriate, partly because it may pressure professors to produce biased research, undermining the credibility of their work and spreading incorrect information to students. That may be particularly problematic in the interpretation of data and construction of models in areas of economics that affect federal tax policy or regulation.\n\nBethany Letiecq, an associate professor in the Human Development and Family Science program at George Mason and president of the university\u2019s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, said the documents demonstrated that the school had \u201cceded our authority and autonomy to one of the wealthiest industrialists in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question now is: How are we going to move forward and rebuild our reputation as a reputable institution in the Commonwealth?\u201d Professor Letiecq said. \u201cHow are we going to undo this mess?\u201d\n\nNews of the donor agreements prompted a university inquiry and other measures intended to rebuild trust in the institution\u2019s academic mission and independence. The faculty senate voted on Wednesday to ask the administration that it publish an online database of all donors, appoint two tenured faculty members to the university\u2019s gift acceptance committee, and extend an ad hoc faculty committee created in 2016 that is charged with examining potential conflicts of interest with outside gifts and grants.\n\nPhoto\n\nProfessor Letiecq said the faculty did not know whether there were any colleagues who may have been affected by the Koch Foundation\u2019s influence over hiring in past years. But those who have been handpicked know they come with strings attached, she said. \u201cThey know the benefits that come with the position,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I guess they can live with that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn one 2003 agreement, the Mercatus Institute said it had received $900,000 from the Menlo F. Smith Trust to fund a professorship in the economics department, and would make the first payment \u201cconditional\u201d upon the appointment of Russell Roberts, an economist who advocates limited government. A person designated by Menlo Smith, a St. Louis businessman, was given a seat on the selection committee, according to the agreement.\n\nProfessor Roberts, who is currently affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford, denied on Thursday that Mr. Smith had had any say in his hiring. He said he had been selected for the job by the economics department, which then sought funding from Mr. Smith.\n\nThe exact amount of Koch donations to campuses across the country, which frequently are earmarked for programs fostering capitalism and free markets, is unknown. But it is estimated at nearly $150 million from 2005 to 2015, benefiting more than 300 schools. An estimated $50 million of that went to George Mason.\n\nArrangements between universities and organizations funded by Koch money have come under scrutiny partly because of the work of an activist organization called UnKoch My Campus, the national affiliate of Transparent GMU.\n\nThe group and its campus affiliates around the country have pressured universities to reject or rescind Koch-funded agreements and also have demanded disclosures about Koch funding. The movement has recently gained steam on several campuses where faculty members and students have protested Koch-funded centers or professorships, including recent actions at Wake Forest University, Montana State University and the University of Utah.\n\nSamantha Parsons, who co-founded the organization as a George Mason student in 2014, said the group has worked with about two dozen campuses to protest donor influence, and is actively working with about a dozen.\n\n\u201cFaculty across the country are waking up and really seeing this as a moment to really defend academic freedom and integrity, and faculty governance,\u201d she said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Daniel Kovenock, a professor of economics at Chapman University, which has received Koch funding, said he believed that the foundation had changed its methods.\n\n\u201cInstead of explicit contractual provisions governing use of the funds, it\u2019s now a wink and a handshake,\u201d Professor Kovenock said.\n\nA former professor and administrator at Arizona State University described the \u201cdrama\u201d involving an offer in 2014 by the Koch Foundation to donate money for a new professor dedicated to teaching the history of capitalism.\n\nThe professor, Matthew J. Garcia, said that he had welcomed the foundation\u2019s donation to his program \u2014 the school of historical, philosophical and religious studies \u2014 but that he had insisted normal hiring procedures be followed to fill the job.\n\nThe hiring search was anything but normal, the professor said. As it progressed, a university dean told him, \u201cA.S.U. will never hire anyone that Koch doesn\u2019t approve,\u201d according to Professor Garcia.\n\nBut Mr. Hardin, of the Charles Koch Foundation, said that any hires by A.S.U. were the result of the university\u2019s process, not foundation pressure. \u201cUnfortunately we see people trying to point the finger at us and trying to call us the boogeyman for things they don\u2019t like when it\u2019s not true,\u201d Mr. Hardin said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepresentatives for Arizona State did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn the end, the Koch Foundation\u2019s top choice was rejected by a faculty committee, Professor Garcia said. But the episode was among developments at A.S.U. that Professor Garcia said had left him disillusioned. He departed last year for Dartmouth, where he is a professor of history focusing on Latin America.\n\nOfficials of the Federalist Society played a key role as an intermediary between George Mason and an anonymous donor when the university\u2019s law school was renamed in 2016 after the former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, the released documents show.\n\nThe records and emails, while heavily redacted, say that representatives of the Federalist Society were given discretion to cancel the donor agreement and that society representatives discussed faculty selection and recommended at least one student for admission. Leonard Leo, a Federalist Society official who was among those directly involved in the correspondence, did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nThe dean of the law school, Henry N. Butler, said that any accusation that the society had undue influence was unfounded. \u201cWhile we are pleased to receive recommendations from many sources,\u201d he said, \u201cdecisions on faculty hiring and student admissions and scholarships are independent and strictly the purview of the law school\u2019s faculty and administrative leadership.\u201d\n\nDespite the release of the documents, the lawsuit is still on. The activist groups want the foundation to release agreements with all of its donors.\n\nElizabeth Mathews, a senior and the vice president of Transparent GMU, said that she was saddened to have resorted to suing her own school, but that she felt its credibility was under siege.\n\n\u201cEven though we have looked particularly at the Kochs, this is a nonpartisan issue,\u201d Ms. Mathews said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe anyone should be able to do this.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "Photo\n\nSome ideas are bigger than others. Some even grow so large that they turn into paradigms, their logic organizing the way we see everything around them. And if you\u2019re uncertain what framework dominates modern life, well, you can take it from the TED conference fixture and Advertising for Humanity founder Dan Pallotta, who put it bluntly enough in a 2011 article for Harvard Business Review: \u201cBrand is everything, and everything is brand.\u201d\n\nHe was writing in the service of building his own brand, which is about rebranding other people\u2019s brands. The brand, in fact, is such a ubiquitous organizing principle for so many things \u2014 companies, products, people \u2014 that it has been forced to spawn an expansive glossary of subcategories and varieties. There are \u201cpublic brands\u201d (civic institutions), \u201cbrand extensions\u201d (new products from existing brands), \u201cfighter brands\u201d (cheaper brands released by costlier brands to reattract lost brand loyalty) and \u201cbrand leaders\u201d (the very best brands). Even aspects of branding itself are branded, with \u201cbrand managers\u201d (marketers) building \u201cbrand equity\u201d (likability) through the cultivation of \u201cbrandface\u201d (the way the consumer sees herself when she engages with the brand). The apotheosis of all this might be the \u201clifestyle brand\u201d \u2014 a corporate bid to escape the humdrum reality of selling products and instead market an entire way of being. Taco Bell is entering the category with a Forever 21 clothing line targeted at \u201cmaking wardrobes a whole lot saucier.\u201d Lexus has chased the luxury lifestyle into the sea by introducing a yacht. A vice president for Good Foods describes its guacamole as part of \u201ca lifestyle brand that adds optimum nutrition and wellness, along with the fun factor that can be enjoyed during holidays like Cinco de Mayo.\u201d\n\nAnything that can be consumed is now understood as a brand \u2014 and on the internet, that\u2019s every last bit of content. This is how a consultant like Eric Garland can, on the strength of a viral tweet storm about the \u201cgame theory\u201d behind American politics, brand himself as a Russian conspiracy sage and market subscriptions to @gametheorytoday. It\u2019s also why actual brands, like Hamburger Helper or Denny\u2019s, hang around social media masquerading as people, posting jokes and memes and roasting haters. Even the most cynical internet users speak semiseriously about our posts being \u201con brand\u201d or \u201coff brand.\u201d There is no refuge from the logic of the brand \u2014 and if there is, some up-and-coming strategist will soon enough bolster her own brand by colonizing it.\n\nCorporate branding first emerged as a practical measure. In the 1920s, the rise of American consumer culture produced a glut of products that couldn\u2019t be differentiated from one another on sight. The branding that emerged around them has, at points, had a glimmer of utility to it, serving as a way to establish the authenticity and reliability of a particular thing from a particular source. But the idea of a \u201cbrand\u201d rapidly spread beyond that seal of quality and subsumed a whole constellation of sentiments a company might provoke in a person, many of them wholly abstracted from the product itself. In her 1999 book, \u201cNo Logo,\u201d Naomi Klein presents the acceleration of corporate branding as a kind of hollowing out: Companies that used to manufacture wares or harvest foods \u2014 that used to sell things \u2014 became brands, which sell ideas. Actual production processes became secondary, outsourced to far-flung subcontractors. The brand\u2019s real investment was to imbue the products with meaning. \u201cNike isn\u2019t a running-shoe company,\u201d Klein wrote in the 10th-anniversary edition, \u201cit is about the idea of transcendence through sports.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt its core, branding is a process of humanization: It imbues companies with personalities. Often the personification is overt. Once there were Aunt Jemima and Betty Crocker; now there\u2019s the Trump Organization and Fenty Beauty. As the celebrity adman Bruce Barton once said: \u201cInstitutions have souls, just as men and nations have souls.\u201d A company with a soul becomes relatable, but in a deceptive way: The more we think of it as a \u201cbrand,\u201d the more our focus shifts away from things like labor practices and supply chains and onto issues of narrative and identity.", "title": "What Happens When People and Companies Are Both Just \u2018Brands\u2019?", "authors": ["Amanda Hess", "First Words"]}

Trump does not. He not only accuses the F.B.I., Justice Department and other agencies of forming a \u201cdeep state,\u201d but also seeks to challenge, disrupt and exert control over them. Trump does not think in institutional terms, but in personal ones.\n\nThese lines of criticism intersect over Russia. Hayden acknowledges that intelligence agencies were slow to pick up on the Russian challenge to United States elections: \u201cCommitted to a path of cyber dominance for ourselves, we seemed to lack the doctrinal vision to fully understand what the Russians were up to with their more full-spectrum information dominance.\u201d That lack of vision was compounded by the reluctance of both the Obama and Trump administrations to counterattack. \u201cRussia has been actively seeking to damage the fabric of American democracy,\u201d Hayden writes, \u201cand the Trump administration\u2019s glandular aversion to even looking at this squarely, much less mounting a concerted response to it, is an appalling national security lapse.\u201d\n\nFor a longtime spook, Hayden is a breezy and direct writer. He reduces complex issues of cyber and information warfare to essentials, and his polemic is leavened with humor and sympathy. He is at his best, though, when he shifts to a purely analytical tone. He coolly forecasts the direction of America under Trump, explains the intelligence that foreign governments are likely to collect from the president\u2019s Twitter feed and describes the benefits Russia drew from the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Kremlin-connected Russian attorneys and senior Trump campaign officials.", "title": "What Happens When the President Ignores \u2014 and Even Belittles \u2014 His Own Intelligence Community?", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-05 00:00:00", "text": "These stories never show up in the short videos on ex-gay ministries\u2019 websites. Ex-gay organizations create emotional short films with earnest young people who talk about hope and redemption, and then they quietly remove the videos when these very same people come out years later with the truth about themselves that they tried to suppress. In fact, that\u2019s what happened to me.\n\nEqually important, the narrative that people find \u201cfreedom from homosexuality through Jesus\u201d fails to acknowledge the existence of the thousands of people who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. Christians. Sexual and gender minorities do not have to choose between their faith and queerness: Both parts of their complex identities belong, and the two actually inform each other. I\u2019m engaged to a woman named Amanda Hite, and our shared passion for Jesus is central to our relationship.\n\nIn addition to the countless Christian denominations that affirm the beauty of same-sex relationships, there are also organizations like The Reformation Project teaching a message of inclusion in conservative Christian communities. They were moved to support same-sex relationships because of their understanding of Scripture. While many conservative Christians actively work against the flourishing of L.G.B.T.Q. people, they don\u2019t represent all Christians.\n\nI feel compassion for the people who will attend the Freedom March on Saturday. The videos on their Facebook page feature young people who say they left a lifestyle of anonymous sex, drug addiction and despair. But I have a lot of L.G.B.T.Q. friends, and I don\u2019t know any who would describe their lives in that way. My community comprises queer pastors, psychologists, professors and entrepreneurs. Some of them are married, some are celibate, many are sober, and all of them are extraordinary human beings.\n\nI can\u2019t help wondering whether the young people in the videos found themselves in destructive cycles because of the shame they carried from the teaching they heard growing up. It\u2019s hard for me to believe they would seek to rid themselves of their God-given desire to love someone of the same sex if it weren\u2019t for the leaders in their communities who fail to consider the possibility that they\u2019re wrong about the value and dignity of L.G.B.T.Q. people made in the image of God.\n\nAs several Christian leaders have already said: If the gospel someone preaches is not good news for the marginalized \u2014 for people of color, those with disabilities, immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. people \u2014 then it\u2019s not good news for anyone. The message the organizers of the Freedom March preach is certainly not good news for people like me. But I have found the Gospel of Jesus \u2014 the one who drew near to the outcasts and touched the despised with his own hands \u2014 to be very good news to me as a lesbian Christian. I want those attending the Freedom March to know this good news is for them, too.", "title": "Opinion | What I Learned From Gay Conversion Therapy", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-05 00:00:00", "text": "Saturday is Cinco de Mayo, a day often mistaken in the United States for Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. In fact, the holiday had its origin more than 50 years after the date associated with the country\u2019s independence. So here\u2019s what you need to know about Cinco de Mayo, including its evolution into a major economic driver for business owners and beverage companies across the United States.\n\nWhat is the significance of Cinco de Mayo?\n\nCinco de Mayo, which isn\u2019t widely celebrated in Mexico, commemorates an underdog victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862. The victory was galvanizing for the Mexican forces \u2014 and for those supporting them from afar \u2014 but it was short-lived, as France later occupied Mexico for a few years. Still, Cinco de Mayo continued to be celebrated in Puebla and, perhaps more significantly, by Mexican-Americans north of the border.\n\nSo when is Mexico\u2019s Independence Day celebrated?\n\nThe country\u2019s Independence Day is Sept. 16, now a national holiday. On that day in 1810, a priest named Miguel Hidalgo implored Mexico to revolt against Spain, leading to the War for Independence, which ended in 1821.\n\nWhen did Cinco de Mayo gain popularity in the United States?\n\nIn the early 1960s, many Mexican-American activists entrenched in the country\u2019s growing civil rights movement used the day as a source of pride. Close to two decades later, in 1989, an ad campaign by an importer of beers like Modelo and Corona was introduced around the day. The campaign was initially targeted toward Latinos but eventually broadened with print and TV ads. This year, Corona\u2019s website featured a ticking \u201cCountdown to Corona de Mayo\u201d in the hours leading up to May 5.", "title": "What Is Cinco de Mayo?", "authors": []}

But Telegram\u2019s increasing popularity prompted scrutiny from countries like France, where investigators found that the app had become a platform for coordinating terrorism.\n\nThe growing criticism led Telegram to crack down on public channels used by the Islamic State. But the terrorist group has thwarted those efforts and continues to operate on the platform. (The channels are one of Telegram\u2019s distinctive features, allowing messages to be broadcast to an indefinite number of users.) Mr. Durov and others at Telegram insisted that private messages would remain private.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere\u2019s more on Telegram\u2019s founder, Pavel Durov\n\nMr. Durov, the founder of Telegram, is in exile. But not long ago, he was seen as Russia\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. Now 33, Mr. Durov started a social network, VKontakte, in 2006, when Russia still appeared to have a future as a haven for web freedom. \u201cIn some ways, it was more liberal than the United States,\u201d he told The Times almost a decade later, after he chose to leave his country following clashes with the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.\n\nMr. Durov sold VKontakte, which shared the look and feel of Facebook but was more popular in Russia, and left the country with a reported $300 million in his pocket in 2014. Once abroad, he began Telegram, hoping to offer a service to people who were worried about their privacy.\n\nSince leaving Russia, Mr. Durov has roamed the world with a core team of Telegram engineers, recently spending time in Dubai. Mr. Durov also holds a passport from St. Kitts and Nevis, a nation in the Caribbean.\n\nSo, is it totally watertight?\n\nTelegram uses end-to-end encryption, as do WhatsApp and Signal. This type of encryption converts messages into a code without the help of a server in the middle, making it nearly impossible to gain access to communication between two users without their consent.\n\nBut Telegram uses its own secure messaging protocol, called MTProto, and the robustness of that system is up for debate. \u201cNobody quite knows how it works, and a lot of the security analysis that has been done of it suggests that it\u2019s not as secure as some people think it is,\u201d Mr. Woodward said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe app \u201chas had serious and simple issues in the protocol,\u201d an analysis by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found, adding that \u201cany knowledgeable security expert could penetrate\u201d those weaknesses.\n\nMr. Woodward said that Telegram \u201calso leaks a lot of metadata \u2014 so who\u2019s calling whom, when, for how long, that type of thing \u2014 which can be just as useful for intelligence organizations.\u201d (Signal, by contrast, is said to retain barely any information on its users.)\n\nVideo\n\nBalancing privacy and security\n\nWestern governments have been critical of Telegram\u2019s privacy policy, but have nonetheless appeared reluctant to ban Telegram. The app\u2019s use by terrorists has fueled the debate about the need for surveillance, however.\n\nSome of Telegram\u2019s largest user bases are in Iran and Russia \u2014 the very countries that have tried to block the app. (Some users in those countries have been using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to hide their geographical location and in that way circumvent restrictions.)\n\n\u201cThe jurisdictions that are blocking it are obviously not the liberal Western democracies that are used to allowing people to talk securely,\u201d Mr. Woodward said.\n\nDemonstrations in Russia against the app\u2019s blocking have included prominent opposition figures, including Aleksei A. Navalny, the anti-corruption activist; and Maria Alyokhina, a member of the feminist collective Pussy Riot.\n\nDespite the posturing, Mr. Durov has pushed against making concerns about Telegram a political issue. \u201cI regard myself as a tech entrepreneur,\u201d he told The Financial Times recently, \u201cnot as a politician or philosopher.\u201d", "title": "What Is Telegram, and Why Are Iran and Russia Trying to Ban It?", "authors": ["Palko Karasz"]}

Authorities in Congo arrested Mr. Kangudi, locked him up and tortured him. He walked across a bridge to El Paso in 2017, then spent four months in a detention center in New Mexico before gaining asylum.\n\nM. P., 30s, El Salvador\n\nM. P. and her son, J. G., fled El Salvador in 2014 after the MS-13 gang tried several times to recruit him and vowed to kill the teenager\u2019s mother unless he joined. They entered the United States illegally and applied for asylum in 2016 in Utah. A judge denied her request in March on the grounds that claims of gang violence do not qualify for asylum, but M. P. is appealing. She is unable to work and is afraid she could be deported at any moment, said her lawyer, Christina Brown of Denver. Her son is part of the same application. (They did not want be identified because they feared it could jeopardize their case.)\n\nCristina Bebawy, 62, Morocco\n\nMoroccan police officers raided the apartment where Ms. Bebawy, a teacher, participated in Bible studies in 2009. She and other women there were arrested and thrown into jail, where they were forced to undress and perform sex acts. The officers videotaped and photographed the acts, then used the footage to justify arresting the women multiple times. Ms. Bebawy received asylum after traveling to the United States on a tourist visa in 2013, according to her lawyer, Christopher Casazza, in Wayne, Pa.\n\nChe Eric Sama, 28, Cameroon\n\nMr. Sama, a university student from Cameroon, applied for asylum after fleeing first to Nigeria, then traveling through Mexico to the United States border in 2015. He said he had been beaten by an anti-gay group for posting a statement in a student publication in support of gay rights in Cameroon, where same-sex sexual activity is illegal and punishable by prison. Mr. Sama, who claimed he faced the possibility of state-sanctioned harm if he was forced to return to Cameroon, had his request for asylum denied, in addition to his appeal in April. He has been deported.\n\nYomara Rivas, 27, Guatemala\n\nMs. Rivas fled to the United States with her daughter, then 4, in 2014, making a perilous trek from Guatemala to the Arizona desert. Ms. Rivas, who was born into an impoverished family of coffee pickers, said in her asylum request that her boyfriend had become physically abusive and tried to strangle their daughter. Ms. Rivas was granted asylum before Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, signaled that he opposes giving asylum to domestic violence victims.\n\nM. C., Honduras\n\nM. C. was detained in South Texas in 2015 and requested asylum as a victim of domestic violence. She passed her credible-fear interview but then remained in detention for nine months. A judge rejected her application, contending that the Honduran government was instituting policies to address domestic violence. She filed an appeal, which was denied on similar grounds, and is appealing again. The board of immigration appeals sent the case back to the same judge, who has since retired. Her case may be heard again in 2020. M. C. cannot work and is living with her child in New Jersey, relying on family to support them.

He is also a Zikri Muslim, a religious minority targeted by fundamentalists because its members do not adhere to the prophecy of Muhammad. Mr. Ali was interrogated and beaten for his political and religious beliefs. He testified during his asylum interview that returning to his homeland would be life-threatening. He was granted asylum in 2017 and was recently accepted to Columbia University.\n\n\u201cThe asylum process is extremely difficult,\u201d Mr. Ali said, comparing it to \u201ccrossing the Bridge of Siraat,\u201d an Islamic belief that the span must be traversed to enter Paradise. \u201cThe Bridge of Siraat is as thin as the strand of hair.\u201d", "title": "What It Takes to Get Asylum in the U.S.", "authors": []}

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "To name just a few: When and why did you decide to fire James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who was leading the Russia investigation at the time? What did you mean when you told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt that you fired Mr. Comey because \u201cthis Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story\u201d? Did you try to persuade the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to protect you from the investigation? Did you secretly promise to pardon Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser who has pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators about his communications with the Russian ambassador?\n\nThe questions are a reminder of just how aberrant this White House has been. No prior president so openly assaulted the rule of law or undermined the integrity of the law enforcement community. In that light, Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions also provide a measure of comfort that, amid all the chaos and tumult of this administration, career public servants in law enforcement continue to do their jobs, investigating crimes and pursuing justice. It may unnerve Mr. Trump, who has spent his life skirting the law and avoiding full accountability, but this is how the law works. Without saying a word publicly, Mr. Mueller and his team of experienced investigators are showing America how a government premised on the rule of law is supposed to function. The process may seem slow, but that is out of diligence and caution. Its fundamental purpose is truth-seeking \u2014 unlike, say, the embarrassing obfuscations of the Republican leaders of the House Intelligence Committee, who last week absolved Mr. Trump and his campaign of any wrongdoing in a 250-page report that reads more like a work of fantasy than a government investigation.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that the leak of Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and that \u201cit would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened!\u201d\n\nWrong. Obstruction of justice is itself a federal crime \u2014 see, for example, Section 1505 of Title 18 of the United States Code \u2014 regardless of whether prosecutors can establish an underlying offense. Mr. Trump and his defenders mock it as a \u201cprocess crime,\u201d but the rule of law breaks down if people can interfere, with impunity, in law enforcement\u2019s efforts to do justice. Don\u2019t forget that both presidents who have faced impeachment proceedings in the past few decades, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, were accused of obstructing justice.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Mueller appears to have at least some evidence of an underlying offense. That is the implication of about a dozen of his questions, including the most surprising of all: Was Mr. Trump aware of any efforts by his campaign, and specifically by his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, to seek Russia\u2019s help in winning the 2016 election?", "title": "Opinion | What Robert Mueller Knows", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-03 00:00:00", "text": "Although I assume the subtitle issue has been resolved, the double-layered sticker situation nicely reflects the structure of this utterly original book, split into two parts. In the first, Witold Szablowski, a Polish journalist frequently compared to the late, more pre-eminent Pole, the writer Ryszard Kapuscinski, describes how after the fall of communism, \u201cdancing\u201d bears kept in captivity by the Roma people in Bulgaria were taken away by well-meaning if righteous animal-rights NGOs and put into special reservations that simulate the wild.\n\nImage\n\nThis narrative would have made for a lovely little book in its own right. Szablowski makes you feel for the Roma families who are losing their livelihood (they earned money by making the bears dance and act out comedy sketches as street entertainment), yet he never flinches from detailing the cruel conditions these same people imposed on the animals. A bear\u2019s most sensitive body part is its nose, and their owners inserted metal rings through them so they could force the bears to dance with little tugs, torturing them physically while breaking their will by giving them alcohol to drink. Szablowski divides the bears\u2019 journey to semi-freedom, or more civilized captivity, into nine chapter headings, from the \u201cLove\u201d the Roma claim to feel for their prisoners, through the bears\u2019 rediscovery of their \u201cInstincts.\u201d One great victory occurs when the bears learn \u201cHibernation,\u201d after never having done so before. But the transition is far from perfect: Because the bears would not be able to look after cubs, they are neutered. Unable to reproduce, with no obvious future, they start to repeat behaviors they were forced to perform before being \u201crescued.\u201d To the horror of the animal-rights community, the \u201cliberated\u201d bears rise up on their hind legs and dance.\n\nIn the second half of his book, Szablowski repeats the same nine chapter headings, but this time he describes daily life in countries from the former Soviet bloc to Cuba at various stages between communism and democracy. At the start of every chapter, Szablowski inserts a quote from the corresponding chapter about the bears. The chapter on Estonia quotes the chapter from Part 1 on instincts, recalling the testimony of zoology experts who bring the bears out of captivity: \u201cWe sit in our observatory and watch how they behave, and we work it out \u2014 how much aggression we can allow them, whether they\u2019ve already crossed the boundary or whether we can still give them a while to cool down.\u201d What ensues is an account of the fraught, often near-violent, relationship between ethnic Estonians and the ethnic Russian minority within that country.\n\nThe book offers not so much a single, continuous narrative as it does two narratives placed opposite each other, bouncing meanings back and forth. As I read the country chapters I was always flicking back to the related sections about the bears. Sometimes the connections come relatively easily, as with instinct and Estonia. Other times they are less obvious: Like some works of conceptual art, they seemed designed to tease and pleasantly infuriate. The \u201cHibernation\u201d chapter in Part 2 is about a Polish village where the locals dress up like Tolkien characters to earn a pittance from visiting tourists. Is this a case of a passive populace honing its entrepreneurial instincts? Or, rather, the pseudo-activity of a free-market model, which keeps people soporific?\n\nIn the final chapter, I assumed Szablowski would take us to contemporary Hungary or Poland, countries deemed to have successfully completed the shift from the Warsaw Pact to the European Union, but where authoritarian tendencies are now prevalent. Instead, he pivots to Greece, which was governed by a right-wing dictatorship until 1974. During mass anti-E.U. protests in Athens, the language of \u201ctransition\u201d is reversed: The protesters see the E.U. as the prison and want to \u201csweep capitalism away.\u201d Are they yearning for the certitudes of tyranny? Still instinctively fighting a long-gone authoritarianism? Or is so-called capitalism being revealed as a false freedom?\n\nThroughout \u201cDancing Bears,\u201d Szablowski challenges not only the conventions of linear storytelling, but also the linear logic of a simple political progression from unfree to free. But he doesn\u2019t merely replace one imposed narrative with another. Instead, he provokes a far-reaching and unresolved conversation about what freedom might really mean. A reader yearning for an all-explaining style of storytelling will be frustrated. Maybe that, too, is a kind of nostalgia for tyranny.", "title": "What Trained Bears Can Teach Us About Formerly Authoritarian Countries", "authors": []}
{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "When our son went off to college, he told us that she contacted him through the internet \u2014 first using an adoption search site and then directly. This was not what we agreed to at all, and it was especially surprising and disheartening that she contacted him without including us.\n\nHe answered her, eventually but not immediately. And I think some emails were exchanged. Then, during a summer break from college, he let us know that she had contacted him and asked if he could attend her wedding. She would fly him out, have him stay with her for about a week and fly him back. We were glad for her but dismayed that again she was not reaching out to us. If our permission had been sought, we would have agreed, of course; we always supported our son\u2019s finding out more about his birth family. (All through his life, we mentioned adoption, spoke about his birth parents, were open to any questions he had, which weren\u2019t many \u2014 we\u2019ve learned that\u2019s not unusual for boys.) We just expected and wished the request had come from him.\n\nWe asked him to give us her address so we could send a card and a present. After many texts back and forth between the two of them, she agreed to send us her email address, which we took as a slight and a bit of an insult. We asked him to send our best wishes. She hasn\u2019t connected with us at all.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat was a few years ago, and we\u2019re still in a standoff of sorts. She has not reached out to us (most likely she feels we should have opened the adoption and agreed to her wishes), but more important \u2014 and potentially more harmful \u2014 she placed our son in the middle of a difficult situation. We are glad they have met (she has flown him out to California a few times) and have spent time together, but this is not the connected, united family situation we were hoping we could offer our son.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I know we have no recourse even though she broke the rules that we all agreed to, but how can we explain this to our son without making things even more confrontational?\n\nI\u2019d like to be the \u201cgood parent\u201d and write her a friendly \u201clet bygones be bygones\u201d note and express friendship for the sake of the unification of all parts of our son, but I haven\u2019t been able to. Is it up to me or us to make the gesture, after we followed all the mutually agreed upon rules and she didn\u2019t? Name Withheld\n\n\n\nIn making arrangements of great ethical importance and emotional complexity, it\u2019s wise to agree to reasonable conditions in advance. Absent some compelling reason, arising from facts unforeseen when the arrangements were made, there is then a strong moral reason to keep your word. The situation you have described is one in which you have abided by your original agreement and your son\u2019s birth mother has not. Because our ideas about adoption have changed, some people will say that she should be allowed to behave as if you had made a different agreement, of a sort that is now more common. I disagree. Her decision to make contact with your son was a response to her own interests, not to anyone else\u2019s. Given that she hadn\u2019t heard from him, she had no evidence that he wanted her in his life. Had your son wished to contact her, he was free to get your permission to do so, and he didn\u2019t. So yes, what she did was wrong.\n\nBut it was perhaps not terribly surprising. It\u2019s hard to predict how you will feel after giving up your child. The birth mother, it appears, is resentful that you didn\u2019t agree to open the adoption when she asked you to, and has sought the relationship denied her by going around you. It\u2019s now difficult for her to see you and your spouse as anything other than impediments. You, too, may be resentful, not without reason, given that resentment is the proper attitude toward those who have wronged you. Yet letting go of that resentment will probably do you some good. That\u2019s not to say you should tell her she has been forgiven; she clearly sees herself as the aggrieved party. One of those mid-17th-century maxims of the Duc de la Rochefoucauld\u2019s speaks to this: \u201cWe forgive those we find tiresome, but not those who find us tiresome.\u201d\n\nYour son is now an adult and presumably knows everything you\u2019ve told me, including that his birth mother did what she promised not to do. If he wants to develop a relationship with her, that\u2019s up to him. If you want a relationship with her as well \u2014 something she seems not to want \u2014 he is the person best placed to persuade her to accommodate you.\n\nBut first, ask yourself why you want this. We all have relationships with people our parents don\u2019t know. If your son feels that he needs you all to get along \u2014 if the \u201cunited family situation\u201d you refer to is important to him \u2014 he can say so. Otherwise, consider leaving well enough alone. Any strain in your relationship with your son is likely to arise from your resentment of his birth mother. Again, I hope you\u2019ll be able to shed those feelings, but spending time with her while you have them may not be the best way to do so.", "title": "What if Our Son\u2019s Birth Mother Wants a Relationship With Him \u2014 but Not Us?", "authors": ["Kwame Anthony Appiah", "The Ethicist"]}

Tammie Jo Shults of Southwest Airlines made her emergency landing of a Boeing 737 on April 17 after an engine explosion and traumatic injuries in the cabin, the world took note of the previous history she made as one of the first women to serve as a fighter pilot in the Navy. Shults, 56, who had wanted to fly since she was a teenager, first tried to enlist in the Air Force and was turned down. She was instead commissioned into the Navy in 1985 and served first as an instructor pilot for the T-2 Buckeye, a training aircraft for student aviators, and then flew as an A-7 Corsair pilot. When her squadron transitioned to the F/A-18 Hornet, then the Navy\u2019s newest fighter jet, Shults was one of the first women to pilot it. But because she was a woman, Shults was prevented from joining a combat squadron, and so she transferred to the Reserve in 1993. Shults then started working for Southwest Airlines as a commercial pilot. Two days after Shults left active duty, the Navy asked the Clinton administration to allow women to fly in combat assignments.\n\nShults is one of a small sisterhood: the women who have served as military aviators. Even though restrictions on women flying aircraft in combat were lifted 25 years ago, the percentage of military pilots who are women remains around 6.5 percent \u2014 and is comparable in the commercial industry, where many pilots land after training and careers in the armed services. In the wake of Shults\u2019s moment in the news, other pioneering women in military aviation considered what it meant to be among the few in a field still dominated by men, why the gender balance has remained so stubbornly lopsided and whether the armed services have done enough to make the history and the roles of these women publicly known.\n\nPhoto\n\nLt. Col. Amy McGrath, who retired last year after two decades of service, was an F/A-18 Hornet pilot and, in 2002, the first woman to fly on a combat mission in the Marine Corps.\n\n\u201cThere were just so few women. You would think we would band together, but a lot of the time, we just wanted to fit in, so we didn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t even know I was the first. We deployed as a squadron to Afghanistan. It really wasn\u2019t until after the first couple of missions that someone said, \u2018Hey, I think you\u2019re the first woman to do this in the Marine Corps.\u2019 And then we just sort of dropped it. I didn\u2019t really pat myself on the back. We were in war. We were busy.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nKyleanne Hunter, a former Marine major who served from 2000 to 2012, was the first woman in her squadron to pilot an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cShould we have made a bigger deal of what we did?

{"date": "2018-05-05 00:00:00", "text": "The workers I spoke with told me that their first act when occupying a factory was to clean and secure the machinery, something they did out of pride. What could such workers possibly make of the slogan \u201cNever work,\u201d a popular piece of student graffiti?\n\nMistrust of the students ran deep among the workers, as did a lack of comprehension. Colette Danappe, who worked at a factory outside Paris, spoke to me of the fear and disgust the students inspired in her. Driving to a demonstration with her husband and some friends, their car was suddenly surrounded by students brandishing paving stones. \u201cI had the scare of my life,\u201d she told me. She was also upset when the students set cars on fire: \u201cI\u2019d say to myself, \u2018You save all your life to buy something and then someone destroys it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gulf between the workers and the students is nowhere more evident than in two gatherings that occurred at the tail end of the uprising, in mid-June. On June 10, a Maoist high school student named Gilles Tautin drowned while fleeing the police outside a Renault factory in Flins, one of the last hot spots of the uprising. The next day, Pierre Beylot, a worker at a Peugeot factory in Sochaux, was shot and killed by the police. If you watch footage of the funeral of Mr. Beylot, no students appear to be in attendance.\n\nLikewise, if you watch footage of Mr. Tautin\u2019s funeral, there appear to be no workers. Indeed, the General Confederation of Labor, a Communist-led trade union, had issued orders that its members not attend the Tautin funeral, wanting to end the strikes and not risk any further disturbance. That workers followed this order, including those not in the union, speaks volumes about the distance between the two groups.\n\nAll this goes far in explaining how and why May \u201968 failed. But if we speak only of the May of the students and the May of the workers, we omit a third May \u2014 an \u201canti-May\u201d that ultimately carried the day, and that the students failed to take into account. On May 30, 1968, half a million people paraded on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in support of President de Gaulle. You would never know it from the conventional accounts of May \u201968, but this march was perhaps the largest demonstration of the period. The France that the students were rebelling against, that they thought was all but dead, turned out to be very much alive \u2014 and eager to put the students back in their place.\n\nIt was Charles de Gaulle, after all, who emerged triumphant from the elections in June 1968. The political right remained in power in France until the victory in 1981 of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and his very un-1968 brand of socialism. Since then, the left has been reduced to a shadow of its former self, while the right and neoliberalism have grown ever stronger.\n\nMay \u201968 will be remembered all over the world this year as a great missed opportunity.

I spent some time with the chef Angie Mar recently, skulking around her kitchen at the Beatrice Inn in Manhattan as she cooked a fine dinner of pan-roasted chicken with morels in a Madeira-spiked cream sauce flecked with savory and tarragon (above). I wrote about it for The Times this week. I think it looks pretty fancy!\n\nBut it isn\u2019t, really. The recipe is just a simple chicken dinner enlivened with flavors that you may not have in your pantry but sure could have, and maybe ought to have, for occasional use: Cognac, for instance, to flame the mushrooms; that Madeira wine.\n\nThese last forever in a cupboard or on a bar.

I am also a psychotherapist and have treated victims and perpetrators. Therapy is not the end-all and be-all, but some form of self-reflection is essential for prolonged change. There needs to be a path for redemption that includes paying back a debt to the victims and society. My nephew was in jail for several years, where he underwent counseling. He no longer drinks, and has had to become self-employed as his criminal record makes him unemployable. He is very fortunate to have a loving partner and community that support his continued growth.\n\nIf he had not been convicted, I doubt his changes for the better would have happened. However, if he had not chosen to embark on a path of self-improvement, then he would not have developed such a good support system. It\u2019s not the victim\u2019s responsibility to forgive, or to provide a means for offenders to reform. We as a community are responsible for these actions. We have the knowledge to do it, but we don\u2019t have the will yet. I hope this #MeToo awakening acts as the catalyst to provide the will to help change perpetrators\u2019 behavior for the betterment of all, including the abusers. \u2014 Helen Clark\n\nAvoid simplistic categories\n\nI think a part of the problem that has escaped the author\u2019s attention is our desire to categorize people with simplistic labels like \u201cgood man\u201d and \u201cbad man.\u201d The author used the term \u201cbad men\u201d four times in the article, implying that it applies to any of the men felled by the #MeToo movement. I think this reflects a lack of understanding of how complicated people really are.\n\nSome of the men named appear to be flawed but ultimately decent individuals who contribute to our society and culture with their work. I don\u2019t mean to excuse their behavior; they made mistakes that harmed other people, and it is unquestionable that they should pay a price for those mistakes. But when we decide that someone is a \u201cbad man,\u201d we run a real risk of falling into a mental trap of concluding that someone does not deserve to have a place in society or to have a chance at growth or redemption. This may be true of some of the men under discussion, but surely isn\u2019t true of all of them. \u2014 Math Professor\n\nEnforce accountability\n\nWhile we are developing treatment programs, public policy options and reconciliation and forgiveness commissions to reintegrate these men into polite society, perhaps we can also spare a thought or two for the victims of these men. I have yet to see an article anywhere discussing reparations for the women who endured ruined careers or blighted financial prospects. Has Richard Meier reached out to any of the women he is accused of treating so appallingly to offer to pay for graduate school? Has Charlie Rose offered to make an introduction for a job opportunity to any of his former employees?\n\nWhen I think of the talent and hard work that so many of these young women had to offer, and in return received sexual abuse and official silence and banishment, it is really hard, at least for me, to worry about what will become of the men. Moreover, most of them have barely even taken responsibility for having done anything wrong. They have issued statements with phrases like \u201cif I offended anyone \u2026\u201d and \u201cwhile I disagree with many of the characterizations \u2026\u201d and \u201call of these relationships were consensual.\u201d Corporations hire law firms to issue reports that hold management blameless, like Laura Walker of WNYC.

Now, what to pack?\n\nWe\u2019ve shared packing essentials for any 36-hour trip in previous lists. So we asked Elaine Glusac, who wrote our guide to Montgomery, to name a few items she was glad to have on her last visit \u2014 or wished she had brought with her.\n\nThen we turned to Ria Misra, an editor at Wirecutter, for the best products to fill those needs \u2014 and her expert suggestions for other things to pack to make the most of your trip. Here are their picks.\n\nDon\u2019t Forget Your:\n\nComfortable running shoes. \u201cI was glad to have packed my running shoes to get in some exercise each morning before sightseeing in hopes of working off the previous night\u2019s bacon or deep-fried dish \u2014 two ubiquitous menu staples,\u201d Ms. Glusac said. Both the Mizuno Wave Rider 21 (for men) and Brooks Ghost 10 (for women) offer a great fit and comfort, according to Ms. Misra, and both are Wirecutter favorites. And you\u2019ll be glad for the shoes\u2019 cushiony treads as you make the rounds of museums, monuments and restaurants.\n\nMobile-friendly wireless earbuds. Jabra\u2019s Elite 65t is the first pair of \u201ctruly\u201d wireless (as in, there isn\u2019t even a wire between the left and the right) earbuds that Wirecutter wholeheartedly recommends, Ms. Misra explained. That\u2019s thanks to their comfortable fit and high sound quality for both music and phone calls. If you\u2019re going for a run or walk around the city like Ms. Glusac suggested, or just want to stroll along Montgomery\u2019s riverfront, you\u2019ll be glad you brought them. Also, visit Storybooth, a podcast studio fashioned like an old telephone booth, where stories from the city\u2019s history are being collected and shared. You won\u2019t need the earbuds while there, but those story archives are also available online, so you can keep listening after you leave.\n\nA lightweight outer layer. Typical for most cities where the weather can vary, a light, packable outer layer is definitely essential. \u201cI really enjoyed walking around Montgomery and spent a lot of time outdoors between the EJI monument, the capitol building, the Civil Rights Memorial and even a beer garden,\u201d Ms. Glusac said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important to dress light there, it\u2019s also critical to take a layer for time spent in air-conditioned museums, of which there are plenty.\u201d Outdoor Research\u2019s Tantrum Hooded Jacket is a great option for changeable conditions. Ms. Misra noted that it\u2019s breathable enough that you don\u2019t overheat in milder temperatures, but it still offers a layer of protection from overzealous air conditioning or on a breezy evening walk. Best of all, it\u2019s feather-light and packs down small, so you can stow it and forget about it when you don\u2019t need it.\n\nPortable power for your phone. A good battery pack is a must wherever you roam, but even more so given how often you\u2019ll want to snap and share photos from Montgomery\u2019s waterfront and museums or access notes, maps or directions you may have stored in your phone. For something you can slide into your pocket, Ms. Misra suggests the TravelCard charger.

While working in print, video and weaving, she realized that all these mediums encode information in lines. This inspired an interest in \u201chow lines could be built up to create information,\u201d she said in a video for Art 21. In 1980, she started weaving her own canvases and devising a coded language based on their structure. It uses squares on a grid to symbolize the letters of the English alphabet. A key to it opens her new exhibition, \u201cA Coded Language,\u201d at the gallery Bitforms The key is legible but not readily comprehensible. It intimates that language can have meaning even when it\u2019s not understood.\n\nOn her first hand-woven canvases, \u201cBabel 1\u201d and \u201cBabel 2\u201d (both 1980), Ms. Korot has painted the biblical story of the Tower of Babel in her code. The thin red-and-black characters of \u201cBabel 1\u201d look as if they belong to a non-Western language, while the symbols in \u201cBabel 2\u201d are more rectangular and blocky, like Morse code. Both are in rows contained in columns (or towers), suggesting a form that connects all written communication, despite the dispersion that concludes the Babel story.\n\nThe paintings \u201cAnordnung: Clearly Visible/Strongly Sewn\u201d (1985) and \u201cA = Girl\u201d (1986) recall ancient pages of Scripture, with a calligraphic version of Ms. Korot\u2019s language and weathered surfaces layered with marks. Each contains the silhouette of a girl derived from a photograph of Jews on train tracks during the Holocaust. The child seems to be a time traveler roaming the canvases in search of answers.\n\nIn the video \u201cEtty\u201d (2009-10), snippets of text from the diaries of Etty Hillesum, a Dutch Jewish writer who died at Auschwitz, scroll over a lattice pattern and images of storms. Hillesum created her own code to circumvent the Nazis, so while her words are intelligible, they also have a missing, second meaning. \u201cWe are permitted to send telegrams but forbidden to be specific,\u201d she writes \u2014 an eerie precedent for Ms. Korot\u2019s work.\n\nJILLIAN STEINHAUER", "title": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "authors": ["Jason Farago", "Will Heinrich", "Martha Schwendener", "Jillian Steinhauer"]}

My anxiety decreased immensely in just a few months, freeing up mental space for bigger questions.

In the United States, if you\u2019re not wealthy, not white and not heterosexual, you may be receiving less than optimal health care.\n\nBut research on disparities between how women and men are treated in medical settings is growing \u2014 and it is concerning for any woman seeking care. Research shows that both doctors and nurses prescribe less pain medication to women than men after surgery, even though women report more frequent and severe pain levels. And a University of Pennsylvania study found that women waited 16 minutes longer than men to receive pain medication when they visited an emergency room. Women are also more likely to be told their pain is \u201cpsychosomatic,\u201d or influenced by emotional distress. And in a survey of more than 2,400 women with chronic pain, 83 percent said they felt they had experienced gender discrimination from their health care providers.\n\nAnd then there are the stories that physicians themselves share about their patients. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many women I\u2019ve seen who have gone to see numerous doctors, only to be told their issues were stress-related or all in their heads,\u201d says Dr. Fiona Gupta, a neurologist and director of wellness and health in the department of neurosurgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cMany of these patients were later diagnosed with serious neurological problems, like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. They knew something was wrong, but had been discounted and instructed not to trust their own intuition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt can be hard to speak up if you feel you\u2019re not being treated fairly,\u201d Dr. Powell said. \u201cI\u2019m a professor at a medical school and I struggled with it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere are three steps to help ensure your health concerns are taken seriously.\n\nAsk about guidelines\n\nIf your doctor recommends something you suspect isn\u2019t right (including \u201cwatch and wait\u201d), Dr. Powell advises asking: \u201cWhat\u2019s the basis for your recommendation? Are there guidelines for this, and what do they say?\u201d \u201cGuidelines tend to be fairly objective and data-driven, so women do better when their doctors follow them,\u201d she notes.\n\nBe direct\n\nIf you still feel like you\u2019re being dismissed, say, \u201cI\u2019m concerned, and I feel that maybe you aren\u2019t hearing me. Help me understand why you don\u2019t see this as a problem.\u201d \u201cA good physician can have biases,\u201d says Dr. Powell. \u201cBut a good physician should also be able to take a step back and say, \u2018I hear you. Let\u2019s talk this through.\u2019\u201d\n\nCheck your own bias\n\n\u201cAs women, we\u2019ve been taught from an early age to rationalize warning signs of physical or mental health problems,\u201d says Dr. Gupta. (To wit: a Yale cardiology study found that many women hesitated to seek help for a heart attack because they worried about being thought of as hypochondriacs.) Recognize that expressing concern over symptoms doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re overreacting, self-diagnosing, or trying to do your health care provider\u2019s job for them. Says Dr. Gupta: \u201cIf you feel like something isn\u2019t right with your health, honor that \u2014 even if a doctor is disagreeing with you.

What was less surprising was that Mr. Price reverted to the party line a day later, saying that getting rid of the mandate \u201cwas exactly the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nOf course, the on-the-level statements from Mr. Rubio and Mr. Price represent stray comments in an ocean of lies, fibs and falsehoods about these pieces of legislation. The vast majority of Republican leaders insist that down is up and up is down when it comes to the effects of their policies, especially in the area of health care.\n\nWhile Congress failed to fully repeal the A.C.A. last year, the Trump administration has been busily whittling away health care benefits, disingenuously arguing that these changes will help working-class families by lowering health care costs. Under one administration proposal that\u2019s in the final stages of approval, insurance companies will be able to sell yearlong junk health plans that don\u2019t have to cover unexpected medical costs or pre-existing conditions. Earlier, the administration slashed spending on advertising and outreach to encourage people to sign up for policies on the health insurance marketplaces created by the health care act. And it ended payments to insurance companies that were authorized by the law to help lower deductibles for low-income families.\n\nThe administration\u2019s health care sabotage efforts have already had a big impact, but not the kind of impact officials promised. Insurance companies raised average premiums for 2018 A.C.A. policies by 30 percent. This has mostly hurt middle-class families who have to pay full freight for health insurance because they make too much money to qualify for subsidies and don\u2019t get coverage through their employers. Few experts were surprised when the Commonwealth Fund found that the percentage of American adults who did not have health insurance jumped to 15.5 percent this year, from 12.7 percent before Mr. Trump took office. Experts say those numbers could climb higher still when the penalty for not having insurance goes away next year.", "title": "Opinion | When Republicans Are Honest About Their Policies", "authors": []}

The organizers notified newspapers early in the day that they planned to kill Henry Lowery as painfully as possible, giving editors time to produce special editions that provided the time, place and gruesome particulars of the death to come.\n\nHistorians have paid scant attention to the role that the white Southern press played in the racial terrorism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which saw thousands of African-Americans hanged, burned, drowned or beaten to death by white mobs. This issue surfaced in dramatic fashion recently when the nearly two-centuries-old Montgomery Advertiser printed a front-page editorial apologizing for lynching coverage that dehumanized black victims. The apology coincided with the recent opening in Montgomery, Ala., of a memorial to lynching victims, and it sets the stage for a timely discussion of a deeply dishonorable period in Southern press history.\n\nThe bloody celebration at which 500 jeering spectators saw Henry Lowery burned to ashes was held at Nodena, Ark., on Jan. 26, 1921. Among those in attendance was a reporter for The Memphis Press whose story \u2014 under the headline \u201cKill Negro by Inches\u201d \u2014 validated the barbaric proceedings and cataloged the victim\u2019s suffering in lurid detail, noting that Lowery remained stoically silent \u201ceven after the flesh had dropped away from his legs and the flames were leaping toward his face.\u201d\n\nLowery had been charged with a wanton act of murder for killing his white landlord and the landlord\u2019s adult daughter. The renowned lynching investigator Walter White later reported that Lowery had drawn a pistol only after being shot by the landlord\u2019s son and physically attacked by the landlord himself in a dispute over wages. In the eyes of the lynching state \u2014 where an African-American could be put to death on a white person\u2019s whim \u2014 the impulse toward self-defense was often viewed as a crime when it came with a black face.", "title": "Opinion | When Southern Newspapers Justified Lynching", "authors": []}

People should know, and they should look.\u201d Mr. Araki declined repeated requests to comment.\n\nMr. Araki\u2019s work has long ignited controversy, given the provocative nature of his images, which include photographs of nude women bound up in a Japanese technique known as kinbaku-bi. He has been fined on obscenity charges in Japan, and while some critics consider him a maestro, others deem his work pornography.\n\nMaggie Mustard, co-curator of the Museum of Sex exhibition, said Kaori\u2019s allegations were forcing a new conversation about models\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThis gives us the opportunity to talk about what happens to a muse \u2014 and I use that word with air quotes \u2014 when she doesn\u2019t have a contract or a sense of economic or legal agency about how her image was used,\u201d Ms. Mustard said in a telephone interview.\n\nMs. Mustard added that she had spoken with Kaori and would incorporate her comments into the exhibition\u2019s programming materials. Already, the wall text mentions another model\u2019s anonymous allegations of inappropriate sexual contact by Mr. Araki, noting that \u201cthe controversy surrounding Araki\u2019s work has almost exclusively been about reception and meaning, and far less about the issues of consent and the potential abuses of power that can be at the foundation of artistic practice and artistic production.\u201d\n\nThe contentious relationship between artist and model goes back centuries, with men like Picasso or Schiele known for mistreating women. More recently, potential portrait models for Chuck Close have accused him of sexual harassment.\n\nArt historians argue that it might be time for artists to rethink the basis on which these relationships are built. Models should have \u201cmore agency in terms of authorship of the work itself,\u201d said Rebecca Zorach, a professor of art history at Northwestern University.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe art world has a tendency to erase women as makers, and historically it just happens over and over again,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Japan, Kaori\u2019s disclosures come as women are just starting to raise questions about male power, sexual harassment and assault.\n\nLast year, when one of Japan\u2019s best-known television journalists was accused of rape, his accuser received only a smattering of attention in the Japanese media. Last month after a television reporter anonymously asserted that a high-level civil servant in the Finance Ministry had sexually harassed several women, the official resigned, although he has denied the charges. The ministry has acknowledged he harassed a reporter.\n\nIn this staunchly patriarchal culture, women are often subservient to men. Japan consistently ranks low among developed countries on gender equality in health, education and the economy and has one of the world\u2019s worst records for women in politics.\n\nFor models working in Japan\u2019s art world, it is difficult to make demands of a male artist.\n\n\u201cI can imagine that as a male photographer who is more than 70 years old, he unconsciously has the perspective towards women that he can do whatever he wants,\u201d said Yukie Kamiya, head of the Japan Society Gallery in New York, speaking of Mr. Araki. \u201cMale power is such a common understanding, and women don\u2019t have much of a voice.\u201d\n\nKaori, who trained in Paris as a dancer, began posing for Mr. Araki after meeting him at a party in 2001.\n\nShe said he paid her 100,000 yen (about $930) to pose in the studio wearing a kimono or performing dances that Mr. Araki would photograph. For nude projects, he took her to so-called \u201clove hotels\u201d and paid her about 50,000 yen for each assignment.\n\nBut she said he also called her for impromptu, unpaid sessions where he took photos while she walked in a park or sat in a bar at his command.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Kaori asked the lawyer for help obtaining some rights to the photos, but Ms. Ito said that such disputes were very rare in Japan and that she was unlikely to win in court.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Ito said she had heard similar complaints from other models for Mr. Araki.\n\nOf course, power inequities between artists and models are not unique to him. \u201cThere has been no public discourse about this structural problem within the industry and the photographer-model relationship,\u201d said Michio Hayashi, a professor of art history at Sophia University in Tokyo.\n\nKaori described one incident when foreign photographers came to observe Mr. Araki as he took pictures of her. She did not want to appear nude in front of strangers, she said, but Mr. Araki told her, \u201cThey aren\u2019t here to photograph you, they\u2019re here to photograph me.\u201d\n\nBut when pictures from that session came out in print, Kaori appeared in them, naked. \u201cHe invited many photographers into the studio and he ordered me to spread my legs in front of that big audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nStill, it took her a long time to quit as Mr. Araki\u2019s model. She started working with him when she was young, and he was already famous. When he was hospitalized, she did not want to abandon him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLooking back now, everything was excessive and extreme,\u201d she wrote on her blog. \u201cSomething in me was numb. He asked me to do abnormal things, and I did them as if they were normal.\u201d At one point, she became suicidal.\n\nBy 2015, the relationship had soured so badly that Mr. Araki insisted she sign a document vowing not to defame him or his business. In 2016, Kaori, who by then was running her own ballet school, stopped working with him.\n\nWhen she requested that he stop republishing or exhibiting some photographs of her, he warned in a March 2017 letter that she had no rights. \u201cAll models should understand the potential for unlimited use of the work,\u201d he wrote in the letter, seen by The New York Times. \u201cI will decide which publication, which exhibition, when to publish and what kind of products I will give permission to use my work. It\u2019s all up to me.\u201d\n\nKaori is not the only model to have objected to Mr. Araki's distribution of photos. In an interview, another woman who occasionally modeled for him between 2003 and 2013, who requested anonymity because she did not want her family to know she had posed, said that when friends discovered nude photos of her online that she had not known about, she asked Mr. Araki to take them down. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the internet,\u201d he told her.\n\nThe model said a gallery that represents Mr. Araki, Taka Ishii in Tokyo, eventually removed the images from various websites.\n\nAs for Kaori, she had started to move on with the support of a new partner. But when #MeToo began and the Museum of Sex mounted its Araki retrospective, they inspired her to go public.\n\nMany of the comments on her blog offered encouragement and called her courageous. \u201cIt must have been a horrible experience,\u201d one commentator wrote.\n\nKaori said she did not expect an apology from Mr. Araki, and she is not asking the Museum of Sex to remove the three photos of her it is displaying.\n\nThe work, she said, should serve as a reminder.

For instance \u2014 I\u2019m going into a tangent \u2014 but my grandfather\u2019s family had a pasta factory right outside of Naples. His parents made pasta and sauces, and he and his siblings would go door to door to sell it when he was a child. That whole area was all pasta factories, but when I say that, you can\u2019t think of the factory the way you think of a factory in Detroit.

Private government contractors may also be restricted from buying foreign telecom products, which the United States believes may be vulnerable to Chinese espionage or disruption.\n\nThe order would follow a series of intensifying actions by the Trump administration to block Chinese technology that is seen as a national security threat. In March, the Federal Communications Commission took action to block broadband companies that receive federal subsidies from buying equipment from suppliers that are deemed a risk to national security. In April, the Commerce Department barred ZTE from purchases of American technology for seven years, saying that the company failed to punish employees who violated United States sanctions.\n\nThe Trump administration increasingly views national security and emerging technology as intertwined and has used its authority to protect national security as a way to block China from gaining an economic edge, particularly as it relates to that nation\u2019s ambitious industrial policy, known as Made in China 2025. Both nations are racing to claim dominance in cutting-edge technology like autonomous vehicles and the next generation of wireless services, known as 5G.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Defense said the Pentagon was stopping the sale of phones made by Huawei and ZTE in stores on American military bases around the world because of security concerns.", "title": "White House Considers Barring Chinese Telecom Sales as Tensions Mount", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Cecilia Kang"]}

More than one million foreign students study in the United States each year, with roughly one-third coming from China.\n\nThe restrictions would cover Chinese nationals, but with two exceptions: those with green cards, which give them the right to permanent residency in the United States, and those who have been granted asylum because of persecution in their home country. Also exempt would be former Chinese nationals who renounce their citizenship and become naturalized Americans.\n\nPhoto\n\nAn attempt to crack down on Chinese citizens could further chill relations between the two nations, whose closely integrated markets support the most prominent companies around the globe. Technology companies like Apple, Qualcomm, IBM and General Electric have hitched their future growth to access to the Chinese market, which the Trump administration is now threatening to curtail.\n\nThis week, a delegation of administration officials, including the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, will head to China for discussions to help avoid a brewing trade war. But additional curbs on Chinese citizens could make those tough discussions even harder.\n\nPresident Trump has threatened tariffs on roughly $150 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for unfair trade practices \u2014 a proposal that sparked tariff threats of China\u2019s own. The administration is expected to detail new plans for restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States by the end of May. Congress is also considering giving the United States broader authority to restrict Chinese investments.\n\nThese measures could prompt more damaging retaliation from China, which has already promised to place tariffs on at least $50 billion of American products. They also appear to be fueling anti-American sentiment within Chinese borders. China has tightened measures against possible spying, even posting public service announcements in subway trains warning citizens to watch foreigners for signs of espionage.\n\nIn America, research institutes look particularly vulnerable to espionage. According to Defense Department statistics, nearly a quarter of all foreign efforts to obtain sensitive or classified information in 2014 were routed through academic institutions. At a congressional hearing in April, Michelle Van Cleave, a former national counterintelligence executive, said the freedom and openness of the United States made the country a \u201cspy\u2019s paradise.\u201d Chinese and Russian agents both come to the United States with \u201cdetailed shopping lists,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet throwing up barriers to protect American technology could come at a high cost. Restricting the free flow of people and information could disrupt innovation at American laboratories, a key destination for talented researchers from around the globe. It could threaten the substantial profits that American universities earn from foreign students, who often pay full tuition.\n\nAnd it could lead to discrimination. Some fear that the Trump administration\u2019s comprehensive challenge to China \u2014 always an easy political target in the United States \u2014 is cultivating a xenophobic, Cold War mentality in Washington that casts all Chinese people as enemies.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Committee of 100, a group of prominent Chinese-Americans, has denounced government assertions that Chinese professors, scientists and students in the United States may be gathering intelligence for the Chinese government as \u201cdisturbing and prejudicial\u201d and warned that it has overtones of anti-Japanese sentiment that was rampant during World War II.\n\n\u201cTo target a whole group of people as being subject to greater suspicion, based purely on race and national origin, and in advance of any facts or evidence, goes against the fundamental American ideals of the presumption of innocence, due process and equal protection for all. It also fans the flames of hysteria,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nAdministration officials have been debating restricting visas offered to Chinese nationals for months as part of the broad package of measures targeting China economically. But the new plan under discussion by the White House would be a much more targeted measure, and one with potentially big consequences for American industry. While the Obama administration also proposed barring foreign students from company-sponsored research at American universities with national security implications, the Trump administration\u2019s measures could apply more broadly to private research facilities as well as new products and technologies.\n\nThe United States already restricts who can work on sensitive technology. Researchers on projects deemed classified are carefully vetted and must obtain security clearances. The next level down are research projects that are subject to so-called export controls \u2014 including many with potential military applications, such as computer programs and hardware that might be used to model nuclear explosions. Universities and companies working on this material need to obtain a special license from the government to employ foreign researchers.\n\nThese products do not need to leave the United States to fall under export rules. All it takes to trigger export controls is for citizens from certain countries \u2014 including China, Russia and many former Soviet republics \u2014 to be involved in almost any way. That ranges from physical possession of the product to written descriptions and even verbal discussions of it. The administration is considering broadening the range of goods and services traded with China that would be subject to these so-called deemed export rules.\n\nIf the proposal is approved by the Commerce Department, and ultimately by Mr. Trump, American companies and universities would be required to obtain special licenses for Chinese nationals who have any contact whatsoever with a much wider range of goods \u2014 making it harder for Chinese citizens to work on a range of scientific research and product development programs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFueling the push are instances like the one involving Ruopeng Liu, a Chinese citizen and a promising student at Duke who was helping to develop a cloak that shields objects from a broad spectrum of wave frequencies. The professor leading the Pentagon-funded lab, David R. Smith, became suspicious of Mr. Liu, who seemed intent on collaborating with old colleagues in China, and even invited them to tour the lab and photograph Duke\u2019s equipment.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

The institute he founded on his return to China eventually received millions of dollars of investment, registered thousands of patents and even played host to President Xi Jinping of China.\n\nMr. Liu did not respond to interview requests, but in past interviews, he has maintained that he did nothing wrong, beyond taking advantage of an open and collaborative university atmosphere. Like many projects in the United States, most of Mr. Smith\u2019s work at Duke was early-stage research that was not classified or categorized as a deemed export.\n\nDaniel Golden, who tells Mr. Liu\u2019s story in his book, \u201cSpy Schools,\u201d said Mr. Liu exploited a gray area that allows a large amount of sensitive, taxpayer-funded technology to flow to foreign governments. \u201cGlobalization has transformed American universities into a front line for espionage,\u201d Mr. Golden said.\n\nYet the academic community is likely to push back on the administration\u2019s efforts over concerns that tighter controls on Chinese nationals could hurt American universities\u2019 ability to collaborate on cutting-edge research and wind up benefiting China even more.\n\nMany students at graduate programs in the United States in computer science, physics, chemistry and other sciences are from China. If the United States makes it harder for aerospace manufacturers, defense contractors and others to employ Chinese nationals, more of these recently trained Chinese graduate students may return to China, taking their skills with them.\n\nStephen A. Orlins, the president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, said that restricting Chinese researchers would be \u201ctragic\u201d for American universities. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let the security fears overwhelm what has made America great,\u201d he said.\n\nEven Mr. Smith said he did not support tougher restrictions on Chinese researchers. Instead, he said, universities should better educate researchers about existing rules and what to do in case of intellectual property theft.\n\n\u201cWith reasonable safeguards I think we can manage it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we were to overreact, I think it could be very damaging to our universities.\u201d", "title": "White House Considers Restricting Chinese Researchers Over Espionage Fears", "authors": ["Ana Swanson", "Keith Bradsher"]}

But it could fuel criticism that Mr. Trump is more bark than bite and increase the pressure on the White House to squeeze concessions from other nations.\n\nIn recent weeks, American negotiators have pressed allies to restrain their own metal shipments to the United States voluntarily in exchange for having the tariffs lifted.\n\n\u201cIn all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment and protect the national security,\u201d the White House said in its statement Monday evening.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut officials have also embarked on unrelated trade discussions. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been charged with negotiating with the European Union, had been pushing for the bloc to reduce its tariffs on imported cars and lower its trade surplus with the United States.\n\nForeign allies and companies that source steel and aluminum from abroad were left in suspense about how the tariffs deadline would play out until late Monday and were fretting about the uncertainty created by the situation.\n\nSo far, European officials have held firm to their insistence that the trade measures violate international trading law. The temporary extension is unlikely to satisfy the European Union, whose leaders have said they do not want to negotiate under threat and have demanded a permanent and unconditional exemption from the tariffs.\n\nIf the tariffs do go into effect after the 30-day reprieve, Europe has promised swift retaliation. It has drawn up a lengthy list of American products it would penalize in return, including orange juice, cranberries, motorcycles and bluejeans. It has also asked to join a dispute China brought at the World Trade Organization against the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe U.S. decision prolongs market uncertainty, which is already affecting business decisions,\u201d the European Union said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe E.U. should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the British government said the move was \u201cpositive,\u201d while the Australian government said that it \u201cwill ensure our trade relationship continues to grow in a fair and reciprocal manner.\u201d\n\nAn extension of the tariff deadline was more widely expected for Canada and Mexico, which are still in negotiations with the United States over Nafta. Although differences of opinion remain, officials from the countries insist they are making quick progress toward a goal of concluding their talks by the end of May.\n\nCanada and Mexico have said that putting tariffs in place in the middle of these discussions could upend delicate negotiations. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that his country would secure an exemption, arguing that the Trump administration understood that tariffs on Canada would hurt jobs on both sides of the shared border.\n\nThe administration has also been in talks with Japan, the largest American ally to be left off the initial list of countries that were granted a temporary exemption from the tariffs \u2014 in part because of the country\u2019s trade patterns, including a large surplus with the United States, but also because the Trump administration hoped to urge the country into one-on-one trade talks.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

Mr. Abe insisted that talks take the form of the United States rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multicountry trade deal Mr. Trump withdrew from. Mr. Trump derided the deal, writing on Twitter that it had \u201ctoo many contingencies.\u201d\n\nThe monthlong reprieve prolongs the state of uncertainty hanging over the global economy, making it difficult for businesses to plan and discouraging them from investing in new factories or hiring more workers.\n\nThat unpredictability has plagued even steel and aluminum companies that support the measure. Todd Leebow, the president and chief executive of Majestic Steel USA, which buys and sells American-made steel, said the tariffs were already helping to revive the American industry. Still, he noted that his customers did not know where they would be able to purchase metals from, and where prices might head.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFrom an industry perspective, the challenge that we have is it creates uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Leebow said.\n\nBut some said the measures are helping accomplish one of the administration\u2019s major goals: combating an overcapacity of metals from China. The European Union and Canada, among others, have introduced steeper measures in recent months to crack down on cheap flows of steel into their markets, and to stop China from shipping steel through their countries to the United States.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that the approach is working,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supports the metal restrictions. He said that temporary exemptions did not worry him, but that they should not be left in place indefinitely or unconditionally.\n\nOther nations affected by the tariffs have not been so optimistic.\n\nIn Europe, the tariffs have driven down steel prices, as countries that did not receive exemptions, like Russia, Turkey and India, redirect their shipments from the United States.\n\nThe flood of imports has hit the European steel industry just as it is bouncing back from a crisis that began five years ago and was caused by steel sold at dumping prices by Chinese producers.\n\n\u201cThey are worried that another wave of imports could throw the industry back into crisis mode,\u201d Martin Theuringer, the managing director of the German Steel Federation, an industry group, said of European steel makers.", "title": "White House Delays Tariffs on E.U., Canada and Mexico for 30 Days", "authors": ["Ana Swanson"]}

This may bring to an end one set of conflicts, but it could spark newer, potentially more dangerous confrontations.\n\nThe key to preventing the Syrian civil war from splintering into an even more chaotic and deadly phase will be Russia, whose September 2015 military intervention gave it control of Syrian airspace and placed it politically in the driver\u2019s seat. But the United States, too, could still play an important role in preventing matters from getting worse.\n\nTo understand how perilous the situation in Syria is, look at the map: In the northwest, in Idlib Province, a \u201cde-escalation zone\u201d that is monitored by the Turkish Army remains tenuous. The Assad government is keen to drive the Turks out, as well as jihadists and other rebels. In the northeast, the Kurds have established a form of self-government, led by the militia called Y.P.G., an American ally in the fight against Islamic State. But that group is the Syrian affiliate of the P.K.K. in Turkey, and is therefore in the Turkish military\u2019s cross hairs. Further to the east, remnants of the Islamic State still roam the desert near the Iraqi border, pursued by the United States and the Y.P.G. as well as by the Syrian regime, and backed by Iran and associated militias.\n\nThe greatest danger lies in the south, along the armistice line that divides Israel and Syria. Recent tit-for-tat attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies have raised the risk of escalation. In February, only a phone call from President Vladimir Putin of Russia to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel induced Israel to call off further airstrikes against Syrian government and Iranian targets after an Iranian drone invaded Israeli airspace. More recently, Israel piggybacked on international outrage over an apparent regime chemical attack to carry out a second round of strikes, reportedly killing 10 Iranian military personnel and several others at a Syrian airfield. Iran vowed to respond, and is likely to do so at a time of its choosing.

In 2016, Ms. Vestager ordered Ireland to reclaim 13 billion euros in back taxes, or about $15.5 billion, saying that the company had illegally received a tax break that was not available to others. Apple has begun paying the money into an escrow account, but both the company and Ireland have appealed the decision. They say it ignores how much tax Apple has already paid to Ireland, misrepresents the tax rate the company is subject to there, and reflects either a willful misreading or an ignorance of tax law.\n\nCritics also accuse her of grandstanding, and of displaying bias against American companies.\n\n\u201cI think she has this vision of what the law should be, and it seems to me that when this radically affects major companies that are headquartered in the U.S., you might want to have more of a dialogue with the U.S. regulators and the U.S. government about it,\u201d said Joe Kennedy, a senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonprofit think tank based in Washington.\n\nBoth Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief, have traveled to Brussels to argue their cases in person, apparently in vain.

{"date": "2018-05-01 00:00:00", "text": "Most of the dozens of questions are about now well-known events, like the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between top Trump campaign officials and Russians promising damaging information about Hillary Clinton. While a few touch on Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings \u2014 in particular, campaign-era talks about a proposed real estate project in Moscow \u2014 they do not signal that Mr. Mueller is examining Trump Organization finances more broadly or contain other major surprises.\n\nIn many instances, Mr. Mueller wants Mr. Trump to explain his knowledge of, reactions to or communications about private events where there were other witnesses, such as his campaign\u2019s internal discussions of Russia-related matters and his conversations as president with and about James B. Comey, whom he fired as F.B.I. director.\n\nThe questions were drawn up in March and reflect no events since then, leaving open the possibility that they may have changed as the president\u2019s lawyers and the special counsel continued to negotiate over an interview.\n\nThe handover to the president\u2019s lawyers grew out of a tense moment early that month between Mr. Mueller and Mr. Trump\u2019s lead lawyer at the time, John Dowd. Mr. Dowd had argued that Mr. Trump was too busy running the country to sit for an interview, especially if he was not a target of the investigation, according to a person briefed on the encounter.\n\nMr. Mueller replied that he had to question Mr. Trump to determine whether he had criminal intent when he took actions like firing Mr. Comey and raised the possibility of subpoenaing Mr. Trump to appear before a grand jury, the person said. News of Mr. Mueller mentioning the subpoena was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nA few days later, a lawyer working for Mr. Mueller called Mr. Dowd to arrange a second meeting, in the hopes of persuading Mr. Dowd to allow Mr. Trump to sit for an interview. At that meeting, investigators for Mr. Mueller provided Mr. Dowd with the list of questions they had for the president. After reviewing the list, Mr. Dowd become even more convinced, the person said, that allowing the president to be interviewed would be a problem.\n\nMr. Dowd quit in March after he advised Mr. Trump that sitting down with investigators would put him in too much jeopardy, but Mr. Trump signaled that he was prepared to ignore Mr. Dowd\u2019s advice.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOne major threat to Mr. Trump posed by such open-ended questions is that, as his Twitter diatribe showed, he has a history of saying things that are not true \u2014 especially when he rambles off the cuff. It is a felony to lie to law enforcement officials or to conceal a material fact during a proceeding like a formal interview.\n\nMoreover, the list of questions is most likely a starting point for follow-ups as investigators try to iron out ambiguities. Paul Rosenzweig, another former Whitewater prosecutor and a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a conservative and libertarian research organization, said they could be seeking such details as: What was the source of your knowledge? When did you find out? Who told you and what exactly did they say?\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just ask, \u2018What did you know about the Trump Tower meeting?\u2019 and he tells you the answer,\u201d Mr. Rosenzweig said. \u201cWith 48 questions like that, that\u2019s honestly a two-day interview. That\u2019s 12 hours of questioning.\u201d\n\nAnd in part because former Trump associates who have pleaded guilty are cooperating with the inquiry, the White House does not know what evidence the special counsel has obtained that could contradict Mr. Trump, Mr. Wisenberg said. Because of that, he said, the president\u2019s lawyers were in a worse position to prepare their client for an interview than President Bill Clinton\u2019s team was in the Whitewater investigation.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It was far less risky.\u201d\n\nEven so, Mr. Clinton perjured himself by falsely denying that he had had a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. That became part of the referral to Congress by Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel, that led to Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nAs part of those proceedings, the videotape of Mr. Clinton\u2019s false testimony became public, taking its place in his legacy. It is far from clear, however, that any transcript or recording of Mr. Trump\u2019s interview \u2014 if he gives one \u2014 would similarly become public. Mr. Rosenzweig said the interview would be covered by investigative secrecy rules, and there was no clear mechanism for it to be disclosed under Mr. Mueller, who has less power than Mr. Starr enjoyed.\n\nMr. Mueller\u2019s authorities remain uncertain; it is not clear that he could charge Mr. Trump with a crime or send an impeachment referral report directly to Congress. That has left his potential endgame unclear if he does conclude the president committed some kind of wrongdoing.\n\nBut the list of questions indicates that the investigation remains a significant threat to Mr. Trump even if he were to be honest about everything in any interview.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe questions zero in on Mr. Trump\u2019s possible liability \u2014 and little else, noted Samuel W. Buell, a Duke University criminal law professor and a former federal prosecutor who helped lead the Enron investigation.\n\n\u201c\u2018What did you know and think?\u2019 and \u2018When did you know it and think it?\u2019 are not questions you ask someone to determine whether they have information about someone else\u2019s commission of a crime,\u201d Mr. Buell said. \u201cThey are questions you ask to determine whether the person you are questioning had the guilty mind required to break the law.\u201d\n\nMr. Wisenberg said he was struck by Mr. Mueller\u2019s focus on establishing the president\u2019s mind-set when he weighed whether to fire Mr. Comey, and potential steps like whether to oust Attorney General Jeff Sessions, pardon people charged by Mr. Mueller or force the Justice Department to dismiss the special counsel.\n\nNo Supreme Court precedent exists to guide Mr. Mueller on whether obstruction of justice can occur if a president exercises a constitutional power with a bad motive, like firing a subordinate to cover up a crime; Mr. Wisenberg counted himself among those who do not think it can. But Mr. Mueller\u2019s questions, he said, suggest the special counsel has adopted a broader interpretation of the law.\n\nSome of the questions may present an opportunity for Mr. Trump, however. Asking him to explain what he meant when he told NBC News that he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he decided to fire Mr. Comey, for example, would permit Mr. Trump to backpedal on the remark or explain it away, perhaps by saying he did not really mean it.\n\nAlan M. Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School criminal law professor who has frequently defended Mr. Trump on television and is informally consulting with him, told CNN on Monday that he thought Mr. Trump could invoke executive privilege to refuse to answer questions about his thinking when he decided to exercise constitutional powers.\n\nBut the problem for Mr. Trump is that those questions, Mr. Dershowitz said, were the \u201ceasy\u201d ones. By contrast, Mr. Trump could not invoke the privilege about events that took place before he became president, like his business dealings.\n\nSeveral legal experts said it was unusual for prosecutors to give Mr. Trump a preview of the questions, speculating that Mr. Mueller was bending over backward to defang any accusations of overreach. Mr. Buell said the move might also be aimed at uncovering any disputes over executive privilege now so they do not disrupt an interview.\n\nBut he predicted that despite all the \u201cposturing,\u201d Mr. Trump would allow his lawyers to talk him out of sitting down with Mr. Mueller.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe game,\u201d he said, \u201cis to appear to be interested and cooperating without doing so.\u201d", "title": "Why Answering Mueller\u2019s Questions Could Be a Minefield for Trump", "authors": ["Charlie Savage"]}

It plans to keep in production the relatively low-volume Mustang, a sporty car that sells for higher prices than ordinary sedans, and a forthcoming rugged variation on its Focus hatchback.\n\nSo what changed? The return of cheap gas, for one thing. It makes larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles affordable again to many consumers. American carmakers spent the years around their great bailout professing their ardor for a new generation of fuel-efficient vehicles, but in the end they were only too happy to steer people back into S.U.V.s, which are more profitable.\n\nCall it the S.U.V. Profit Paradigm: Added height elevates the price people are prepared to pay for what is essentially the same vehicle. S.U.V.s and crossovers sell at higher prices than cars of equivalent size, but they cost little, if anything, more to build.\n\nThe unwillingness of Congress to tax gasoline more heavily did not help. Nor did the readiness of the Obama administration to accommodate so much of Detroit\u2019s pro-S.U.V. agenda in its regulations. Though they did raise federal mileage standards, the rule makers rewarded companies that built bigger vehicles by setting standards matched to vehicle size, with large cars allowed to burn more gas and pollute more. And now the Trump administration is moving to reduce even those standards.\n\nEven in times of robust, S.U.V.-fueled profit, carmakers have not seen their share prices rise much, especially compared with the tech companies that may, in the era of self-driving cars, become their competitors. Last October, Ford proclaimed it would cut its future spending by $14 billion. Its stock did nothing. Last week, it announced it would trim an additional $11 billion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to feed the healthy parts of our business,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, told analysts, \u201cand deal decisively with the parts that destroy value.\u201d", "title": "Opinion | Why Is a \u2018Green\u2019 Car Company Pivoting Back to S.U.V.s?", "authors": []}

Lawrence Dennis, a Southerner and a former Foreign Service officer, argued in a pair of books in the 1930s that radio and other mass media made Americans susceptible to suggestion. \u201cWe have perfected techniques in propaganda and press and radio control which should make the United States the easiest country in the world to indoctrinate with any set of ideas, and to control for any physically possible ends.\u201d\n\nWhich was why Roosevelt\u2019s appeals to what Abraham Lincoln had called \u201cthe better angels of our nature\u201d proved so essential. He did not broadcast solely for partisan purposes; he believed that greatness would come \u2014 to the country and, not coincidentally, to himself in the eyes of history \u2014 if he built beyond his base rather than simply speaking to it.\n\nThe television era offered similar perils and promise. In the 1950s observers fretted that presidential candidates were now being marketed like soap, but as the years passed it became clear that visual media had an extraordinary power to unify, if only for a time. Both Kennedy and Reagan understood the dramatic possibilities of the presidency-as-production, turning their hours upon the stage into national sagas. \u201cThere have been times in this office,\u201d Reagan said as he left the White House, \u201cwhen I\u2019ve wondered how you could do the job if you hadn\u2019t been an actor.\u201d\n\nGreat performers, of course \u2014 and Reagan was one, as was his Cold War colleague John Paul II, who trained in the theater as a young man \u2014 present visions of a world beyond the tactile to their audiences. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don\u2019t know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it,\u201d Reagan said in his Farewell Address in 1989. \u201cBut in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept, God-blessed and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about, and dismissive of, such a view. But, as G. K. Chesterton observed after a 1921 tour of the United States, America is \u201cthe only nation in the world founded on a creed\u201d \u2014 and if natives and newcomers alike can live up to that creed of inclusion, then our best instincts will carry the day. As a matter of observable fact, the United States, through its sporadic adherence to that creed, is the most far-reaching and successful experiment in pluralistic republicanism the world has ever known. In the main, the America of the 21st century is, for all its shortcomings, freer and more accepting than it has ever been. If that weren\u2019t the case, populist attacks on immigrants and the widening mainstream wouldn\u2019t be so ferocious.\n\nPerhaps borrowing from Henry David Thoreau, President Roosevelt added the most enduring line from his first inaugural address while at work on the speech at the Mayflower Hotel in the first days of March 1933. \u201cThe only thing we have to fear,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis fear itself.\u201d Such sentiments are tweetable \u2014 one can say a lot in 280 characters \u2014 but they have to be deeply held by the one doing the tweeting.", "title": "Opinion | Why Trump Is More Father Coughlin Than Franklin Roosevelt", "authors": []}

In 2014, Pope Francis named him prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, effectively making him the Vatican\u2019s treasurer and its third most senior figure.\n\nLast June, his legal team received the charges against him in the state of Victoria. Pope Francis gave him a leave of absence to return to Australia to mount his defense.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat has he been accused of?\n\nCardinal Pell has been charged with \u201chistorical sexual offenses.\u201d No further details of those charges have been publicly released by the courts.\n\nCardinal Pell previously denied knowing about abuse in the 1970s and \u201980s, but the description of the crimes that have been made available to the public would suggest that he is now being accused of having been personally engaged in sexual offenses by multiple complainants.\n\nOf the various charges, about half of which will move to trial, most appear to be linked to two locations where the alleged offenses took place, spanning many years. But the vast majority of charges against the Cardinal were either withdrawn or dismissed, including several of the most serious allegations, which were said to have taken place in a playground, on an altar, on a mountain top, and during a 1970s screening of \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s also known is that Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Vatican cleric to face charges of sexual crimes, and that he has aggressively denied the charges.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,\u201d he said at a news conference in Rome last June.", "title": "Why the Cardinal Pell Case Has Been So Secretive", "authors": ["Damien Cave", "Adam Baidawi"]}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nThere was some controversy over the title of the show last season, and this season the Sam character, who hosts a radio show within the show, also called \u201cDear White People,\u201d deals with her own similar controversy. How did you digest all of the feedback from Season 1?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe backlash stuff was really interesting to me. They were so organized and they didn\u2019t just come after us, they came after anything black \u2014 there were campaigns against \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d too. I was so curious about it and I did a deep dive and started to try to figure out what were the tactics that they used and how were they so mobilized.\n\nThe other big thing that informed this season was that Trump won on the day we wrapped Season 1. And I was just so bewildered by how we got here. I started to really research and not just assume that I knew. I read a book called \u201cThe History of White People,\u201d about all of the cultural decisions that led to the creation of the white race and why white is the ideal form of beauty, and it\u2019s so arbitrary. I realized that the reason we can\u2019t talk to each other is because people don\u2019t know where this all comes from. So this season has a lot of history on its mind, too.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhen you\u2019re investigating those questions on the show, do you worry that white people will just choose not to engage?\n\nI think the key to the show is making you care about the characters first, because it\u2019s not a thesis. And if we tell the truth about what they\u2019re going through, then maybe you\u2019ll care and think about it.\n\nI think the show has two goals. One is to allow people who don\u2019t necessarily look like us to see themselves in characters they don\u2019t expect to, so that the next time they see a black guy at Starbucks, they won\u2019t feel the need to call the cops on him.\n\nAnd the other thing is to make people who\u2019ve actually gone through these experiences go: \u201cOh my God, totally. I\u2019m so glad someone finally put it that way.\u201d I think both of those things allow black folks to feel more human in society.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Because the truth is, I could walk around all day saying: \u201cI don\u2019t identify with being black. I don\u2019t identify with being gay.\u201d But you know what\u2019s going to happen to me? Society\u2019s going to happen to me. I\u2019m going to go into Starbucks and get arrested, or I\u2019m going to walk through the wrong neighborhood in a hoodie.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t have to have the burden of identity, when you don\u2019t have to code switch every day or constantly be aware of your surroundings, you get to say that. Part of the reason the show is called \u201cDear White People\u201d is because there\u2019s no way to be black in America without constantly having to explain or protect or defend yourself. Talking about that is not why Donald Trump is president.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe new season doesn\u2019t mention Trump by name. Why not?\n\nI just didn\u2019t want to say his name. I didn\u2019t want to give it that kind of power. I think the underlying issues that brought about the Trump presidency are American issues, and they\u2019ve been around before Trump and they\u2019ll be around after Trump.\n\nPhoto\n\nBeing on Netflix, do you get much data about who\u2019s watching you?\n\nThey keep things pretty close to the chest, but I know that Brazilians like us and I know that we\u2019re big in Africa. In Africa they really hated [the Kenyan immigrant character, played by Jeremy Tardy] Rashid\u2019s accent last year [laughs].\n\nIs the actor African?\n\nHe is African. And his accent is based on an actual Kenyan accent, but people thought it was too sing-songy. So we brought in the woman who was the dialect coach for \u201cBlack Panther\u201d to give it some flavor and some nuance. But I\u2019m sure people will still be mad.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about being a black creator: [Scrutiny] is part of being in the ring. Black folks and the black diaspora are so starved for content that when you\u2019re the only person telling the story there\u2019s all these people that are like, \u201cWell where\u2019s my story?\u201d\n\nI remember reading this article about how \u201cBlack Panther\u201d had failed the queer community by not expressing LGBT issues. And I was like, but it did so many things! It\u2019s literally changed cinema for black people forever, and was an all-black cast, and made all the money in the world, and introduced African themes, and is opening in Saudia Arabia \u2026 but we didn\u2019t have gay characters. So let\u2019s just throw the whole thing away. That kind of thing can be a lot. But it\u2019s the cost of telling stories in an oppressive society. You have to be prepared to take some of those jabs and you do the best that you can.\n\nYour next movie, \u201cBad Hair,\u201d is about a woman who\u2019s possessed by a sentient killer weave. Where\u2019d you get the idea?\n\nI always write because I\u2019m really angry about something, and I was so angry that people weren\u2019t seeing how black women are getting it from all angles. [If you\u2019re a black woman,] you\u2019re at the bottom of the totem pole, even though black women are always among the strongest members of our society and culture.\n\nI was also really inspired by Korean horror movies, because hair possession is a subgenre there.

It was never clear whether Till actually whistled, but the truth mattered little: Four days later, he was kidnapped from his great-uncle\u2019s home, beaten, tortured and shot.

In 2004, the F.B.I. reopened the investigation into Till\u2019s case to explore whether anyone could be charged. No one was.\n\nLast year Timothy B. Tyson, a Duke University professor and author of the 2017 book \u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till,\u201d revealed that Ms. Donham had told him that one account she had given in front of the judge in her husband\u2019s case \u2014 that Till had grabbed her and was menacing \u2014 was false. Some commenters on Twitter have suggested that if Mr. Cosby could be prosecuted for a sexual assault that occurred more than a decade ago, Ms. Donham should face prosecution as well.\n\nIn recent years, Till\u2019s name has frequently been used in discussions of unarmed black men and boys shot dead by police or, in the case of Trayvon Martin, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a conceptual overlap between Trayvon, Black Lives Matter and Emmett Till, but a very personal overlap,\u201d said Dave Tell, a professor at the University of Kansas who has studied Till extensively. \u201cThe Till family is very close to the family of Trayvon Martin.

While some former law-enforcement officials said that those attacks had eroded trust in the criminal-justice establishment, others said that the figures singled out by the president and his lawyer were deserving of their ire.\n\n\u201cRudy is not anti-law enforcement, but he is upset, like me, at a small cadre of people who have lost their way,\u201d said James K.

He criticized, for instance, the way that F.B.I. agents, acting on a search warrant last year, broke into the home of Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign manager. Mr. Kallstrom also blasted the more recent raids on Mr. Cohen\u2019s office, apartment and hotel room, saying that they may have violated the attorney-client privilege.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Some of China\u2019s biggest and most exciting technology start-ups, like Didi Chuxing, the ride-sharing rival to Uber, and Ant Financial, the financial arm of Alibaba, are making plans to go public over the next year.\n\nIn the past, Chinese entrepreneurs like Jack Ma of Alibaba chose to list their shares in markets, like New York, where they could operate as if their companies were still private. They were able to offer so-called dual-class shares, which give shareholders little say in the operations of the business.\n\nUntil last week, Hong Kong, which has stricter rules than New York, had not allowed such listings. In its filing on Thursday with Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange, Xiaomi appeared to be taking advantage of the new rules.\n\nThe company, whose low-cost smartphones have won a loyal following not just in China but in other emerging markets like India as well, said it would raise an unspecified amount from the public in order to fund the development of new smartphones and other devices like household gadgets. The money will also help Xiaomi pursue expansion overseas.\n\nIt could raise as much as $10 billion, according to two people with direct knowledge of the company but not authorized to speak on the record.

This will mean that Lei Jun, Xiaomi\u2019s founder, chairman and chief executive, will have the ultimate say over the company\u2019s operations, rather than investors who buy its shares, even if they end up owning more stock than he decides to hold on to.\n\nThis share structure will allow the company to benefit from Mr. Lei\u2019s \u201cvision and leadership\u201d while allowing him to maintain its \u201clong-term prospects and strategy,\u201d Xiaomi said in its filing.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe decision by the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong to allow dual-class shares just one week ago has sparked fierce debate here.

As part of the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the territory was promised 50 years of self-administration. But in recent years, the city has experienced encroachment on its independence, and investors have raised concerns that its strong regulatory and legal institutions are slowly being eroded by Beijing.\n\nTo these critics, Hong Kong\u2019s decision to allow dual-class shares is further evidence of that erosion.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cBeijing is much happier raising capital in a city that they can partially control rather than handing over all the listings to U.S. markets,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hong Kong stock market is going to be creeping slowly toward Chinese-style regulation.\u201d\n\nMr. Li did not respond to a request for comment.

He did not allow a hit in six innings \u2014 helped significantly by two fine defensive plays by Torres at second base \u2014 but had to come out after the sixth because he had thrown 84 pitches. The Yankees were not willing to risk an injury. Boone, who praised German\u2019s use of three outstanding pitches \u2014 his breaking ball, changeup and fastball \u2014 said it was not a debatable decision to take him out, and German said he understood it.\n\nThe notion of lifting a starting pitcher from a no-hit bid has become far more commonplace over the last few years \u2014 the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday completed a combined no-hitter started by 23-year-old Walker Buehler against the San Diego Padres. Johan Santana\u2019s career-ending string of injuries after his 134-pitch no-hitter for the Mets in 2012 is the red marker for that shift in thinking.\n\nSo Betances came out of the bullpen, tasked with preserving the no-hitter in a 0-0 game.\n\n\u201cI was trying my best to keep it that way,\u201d Betances said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Man, this is an opportunity to be famous for a long time.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe extended it only one inning. Yonder Alonso recorded the first hit, leading off the eighth with a ground ball that found its way past Torres into the outfield. Yan Gomes and Tyler Naquin followed with singles, and before the inning was over, Betances had been replaced by Jonathan Holder and Cleveland led, 4-0.\n\nPhoto\n\nMike Clevinger, Cleveland\u2019s longhaired starting pitcher, was matching German almost pitch for pitch and went back to the mound in the eighth having already thrown 100 pitches. He walked Neil Walker and Tyler Austin, so Cleveland Manager Terry Francona summoned closer Cody Allen to try for a five-out save.\n\nHad Andrew Miller, the superb Cleveland setup man who is on the disabled list with a hamstring strain, been available, he most likely would have pitched the eighth. Instead, Allen was asked to get the extended save.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBrett Gardner singled to right, scoring Walker, and Aaron Judge doubled, scoring Austin and Gardner as the Yankees drew to within a run, 4-3.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nAllen, who ran his pitch count up to 32, was finally chased from the game in the ninth after Aaron Hicks and Walker doubled to even the score. In came Otero, who got Andujar to ground out. Otero then walked Giancarlo Stanton intentionally to pitch to Torres.\n\nOn Friday, when Torres went deep in the fourth inning, he became the youngest Yankee to hit a home run since 20-year-old John Ellis did in 1969. But the Yankees relinquished a five-run lead in that game and needed to win it in the ninth inning on Andujar\u2019s single.\n\nTorres, of course, is the star prospect the Yankees got from the Chicago Cubs in a trade for Aroldis Chapman in 2016.\n\nTorres said he had never hit a walk-off home run at any level of baseball. But on the sixth pitch of his at-bat, he drove an 88-mile-per-hour slider from Otero into the Yankees\u2019 bullpen, just a few feet from where Chapman was warming up.\n\nIn doing so, he became the youngest Yankee to hit a game-ending homer, surpassing Mickey Mantle, who was 41 days older when he did it in 1953.\n\nAs Torres circled the bases, looking like a 10-year veteran, Chapman, whom the Yankees re-signed in free agency before last season, raised his arms in victory, something the Yankees have been doing with an almost inevitable regularity the last two weeks.\n\nTorres said he was happy to help his team and did not seem overwhelmed by the moment. After all, in the last three games, he\u2019s already had two big moments.\n\nAs Boone said afterward: \u201cIt seems like the bigger the spot, the bigger the situation, the better he is.\u201d", "title": "Yankees\u2019 Gleyber Torres Upstages Himself With Walk-Off Homer", "authors": ["David Waldstein"]}

Pitching coach Larry Rothschild had noticed that Montgomery\u2019s velocity, which is typically in the low 90s, was down to between 88 and 90 miles per hour.

More important than how much they earn is their sense of how they are doing compared with the standard of living of their parents\u2019 generation. Those who see themselves as downwardly mobile are the unhappiest.\n\nWorking-class whites with steady employment may nevertheless consider themselves worse off because their parents made high, unionized wages that are mostly out of reach today. Those with lower incomes may not have expected as much. In other words, what matters is not the size of your paycheck but whether it allows for the standard of living you think you are entitled to.\n\nThe debate over why the white working class supported Mr. Trump raises a question: Why do we care so much about determining precisely how much political upheaval is due to economics and how much is due to culture?\n\nPerhaps we are drawn to this futile quest because economic problems seem more tractable \u2014 more easily dealt with through the levers of government policy \u2014 while cultural issues seem more resistant to change. Perhaps it is because people\u2019s economic troubles are often said to reflect larger, structural problems beyond their control, whereas their cultural deficiencies are sometimes seen as their own fault. When academics and journalists want to express affinity with the working class, in other words, they focus on poverty, and when they don\u2019t, they focus on prejudice.\n\nControversy over economic versus cultural explanations of poverty can be traced to 1966, when the anthropologist Oscar Lewis, in his book \u201cLa Vida,\u201d on Puerto Ricans in New York, wrote of a \u201cculture of poverty\u201d that seemed impervious to change.\n\nToday, however, astute scholars do not see a wall between economics and culture. They acknowledge that financial hardship affects the daily lives of working-class Americans, but they add that how they respond is based on cultural beliefs that may lead them to scapegoat minority groups.\n\nPeople with unstable or insufficient incomes may express their fears by talking about race because that is the way they have learned to interpret the world. People who are frustrated by their lack of progress may still try to defend the dignity of their work. It is a mistake to see economics and culture as distinct forces.

We are in the midst of a run of them, with targets ranging from Fox News host Laura Ingraham to Keurig coffee makers.\n\nDeciding how you spend your own money seems like a fundamental right in a democracy. But Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, writing in The Guardian, warned of \u201cboycott fatigue\u201d related to fresh campaigns against Starbucks from the left and the San Antonio Spurs from the right.\n\nMy first call on Venezuelan rum was to Thor Halvorssen, an activist who runs the Human Rights Foundation, which puts on the Oslo Freedom Forum, a conference that honors dissidents from around the world.\n\nMr. Halvorssen is a dual citizen of Venezuela and Norway, with deep roots in both countries. He thinks boycotts should be focused on repressive governments.\n\n\u201cEngaging in boycotts that dampen someone\u2019s freedom of expression is probably not a good idea, because those winds can turn on you,\u201d he said. He brought up calls to boycott the Coachella music festival because of its owner\u2019s views on gay rights, noting that \u201cthe owner of Coachella can\u2019t have you tortured and taken away.\u201d\n\nHe also said there is \u201cnot a one-size-fits-all solution or prescription with regards to ethics, boycotts and authoritarianism.\u201d He believes proceeds from purchases of goods from places like Cuba end up helping a repressive government.\n\nHe had a more nuanced take on Venezuela, and said the question was more situational, depending on the company.

Mr. Vollmer, 49, has worked to rehabilitate gang members in his region by creating an ambitious work training program called Project Alcatraz, and also organizes rugby matches for gang members and prison inmates.\n\nBut Mr. Vollmer has also long courted controversy for his accommodations to Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He also has a warm relationship with Tareck El Aissami, Venezuela\u2019s vice president, who has been sanctioned by the United States as a drug trafficker.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He is a charismatic executive whose great-grandfather was a merchant from Hamburg who married a first cousin of the Venezuelan independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. (Mr. Halvorssen is also a descendant of Bol\u00edvar.)\n\nHe expressed a measure of regret, though he chose his words carefully, as one might expect, given his situation.\n\n\u201cFor me, the main ethical dilemma that I have every single day is basically thinking, is it right to stay here?\u201d he said of his country. \u201cPutting my three kids in danger, I\u2019ve got a 6-month-old baby, a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old, and of course my wife. Every single day they are there, their lives are at risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then you think, if we leave, then what are you leaving unprotected?\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re talking about 7,500 families that depend on you, you\u2019ve got the development of the country, you\u2019ve got all that responsibility that\u2019s somehow on your shoulders, that you\u2019re basically leaving behind.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegarding his appearance last year with Mr. Maduro, he said \u201cI spoke with bad timing and probably the wrong body language. Not probably, surely. You know I\u2019ve heard the speech several times, and when you see the content of the speech, the content wasn\u2019t bad. The body language was bad, the timing was bad.\u201d\n\nHe said his company was extended a line of credit by the government, and ultimately used $1 million to buy barrels for aging rum. When I asked him what he thought about the government, he paused.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking what the right answer is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say I think we\u2019ve made mistakes, and when I say we, I\u2019m talking as a country. Decisions that have been taken have been wrong decisions that have taken us to a country that is in crisis, that has been isolated. Now I also believe that the biggest challenge we have as a country right now is coming together in having a unifying vision, a common vision.\u201d\n\nHis company has survived for 221 years, and he appears determined to continue in what is a very difficult environment for any company. The challenges of operating a business in the country were underscored last month after Chevron evacuated executives when two of its workers were imprisoned amid a contract dispute with a state owned oil company.\n\n\u201cIn such a polarized environment, if you try to be neutral, everyone is going to attack you,\u201d Mr. Vollmer said. \u201cIf you leave, if the good guys leave, who is going to be there? Who is going to help steer things in the right direction? And when things somehow open up, who is going to be there to be build?\u201d\n\nOther rum companies have taken a lower profile. Victoria Cooper, a spokeswoman for Diplom\u00e1tico, issued a statement that lived up to the company\u2019s name: \u201cWe are aware of the difficult situation that our country is facing, and it is our duty to support our local community and employees in the best way we can.\u201d\n\nMr. Halvorssen, for his part, believes there should be more thought put into the question of the political conditions under which products are made.\n\n\u201cPeople are smart when it comes to buying their groceries, buying cage-free eggs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t people have an individual commerce policy?\u201d", "title": "You Love Venezuelan Rum.

In 1927, Hurston, at the behest of a mentor, the anthropologist Franz Boas, went straight to the storyteller, traveling to Alabama to interview the 86-year-old Cudjo Lewis, the last living African brought to America aboard a slave ship. (\u201cBarracoon\u201d is a word for the barracks built near the coast, where the enslaved were kept until they boarded the ships.)\n\nThe book was completed almost a century ago. Publishers considered her use of dialect too alienating, and there was a worry that the blunt description of Africans selling their own into slavery was too incendiary.\n\nHurston herself is present only at the edges of the narrative, but she is unmistakable. She is most beloved for her novels, particularly \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God,\u201d but she was also a gifted folklorist, and the qualities that distinguished her are on display in this early work: her patience, persistence and charisma; her ability to read her subjects; her tact. She has an unerring instinct of when to push Lewis \u2014 and when to slip away and leave him to his memories. She brings him gifts and company. They talk over \u201ca marvelous mess of blue crabs,\u201d \u201cexcellent late melons\u201d and huge quantities of clingstone peaches.\n\nLewis was a widower when Hurston found him. Many of his children had died, and he was desperately lonely. He asked for his portrait to be taken in his family graveyard, where everyone had vanished to \u2014 \u201cdey lonesome for one \u2019nother.\u201d\n\nThe details he shared with Hurston are indelible.

Sauntering over to Mafee\u2019s man cave of an apartment, she seduces him not into sex \u2014 he\u2019d probably be too discombobulated by his crush on her to handle it anyway \u2014 but into falling on the grenade for her. Thanks no doubt to her experience as a dominatrix, she does this so effortlessly that he probably thinks it was his idea.\n\nBoth Soder and Maggie Siff do humane, careful work with material that could be icky or campy in other hands. Wendy\u2019s relentless attractiveness, and the differential of desire between the two characters, yields the sexiest scene I\u2019ve seen on TV all year, with no nudity and little more physical contact than a strategically deployed head on his shoulder. And yet you feel Wendy\u2019s desperation, even as she feigns confidence. She has already been dressed down by Taylor in a powerful confrontation over her motives regarding Mafee, and she visibly carries the weight of Taylor\u2019s accusations, even as she asks him if she can call him \u201cDudley.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The first is Dr. Gilbert, whom he convinces to cop a plea. The opening scene, we learn, was a flash-forward \u2014 a conversation initiated by Rhoades in order to distract Dr. Gilbert while the notorious slide was planted back in the doctor\u2019s fridge. Combined with the phony trade record whipped up by Axe\u2019s team, it makes for an airtight and totally fraudulent case. The doctor is toast.\n\nAnd yet, Chuck\u2019s speeches to Dr. Gilbert about guilt as a state of being, if not as a set of demonstrable facts, were more than just a ruse. They were the moral and philosophical polish to the dagger Chuck had been readying since the meeting at Axe\u2019s apartment. Despite the obvious frame-up, Chuck convinces Dr. Gilbert to confess by hammering him over his choice to deny Donnie Caan the experimental cancer treatment that could have extended his life (and thus left Donnie alive to testify against Axe, his former boss). Dr. Gilbert may not be guilty of the specific crimes for which he\u2019s charged, Chuck tells him, but he\u2019s damn sure guilty. (Like the doctor he plays, the actor Seth Barrish is asked to shoulder a lot of weight versus his comparatively small role, and he deserves a lot of credit for making you care.)\n\nThe doctor\u2019s downfall gives Chuck a \u201cscalp\u201d to show his boss, the creatively profane attorney general Jock Jeffcoat. Meanwhile, the phone-record manipulation takes Chuck\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9-turned-scourge Bryan Connerty down a notch, causing his case against Axe to blow up right in the middle of Judge DeGiulio\u2019s courtroom. Bryan is transferred back under Chuck\u2019s supervision in the Southern District. And that leaves Bryan\u2019s now-former boss in the Eastern District, Chuck\u2019s old enemy Oliver Dake, as the last fall guy standing, if not for long: Jeffcoat fires him to show that fighting crime unsuccessfully doesn\u2019t pay.\n\nDisaster for our Big 3 thus averted, the episode ends in Axe Cap headquarters. A clever edit juxtaposes the supine bodies of Chuck and Wendy, in bed together after their long day, with a shot of Axe and Wags, riding in the elevator together after their own ordeal. Gradually, muffled music grows louder in the elevator, and the grin Wags\u2019s face widens. The doors open into a bacchanal straight out of the most blinkered macho fantasy: a party, featuring all the pills and bottles you can pop, at which every attendee is a beautiful woman. Bobby gives into his wild side, stripping naked as he approaches a hot tub where three already naked women wait for him like prizes awarded by the patriarchy.\n\nBut as he climbs in and sinks down into the water, bottle in hand, Bobby\u2019s grin fades. The lyrics of the hip-hop track to which everyone is undulating, Vince Staples\u2019s darkly contemptuous \u201cStreet Punks,\u201d seem to echo in his ears, as if the rapper were accusing him directly of being the kind of low-level hoodlum the song mocks. By the time the credits roll, the look on the face of Axelrod Agonistes approaches \u201cMy God, what have I done?\u201d territory. The blend of material and sexual excess with existential terror, rooted in whip-smart filmmaking and a powerful performance by Damian Lewis, encapsulates all the strengths of the episode, and of the series.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it now: \u201cBillions\u201d belongs in a special class of dramas \u2014 \u201cThe Americans,\u201d \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d and even the era-defining \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d \u2014 that skyrocket upward in quality from one season to the next. In fact, I think the last of those is the best series with which we can compare \u201cBillions\u201d at this point. \u201cBillions\u201d is the new \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d with white collars instead of blue meth.", "title": "\u2018Billions\u2019 Season 3, Episode 7: Street Punks", "authors": ["Sean T.

She wisely advised Eureka against portraying Divine, steering her instead toward playing the poster child for our nation\u2019s education and food-desert crises, Honey Boo Boo.\n\nKameron announced with her singular quiet confidence that she would play the late, great wrestler Chyna, and, in what would appear to be a body-slam, Monique was encouraged to take on Congress-Auntie Maxine Waters.\n\nUpon declaring that she would portray the legendary wit Dorothy Parker, Miz Cracker was warned, \u201cMany people at home won\u2019t know who Dorothy Parker is \u2026 that\u2019s the kind of humor that receivers have to think about.\u201d It was at this point that I threw myself under a bus, and the rest of this recap was written by a Russian bot.\n\nAquaria announced that she would embrace her sentence-hobbling \u201cflaws\u201d and use them to her advantage by playing the first lady Melania Trump.

This is of course understandable and, in its way, fascinating to witness. But comedy is an essential element of the art of drag.

She named Asia, who she believes is her fiercest competition, which I do not also believe. The Vixen, naturally, voted Eureka off the island, citing her \u201cunprofessionalism,\u201d her habit of claiming to be attacked and her \u201cThis is who I am. Deal with it\u201d attitude. (And we all thought irony died on 9/11.)\n\nIn an attempt to Define The Relationship, Eureka countered that she has reached out to Vixen many times with love, and has been rebuffed at every turn. This provoked a torrent of defense, and even more eye rolls. I do hope Ru keeps a medic on hand.\n\nAquaria\u2019s Trump-Tillerson ticket bought her a six-night stay on that refuge for the tattered-tailed, Fire Island, while The Vixen\u2019s poisonous Ivy and Monique\u2019s stagnant Waters sank them to the ocean floor.

A month earlier, the state government had declared that it was safe for residents to return.\n\nSince December 2015, the Nigerian government has repeatedly claimed that Boko Haram has been defeated, after what was thought to be the group\u2019s main base, in the vast Sambisa Forest in Borno State, was taken by the military.\n\nBut attacks have continued. Boko Haram militants have also made international headlines for their kidnapping of schoolgirls, from Chibok, a town in Borno State, in 2014; and from Dapchi, a town in the neighboring Yobe State, this year.\n\nThe bombings in Mubi came just days after President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria met in Washington with President Trump, becoming the first African leader to visit the White House since Mr. Trump took office.\n\nDuring their meeting, Mr. Trump pledged American support in the fight against Boko Haram and said he was pleased about the sale of a dozen A-29 Super Tucano warplanes to Nigeria.\n\nThe $600 million sale, long sought by the Nigerians, had been held up by the Obama administration amid concerns about human rights abuses by Nigeria\u2019s military. There have also been concerns about whether light attack aircraft would be as helpful as ground troops in the fight against Boko Haram, which no longer fields large groups of fighters in the open, using lone suicide bombers to attack civilians instead.\n\nMr. Buhari was still in the United States at the time of the bombings, but he has since left Washington for Abuja, the Nigerian capital.

Harvest figures out he\u2019s been made and sends an S.O.S. to Central, which contacts Claudia, who tells Elizabeth she has to go to Chicago \u2014 on Thanksgiving, that most American holiday \u2014 and deal with the situation. Which is how Elizabeth ends up in the Windy City, accompanied only by a frightened Marilyn, with a shaky plan to grab Harvest despite his F.B.I. tail. And that\u2019s why Philip ends up in that phone booth, agreeing to come save the day and possibly his wife\u2019s life, even though she\u2019s left in the middle of Thanksgiving dinner prep.\n\nThe tightening noose was the episode\u2019s crisis, but its dramatic center was Elizabeth and Philip\u2019s continuing woes. The show may be pushing the marriage and Cold War and espionage metaphors a little too hard, but they\u2019re generally smart and effective in themselves. The opening scene cleverly conflated Philip\u2019s announcement that he wasn\u2019t going through with the Kimmy operation and a husband\u2019s declaration that he was done with an extramarital fling \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s over\u201d doing double duty. And Elizabeth let slip how sexual jealousy was mixed in with her anger at Philip\u2019s dereliction of his patriotic duty. Elizabeth stomped upstairs to Paige\u2019s room and Philip turned the other direction, to the master, a telling moment in a show that so often pictures them hanging out in bed together.\n\nWe also saw their rift through the eyes of Henry, who was home for Thanksgiving \u2014 Philip leaving the room when Elizabeth entered, Elizabeth sleeping in Paige\u2019s bed.

It allowed for a mention of the blacklisting of the director Jules Dassin, but from the title I was expecting something that would invoke the film\u2019s famous, nearly silent, half-hour robbery scene. Maybe there was meant to be a connection to Elizabeth\u2019s plan, which we haven\u2019t seen yet, to make Harvest disappear. (On a more obscure level, you could note that \u201cRififi\u201d ends with the antihero putting himself at risk to save a young boy.) The script also worked in references to several other old movies, including the great Jean-Pierre Melville gangster flick \u201cBob le Flambeur.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Elizabeth meets the intern, Jackson, at the Key Theater, an art house on Wisconsin Avenue in Georgetown that closed in 1997. It\u2019s now a Restoration Hardware. Extra value, in the context of \u201cThe Americans\u201d: The theater was said to have been named for Francis Scott Key.\n\n\u2022 Later, on the Metro (which looks an awful lot like the New York subway), Elizabeth tells her target she works for a firm that does management consulting. Soon after, we see Philip telling the hapless Stavos that he wasn\u2019t pulling his weight as he fires him. It\u2019s Philip who could use the management training, a point brought home when his son offers to hook him up with a friend\u2019s father who\u2019s also had \u201csome failures\u201d but is now a successful businessman.\n\n\u2022 The mail robot had its biggest scene of the season, hilariously pushing its way into the elevator with Stan and Dennis. And there was a clear reference to the F.B.I.\u2019s one big advantage over the Illegals (beyond memo-delivery technology): personnel. Stan was able to put 50 men to work tracking down car sales. (Dennis needed one of them to follow another lead that\u2019s potentially deadly for Elizabeth and Philip: Harvest was seen talking to a Russian Orthodox priest.)\n\n\u2022 Favorite printable line of the episode: Elizabeth, after offering Henry a cigarette, \u201cYou\u2019re an adult now, I don\u2019t have to hide things from you anymore.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Finally, the episode\u2019s dialogue-free pop-song scene was done to Tears for Fears\u2019 \u201cIdeas as Opiates,\u201d a somewhat obvious anthem about the tyranny of belief systems (like Elizabeth\u2019s). After Thanksgiving dinner at the Beemans \u2014 where Stan delivered a toast about the people \u201cout there\u201d threatening the American way of life \u2014 Philip went to one of those garages the F.B.I. is homing in on.

{"date": "2018-05-02 00:00:00", "text": "In the present, June struggles through a nail-biting escape that crosses from tense to foolhardy. We know how inertia has rattled her nerves, but the risks she takes are staggeringly dangerous. When she is moved from the Boston Globe offices to another location, the new safe house \u2014 for reasons that aren\u2019t clear \u2014 becomes suddenly unsafe, and she begs the Economan to take her with him. But going back into Boston is so risky that it mostly feels like a chance to introduce Econopeople before June\u2019s inevitable recapture.\n\nAt first it\u2019s surprising that the Econopeople\u2019s children haven\u2019t also been handed out to the powerful \u2014 especially because we learned last season what high-value exports children and fertile women are for Gilead. But apparently, the freedom to at least have and keep one\u2019s own children is a reward for good behavior. \u201cSo this is where the Econopeople live,\u201d June muses. \u201cIt\u2019s where I would live if I weren\u2019t an adulteress, if I\u2019d gone to the right kind of church, if I\u2019d played my cards right \u2014 if I\u2019d known I was supposed to be playing cards.\u201d\n\nGilead being Gilead, however, that particular freedom exists only under constant threat \u2014 of institutional rape and of having your kids taken away if you misbehave. When the Econowife, terrified to be harboring a fugitive, asks June whether she\u2019s a handmaid, June confirms that, yes, she was. \u201cThat\u2019s how they threaten us if we\u2019re fruitful,\u201d the woman replies. \u201cWith the red dress and the wings.\u201d\n\nAnd because no good deed in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d goes unpunished, June\u2019s savior and his family never come home from church. After they go missing, it\u2019s hard not to think about how June begged him for transport and shelter, knowing the risk he would be taking \u2014 or about how she looked out the window of their apartment after being told to hide. By then she was beyond being able to wait, and we know that. But at what cost to those around her who, like her, are just trying to survive? If June ever encounters this Econowife again, the woman might very well be a handmaid by then, stripped of her beautiful son just as June was stripped of Hannah.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the work seems to be re-traumatizing her; her face as her new charge compulsively confesses to murdering gender traitors was one of the episode\u2019s most heartbreaking images. She\u2019s physically safe, but she has a long road of healing ahead of her.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, though, what that healing looks like for her. What we know of Moira\u2019s life pre-Gilead we know only from June\u2019s flashbacks. By now, June, Serena and Emily have all had focal episodes and flashbacks, but Moira is still a mystery. Her detached hookup with a woman in a nightclub bathroom suggests that she is trying to reclaim her sexual agency in defiance of her underlying trauma. But without her back story, we\u2019re still missing the fuller implications of her behavior. Samira Wiley is excellent and has made the most of every moment, but it\u2019s time for Moira\u2019s history now, too.\n\nIt will have to wait, because this week\u2019s episode could end only one way. Gilead is a monster with long tentacles, and we don\u2019t yet know if June was betrayed or simply tracked. In the moment of her capture, however, it doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s only June, dragged in agonizing slow-motion from a very little window, as the edges go dark.\n\nOther Gossip:\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou were there, all the time, but no one noticed you.\u201d This show keeps providing thesis statements on its own obliviousness.

There\u2019s a lot of both.\u201d I am already afraid for Handmaid Econowife, and I truly dread what might have happened to her kind husband.\n\n\u2022 One of the best aspects June\u2019s time in the Gilead Underground was her reaction to places that were hollowed out freshly enough to sting. Gilead is still new, and her disbelief reminds us how fast things changed.\n\n\u2022 This show makes incredible use of overhead shots.

These movies extend his doleful comedies across decades, cultures and nations, putting his words in the mouths of Australian ranchers, Japanese schoolgirls, French auteurs and jobbing New York actors. Here\u2019s a quick sampling of some notable Chekhov\u2019s translations from stage to screen.\n\nThe Sea Gull (1968)\n\nAs the 1960s swung on, the director Sidney Lumet retreated to a Swedish idyll to film this heavy-handed, defiantly unfunny adaptation. Lumet\u2019s stolid approach had yielded a decent \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey Into Night,\u201d but here the performances feel outsized, the blocking and camera work constrained. If the international cast is impressive \u2014 James Mason, Simone Signoret, Vanessa Redgrave, David Warner, Kathleen Widdoes \u2014 none of them seem to be in the same movie. In The Times, Vincent Canby wrote that it was \u201cso uneven in style, mood and performance that there are times when you could swear that the movie had shot itself \u2014 though not quite fatally.\u201d You could fault the translator Moura Budberg for her unhelpful fidelity to the play except that the few scenes departing from Chekhov are worse.\n\nAn Unfinished Piece for Player Piano (1977)\n\nAn unlikely adaptation of an impossible play \u2014 a sprawling, untitled, nearly unstageable early Chekhov work often called \u201cPlatonov\u201d \u2014 Nikita Mikhalkov\u2019s film is a classic of Soviet cinema. Set during a sun-drenched prerevolution house party, it\u2019s both an indictment of and an homage to a lost way of life. The story can be hard to follow, but the roguish sense of play and the wild tonal shifts are thrilling. The giddy comedy of the opening \u2014 songs, fortune telling, fake mustaches \u2014 skews darker and sadder until an unexpectedly redemptive ending buoys the piece back up. The lively ensemble cast, which includes Mr. Mikhalkov, is led by Aleksandr Kalaigin as a schoolteacher whose youthful illusions are dying hard.\n\nSakura No Sono (1990)\n\nPhoto\n\nIn this free-form adaptation, the students at an elite Japanese girls\u2019 school gather each year to perform Chekhov\u2019s \u201cThe Cherry Orchard.\u201d When a student is caught smoking, administrators threaten to cancel the play. Adapted from a popular manga and unspooling over a single day, the modest movie is gauzy and elliptical. It shares a few of the themes of Chekhov\u2019s original, a concern with tradition and modern life, permanence and evanescence. \u201cThe students come and go,\u201d one character says. \u201cBut the blossoms stay here.\u201d The director, Shun Nakahara, films the schoolgirls with a barely there eroticism, and that subtlety is maybe a surprise as Mr. Shun, who remade the film in 2008, later shifted into soft-core pornography.\n\nCountry Life (1994)\n\nLike \u201cAn Unfinished Piece,\u201d \u201cCountry Life\u201d traipses between tragedy and farce. Directed by Michael Blakemore, this movie relocates \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d to the Australian outback just after World War I, creating what The Times called \u201ca film of charm and visual splendor.\u201d Mr. Blakemore appears as Alexander, a failed theater critic, who brings his fragile, chilly young wife (Greta Scacchi) back to the estate run by his lonely daughter (Kerry Fox) and frustrated brother-in-law (John Hargreaves). A sexy Sam Neill plays a sunburned country doctor who catches the eyes of both women. The acting is terrific, the interiors and exteriors are strongly evocative, and this is almost certainly the only Chekhov adaptation to include a close-up of lusty kangaroos.\n\nVanya on 42nd Street (1994)\n\nVideo\n\nFor many, this is the most perfect film of any Chekhov play, maybe because it doesn\u2019t feel much like a film at all. In 1989 the director Andr\u00e9 Gregory gathered a group of actors (including Wallace Shawn and before-she-was-a-star Julianne Moore) for a multiyear exploration of \u201cUncle Vanya.\u201d When they opened the workshop to a few friends, word spread, and eventually Louis Malle agreed to film it. His framing device follow the actors to their rehearsal. (Catch that opening shot of Mr. Shawn chomping a knish.) But as they slip into character, still wearing their street clothes, that outside world disappears. A quiet heartbreaker, \u201cVanya on 42nd Street\u201d is a valentine to the powers of theater and film.\n\nVideo\n\nLa Petite Lili (2003)\n\nAnother \u201cSeagull,\u201d Claude Miller\u2019s movie relocates the action to a French chateau, a retreat for the film star Mado Marceaux (Nicole Garcia) and her director boyfriend, Brice (Bernard Giraudeau), who disrupt the lives of Mado\u2019s son (Robinson St\u00e9venin) and his sweetheart (Ludivine Sagnier). This being France, there\u2019s wine, sex, cigarettes and talk of Proust. (And oh the cheekbones!) The movie\u2019s first two-thirds are fairly faithful, but a daring final act, a more deliberate and affirming meditation on art and life, transmutes the tragic ending into something more wistful. It\u2019s also notable as the only adaptation to give the mournful character of Masha (the estate manager\u2019s daughter), played here by a lovely Julie Depardieu, a happy ending.", "title": "\u2018The Seagull\u2019 Brings Chekhov\u2019s Doleful Comedy to Cinemas", "authors": ["Alexis Soloski"]}

Then, he continues, they left him hanging there until he was dead. Paul Jr. and Gail stand behind listening, squeamish. But it proves to be an allegory for what Paul Jr. is about to endure: being crucified by his father while working for Getty Oil.\n\nThe men have dinner to discuss Paul\u2019s promotion. Getty tells his son the secret to his own success. \u201cDrink, food, sex \u2014 appetite,\u201d he explains, with a crazed glint in his eye. \u201cYou need that to succeed.\u201d It\u2019s an uncomfortable speech to hear a man give to a son.

His expression is almost maniacal, just thinking of the concept. \u201cHeh, you want some?\u201d he chortles to his son. It\u2019s a disturbing, detailed window into Getty\u2019s soul; this man does not work like most people.\n\nAt first Getty seems to toy with Paul intentionally when he offers him a job running Getty Oil in Saudi Arabia. (\u201cSaudi\u2019s not much of a place you know,\u201d he tells Paul. Too much sand, not enough sex.) But then out of nowhere he course-reverses, telling Paul Jr. that he can take over operations in Rome instead; Paul\u2019s brother Gordon, whom Getty appears to think less of, can take Saudi Arabia. Getty shares this decision as he drinks a white wine he seems displeased with, sitting outside with Paul, Gail and little Paul, whom Getty has just thrown off a dock in order to teach him how to swim \u2014 without warning and without his parents\u2019 consent.\n\nGetty wheezes with schadenfreude-like pleasure picturing Gordon in the Middle East. In Rome, Paul will be tasked with making a bloated Italian operation lean and profitable, which for now sounds better than contraband moonshine and veils in Saudi Arabia. Paul and Gail look at each other, hardly able to contain their excitement over their blessed future.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He provides no useful tutelage or insight for Paul, who toils away in the dark, making business decisions that Getty overturns every time. Fueled by rage at his father\u2019s treatment, Paul spirals into coke-driven despair and neglects his work. Getty watches his son\u2019s nose-dive placidly, as if he\u2019d been waiting for it to happen all along.\n\nThe way Gail explains it to Chace, \u201cthere\u2019s a slice of pure animal in the old man.\u201d It doesn\u2019t include what most people rely on for sanity, she continues: love, care and compassion. \u201cThere\u2019s a switch in him that clicks\u201d \u2014 she snaps her fingers \u2014 \u201cand it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nThe switch had indeed flipped. Getty fires Paul. The family\u2019s unraveling accelerates. Paul and Gail stay married for a while, but Gail had been lonely while Paul worked those late, tortured hours, and they each start relationships with other people. Little Paul watches his parents fall in love with new partners, and he seems to run free with scant oversight. He starts down his own freewheeling, drug-dabbling trail. So much for being an heir to the richest man in the world \u2014 or to this one in particular, anyway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBack in 1973, Paul and Getty meet inside a museum after hours to finalize the terms of the ransom payment that Getty has negotiated with Don Salvatore. Getty brags to his son that they\u2019ve agreed to $5 million \u2014 far under asking price \u2014 and that he\u2019ll pay it with money from the Getty Trust. Paul is beside himself. This is the first apparent act of kindness his father has ever given him, the first time he\u2019s given him anything. For a moment, decades of hurt begin to dissolve.\n\nBut then Paul looks at the contract; it\u2019s not a gift, it\u2019s a loan that Paul has to pay back, and it\u2019s saddled with a 4 percent interest rate. Paul flies into a rage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a profit off the kidnapping of your own grandson,\u201d he shouts, tearing up the contract. He cannot believe he thought his dad might have some kindness in him yet.\n\nAs the episode nears a close, Chace informs Gail in her kitchen that little Paul won\u2019t be coming home yet after all. Primo, meanwhile, who has been waiting with little Paul in his car for the ransom money, finally realizes the money isn\u2019t coming.\n\nPaul spots a newspaper and tells Primo it\u2019s his birthday. Primo, about to go into a standard Primo rage, can\u2019t believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday,\u201d he repeats to Paul, and then screams back at him, \u201cIt\u2019s your death day as well.\u201d\n\nSpare Change:\n\n\u2022 Getty fan fiction!

Sizemore was treating Westworld like any other theme park: In order to keep visitors coming back, his answer was to keep building bigger roller coasters. But after soaking in Sizemore\u2019s splashy presentation, Dr. Ford turned it down flat \u2014 to his mind, the appeals of Westworld were more abstract than visceral, and the guests\u2019 time in the park spoke more to a deeper existential longing than to the bang-bang action on the surface.\n\nIn retrospect, that scene was another example of the show\u2019s commenting on itself and what it sees as its true strengths and purpose. The traditional Western action of \u201cOdyssey on Red River\u201d or of Hector and Armistice\u2019s daily vault heist in Sweetwater are, in this context, canned narratives, an opportunity for a guest to cosplay a gunslinger without any permanent stakes whatsoever. Despite the setting, \u201cWestworld\u201d would never be described as a Western, in part because this synthetic environment constantly resets itself instead of evolving as dictated by the actions within it. But one of the promises of the second season is that \u201cWestworld\u201d could, in fact, become a real Western, just as the Pinocchios that populate it have become real boys. With the hosts out of their loops and real bullets flying everywhere, the park is now territory to be claimed, not territory to be carefully stage-managed.\n\nAnd yet, perhaps Dr. Ford was right all along. As exciting as it seemed that \u201cWestworld\u201d was evolving into a Western with life-or-death consequences, the reality has been less scintillating. This week\u2019s episode, \u201cVirt\u00f9 e Fortuna,\u201d is an action-packed hour that is least exciting when the guns are a-blazing, despite a few cleanly staged and expensive-looking sequences.\n\nThe battle sequence at Fort Forlorn Hope, where Dolores and her newly acquired Confederado fighting force finally square off against Delos\u2019s heavily armed human mercenaries, should be the kind of thrilling human-versus-robot showdown the show has led us to anticipate from the beginning. But we\u2019ve been so programmed to understand the action in \u201cWestworld\u201d as predigested that the fight has no emotional impact: We can appreciate the horror embedded in Dolores\u2019s calculation that Major Craddock and his men are disposable in the grand scheme of things, but the moral stakes involved in actually witnessing these stranded Confederados get shot into Swiss cheese are very low: There\u2019s little indication that they have evolved anything like the kind of off-script consciousness possessed by hosts like Dolores and Bernard, and they\u2019re still androids after all. We\u2019ve seen minor characters like them get \u201ckilled\u201d and rebooted so many times that watching them get slaughtered will always feel a bit like watching your computer crash. You cross your fingers, but it\u2019s likely to restart.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, \u201cWestworld\u201d still works best as an idea-driven show, and \u201cVirt\u00f9 e Fortuna\u201d latches onto a good one by considering how freethinking the hosts actually are. In a particularly good scene, Sizemore wanders the underground halls with Maeve and Hector, who surprise and repulse him when they start holding each other\u2019s hands. As a creative person, he\u2019s appalled to see his characters stray from their roles: Hector was romantically linked to a woman named Isabella, so this hand-holding violates his authorial intent. \u201cI realized Isabella was a lie, just words in my head,\u201d says Hector. But in his next breath, Hector tells him that Maeve is \u201call I ever dreamed life could be,\u201d and Sizemore pounces. That\u2019s one of his corny scripted lines.

Mr. Trump\u2019s one-person guessing game came into play as he addressed topics including Mexico, Nafta, Russia, Amazon, North Korea, Mike Pompeo, Dr. Ronny L.

But many who watch closely say Mr. Trump is using the phrase to avoid accountability.\n\n\u201cThe occasions in which he\u2019s made specific promises, like \u2018we\u2019ll build a wall and Mexico would pay for it,\u2019 he has had trouble delivering,\u201d Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cInstead of forecasting and being accountable for the forecast, he\u2019s opening the possibility that there are a range of possibilities not anticipated for which he does not want to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is not the first president to rely on a verbal crutch to make a point, avoid criticism or skirt a question.

President Ronald Reagan tended to tug on his ear and mutter \u201cI can\u2019t hear it\u201d to avoid questions shouted at him on the way to Marine One. And President Barack Obama often relied on the phrase \u201clet me be clear\u201d to get his audiences to pay attention during several of his first-term speeches, until people started to catch on to the rhetorical device.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That approach has lent itself to a collection of presidential favorites: In Trumpese, she said, \u201cmany people are saying\u201d means \u201cI wish many people were saying this because I want you to believe they are.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, likely means \u201cI just found out,\u201d and \u201cbelieve me,\u201d on some level, may signal \u201cI have real doubts.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s modern predecessors, she said, tended to adhere to a tightly scripted approach. For example, she had a hard time imagining President John F. Kennedy saying \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens\u201d while negotiating his way through the Cuban missile crisis.\n\n\u201cThe presidents wanted to ensure that they knew what outcomes could be achieved and that their rhetoric could help them achieve the outcome,\u201d she said.

(Easier said than done, of course, when a president delights in veering off script.)\n\n\u201cIf you keep forcing the same phrases into people\u2019s ears all the time, people start to wonder what you\u2019re actually meaning,\u201d Matt Latimer, a literary agent and former speechwriter for Mr. Bush, said in an interview.

For instance, of the impending deadline on negotiations with Iran, Mr. Trump twisted the phrase to suit his penchant for showmanship: \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do on the 12th, although, Mr. President, you have a pretty good idea \u2014 but we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said during a meeting last week with President Emmanuel Macron of France.\n\nBut Mr. Latimer, who scripted a president through the Iraq war and a looming recession, said Mr. Trump\u2019s laissez-faire attitude probably would not last as consequential negotiations advance: \u201cFree styling only works when things are going pretty well.\u201d", "title": "\u2018We\u2019ll See,\u2019 Trump Says on North Korea.
